"2000","Chrétien de Troyes sur le Web: présentation, analyse et interprétation des manuscrits d’&lt;i&gt;Yvain ou le Chevalier au Lion&lt;/i&gt; [2000, rptd. 2008]","On the web site of the Laboratoire de Francais Ancien at the University of Ottawa we intend to offer free access to a query and research tool, both powerful and new, for use on Chretien de Troyes' masterpiece the Chevalier au Lion , Chretien being the most famous writer of medieval French romances. We are preparing a presentation of all the Chevalier au Lion manuscripts, with analysis and interpretation, that will constitute an indispensable collection of documents for future critical work — both for critical editions in general and critical editions of this particular work. Our aim is to show the educated public the text itself, accompanied by a series of indices, a study of the language and a complete lexicon of each manuscript copy. When the work is complete, the reader will be able to see images of the manuscript folios, to decipher the text by means of a first, """"archeological"""" transcription (the text as is), and to understand it, through a second, critical transcription of the emended manuscripts. The series of indices will allow easy, automatic look-up of the text, and various types of query (phonetic, morphological, syntactic, lexical, semantic, literary, cultural, etc.). Morphosyntactic study will give a systematic framework for determining the meaning and import of textual forms and expressions encountered in reading. The lexicon will provide precise definitions for all the lexical words of each manuscript.","",""
"2002","Who Sets E-Mail Style? Prescriptivism, Coping Strategies, and Democratizing Communication Access","Stylistic practices in e-mail reflect an amalgam of social presuppositions about usage conventions and individual strategies for handling a new language medium. To understand how contemporary e-mail patterns have been forged and where they might be heading, this study examines the ways in which newly enfranchised language users in the past have balanced externally generated prescriptions for linguistic style with user-generated coping strategies in constructing spoken and written messages. Popular letter writing, the early telegraph, and early telephone behavior offer useful precedents for thinking about both e-mail messages themselves and the potential effects of language technology on broader language change.","",""

This paper evaluates the choices of texts made by the TLF committee in the light of a contemporary encyclopaedia of French literature and of subsequent published research in the field of French literature, provided by the MLA (Modern Language Association) online bibliography. Spearman?s rank correlation coefficient, and outlier analysis based on Mahalanobis distance evaluate similarities in the sets of data. The conclusion is that the choices made in the mid-twentieth century were a reasonable reflection of scholarly interests both at the time the database was constituted, and subsequently up to the present. The method described in this paper is applicable to the evaluation of other full-text databases.","",""
"2003","&lt;i&gt;SAToRBase&lt;/i&gt;: A Database of Topoi for French Literature","This article is a general description of the conception and development of SAToRBase, an online database tool that contains some 3000 occurrences of topoi (recurring motifs) in French literature from about 1200 to 1800. SAToRBase has been developed expressly for the Societe d'Analyse de la Topique Romanesque (SAToR), an international literary association. The purpose of this article is not to examine in detail each aspect of SAToRBase; that would be futile for an online tool of this kind which is in constant evolution. Rather, the purpose is to present more broadly the major characteristics of SAToRBase, including a brief description of typical procedures such as searching for occurrences of topoi and proposing new occurrences. The interface of SAToRBase is likely to change considerably over time, but the core concepts will no doubt remain stable.","",""
"2003","The processed book","The """"processed book"""" is about content, not technology, and contrasts with the """"primal book""""; the latter is the book we all know and revere: written by a single author and viewed as the embodiment of the thought of a single individual. The processed book, on the other hand, is what happens to the book when it is put into a computerized, networked environment. To process a book is more than simply building links to it; it also includes a modification of the act of creation, which tends to encourage the absorption of the book into a network of applications, including but not restricted to commentary. Such a book typically has at least five aspects: as self-referencing text; as portal; as platform; as machine component; and, as network node. An interesting aspect of such processing is that the author's relationship to his or her work may be undermined or compromised; indeed, it is possible that author attribution in the networked world may go the way of copyright. The processed book, in other words, is the response to romantic notions of authorship and books. It is not a matter of choice (as one can still write an imitation, for example, of a Victorian novel today) but an inevitable outcome of inherent characteristics of digital media.","",""
"2004","Abstract identifiers, intertextual reference and a computational basis for recordkeeping","This paper presents three proposals concerning the structure and maintenance of formal, inter–referential, digitally stored texts: (1) include abstract atomic identifiers in texts, (2) identify these identifiers with references to text objects, and (3) keep among the texts records of computationally substantiated claims about those texts. We use """"formal"""" in a narrow sense approximating computer–checkable; we are informed by informal symbolic practices used in mathematical text and program source text, which we hope to enhance and exploit explicitly. The basic management problem is how to alter texts rather freely without ruining the bases for claims depending upon them; this becomes an issue of accounting for various dependencies between texts.","",""
"2004","The software word: digital poetry as new media-based language art","Drawing particularly on kinetic digital poetry as a kind of software language art, this essay suggests that such a scripting-and-programming-language based textuality is not a continuation of the poetry-as-we-know-it by other means, but a new medium with its own specificity set at the intersection of the literary avant garde, net art, software art, browser art and text-based electronic installations. It is of importance that this programmable medium applies an expanded concept of textuality based on the application of netspeak and the symbols of programming languages, meaning also that the language of the code is involved in new poetic dynamic structures with striking visual, animated and tactile features. Kinetic digital poetry runs in loops, the loop being the medium adjusted to the demand of organising text components in time-based sequences, which seems to be the mode best suited to the perception of contemporary individuals and to the demands of mainstream visual culture. One of the crucial tasks of this essay is to demonstrate a shift from traditional hyperfiction and hyperpoetry to more sophisticated forms and to the specificity of software language art devoted to a new audience. The institutions in which such a textual practice exists are the rooms of club-, DJ-, and VJ- culture, mailing lists, newsletters, digital arts conferences and digital art exhibitions, rather than university classrooms and libraries.","",""

Project is at a graphetic level and captures each distinguishable glyph used by the scribe. When the transcription is organized as a series of XML entities within a codicological DTD a search-and-count algorithm can be appied to the database of graphetic information. Initial statistical analysis of the data reveals dramatic changes in the scribe's writing system at two points in the manuscript that are roughly coincident with quire boundaries (and also textual boundaries). Hypotheses that will guide further investigation of this phenomenon include the possibility that substantial gaps of time separated the scribe's work in copying the four Middle English poems that make up the manuscript.","",""

This article presents initial work towards a Text Analysis Markup Language (TAML) that would foster the distributed development of literary text analysis tools.

Our focus to date, as texts are being edited, has been to create hypertext editions, capable of being annotated both by text and by multimedia objects. The infrastructure created by TAPoR (Text Analysis Portal for Research), however, provides an opportunity to go further than the hypertext edition, by integrating into it the capabilities offered by textual analysis software.

"2005","Numbering the streaks of the tulip? Reflections on a Challenge to the Use of Statistical Methods in Computational Stylistics","Are statistical methods, which take randomness of data as their starting-point, appropriate to the study of something so highly systematic as the English language? The challenge seems justified by the non-random effects of context or semantics, transition, and recursion, despite the significant degree of unpredictability that remains. Yet valid statistical analysis often proceeds by assuming no such effects exist (the """"null hypothesis""""), then establishing whether they do. Furthermore, the postulate of randomness is not essential to descriptive statistics, which meets most of the requirements of computational stylistics.    The challenge may, however, have force in the area of predictive statistics, where the relationship between a specimen and a named population is in question and the notion of a random, representative sample is crucial. In answer, the author proposes the idea of specimens from a repertoire instead of the statistician's usual samples from a population , and looks forward to the establishing of a """"grammar of probabilities"""" to replace the abstract postulate of randomness.","",""

"2006","Printing, cartography and conceptions of place in Renaissance Europe"," Eisenstein's account of the connection between scientific progress and printing does not apply well to map publication and knowledge of geography. Most of the celebrated figures in map design and publishing in the 16th century were fundamentally copyists and collectors of others' works. In Renaissance Europe, geographers did not strive to be original, but relied on others' measures, adding their own information to extant maps whenever this was possible. They also made maps in multiple genres, and used geographical works not simply as practical tools for trade and politics, but as evidence for Creation and demonstrations of human dominion. Printed atlases displayed the array of map forms, provided exemplars of good work, and made visible points of translation across different genres of geographical representation. In this context, copying and collection were helpful rather than detrimental to knowledge. ","",""

This issue has been a long time in the making. The first organizational efforts began in June 2005, and the journal’s technical development started soon after. Developing a new journal—on a new publication model, with an innovative technical architecture—is not an undertaking for the faint-hearted. That level of challenge, however, was central to the venture from the start: the world may not need yet another academic journal, but it does need experiments in how academic journals are published.

"2008","Present and Active: Digital Publishing in a Post-print Age","At one point in Victor Hugo’s novel, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, the archdeacon, Claude Frollo, looked up from a book on his table to the edifice of the gothic cathedral, visible from his canon’s cell in the cloister of Notre Dame: “Alas!” he said, “this will kill that” (146). Frollo’s lament, that the book would destroy the edifice, captures the medieval cleric’s anxiety about the way in which Gutenberg’s print technology would become the new universal means for recording and communicating humanity’s ideas and artistic expression, replacing the grand monuments of architecture, human engineering, and craftsmanship. For Hugo, architecture was “the great handwriting of humankind” (149). The cathedral as the material outcome of human technology was being replaced by the first great machine—the printing press. At this point in the third millennium, some people undoubtedly have similar anxieties to Frollo: is it now the book’s turn to be destroyed by yet another great machine? The inclusion of “post print” in our title is not intended to sound the death knell of the book. Rather, we contend that despite the enduring value of print, digital publishing is “present and active” and is changing the way in which research, particularly in the humanities, is being undertaken.  Our approach has three related parts. First, we consider how digital technologies are changing the way in which content is constructed, customised, modified, disseminated, and accessed within a global, distributed network. This section argues that the transition from print to electronic or digital publishing means both losses and gains, particularly with respect to shifts in our approaches to textuality, information, and innovative publishing. Second, we discuss the Children’s Literature Digital Resources (CLDR) project, with which we are involved. This case study of a digitising initiative opens out the transformative possibilities and challenges of digital publishing and e-scholarship for research communities. Third, we reflect on technology’s capacity to bring about major changes in the light of the theoretical and practical issues that have arisen from our discussion.     I. Digitising in a “post-print age”  We are living in an era that is commonly referred to as “the late age of print” (see Kho) or the “post-print age” (see Gunkel). According to Aarseth, we have reached a point whereby nearly all of our public and personal media have become more or less digital (37). As Kho notes, web newspapers are not only becoming increasingly more popular, but they are also making rather than losing money, and paper-based newspapers are finding it difficult to recruit new readers from the younger generations (37). Not only can such online-only publications update format, content, and structure more economically than print-based publications, but their wide distribution network, speed, and flexibility attract advertising revenue. Hype and hyperbole aside, publishers are not so much discarding their legacy of print, but recognising the folly of not embracing innovative technologies that can add value by presenting information in ways that satisfy users’ needs for content to-go or for edutainment. As Kho notes: “no longer able to satisfy customer demand by producing print-only products, or even by enabling online access to semi-static content, established publishers are embracing new models for publishing, web-style” (42).   Advocates of online publishing contend that the major benefits of online publishing over print technology are that it is faster, more economical, and more interactive. However, as Hovav and Gray caution, “e-publishing also involves risks, hidden costs, and trade-offs” (79). The specific focus for these authors is e-journal publishing and they contend that while cost reduction is in editing, production and distribution, if the journal is not open access, then costs relating to storage and bandwith will be transferred to the user. If we put economics aside for the moment, the transition from print to electronic text (e-text), especially with electronic literary works, brings additional considerations, particularly in their ability to make available different reading strategies to print, such as “animation, rollovers, screen design, navigation strategies, and so on” (Hayles 38).      Transition from print to e-text  In his book, Writing Space, David Bolter follows Victor Hugo’s lead, but does not ask if print technology will be destroyed. Rather, he argues that “the idea and ideal of the book will change: print will no longer define the organization and presentation of knowledge, as it has for the past five centuries” (2). As Hayles noted above, one significant indicator of this change, which is a consequence of the shift from analogue to digital, is the addition of graphical, audio, visual, sonic, and kinetic elements to the written word. A significant consequence of this transition is the reinvention of the book in a networked environment.   Unlike the printed book, the networked book is not bound by space and time. Rather, it is an evolving entity within an ecology of readers, authors, and texts. The Web 2.0 platform has enabled more experimentation with blending of digital technology and traditional writing, particularly in the use of blogs, which have spawned blogwriting and the wikinovel. Siva Vaidhyanathan’s The Googlization of Everything: How One Company is Disrupting Culture, Commerce and Community … and Why We Should Worry is a wikinovel or blog book that was produced over a series of weeks with contributions from other bloggers (see: http://www.sivacracy.net/). Penguin Books, in collaboration with a media company, “Six Stories to Start,” have developed six stories—“We Tell Stories,” which involve different forms of interactivity from users through blog entries, Twitter text messages, an interactive google map, and other features. For example, the story titled “Fairy Tales” allows users to customise the story using their own choice of names for characters and descriptions of character traits. Each story is loosely based on a classic story and links take users to synopses of these original stories and their authors and to online purchase of the texts through the Penguin Books sales website.  These examples of digital stories are a small part of the digital environment, which exploits computer and online technologies’ capacity to be interactive and immersive. As Janet Murray notes, the interactive qualities of digital environments are characterised by their procedural and participatory abilities, while their immersive qualities are characterised by their spatial and encyclopedic dimensions (71–89). These immersive and interactive qualities highlight different ways of reading texts, which entail different embodied and cognitive functions from those that reading print texts requires. As Hayles argues:  the advent of electronic textuality presents us with an unparalleled opportunity to reformulate fundamental ideas about texts and, in the process, to see print as well as electronic texts with fresh eyes (89–90).  The transition to e-text also highlights how digitality is changing all aspects of everyday life both inside and outside the academy.      Online teaching and e-research  Another aspect of the commercial arm of publishing that is impacting on academe and other organisations is the digitising and indexing of print content for niche distribution. Kho offers the example of the Mark Logic Corporation, which uses its XML content platform to repurpose content, create new content, and distribute this content through multiple portals. As the promotional website video for Mark Logic explains, academics can use this service to customise their own textbooks for students by including only articles and book chapters that are relevant to their subject. These are then organised, bound, and distributed by Mark Logic for sale to students at a cost that is generally cheaper than most textbooks.   A further example of how print and digital materials can form an integrated, customised source for teachers and students is eFictions (Trimmer, Jennings, &amp; Patterson). eFictions was one of the first print and online short story anthologies that teachers of literature could customise to their own needs. Produced as both a print text collection and a website, eFictions offers popular short stories in English by well-known traditional and contemporary writers from the US, Australia, New Zealand, UK, and Europe, with summaries, notes on literary features, author biographies, and, in one instance, a YouTube movie of the story. In using the eFictions website, teachers can build a customised anthology of traditional and innovative stories to suit their teaching preferences.   These examples provide useful indicators of how content is constructed, customised, modified, disseminated, and accessed within a distributed network. However, the question remains as to how to measure their impact and outcomes within teaching and learning communities. As Harley suggests in her study on the use and users of digital resources in the humanities and social sciences, several factors warrant attention, such as personal teaching style, philosophy, and specific disciplinary requirements. However, in terms of understanding the benefits of digital resources for teaching and learning, Harley notes that few providers in her sample had developed any plans to evaluate use and users in a systematic way.   In addition to the problems raised in Harley’s study, another relates to how researchers can be supported to take full advantage of digital technologies for e-research. The transformation brought about by information and communication technologies extends and broadens the impact of research, by making its outputs more discoverable and usable by other researchers, and its benefits more available to industry, governments, and the wider community.   Traditional repositories of knowledge and information, such as libraries, are juggling the space demands of books and computer hardware alongside increasing reader demand for anywhere, anytime, anyplace access to information. Researchers’ expectations about online access to journals, eprints, bibliographic data, and the views of others through wikis, blogs, and associated social and information networking sites such as YouTube compete with the traditional expectations of the institutions that fund libraries for paper-based archives and book repositories. While university libraries are finding it increasingly difficult to purchase all hardcover books relevant to numerous and varied disciplines, a significant proportion of their budgets goes towards digital repositories (e.g., STORS), indexes, and other resources, such as full-text electronic specialised and multidisciplinary journal databases (e.g., Project Muse and Proquest); electronic serials; e-books; and specialised information sources through fast (online) document delivery services. An area that is becoming increasingly significant for those working in the humanities is the digitising of historical and cultural texts.      II. Bringing back the dead: The CLDR project  The CLDR project is led by researchers and librarians at the Queensland University of Technology, in collaboration with Deakin University, University of Sydney, and members of the AustLit team at The University of Queensland. The CLDR project is a “Research Community” of the electronic bibliographic database AustLit: The Australian Literature Resource, which is working towards the goal of providing a complete bibliographic record of the nation’s literature. AustLit offers users with a single entry point to enhanced scholarly resources on Australian writers, their works, and other aspects of Australian literary culture and activities. AustLit and its Research Communities are supported by grants from the Australian Research Council and financial and in-kind contributions from a consortium of Australian universities, and by other external funding sources such as the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy.   Like other more extensive digitisation projects, such as Project Gutenberg and the Rosetta Project, the CLDR project aims to provide a centralised access point for digital surrogates of early published works of Australian children’s literature, with access pathways to existing resources. The first stage of the CLDR project is to provide access to digitised, full-text, out-of-copyright Australian children’s literature from European settlement to 1945, with selected digitised critical works relevant to the field. Texts comprise a range of genres, including poetry, drama, and narrative for young readers and picture books, songs, and rhymes for infants. Currently, a selection of 75 e-texts and digital scans of original texts from Project Gutenberg and Internet Archive have been linked to the Children’s Literature Research Community. By the end of 2009, the CLDR will have digitised approximately 1000 literary texts and a significant number of critical works. Stage II and subsequent development will involve digitisation of selected texts from 1945 onwards.   A precursor to the CLDR project has been undertaken by Deakin University in collaboration with the State Library of Victoria, whereby a digital bibliographic index comprising Victorian School Readers has been completed with plans for full-text digital surrogates of a selection of these texts. These texts provide valuable insights into citizenship, identity, and values formation from the 1930s onwards.   At the time of writing, the CLDR is at an early stage of development. An extensive survey of out-of-copyright texts has been completed and the digitisation of these resources is about to commence. The project plans to make rich content searchable, allowing scholars from children’s literature studies and education to benefit from the many advantages of online scholarship. What digital publishing and associated digital archives, electronic texts, hypermedia, and so forth foreground is the fact that writers, readers, publishers, programmers, designers, critics, booksellers, teachers, and copyright laws operate within a context that is highly mediated by technology.   In his article on large-scale digitisation projects carried out by Cornell and University of Michigan with the Making of America collection of 19th-century American serials and monographs, Hirtle notes that when special collections’ materials are available via the Web, with appropriate metadata and software, then they can “increase use of the material, contribute to new forms of research, and attract new users to the material” (44). Furthermore, Hirtle contends that despite the poor ergonomics associated with most electronic displays and e-book readers, “people will, when given the opportunity, consult an electronic text over the print original” (46). If this preference is universally accurate, especially for researchers and students, then it follows that not only will the preference for electronic surrogates of original material increase, but preference for other kinds of electronic texts will also increase.  It is with this preference for electronic resources in mind that we approached the field of children’s literature in Australia and asked questions about how future generations of researchers would prefer to work. If electronic texts become the reference of choice for primary as well as secondary sources, then it seems sensible to assume that researchers would prefer to sit at the end of the keyboard than to travel considerable distances at considerable cost to access paper-based print texts in distant libraries and archives. We considered the best means for providing access to digitised primary and secondary, full text material, and digital pathways to existing online resources, particularly an extensive indexing and bibliographic database. Prior to the commencement of the CLDR project, AustLit had already indexed an extensive number of children’s literature.     Challenges and dilemmas  The CLDR project, even in its early stages of development, has encountered a number of challenges and dilemmas that centre on access, copyright, economic capital, and practical aspects of digitisation, and sustainability. These issues have relevance for digital publishing and e-research.   A decision is yet to be made as to whether the digital texts in CLDR will be available on open or closed/tolled access. The preference is for open access. As Hayles argues, copyright is more than a legal basis for intellectual property, as it also entails ideas about authorship, creativity, and the work as an “immaterial mental construct” that goes “beyond the paper, binding, or ink” (144). Seeking copyright permission is therefore only part of the issue. Determining how the item will be accessed is a further matter, particularly as future technologies may impact upon how a digital item is used. In the case of e-journals, the issue of copyright payment structures are evolving towards a collective licensing system, pay-per-view, and other combinations of print and electronic subscription (see Hovav and Gray).  For research purposes, digitisation of items for CLDR is not simply a scan and deliver process. Rather it is one that needs to ensure that the best quality is provided and that the item is both accessible and usable by researchers, and sustainable for future researchers. Sustainability is an important consideration and provides a challenge for institutions that host projects such as CLDR. Therefore, items need to be scanned to a high quality and this requires an expensive scanner and personnel costs. Files need to be in a variety of formats for preservation purposes and so that they may be manipulated to be useable in different technologies (for example, Archival Tiff, Tiff, Jpeg, PDF, HTML). Hovav and Gray warn that when technology becomes obsolete, then content becomes unreadable unless backward integration is maintained.  The CLDR items will be annotatable given AustLit’s NeAt funded project: Aus-e-Lit. The Aus-e-Lit project will extend and enhance the existing AustLit web portal with data integration and search services, empirical reporting services, collaborative annotation services, and compound object authoring, editing, and publishing services. For users to be able to get the most out of a digital item, it needs to be searchable, either through double keying or OCR (optimal character recognition).      The value of CLDR’s contribution  The value of the CLDR project lies in its goal to provide a comprehensive, searchable body of texts (fictional and critical) to researchers across the humanities and social sciences. Other projects seem to be intent on putting up as many items as possible to be considered as a first resort for online texts. CLDR is more specific and is not interested in simply generating a presence on the Web. Rather, it is research driven both in its design and implementation, and in its focussed outcomes of assisting academics and students primarily in their e-research endeavours. To this end, we have concentrated on the following: an extensive survey of appropriate texts; best models for file location, distribution, and use; and high standards of digitising protocols. These issues that relate to data storage, digitisation, collections, management, and end-users of data are aligned with the “Development of an Australian Research Data Strategy” outlined in An Australian e-Research Strategy and Implementation Framework (2006). CLDR is not designed to simply replicate resources, as it has a distinct focus, audience, and research potential. In addition, it looks at resources that may be forgotten or are no longer available in reproduction by current publishing companies. Thus, the aim of CLDR is to preserve both the time and a period of Australian history and literary culture. It will also provide users with an accessible repository of rare and early texts written for children.     III. Future directions  It is now commonplace to recognize that the Web’s role as information provider has changed over the past decade. New forms of “collective intelligence” or “distributed cognition” (Oblinger and Lombardi) are emerging within and outside formal research communities. Technology’s capacity to initiate major cultural, social, educational, economic, political and commercial shifts has conditioned us to expect the “next big thing.”   We have learnt to adapt swiftly to the many challenges that online technologies have presented, and we have reaped the benefits. As the examples in this discussion have highlighted, the changes in online publishing and digitisation have provided many material, network, pedagogical, and research possibilities: we teach online units providing students with access to e-journals, e-books, and customized archives of digitised materials; we communicate via various online technologies; we attend virtual conferences; and we participate in e-research through a global, digital network. In other words, technology is deeply engrained in our everyday lives.   In returning to Frollo’s concern that the book would destroy architecture, Umberto Eco offers a placatory note: “in the history of culture it has never happened that something has simply killed something else. Something has profoundly changed something else” (n. pag.). Eco’s point has relevance to our discussion of digital publishing. The transition from print to digital necessitates a profound change that impacts on the ways we read, write, and research. As we have illustrated with our case study of the CLDR project, the move to creating digitised texts of print literature needs to be considered within a dynamic network of multiple causalities, emergent technological processes, and complex negotiations through which digital texts are created, stored, disseminated, and used. Technological changes in just the past five years have, in many ways, created an expectation in the minds of people that the future is no longer some distant time from the present. Rather, as our title suggests, the future is both present and active.     References  Aarseth, Espen. “How we became Postdigital: From Cyberstudies to Game Studies.” Critical Cyber-culture Studies.

"2008","Toward an Electronic Edition of an Early Modern Assembled Book","This paper describes an intermediate point in the development of an electronic edition of a unique and complex early modern book. At this stage, we the authors have done extensive research on the book itself and have also begun thinking about appropriate ways of rendering information about the book electronically. This essay describes the book, a gospel harmony or 'concordance' made for King Charles I in the mid-1630s by the Ferrars of Little Gidding, England, particularly in light of its construction and intended functions. It goes on to explore the appropriateness of electronic forms for describing the book, ending by postulating possible tools for delivery. In particular, it describes the complexity of the Little Gidding concordance, which rearranges and combines the text of the four canonical gospels into a single narrative of 150 chapters. We have found, somewhat paradoxically, that XML provides a natural-feeling platform for gathering data about this document (contrasted with a word processor), but that the document's complexity makes it a difficult fit with TEI markup. We note that since the biblical text is already marked up, and that the Ferrars have added another layer of markup, the real difficulty as well as the promise of this project is in using digital markup to further enable the complex and powerful reading machine that is the Little Gidding concordance.","",""

"2008","Something Called Digital Humanities","For these purposes, the online edition of The Nation is just the thing.  And so one day I found myself reading a lament about the present and  future of academic English departments. William Deresiewicz’s ‘Professing  Literature in 2008’1 is ostensibly a review of a new reissue of Gerald  Graff’s Professing Literature. As such, I found it to be trenchant enough,if not about its subject (which it merely glances at, and I have never  read) then about its world (which preoccupies it, and with which, at one  time, I was very familiar). It stood out in my mind for two things. There  was a tidy analogy: by the author’s account, the curricula now offered  in English departments are fragmented by fashion and identity politics  to such an extent as to reflect nothing so much as efforts, ingenuous or  not, to win students by flattery. “If grade schools behaved like this, every  subject would be recess, and lunch would consist of chocolate cake.” And  by way of depicting the symptoms of the problem, there is an interesting  summary of how this fragmentation manifests itself in the want ads posted  by departments in the annual mLA Job Information List. “Contemporary  lit, global lit, ethnic American lit; creative writing, film, eco-criticism –  whatever. There are postings here for positions in science fiction, in  fantasy literature, in children’s literature, even in something called ‘digital  humanities’.”","",""

"2009","What the developer saw: an outsider’s view of Annotation, Interpretation and Scholarship.","This paper, as are many in this connection, explores roles for computing in the humanities. The very act of blending a highly technical and often non-academic subject (computing) with an academic one has resulted in the emergence of the field of activity nowadays called the Digital Humanities (DH) or Humanities Computing (HC), and has resulted in bringing together of people with technical skills with those of an academic orientation. Those who have followed the DH over the 60 years of its existence have seen many developments grow out of the generally fruitful collaboration between the academics who have mastered various aspects of computing and the technologists. The nature of this relationship, however, has sometimes been fraught, and vulnerable to “prejudices and misconceptions” that, if set aside, can “challenge the ego but open the mind” (Piez 2005), and a part of what this paper is about is some aspects of the nature of this relationship, from the perspective of the technologist rather than the academic.","",""

"2009","Enter Tagger: Encoding (Reading) The Digital Temple","Some years ago I met with a colleague briefly to discuss my plan to build an electronic edition of George Herbert’s English verse. I broached the topic with some trepidation, for Randy McCloud’s Herbert essays are exercises in un-editing, what he calls a “critique of editorial response” to the manuscripts and early print volumes of The Temple. I described my plans: that The Digital Temple would include high-resolution images of two manuscripts and a copy the first edition (1633) alongside diplomatic transcriptions of all three. There would also be a user interface for viewing these materials in a number of ways: as individual documents; in a variety of frames formats; in modern spelling versions; with links to the digital images; in some user-determined combination of these options. In so far as the project would bring together all of the relevant primary documents, Randy’s (or Randall’s or Random’s) response was encouraging.

"2009","The Canadian Century Research Infrastructure: Enabling Humanities and Social Science Research in the Digital Age","The Canadian Century Research Infrastructure (CCRI) is a census-based digital project which involves scholars from seven Canadian universities and partners at IBM and Statistics Canada. The first project based in the Humanities and Social Sciences to receive a major grant from the Canadian Foundation for Innovation, the CCRI’s mandate is to create public use microdatabases of the 1911, 1921, 1931, 1941 and 1951 national censuses of Canada.  This new research infrastructure represents a fresh contribution to the study of the making of modern Canada, and has combined ‘traditional’ research methodologies in the humanities and social sciences with an array of digital products and data processing software. As a result, a wealth of new research on individuals, families, households, and communities (ethnic, religious, geographic, etc.) will be supported and enriched. This article provides an overview of the creation of what has become an innovative cyber-infrastructure, one which has successfully merged quantitative and qualitative data into one interactive digital platform.  In 2002, the CCRI received its initial funding from the Canadian Foundation for Innovation. Over the course of the following five years, project participants created 1.8 million case records from five separate Canadian censuses, all in computer-readable format. Each census year was then overlaid with a GIS mapping sequence, representing the shifting boundaries of census districts over the course of the first half of the twentieth century. In addition, the database information received added value from both a national survey of newspapers (in both English and French) covering the social and political context of census-taking and the dissemination of result, as well as a host of internal working documents, memoranda and correspondence from the officials who conducted the original censuses and tabulated the original data at Statistics Canada. The result is a massive, searchable and interactive research infrastructure capable of supporting research in history, geography, sociology, Canadian Studies, medicine, and a host of other disciplines either separately or as multidisciplinary efforts.   Beginning with an overview of the project’s history and inspiration, the paper explores the broad range of goals and challenges which coloured the construction of the database, as well as the innovative means and solutions which were crafted along the way. It will examine the tools and strategies which have been created as a result of the project; these include the project’s sample points identification, date entry, and reporting program (S.P.I.D.E.R.), the spatial analysis of the updated geodatabase, and the cleaning, coding, and conceptual organization of the wealth of contextual data which the project has amassed. A number of specific elements – such as the integration of the contextual data and the building of an effective User Guide – are also explored. In addition, the long-term contributions and possibilities of the CCRI database, and the type of new research which it can support and has already fostered both in Canada and abroad, are discussed.","",""

This article explores the lessons learned in the development of a multi-layered, geo-referenced historical database for 19th-century Montreal. The maps we used proved to be important historical sources in their own right, while the historical sources we used to ‘people’ the maps proved to have significant spatial dimensions. Thus, the idea that an inter-disciplinary project of this nature could work if the geographers took care of the maps, while the historians dealt with the sources, proved wrong. The ways of knowing that we developed subvert existing academic boundaries and therefore should be of interest to any progressive scholar in the humanities or social sciences.

A researcher addressing every published account of early modern witchcraft trials in England must hold more than one text in her or his mind–a feat which grows more difficult with any increase in the complexity or number of the texts involved. In spite of the inescapable frustrations involved in keeping more than one mental plate spinning, this kind of multi-text research has become simpler and easier for humanists with the widespread development of digital text archives. In this paper, we use published accounts of early modern English witchcraft trials as a basis for investigating ways in which interface design for digital text collections can expedite and even expand the research activities of the humanist.","",""

At one point during the paper, a brief aside about the difficulty of rendering information of this sort — information about the way in which physical and authorial space interacted in the manuscript — introduced a few slides containing a newer, visual way of considering a fair bit of complex information of this sort. For several of us in the room at the time, Gibson’s aside about the difficulty associated with conveying such representation (and his solution), resonated significantly, and well beyond.  The work we present in this paper has its roots in this resonance and, indeed, will eventually discuss one result of our experimentation in the conveyance of such information in the course of our exploration of the Devonshire MS (BL Add Ms 17492). This paper appears in three parts: one along the lines of traditional work in the field of textually-oriented Renaissance literary studies; one that will merge this traditional approach with that of the computing humanist, with discussion of the visualization of the scribal interaction data we present; and one, as an addendum, that provides the technical details of our experimentation, for those who might wish to reproduce or duplicate elements of it.","",""
"2009","The Digital Future is Now: A Call to Action for the Humanities","Author(s): Borgman, Christine L. | Abstract: The digital humanities are at a critical moment in the transition from a specialty area to a full-fledged community with a common set of methods, sources of evidence, and infrastructure – all of which are necessary for achieving academic recognition. As budgets are slashed and marginal programs are eliminated in the current economic crisis, only the most articulate and productive will survive. Digital collections are proliferating, but most remain difficult to use, and digital scholarship remains a backwater in most humanities departments with respect to hiring, promotion, and teaching practices. Only the scholars themselves are in a position to move the field forward. Experiences of the sciences in their initiatives for cyberinfrastructure and eScience offer valuable lessons. Information- and data-intensive, distributed, collaborative, and multi-disciplinary research is now the norm in the sciences, while remaining experimental in the humanities. Discussed here are six factors for comparison, selected for their implications for the future of digital scholarship in the humanities: publication practices, data, research methods, collaboration, incentives, and learning. Drawing upon lessons gleaned from these comparisons, humanities scholars are “called to action” with five questions to address as a community: What are data? What are the infrastructure requirements? Where are the social studies of digital humanities? What is the humanities laboratory of the 21st century? What is the value proposition for digital humanities in an era of declining budgets?","",""

And how do the conceptions inherent in these choices of language frame and perhaps limit what we attempt? How do terms such as edition, project, database, archive, and thematic research collection relate to the past, present, and future of textual studies? Kenneth M. Price considers how current terms describing digital scholarship both clarify and obscure our collective enterprise. Price argues that the terms we use have more than expressive importance. The shorthand we invoke when explaining our work to others shapes how we conceive of and also how we position digital scholarship. What are the implications of the terms we use to describe large-scale text-based electronic scholarship, especially undertakings that share some of the ambitions and methods of the traditional multi-volume scholarly edition? What genre or genres are we now working in? And how do the conceptions inherent in these choices of language frame and perhaps limit what we attempt? How do terms such as edition, project, database, archive, and thematic research collection relate to the past, present, and future of textual studies? Drawing on a range of resources, including the Walt Whitman Archive, I consider how current terms describing digital scholarship both clarify and obscure our collective enterprise. In addition, I will use the final term, thematic research collection, to discuss yet-to-be-developed parts of the Whitman Archive dealing with place-based cultural analysis and translation studies as a way to illustrate the expansive possibilities of this new model of scholarship. Digital textual studies seem to me inadequately described by the terms now available. Project is amorphous; archive and edition are heavy with associations carried over from print culture; database is both too limiting and too misleading in its connotations; and digital thematic research collection lacks a memorable ring and pithiness. The terms we use have more than expressive importance. The shorthand we invoke when explaining our work to others shapes how we conceive of and also how we position digital scholarship. We need a new term that is vivid enough to be memorable, elastic enough to cover a class of like things, and yet restrictive enough to allow us to include some scholarly undertakings and not others. Ordinary readers and academics alike rely heavily on the work of editors, yet the standing of editors in the academy has for decades been shaky at best. For many people, electronic work is even more dubious: what relatively short history it has is marked by distrust, denigration, and dismissal. We all know the charges, however distorted they may be: digital work is ephemeral, unvetted, chaotic, and unreliable. When suspicion of the value of editing combines with suspicion of the new medium, we have a hazardous mix brewing. There is a danger that if humanities scholars do not undertake the key work of textual transmission, this work will be done by librarians and systems engineers — that is, it will be done by people with less specialized knowledge of the content. In the fraught circumstances of the academy, driven by a prestige economy, humanities scholars are well advised to be highly self-conscious about what we do and how we describe it.","",""

Mobilizing many of the great – and the not­so­great – philosophes of the 18th century, the Encyclopedie was a massive reference work for the arts and sciences, which sought to organize and transmit the totality of human knowledge while at the same time serving as a vehicle for critical thinking. In its digital form, it is a highly structured corpus; some 55,000 of its 77,000 articles were labeled with classes of knowledge by the editors making it a perfect sandbox for experiments with supervised learning algorithms. In this study, we train a Naive Bayesian classifier on the labeled articles and use this model to determine class membership for the remaining articles. This model is then used to make binary comparisons between labeled texts from different classes in an effort to extract the most important features in terms of class distinction. Re­applying the model onto the original classified articles leads us to question our previous assumptions about the consistency and coherency of the ontology developed by the Encyclopedists. Finally, by applying this model to another corpus from 18th century France, the Journal de Trevoux, or Memoires pour l'Histoire des Sciences & des Beaux­Arts, new light is shed on the domain of Literature as it was understood and defined by 18th century writers.","",""

The word finish is just not part of the deal for the Linguistic Atlas Project in either sense. However, granting agencies must ask what do you want money for this time? and, from this viewpoint, the Atlas Project consists of a series of particular tasks or experiments, each one of which is capable of being finished in both senses of the word. This paper discusses the reality of funding, deadlines, and deliverables, as they relate to the sequence of tasks that make up the larger Atlas Project. There are no once-and-done, permanent solutions. The largest humanities computing projects require continuing care and maintenance, and the best way forward is to create some sort of stable institutional setting for large projects that will provide continuity and baseline resources for the work.","",""

There have been many studies of the roles new information and communication technologies play within organizations. In our study, we compare digital and non-digital methods of inter-organizational collaboration. Based on ethnographic fieldwork on three construction projects and interviews with 65 architects, engineers, and builders across the USA, we find that IT tools designed to increase collaboration in this setting instead solidify and make explicit organizational and cultural differences between project participants. Our study suggests that deeply embedded disciplinary thinking is not easily overcome by digital representations of knowledge and that collaboration may be hindered through the exposure of previously implicit distinctions among the team members’ skills and organizational status. The tool that we study, building information modelling, reflects and amplifies disciplinary representations of the building by architects, engineers, and builders instead of supporting increased collaboration among them. We argue that people sometimes have a difficult time overcoming the lack of interpretive flexibility in digital coordinating tools, even when those tools are built to encourage interdisciplinary collaboration.","",""
"2010","Transitions: A Prologue and Preview of Digital Humanities Research in Canada","It is a truism in the digital humanities, a constant one, and a good one, that it is always in a state of transition. Such an observation is not surprising since the instrument upon which it relies -- the computer -- is itself in a state of flux. For the moment, its computational power remains firmly in the grip of Moore's Law, exponentially increasing its computational power as the decades pass. Scholars, whether they want it or not, are constantly being presented with new paradigms of computing -- be it cloud computing, ubiquitous computing, or high performance computing -- and new tools and markup schemes to express, treat and analyze content. In any publication devoted to the digital humanities, then, it would seem superfluous to mention that change is our constant condition and our constant preoccupation, a trite observation best left unsaid. We sympathize with this view. But when it comes to describing digital humanities scholarship generally, and computationally supported scholarship in Canada particularly, we think it is wrong. In Canada and abroad, a number of important developments have recently emerged that will impinge on the practice and future trajectory of our inter-discipline. They are new, important, and are reflected in the contributions to this issue. They are of sufficient moment and frequency that we feel justified in rendering this inaugural issue of Digital Studies with the thematic stamp it now bears: that of transition.","",""

The question remains, however: does editing disappear along with the editor? The short answer is ‘no’, when one understands editing generically, as an essential part of the process of creating meaning in a text. In reviewing examples on the internet, one sees that it does not disappear, but shifts from a third-party intermediary to the author and the reader, and from human to more automated types of intervention. However, despite the promise of the ‘semantic web’, these kinds of intervention are unlikely to reach high standards on a consistent basis. The absence of experienced human mediation in the writing process — as in other areas of life — can be harmful to public life, and ways should be found to show the added value that they make. ","",""

"2010","Framing digital humanities: The role of new media in humanities scholarship","The phrase “digital humanities” refers to a range of new media applications that converge at the intersection of technology and humanities scholarship. It is an evolving notion and conveys the role of information technologies in humanities scholarship. Based on a qualitative case study approach, this paper interprets the concept by eliciting the diverse perspectives — which nevertheless express several discernible themes — of a group of humanities scholars. It synthesizes the wide range of opinions and assumptions about information and communication technologies (ICTs) held by these humanists by using Bijker’s (1995) notion of a technological frame. The digital humanities domain is interpreted through three lenses: digital media as facilitator of scholarly communication; digital media as a platform for creative expression and artistic endeavors; and, digital media as context for critical studies of digital culture. The article concludes that, while technologies are being positioned as driving forces behind academic innovation, it is more important than ever to understand the cultural, social, and political implications of new media and how they are perceived and used by humanities scholars.","",""
"2010","Post PostScript please","Writing practices that integrate dynamic and interactive strategies into the making and reading of digital texts are proliferating as more of our reading experiences are mediated through the screen. We argue that rarely do current approaches to creating digital texts operate at the basic textual level of the letterform itself, and that this neglect is partially due to the fact that current font technology is based on print paradigms that make it difficult to work programmatically at the level of individual letters. Work produced in our lab suggests the creative possibilities in being able to easily specify behaviours at such a level, and leads us to propose that writers, typographers and programmers start thinking beyond Postscript-like formats such as OpenType or TrueType to collaboratively develop a new ComplexType format (or formats) that is designed for the twenty-first century as opposed to a simulation of the fifteenth.","",""

As a way of filling this gap, the authors conducted an online survey of developers of digital humanities tools in March 2008. The survey focused on their perceptions of their work, how they felt their tool development fit into a structure of academic rewards, and the value of tool development as a scholarly pursuit. Survey results indicate that tool development is indeed considered a scholarly activity by developers, but recognition of this work and rewards for it lag behind rewards for traditional scholarly pursuits (such as journal articles and book publication). This paper presents a summary of the results of the survey, ending with some suggestions for further research.","",""

Orlando's current delivery system privileges text as an approach to literary historical scholarship. The Mandala browser represents a radically different way of mediating between the user and the text, translating a text or set of texts into a circular visual form and pushing the user towards a more distant, or at least a more selective, reading of the materials than that associated with conventional print or screen rendering. Through experimental visualizations of Orlando content, we began to address questions concerning the participation of Victorian and Renaissance writers in various genres, the relationship between reproduction and literary production, the connection of censorship to the destruction of literary works, and the relationship between suffrage and liberal or conservative political groups. We argue that, just as a postcolonialist or a new historicist needs to learn about the tenets and processes involved in a postcolonial or new historical critical framework, so too an algorithmic critic should expect to invest some time learning the techniques of a given approach and how to apply them to a particular text or body of texts. These investigations may interest other humanities scholars working with online digital collections, as well as those thinking through the question of how to involve computational processes in complex inquiries using large quantities of texts.","",""
"2011","""""Testing the Limits"""": What Happens When Digital Humanities Meets Alternative Worldviews","“Testing the Limits” aims to introduce a conceptual paradigm shift in theoretical approaches to the use of immersive technologies in a postcolonial, post-positivistic world. This means bringing into proximity alternative explanatory models of “reality”--such as quantum theory, the Indigenous philosophy of Leroy Little Bear, and the theory of synchronicity as developed by Carl G. Jung in collaboration with physicist Wolfgang Pauli--where these modes open into alternative worldviews which offer a rapprochement in the history of consciousness between science and art. This study, therefore, focuses on the instrumentality of theory itself in constructing perceptual models of reality (including scientific and artistic worldviews), especially where it is “virtual” and where it needs consider diverse philosophies, scientific theories and representations of space/time in relation to subjectivity. To illustrate this claim, the media work by Canadian artist, Char Davies will be offered as a case studies. Char Davies is a software developer and artist whose work is informed by her understanding of quantum theory.","",""

"2011","Rethinking the Digital Humanities in the Context of Originary Technicity","There seems to be a vague sense among digital humanities scholars that this emerging field should be concerned with, and engaged in, thinking the humanities differently. However, there is no significant agreement about what this might actually mean. Is the encounter between the humanities and digitality sufficient to make the humanitites ‘different’, or ‘new’? In what sense would digitality bring about something ‘new’ in the humanities, and what implications would this have for the way in which the humanities are practiced in the academy? Alan Liu, among others, has raised questions for such a search for novelty or ‘new beginnings’ in academic disciplines (Liu, 2008: 4). In his book of 2008 entitled Local Transcendence he understands the chase for ‘the new or innovative in business, technology, media, art fashion’, and (we may add) in academic disciplines, as a feature of the postindustrial Western sense of temporality – a ‘sense of loose beginnings and loose ends’ (1).","",""

"2011","Technics and Violence in Electronic Literature","If, as Jacques Derrida once claimed in a New York Times interview, ‘Everything is a text’ (Smith, 1998), then, of course, we are correct to seek methods of textual analysis appropriate for those media we choose to scrutinize, including those texts contained within the entire realm of digital computing. This realm of the text would include the network of machines, the individual machines themselves, the platforms that run on them, the software that runs on the platforms, the plug-ins and applets tucked into the software, the content supported by the software, and the ways that people use, modify, and create this content. To many who read this—electronic literature critics, digital humanists, cultural studies scholars, and others—this broad conception of textuality is nothing new. It fits within a tradition of criticism that is often traced back to the field of semiotics, but could conceivably be traced back to the Hellenic conception of techne which is linked to poiesis.","",""

These tools carry with them assumptions of knowledge as observer­independent and certain, rather than observer co­dependent and interpretative. This paper argues that we need a humanities approach to the graphical expression of interpretation. To begin, the concept of data as a given has to be rethought through a humanistic lens and characterized as capta, taken and constructed. Next, the forms for graphical expression of capta need to be more nuanced to show ambiguity and complexity. Finally, the use of a humanistic approach, rooted in a co­dependent relation between observer and experience, needs to be expressed according to graphics built from interpretative models. In summary: all data have to be understood as capta and the conventions created to express observer­independent models of knowledge need to be radically reworked to express humanistic interpretation.","",""

"2011","Digital Literature and the Modernist Problem","What is the status of digital literature in contemporary culture? After more than 20 years of production, the audience for digital literature remains small in comparison with the audience for “serious” or popular fiction. Many scholars and practitioners assume that digital literature constitutes a contemporary avant-garde, which does its work of experimentation outside or in opposition to the mainstream. Recent comparisons of digital poetics and early modernist art practices (e.g. by Scott Rettberg and Jessica Pressman) indicate continued interest in this issue. The notion of the avant-garde might seem thoroughly out of date in a consideration of the digital future. Important theorists (e.g. Huyssen, Drucker) have argued that the avant-garde is no longer viable even for traditional media and art practices. On the other hand, the avant-gardes of twentieth-century modernism made claims about the function of art that remain surprisingly influential today–within the art community and within popular culture. As Peter Burger and others have discussed, an important division grew up in modernism on the question of whether art should strive for formal innovation or for sociopolitical change. Avant-gardes of the twentieth century took up positions along a spectrum from pure formalism (e.g. the Abstract Expressionists) to overt political action (e.g. the Situationists). This modernist problem is still apparent in the practices of digital art and digital literature today. While the digital literature community is in general committed to formal innovation, some are critical of this commitment, in part on the political grounds that (technological) innovation has become a byword for the digital culture industry. We propose to read examples of contemporary digital literature in terms of this modernist problem. Our reading is meant to contribute to the larger question: do digital art practices in the twenty-first century constitute a turning away from the aesthetics of the avant-gardes of the twentieth?","",""
"2012","Synthetic Ethos: The Believability of Collections at the Intersection of Classification and Curation","This article explores the rhetorical notion of ethos, or a believable character, in the context both of classification schemes, or means of organizing documents, and of the resource collections that make use of those schemes. Ethos, the article contends, explains how a particular audience is more or less likely to accept the interpretive frame that classification or collection inscribes on its contents. Two case studies, one of a classification and one of a resource collection that incorporates a classification, show how these communicative artifacts can generate ethos despite their lack of typical textual mechanisms, such as linear narrative. The article concludes by suggesting that properties of collections—their synthesis of multiple, often independent parts, their continuous versioning—stretch the basic idea of ethos itself, and the notion of synthetic ethos is proposed to better encompass these properties.","",""
"2012","Graphic Literacies for a Digital Age: The Survival of Layout","Page layout is dominant in many genres of physical documents, but it is frequently overlooked in academic analyses of texts and in digitized versions. Its presence is largely determined by available technologies and skills: If no provision is made for creating, preserving, or describing layout, then it tends not to be created, preserved or described. However, I argue, the significance and utility of layout for readers is such that it will survive or reemerge. I review how layout has been treated in the literature of graphic design and linguistics, and consider its role as a memory tool. I distinguish between fixed, flowed, fluid, and fugitive layouts, determined not only by authorial intent, but by technical constraints. Finally, I describe graphic literacy as a component of functional literacy and suggest that corresponding graphic literacies are needed not only by readers, but by creators of documents and by the information management technologies that produce, deliver, and store them.","",""

It defines laterally developed projects as those that reconstitute previously existing project architecture to new ends. It argues that there are many reasons to develop projects laterally. First, it can be financially prudent to develop projects laterally; given the difficulties in securing grant money for projects, lateral development can assist digital humanists in building new and more robust projects on the shoulders of previously competed work. Second, lateral project development can facilitate greater production in the digital humanities, as laterally developed projects need not be undertaken by the researcher or institution that developed the original. Indeed, once the core elements of a project have been published online any other researcher can build upon this previously completed work. However, this presents a bit of a problem, as to fully realize the potential of lateral project development we will have to do away with a proprietary mindset with regard to our digital projects and be willing to share already completed project elements and modules with other researchers.","",""

Reflections on this extended multidisciplinary experience have led to the articulation of a new perspective on the nature and structure of computing as a scientific discipline (Rosenbloom, 2004, 2009, 2010, 2012; Denning and Rosenbloom, 2009). In the process has come: a new conception of what a great scientific domain is; the realization that computing forms the fourth such domain, with the physical, life and social sciences comprising the other three domains; the recognition that much of the core content and future of computing is inherently multidisciplinary; the understanding that this multidisciplinarity can be reduced to a small fixed set of across-domain relationships, defining the relational architecture; the demonstration that the relational architecture yields a novel organizational framework over computing; and the application of this framework to illuminating some of the connections between computing and other scientific disciplines. It has also suggested several tentative conclusions concerning disciplines outside of computing, such as that mathematics and the humanities can both be considered as part of the scientific enterprise, but that neither amounts to a great scientific domain on its own. Mathematics instead nestles naturally within a broad understanding of the computing domain, while the humanities fit within a comparably broad understanding of the social domain. The purpose of this article is to further explore these notions with respect to the emerging area of the digital humanities, with their focus on the interchange between computing and the humanities. In particular, we will look at the idea that the humanities can be viewed as a part of science – in fact, as part of the social domain – and at the framework that this yields for understanding the space of relationships between computing and the humanities. Such an exploration requires some understanding of computing, the humanities, and the philosophy of science. I am a professional within the first of these, but no more than an interested amateur with respect to the latter two. So there are inherent risks in this enterprise, but the hope is that the utility of its results will overbalance any naivete exposed in the process.","",""

The goal of the project, which has been run three times since 2009, is to bring together participants to reflect on the question, Just what do computing humanists really do? To do this, participants document their day through photographs and commentary using one of the Day of DH blogs set up for them. The collection of these journals (with links, tags, and comments) is, after editing, made available online. This paper discusses the design of this social project, from the ethical issues raised to the final web of journals and shares some of the lessons we have learned. One of the major challenges of social media is getting participation. We made participating easy by personally inviting a seed group, choosing an accessible technology, maintaining a light but constant level of communication prior to the event, and asking only for a single day of commitment. In addition, we tried to make participation at least rewarding in formal academic terms by structuring the Day of DH as a collaborative publication. In terms of improvements, we have over the iterations changed the handling ethics clearances for images and connected to other social media like Twitter.","",""

There, whilst undertaking summer work in the library, he saw first-hand the potential of digital methods. After arriving in London in 1972 he took an Open University degree in mathematics, computing and systems. Among his early influences he identifies the reading he did on matters related to cognitive science whilst undertaking a postgraduate certificated in education. In the UK he worked at the BBC as programmer, systems analyst and then systems manager. In 1988 he moved to King's College London to take up the post of Assistant Director in Computing Services for Humanities and Information Management. One of his first tasks was to work with the Humanities Faculty to develop an undergraduate programme in humanities and computing. The first digital humanities conference he attended was the first joint international conference of ALLC and ACH, held at the University Toronto in 1989, which c. 450 people attended. He reflects on aspects of the institutional shape of the field towards the end of the 1980s, including the key Centres that existed then, the first meeting of the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing (ALLC) and those who were active in it such as Roy Wisbey, Susan Hockey and the late Antonius Ampoli. He gives a detailed discussion of the development of what is now the Department of Digital Humanities in King's College London, both in terms of the administrative and institutional issues involved, as well as the intellectual. He also reflects on some of the most successful collaborations that the Department has been involved in, for example, the AHRC funded Henry III Fine Rolls project, and the conditions and working practices that characterised them. He closes by discussing his impressions about the movement of scholars into and out of the discipline and of the institutional issues that have had an impact on digital humanities centres.","",""

After his dreams of becoming a physicist were thwarted he transferred to Reed College. There he did not have the opportunity to take formal training in computing; for the most part, Computer Science departments did not exist then. So, he learned to programme on the job with help from a talented physicist turned computer programmer named Bill Gates (no association with Microsoft). His first encounter with what we now call digital humanities was at the University of Toronto where he worked  the Records of Early English Drama project whilst undertaking a PhD  17th century non-dramatic poetry. In 1984/5, as he was finishing his PhD, he accepted an academic support role at the Centre for Computing in the Humanities at Toronto, where he remained until 1996 when he accepted an academic post in King's College London. In Toronto he was keenly aware of the staff-faculty divide and the marginalised position of those who used computers in Humanities research. Nevertheless, the opportunities that the role brought to meet with a range of scholars interested in computing had a lasting influence  him.

He bought his first computer, an Apple II clone, after graduation when he was working as a teacher in the Middle East. Throughout the interview he reflects on the various computers he has used and how the mouse that he used with an early Macintosh instinctively appealed to him. By the mid-1980s he was attending graduate school in the University of Toronto and was accepted on to the Apple Research Partnership Programme, which enabled him to be embedded in the central University of Toronto Computing Services; he went on to hold a full time position there. Also taking a PhD in Philosophy, he spent many lunch times talking with John Bradley. This resulted in the building of text analysis tools and their application to Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, as well as some of the earliest, if not the earliest, conference paper on visualisation in the digital humanities community. He reflects on the wide range of influences that shaped and inspired his early work in the field, for example, the Research Computing Group at the University of Toronto and their work in visual programming environments. In 1994 he applied, and was hired at McMaster University to what he believes was the first job openly advertised as a humanities computing position in Canada. After exploring the opposition to computing that he encountered he reflects that the image of the underdog has perhaps become a foundational myth of digital humanities and questions whether it is still a useful one.","",""

In his impressively sourced history, Jason Palmeri (Associate Professor of English, Director of Composition, and Co-Director of the Digital Writing Collaborative at Miami University of Ohio) offers a unique, nonlinear examination of the history of composition and its pedagogy. Although his book is written to address scholars in composition, it also offers useful insights to scholars in all areas of communication who are interested in, or work with, multimodal composing practices. Palmeri draws on scholarship from rhetoric, composition, psychology, education, film studies, and other disciplines to address the complex “borrowing” and interdisciplinary network of theories and methods that undergird pedagogical approaches to writing or composing. Truly, any reader interested in the multitude of contexts surrounding multimodal composing processes, be they political, cultural, semiotic, or otherwise, will find value in Palmeri’s account of the last four decades of writing pedagogy.","",""
"2013","THE EMERGENT QUALITIES OF DIGITAL SPECIMEN IMAGES IN BIOLOGY","Whilst digital technologies are often popularly portrayed as inherently different from their material counterparts, recent research has accentuated continuities between the two. Research on the material aspects of digital technologies has emphasized that both material and digital technologies are embedded in practice and acquire their meaning in context. This is particularly so in science, where research in science and technology studies has illuminated the contextual interpretation of representations and their contingent manifestation through embedding in specific sociotechnical configurations. This article explores how digital technologies are experienced in a specific field of science, biological systematics. Email accounts were solicited from biologists who have been working with digital images of the biological specimens conventionally used in work on the classification and naming of organisms. Thematic analysis of the interviews shows that qualities of digital images were highly contextual, often defined in dialogue with their material counterparts which are also defined in fluid and contextual fashion. Discussing the use of digital specimen images involved distinctions between different forms of work and different organisms being studied and referenced the varied institutional and geographic positioning of respondents. The introduction of digital images offered the possibility of new sociotechnical configurations emerging and to some extent realized the aspirations of digitization projects to enable new forms of distributed working. This was, however, a qualified success restricted to only some aspects of the systematists’ work.","",""

"2013","Before the Beginning: The Formation of Humanities Computing as a Discipline in Canada","In his book Humanities Computing, in a chapter fittingly titled “Discipline”, Willard McCarty attempts to define the discipline of Humanities Computing by understanding what is happening within the discipline. According to McCarty it is through this understanding that “we may get to the disciplinary conditions from which specific methods arise as desire or need direct” (McCarty #). This suggests that one way to understand the beginnings of a discipline are to look not at the founding people, but at the desires and needs articulated at the time. This paper will therefore look at how an agenda was set for humanities computing in documents around a particular moment of emergence, in this case the emergence of a Canada-wide scholarly society, the Consortium for Computers in the Humanities (COCH/COSH).","",""

To justify these claims, the authors examine two platforms, ThoughtMesh and Scalar, using methods across digital rhetoric, interaction design, data structuring, and software studies.

Borges, digitisation and the myth of a universal library","The growing capacity of digital encoding and storage has opened up vast new avenues for the archiving and distribution of texts in virtual space, prompting many to declare the imminent obsolescence of print media, the book included. An interesting correlate to this situation is the revival of interest in and support for the idea of the universal library, a collection of every text in existence, albeit reimagined as an immense database of digitised material with online accessibility. Drawing mainly upon two texts by Jorge Luis Borges, a short story and an essay, this article challenges the premise that such a project would be possible or even desirable, and problematises the perceived equivalencies between print and digital media, reading a book and reading onscreen text, and library and database.","",""

"2013","Introduction: transdisciplinary learning for digital creative practice","The Institute of Creative Technologies (IOCT) at De Montfort University, Leicester, UK, was founded in 2006 with a £1.3 million award from the Higher Education Funding Council for England under its ‘Science Research Infrastructure Fund’. The aim was to provide a catalyst for research at the intersection of science and technology, and the arts and humanities. The IOCT was situated outside the faculty structure of the university with a mission to pull together high-quality research from all areas and to present a public face to the most creative and innovative research at De Montfort University (DMU). The IOCT rapidly formed a network of partners across the university and established a large collection national and international links. These are detailed on its website at http://www.ioct.dmu.ac.uk. Since its inception, it has housed over 100 projects, conducted by over 100 researchers, and funded from a range of sources including research councils, charities and other agencies. All IOCT projects are either interdisciplinary (applying the methods from one discipline to another), multidisciplinary (teams from various disciplines combining to investigate a research question) or transdisciplinary (across and beyond all disciplines) (Nicolescu 2002; Nowotny et al. 2001; Thompson Klein 1990). The emphasis on collaboration and networking has led to some notable successes in areas such as: computational intelligence; digital writing; sonic art; pervasive media; digital heritage; interactivity in health; cultural visualisation; semantic web; and many more. Current research in the IOCT is clustered into three main areas:","",""

This sea-change in how scholars conceive of, undertake, and communicate their research is often registered in the perceived relation of the digital humanities to the humanities as a whole. However, the scope of rapid transformation in scholarly practice and interdisciplinarity is much larger than the digital humanities alone suggests, reaching across the humanities and social sciences, reconfiguring disciplinary formations, and revealing new contact zones between academic research and communities involved in policy making, data-driven corporate research, and social networking. Undertaking the dynamics of new interdisciplinary formations not only as its focus, but also through its breadth of coverage, Virtual Knowledge offers an empirical study of what practices, procedures, and power dynamics change (or remain unchanged) when emerging digital methods contact established disciplinary and institutional models.

This Project uses architectural modelling software and acoustic simulation software to give us access experientially to a particular event from the past–the Paul's Cross sermon John Donne delivered on Tuesday, November 5, 1622. These tools enable us to integrate the physical traces of pre-Fire St. Paul's Cathedral with the surviving visual record of the cathedral and its surroundings to create a visual model of the Cathedral and its churchyard. They also enable us to experience a historically informed interpretation of Donne's preaching style, based on contemporary descriptions of his capacity to engage his congregations imaginatively and emotionally and to delight them with his wit. We are also able to assess the audibility of a sermon delivered without amplification in a large open space for people positioned at different places in the crowd, and in the presence of different sizes of congregation.

Therefore, in this paper, I investigate the digital culture of Nigeria as a developing country with the goal of teasing out explanations for the gaps between digital literacy and digital humanities activities. I focus on the reasons for a low participation in digital humanities activities in the country by looking into the problems that internet users face in the country and why, despite the amount of digital activities taking place in the country, there appears to be an absence of digital humanities in academia. I conclude by proposing ways through which digital humanities can be incorporated into the Nigerian digital culture, especially in the education sector.    Comme le suggere Daniel O’Donnell dans son examen sur la participation mondiale aux humanites numeriques, il peut y avoir une correlation entre les activites numeriques et la situation economique d’un pays.

As this migration to digital practices is increasingly accepted at universities and public institutions, such bodies have realised they must develop consistent policies governing the practice, implementation, and evaluation of digital scholarship. The formal debate about these processes in relation to faculty and administration is well underway. Similar discussions from the perspective of graduate students working on large-scale, collaborative digital projects has until now been limited to passing conversations at conferences and intradepartmental gestures, with occasional online discussions occurring in venues frequented by early career digital practitioners. This contribution revisits and rehearses, in textual form, issues raised and discussions had at a roundtable at the 2012 conference of the Canadian Society for Digital Humanities devoted to exploring the role of graduate students in the forming digital scholarly environment.

"2014","""""To think a world without thought"""": Negotiating Speculative Realism in a Digital Humanities Practice","In John Napier’s classic study of the structure, function, and behavior of the human hand, he states that """"[i]magination is basic to tool-making. All human-made tools start off as chunks of undifferentiated material, which are then shaped according to some cerebral blueprint of what is required"""" (1993, 99). These words can be productively repurposed to describe the digital humanities practice of tool making, tool use, and modelling. After all, making, shaping, and using tools for analysis, archiving, and visualisation has become central to humanistic research methods. Napier's """"cerebral blueprint"""" blends imaginative and technical ways of making that emulates how digital humanists seek out new insights alongside technological development. As increasing numbers of digital humanists hone their literacy of the programming languages to build and remake tools, I argue that the means by which we describe this particular philosophy of tool use will become an increasingly thorny issue that may even hinder the usefulness of the knowledge produced by the digital humanities. Therefore, digital humanists will need to find ways to negotiate this role in the humanities and better define their critical agency within the history of epistemology. Additionally, a collaborative development of tools requires a theoretical framework that is critical of the value of data derived from literature in a purely instrumental way and is able to redefine research artifacts in the humanities to include digital tools.    Dans son etude classique de la structure, de la fonction et du comportement de la main humaine, John Napier affirme que """"l’imagination est a la base de la fabrication des outils. Tous les outils fabriques par l’humain sont, au depart, des morceaux de materiaux indifferencies, qui sont ensuite faconnes selon un certain schema cerebral de ce qui est requis"""" (1993, 99). Cette affirmation peut etre reutilisee de facon productive pour decrire la fabrication, l’utilisation et le modelage des outils, selon la pratique des humanites numeriques. Apres tout, fabriquer, faconner et utiliser des outils pour l’analyse, l’archivage et la visualisation est maintenant au cœur des methodes de recherche en sciences humaines. Le """"schema cerebral"""" de Napier combine des moyens imaginatifs et techniques de fabrication qui imitent la facon dont les humanistes numeriques recherchent de nouvelles idees en meme temps que le developpement technologique. A mesure qu’un nombre de plus en plus eleve d’humanistes numeriques perfectionnent leurs connaissances des langages de programmation pour bâtir et refaire des outils, j’argumente que les moyens par lesquels nous decrivons cette philosophie particuliere d’utilisation des outils deviendront une question de plus en plus epineuse qui pourrait meme gener l’utilite des connaissances produites par les humanites numeriques. Par consequent, les humanistes numeriques devront trouver des moyens de negocier ce role dans les humanites et de mieux definir leur mandat critique au sein de l’histoire epistemologique. De plus, un developpement collaboratif d’outils necessite un cadre d’applications theorique qui est essentiel a la valeur des donnees derivees de la litterature de facon purement instrumentale, et qui est capable de redefinir les artefacts de recherche dans les humanites afin d’y inclure les outils numeriques.","",""

The book’s social function as the high status vehicle for communicating new ideas and cultural expressions is being challenged by sophisticated systems of conveying meaning in other media. In this article, we report on two projects: electronic book (e-book) publication and reader forum for Nature Mage and the transmedia augmented reality (AR) fiction Sherwood Rise, which investigate these issues. Claudio Pires Franco’s work is based on the adaptation of a source work: Duncan Pile’s Nature Mage. The project aims to develop the book from e-book to a fan-produced enhanced digital book. Through this practice-based research, Franco investigates the definitions and classification of the e and i forms of the book and adaptation in new media; the role of the author in creative collaboration with readers through online forums; the extension of the story world through creative collaboration and reader participation while respecting and safeguarding creative properties. One remove from the traditional book, David Miller’s Sherwood Rise, research the user experience with AR to examine narrative problems and explore new storytelling aesthetics.

In doing so, the authors point out some fundamental parallels between the masterpiece of Renaissance map-making and the current computer-supported digital representations of urban spaces. The historical sources indicate that de’ Barbari’s map was a composite image stitched together from numerous partial views; such partial views were already “digitized” and consequently mechanically reproduced and manipulated into one synoptic image whose sheer size and amount of detail was able to evoke in viewers an experience of virtual reality. Ultimately, the study challenges the rhetoric of newness that dominates current media studies by emphasizing the need to separate what is genuinely new in our everyday experiences of media from what has been seen before.

Digital Humanities as an answer to contemporary perceptions of the Humanities on the Polish language Internet","Starting with objectively laconic questions I would like to focus for a moment on the Humanities and encourage to some reflection. For some time researchers have been increasingly interested in entrepreneurship and the commercialisation of research. This phenomenon is discussed in the popular media, but also, perhaps especially, in the universities. The result is various training courses, workshops and conferences aimed at improving university-business collaboration. These have also produced reports and strategies outlining development opportunities. Young researchers (but not only) are encouraged to conduct innovative and modern research that will answer real market needs. And all this work is said to be very important for the development of the country–especially its competitiveness. While it is impossible to disagree with the desire for national improvement, this emphasis on commercialisation does immediately raise a question about where the Humanities fit in. How can they participate into this approach? In which direction should they develop? Can the development of Digital Humanities and media literacy make a difference in a field that is otherwise in danger of being seen as irrelevant to contemporary trends?","",""

"2015","Inner Margins of the Literary Digital Text: From Allusion to Rewriting","This paper aims to take into account the process of annotation as it can be inserted in a literary text driven by digital culture. Focusing on a corpus of digital literary texts, it will study how writers use hyperlinking as a way to build a network of allusions or commentaries inside the boundaries of their own text, or as support of reading of an another text. Three ranges of use are to be exposed. The first acts as a mediated reading of one's own work. Guillaume Vissac's Accident de personne, published as a twitter feed in 2010, has been edited as a (digital) whole by digital editor publie.net. The author used hyperlinks to reinforce patterns of similarity between characters and specific circumstances. The second use of semantic links inserts essayistic discourse and urban fabulation, as it can be found in Francois Bon's Tiers livre, in the web of its tentacular work and in a discursive ground of the social and literary environment of the writer. The third range of use covers writing-as-reading works, where links enact a set of commentaries or a way of rewriting a prior text. Philippe De Jonkheere's site, Desordre.net, and more specifically his project Tentative d'epuisement de Tentative d'epuisement d'un lieu parisien de Georges Perec, build on this idea. This project takes Perec's own reading of an urban place which tries to exhaust the real world by description, and adds a layer of hyperlinks giving back a reading of the reality depicted by Perec. These three uses show how literary writing in a digital context inherit from the tradition of marginal annotation and inscribe it in the most basic function of electronic publication, which is linking.

Although the first stage of digital scholarship (providing digital content) seems to be a well mastered skill for Siberian researchers, the second stage of working with digital data and new research questions in the humanities does not seem to be within their comfort zone. We conclude that random digital humanities initiatives do not guarantee either demand for digital humanities or knowledge and understanding of new research questions inspired by new methodologies. Further studies might be needed to understand if we require lobbying for digital humanities and, if so, what kind of promotion, dissemination and training are needed or would be most effective.","",""
"2015","NewRadial: Challenging scales and standards of humanities scholarship through new knowledge environment prototypes","Even though large aggregations of humanities data are emerging through the efforts of significant federations, the larger the collection, the more difficult it is for large-scale standards to effectively account for and relate the complex variety of data objects and their characteristics. How can we simultaneously embrace this complexity with the help of the computer and achieve interoperability while still retaining the interpretative flexibility that is the heart of meaningful humanities work? Additionally, what scale is the optimal viewpoint through which we can do humanities-related work on such large data sets? At what point do we lose a humanist sensibility when working with big data, and how do we take advantage of computing technology to pluralize perspective, confront complexity, avoid reductiveness and preserve meaning as we interpret meaningful subsets of big data collections? NewRadial— an INKE prototype—addresses these questions by enabling users to connect and explore humanities databases across plural scales of engagement without imposing a universal metadata standard. Its web-based environment visually displays the objects of humanities databases in a manner that encourages browsing, searching, collecting, organizing, connecting and annotating, modelling a way to bring different standards and ontological perspectives together without negating their differences or requiring conformity to a reductive or limiting overall system.","",""
"2015","Seeing through the fog: Digital problems and solutions for studying ancient women","In spite of the proliferation of online resources dedicated to the study of the ancient world, there is nonetheless room for the improvement and expansion of methodology and content. This paper identifies two predominant problems in the realm of digital classics: the perpetuation of traditional methods of presenting research rather than the promotion of technology-driven analysis, and the virtual invisibility of ancient women in cyberspace. Arguing that there is a gender imbalance in Web-based resources for antiquity, two solutions are proposed beginning with the addition of more material regarding ancient women to existing platforms in the interest of equalization. Using an analogous project from McGill University as inspiration, an approach that combines ancient data with GIS analysis is proposed in order to make room for technology-driven research while beginning to mitigate the invisibility of women in the ancient world and on the Web.","",""

During this data sprint, we developed a method to map the fields of Digital Humanities and Electronic Literature based on title recommendations from the largest online bookseller, Amazon, by retrieving similar purchased items from the Amazon API. A first step shows the overall Amazon recommendation network for Digital Humanities and allows us to detect clusters, aligned fields and bridging books. In a second step we looked into four country-specific Amazon stores (Amazon.com, Amazon.co.uk, Amazon.fr and Amazon.de) to investigate the specificities of the Digital Humanities in these four countries. The third step is a network of all books suggested for the Electronic Literature field in the four Amazon stores we searched, which offers a comparison to the field of Digital Humanities.","",""

"2016","Asymmetric Digital Collaboration and Collective Authorship: On Digital Genres and Writing Processes for &lt;em&gt;CanLit Guides&lt;/em&gt;","This paper discusses the unique asymmetric collaboration process used at CanLit Guides in the first phase of its development. CanLit Guides began as a project to mobilize the massive digital archive (1959-2008) of the scholarly journal Canadian Literature. The Guides introduce undergraduate students to areas of scholarly and critical concern in the larger field of Canadian Literature and culture. The editors of Canadian Literature enabled graduate students to develop teamwork, research, teaching, and digital writing skills by employing them as developers, researchers, and writers. The project supports open access, scholarly collaboration, and the creation of new digital genres. As the project evolved, however, it became clear that getting a team of scholars to work on a hierarchized, or what we call """"asymmetric,"""" collaboration between the editors and the graduate students, is particularly difficult, and can lead to issues of doneness and sprawl. Producing a collaborative and democratic workflow process enabled us to write a robust collection of guides in innovative digital genres. This paper pays particular attention to issues of authorship that come up with any collaborative digital writing project, and it discusses the complexities of the graduate student experience of working on a digital pedagogical development team. Cet article discute du processus unique de collaboration asymetrique qui a ete utilise dans les guides sur la litterature canadienne ( CanLit Guides ) au cours du premier stade de leur developpement. Les guides CanLit ont debute comme projet visant a mobiliser les archives numeriques massives (1959-2008) du journal erudit de la litterature canadienne. Les guides initient les etudiants de premier cycle a des domaines de preoccupation universitaire et critique dans le champ plus large de la litterature et de la culture canadienne. Les redacteurs de Litterature canadienne ont permis aux etudiants diplomes de developper leurs aptitudes de travail en equipe, de recherche, d'enseignement et de redaction numerique, en les employant comme developpeurs, chercheurs et redacteurs. Le projet soutient l'acces ouvert, la collaboration universitaire et la creation de nouveaux genres numeriques.

In turning to earlier textual exemplars, such as the sammelbande and foldout engravings, the chapter illustrates certain commonalities between past and present textual media. Similarly, by examining the material evidence of Renaissance readers, including manuscript tables of contents and supplements to print indexes, the chapter considers the long history of customization that lies behind many of our digital applications today. In short, the chapter invites readers to situate a series of INKE tools within a much earlier and seemingly unrelated textual tradition.

"2016","Chapter 5&lt;/br&gt;Digital editing as autopoietic process","One of the most potent criticisms of the TEI as a means for describing documents is that it is deterministic: it forces upon a text a set of a priori categories and thus largely determines how the text is understood. My contention is that critiques offered by scholars such as Jerome McGann can be answered in part by modifying one's conception of the text's poietic frame. If the entire process of editing is conceived of as an autopoietic system, the act of marking the text according to the TEI standards becomes but one stage of a process that is repeatedly questioned and open to revision. By conceiving of the system as editorial interaction with successive iterations of the text, the editor is made aware of the inherent textual and linguistic ambiguities of the source document and is forced to read actively and engage these ambiguities in pursuit of an adequate electronic text. These ideas will be demonstrated with examples from my work in digitizing a manuscript of records belonging to William Courten, a 17th-century naturalist and collector. L'une des critiques les plus negatives de la TEI (initiative pour l'encodage du texte) comme moyen de decrire des documents est qu'il s'agit d'une approche deterministe : elle impose a un texte un ensemble de categories a priori et determine ainsi en grande partie la facon dont le texte est compris. Je soutiens que l'on peut repondre en partie a des critiques offertes par des erudits comme Jerome McGann, en modifiant notre conception du cadre poietique du texte. Si le processus entier de l'edition est concue comme un systeme autopoietique, le marquage du texte selon les normes de la TEI devient un processus qui est constamment remis en question et ouvert a la revision. En concevant le systeme comme une interaction redactionnelle avec des iterations successives du texte, le redacteur est sensibilise aux ambiguites textuelles et linguistiques inherentes au document de source et se voit force de lire activement et d'impliquer ces ambiguites dans la recherche d'un texte electronique adequat. Ces idees seront demontrees par des exemples de mon travail de numerisation d'un manuscrit de documents appartenant a William Courten, naturaliste et collectionneur du 17e siecle.","",""

It may refer to a theory of editing; to varieties of practice; to manners of making; or to characterize the edition itself. Further, not all editions which claim to be """"social,"""" in any of these senses, are any such thing. A particularly egregious example is the so-called """"Social edition of the Devonshire manuscript,"""" whose claim to be """"social"""" is poorly based. However, there is real potential in the making of editions which are more inclusive in their making, which achieve a wider impact and create new understandings in expanding circles of readership, whether or not we choose to label these as """"social.""""

De plus, les editions qui se disent « sociales » que ce soit dans n’importe lequel de ces sens, ne le sont pas toutes. Un exemple particulierement flagrant est le soi-disant « Social edition of the Devonshire manuscript », dont l’allegation de « sociale » est plutot mal definie.

Arguing that digital humanities (dh) has become a site of struggle for the future of the academy, the essay rejects a monolithic understanding of dh, arguing that such a representation encourages tensions by hiding the varying disciplinary knowledge productions, national structures, and local contexts that form specific dh practices. Insisting on specificity as a counter narrative to that of the sweeping representation of DH's revolutionary change, the article suggests that the current analysis of dh as a battle between insiders and outsiders is a potentially destructive form of resistance. Attending to continued problems with the treatment of race and gender in the field, the essay argues that such issues are core to particular dh practices.

In this paper, we describe one approach for addressing those two challenges simultaneously: an interdisciplinary research and development team called the Digital Innovation Group (DigInG). DigInG quickly and necessarily became an experiment in trans-disciplinary education at the interface of digital humanities and computer science. Not only does DigInG play an important role in developing a computational infrastructure for d/cHPS research, it also creates an environment for hands-on training for graduate and undergraduate students in computer science, biology, and history and philosophy of science. We discuss the rationale, benefits, and challenges of DigInG since its inception. Our primary objectives are to broaden the discussion about how digital and computational humanities programs are organized, and to suggest that software development and training in the digital humanities need not be conceived as independent activities.

Operating within an academic field of literary theory and criticism, in which a detailed and conscious use of scholarly edited texts is all but obvious, much more effort should be spent to communicate the merits of textual scholarship. With Hermans, an author known for the ongoing revisions of his texts, academic awareness on the textual process and textual fluidity can be raised, by developing digital editions of some of his works, and by integrating genetic criticism's notion of the creative process. But a range of other dissemination strategies should be developed as well. For a project like the Complete works of Willem Frederik Hermans, that almost exclusively takes place within a national context, with a comparatively small group of interested academics, students and other specialists, well-chosen, tailored initiatives should be deployed to reach new and diverse groups of audiences within the general reading public. Within the contexts of an emerging digital culture and a thoroughly changing literary culture and book market, new challenges are abundant. This article focuses on a range of past and future initiatives, all of which were developed in close cooperation with other partners working within the fields of technology and digital culture, literary education and cultural heritage.    Bien que la publication de l’Œuvre Complete de l’ecrivain neerlandais Willem Frederik Hermans soit deja une tâche difficile, aujourd’hui il ne suffit plus de seulement publier le vingt-quatre volumes dans la presse. Puisque le projet soit realise dans le champ des etudes litteraires, dans lequel l’usage conscient et detaille des textes edites est une evidence, il faut communiquer la valeur de la philologie avec beaucoup plus d’effort. Comme l’ecrivain Hermans est connu pour la revision continue de ses textes, on pourrait sensibiliser le discours academique au processus textuel et a la fluidite textuelle en creant des editions numeriques d’une partie de son œuvre litteraire qui integrent la notion du processus creatif de la critique genetique. En meme temps, il faut developper une gamme des strategies de diffusion.

L’enquete """"Who are you, Digital Humanists?"""" lancee a l’issue de THATCamp Luxembourg (Terras 2012b) et promue au cours de DH2012 (Hambourg), a permis de recolter un echantillon incomplet, mais deja significatif, de 850 personnes, qui ont accepte de se preter au jeu du questionnaire. On y decouvre une tres grande diversite linguistique et geographique, l’existence d’un hors-monde qui n’a pas vu l’enquete ou n’y a pas prete attention, la marginalite de l’anglais comme premiere langue, mais sa domination comme second idiome. S’y revelent des Digital Humanities fortement marquees par l’Histoire et les etudes classiques, mais tres peu, beaucoup trop peu, connectees aux disciplines s’interessant au monde contemporain, d’une part, et au sciences du Web, a la fouille de donnees, a la fouille de textes, d’autre part.

L’anglophonie a encore frappe, dira-t-on. Afin de mesurer les progres de la diversite au cœur du pouvoir de notre communaute, cet article propose la creation d’un indicateur, le Digital Humanities Decision Power (DHDP), qui permet de mesurer l’ecart entre la taille des bassins de Digital Humanists et leur pouvoir dans l’expertise et les procedures de selection scientifiques. Sur la base de cet indicateur, un debat collectif est necessaire pour rendre notre communaute plus ouverte a la diversite linguistique et geographique. Nous appelons cela la strategie du Sauna finlandais.    Digital Humanities is getting a lot of attention! But do they exist as a community, unified and consistent? Is this community’s government balanced and democratic? Up to now, no study has explored such a community by investigating its members, looking at them through the prism of multilingualism and geography. The """"Who are you, Digital Humanists?"""" survey, conducted after THATCamp Luxembourg (Terras 2012b) and promoted at DH2012 (Hambourg), provided an incomplete, though already significant, sample of 850 people who accepted to answer a questionnaire. The survey found a highly mixed linguistic and geographic profile, the existence of outsiders who either were not aware of the study or did not pay attention to it, the marginalization of English as a first language, and the dominance of English as a second language. It showed that Digital Humanities are strongly influenced by History and Classical Studies, but have little or no bearing on disciplines concerned with today’s world, on the one hand, and with Web sciences, data mining and text mining, on the other hand. A major event on cultural diversity, the Digital Humanities 2012, was governed by Europe and North America, namely the United Kingdom and its former colonies (Ireland, Canada, the United States and Australia). The Anglophone community strikes again, it appears. In order to measure progress in the diversity of the power of our community, this paper proposes the creation of an indicator, the Digital Humanities Decision Power (DHDP), which measures the gap between the various groups of Digital Humanists and their power in the field and the scientific selection procedures. On the basis of this indicator, a collective debate is necessary to make our community more responsive to linguistic and geographic diversity. We call this the Finnish Sauna strategy.","",""
"2016","Scholarly editions in print and on the screen: A theoretical comparison","Since the advent of digital scholarly editions, there have been many arguments to the effect that digital versions are able to offer more to humanities scholars than printed ones. Though this opinion is shared by most scholars producing digital editions, a number have also published printed versions alongside or even after launching digital ones.    To address the apparent contradiction between theoretical discourse and actual practice, this chapter will analyze two scholarly editions that have been implemented in both digital and printed environments by the same editor(s). Scholarly editions that we intend to focus on include the British Library, National Library of Russia, St. Catherine's Monastery, and Leipzig University Library's edition of the Codex Sinaiticus, and Daniel Paul O'Donnell's edition of Caedmon's hymn. By comparing statements of purpose, interface features, and content, we will identify the structures and characteristics that are either shared or unique in each edition.    Having conducted a detailed analysis of each edition, we will then evaluate each scholarly edition by applying to it a relevant theory of new media. Theories that we will use include Lev Manovich's The language of new media, and Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin's Remediation: Understanding new media. A view of the scholarly edition as a particular instance within the broader context of current media theory will thereby be developed. The vantage point thus obtained will allow for a more moderate evaluation of the relative advantages and disadvantages of printed and digital scholarly editions than has been available thus far.    Depuis l'avenement des editions universitaires numeriques, de nombreux arguments ont ete avances selon lesquels les versions numeriques sont en mesure d'offrir aux chercheurs en sciences humaines un eventail plus large que les versions imprimees. Bien que la plupart des chercheurs produisant des editions numeriques partagent cette opinion, certains ont aussi publie des versions imprimees en meme temps, ou meme apres, qu'ils ont lance des editions numeriques.    Afin de traiter de la contradiction apparente entre le discours theorique et la pratique reelle, ce chapitre analysera deux editions universitaires qui ont ete mises en œuvre a la fois en version numerique et en version imprimee par le(s) meme(s) editeur(s). Les editions universitaires sur lesquelles nous avons l'intention de porter notre attention sont l'edition du Codex Sinaiticus, de la British Library, de la Bibliotheque nationale russe, du monastere Sainte-Catherine et de la bibliotheque de l'universite de Leipzig, et l'edition de l'Hymne de Caedmon de Daniel Paul O'Donnell. En comparant les declarations d'intention, les fonctions d'interface et le contenu, nous identifierons les structures et les caracteristiques qui sont soit partagees, soit uniques dans chaque edition.    Apres avoir effectue une analyse detaillee de chaque edition, nous evaluerons ensuite chaque edition universitaire en y appliquant une theorie pertinente de nouveaux medias. Les theories que nous utiliserons sont, entre autres, Le langage des nouveaux medias de Lev Manovich et Remediation: Understanding new media de Jay David Bolter et Richard Grusin. Cela permettra ainsi d'elaborer un apercu de l'edition universitaire comme echantillon particulier au sein du contexte plus large de la theorie des medias actuelle.

We argue that the best digital remediations of women's manuscripts contribute, paradoxically, both to their hypermediacy (those elements that remind users they are not faced with a manuscript) and their immediacy (those aspects that hide the remediation and encourage users not to reflect on the medium). We showcase the range of scholarly engagement possible through a variety of sites, including British Literary Manuscripts Online, Perdita Manuscripts, and Jane Austen's Fiction Manuscripts. Analyzing these resources demonstrates how they can best be used by teachers and scholars. By evaluating digital remediations of women's manuscripts, we highlight best practices for manuscript digitization and point to new directions for digital projects and literary study. Dans ce chapitre, nous evaluons comment les projets numeriques qui presentent les manuscrits des femmes (vers 1550-1900) peuvent aider la recherche en litterature, en histoire et en etudes culturelles. Nous soutenons que les meilleures remediations numeriques de manuscrits de femmes contribuent paradoxalement a la fois a leur hypermedialite (ces elements qui rappellent a l’utilisateur qu’il n’est pas confronte a un manuscrit) et leur instantaneite (ces aspects qui dissimulent la remediation et encouragent l’utilisateur a ne pas songer au medium).

Considered in this engagement are: the important (and profitably-elusive) process of defining digital humanities; foundational notions of the methodological commons and communities of practice, and the ways in which they originate, are fostered, are engaged, and themselves engage; and the value of an open approach to current and future work on modeling humanistic data and process, in ways that build on these foundations to embrace the communities and constituencies served by the humanities.    Ce texte, qui aborde un contexte plus large des tendances qui faconnent et influencent le changement dans les sciences humaines et les cultures de l'universite, suit le discours du prix Antonio Zampolli donne le 2 juillet 2014 a l'universite de Lausanne, qui explorait et encourageait le role positif des sciences humaines numeriques dans le processus de l'auto-determination numerique des sciences humaines dans le monde numerique. Nous avons considere dans cet engagement : le processus important (et incertain au niveau de la rentabilite) qui consiste a definir les sciences humaines numeriques; les notions fondamentales d'elements communs en methodologie et en communautes de pratique, et les moyens par lesquels ils proviennent, ils sont favorises et prises et sont eux-memes invitants; et la valeur d'une approche ouverte envers le travail actuel et futur sur la modelisation des donnees et du processus humanistes, de facon a s'appuyer sur ces fondements pour accueillir favorablement les communautes et les secteurs desservis par les sciences humaines.","",""
"2016","A Window Toward the Medium: A Media Specific Analysis of Chemical Landscapes Digital Tales","Reading a work of digital fiction can be a challenging experience for anyone who is approaching it from a print-oriented stance. Paying particular attention to the materiality of the medium in which the work is presented can be a useful tool and this is what N. Katherine Hayles has emphasized upon by coining the phrase Media-Specific Analysis. This approach to texts, as its name states, is based on exploring the materiality of the medium in which the work is instantiated as an active component in the signifying process. The case study chosen for this paper, Chemical landscapes digital tales (2006) by Edward Falco, brings its materiality into the foreground and makes it an essential part of the reading process. In order to devise a working method for the media-specific analysis of this work (and other works of web-fiction) three different but interrelated dimensions of the text—physical organization and design, narrative strategy, and reading process—will be analyzed in this paper.    La lecture d'une œuvre de fiction numerique peut s'averer une experience stimulante pour quiconque l'aborde selon une optique d'impression. Il peut etre utile de preter une attention particuliere au caractere substantiel du medium dans lequel l'œuvre est presentee et c'est sur ce point que N. Katherine Hayles a mis l'emphase en inventant l'expression Analyse Specifique aux Medias (Media-Specific Analysis). Cette maniere d'aborder les textes, comme son nom l'indique, est basee sur l'exploration du caractere substantiel du medium dans lequel l'ouvrage est instancie comme une composante active du processus de signification. L'etude de cas choisie pour cet article, Chemical landscapes digital tales (2006) de Edward Falco, ramene son importance au premier plan et en fait une partie essentielle du processus de lecture. Afin d'elaborer une methode de travail pour l'analyse specifique aux medias de cet ouvrage (et d'autres ouvrages de fiction web), cet article analysera trois dimensions de ce texte a la fois differentes et reliees entre elles, c'est-a-dire l'organisation et la conception physique, la strategie narrative et le processus de lecture.","",""
"2016","The surprising ascendance of Digital Humanities: And some suggestions for an uncertain future","In recent years, every measure of significant change from research to academic programming and hiring indicates that Digital Humanities (DH) has moved from nascent to significant on the higher education landscape. But is the future of DH bright? In addressing this question, the goal of this paper is three-fold: to stimulate further historical research on the emergence and development of DH; to provoke further critical analysis of current activities and initiatives; and to help cultivate creative thinking about how we can work together to ensure the ability of digitally-enabled scholarship to enhance knowledge and understanding of human expression and action. With examples primarily from what began as History and Computing as well as other text-based Humanities fields, this discussion does not seek to capture the diversity of developments across the Humanities. Rather, it attempts to build on pioneering efforts by Susan Hockey, John Bonnett, Kevin Kee, Ian Milligan and others to examine the multi-faceted activities that, in hindsight, we are beginning to connect within a nascent narrative of DH's history. While this paper offers only select contributions in the pursuit of this goal, the hope is that greater attention to the surprising features of the past will better emphasize their enduring and changing importance for DH's uncertain future. En 2015, toutes les mesures de changements importants, de la recherche aux programmes d'etudes et d'embauche, indique que les humanites numeriques sont passees de naissantes a importantes dans le paysage de l'enseignement superieur. Mais est-ce que l'avenir des humanites numeriques est prometteur? Pour aborder cette question, le but de cet expose est triple : stimuler une recherche historique plus poussee sur l'emergence et le developpement des humanites numeriques, provoquer une analyse critique plus poussee des activites et initiatives actuelles, et aider a cultiver la pensee creative pour tenter de decouvrir comment nous pouvons travailler ensemble pour assurer la capacite des erudits qui maitrisent l'instrument numerique a rehausser les connaissances et la comprehension de l'expression et de l'action humaine. Principalement au moyen d'exemples de ce qui a commence comme « histoire et informatique » ainsi que d'autre champs des humanites axes sur le texte, cette discussion ne cherche pas a saisir la diversite des developpements a travers les humanites. Elle tente plutot de tirer parti des efforts de pionniers comme Susan Hockey, John Bonnett, Kevin Kee, Ian Milligan et d'autres personnes pour examiner les activites a multiples facettes que, avec le recul, nous commencons a raccorder au sein d'un recit naissant de l'histoire des humanites numeriques. Bien que cet expose n'offre que des contributions choisies dans la poursuite de cet objectif, nous esperons qu'une plus grande attention aux caracteristiques surprenantes du passe permettra de mieux mettre en valeur leur importance durable et changeante pour l'avenir incertain des humanites numeriques.","",""

"2016","Exploring Citation Networks to Study Intertextuality in Classics","Referring constitutes such an essential scholarly activity across disciplines that it has been regarded by [Unsworth 2000] as one of the scholarly primitives. In Classics, in particular, the references to passages of the ancient texts - the so-called canonical citations (or references) - play a prominent role. The potential of these citations, however, has not been fully exploited to date, despite the attention that they have recently received in the field of Digital Humanities. In this paper I discuss two aspects of making such citations computable. Firstly, I illustrate how they can be extracted from text by using Natural Language Processing techniques, especially Named Entity Recognition. Secondly, I discuss the creation of a three-level citation network to formalise the web of relations between texts that canonical references implicitly constitute. As I outline in the conclusive section of this paper, the possible uses of the extracted citation network include the development of search applications and recommender systems for bibliography; the enhancement of digital environments to read primary sources with links to related secondary literature; and the application of these network to the study of intertextuality and text reception.","",""

"2016","It is time to address the Public Communication of DH.","This introduction addresses two facets of the communication of Digital Humanities (DH) that have framed this special edition of DHQ. I begin by discussing a number of articles about  that have relatively recently appeared  mainstream newspapers. I then observe that a number of these articles not only show an impoverished understanding of the field’s frame of reference but also misrepresent various aspects of it, for example, its interrelationship with the Humanities. Given that many academic publications on the question  is DH? have appeared  recent years, yet  is, nonetheless, misrepresented  this way, I propose that the field must look again at the communication of its activities in the round. Now that  is arguably moving from the margins to the mainstream I propose that the time has come to address what we might call the Public Communication of DH so that we can better communicate to the general public and academics working  other disciplines what it is that we do. As the nature of DH’s relationship to the Humanities is one that is frequently misrepresented  the mainstream media I propose that this would be an important area for endeavours  the Public Communication of DH to address and explore as early as possible. The articles included  this special edition enrich and expand ongoing conversations about the nature of this relationship. In doing so they make available a wealth of case studies, arguments and insights that can,  due course, be drawn on to further the Public Communication of DH.","",""

Websites and digitized text uploaded on them are retrieved via algorithms, tied together by links, and so on, whereas physical libraries are structured by classification schemes, catalogs, and indexes.

"2017","Connecting the dots: Integrating modular networks and narrativity in digital scholarship","Lev Manovich posits that new media and the World Wide Web are modular or layered in nature, similar to structural computer programming in that their distinct elements are combinative while retaining independence. Modular structures and systems (such as Lego, mobile apps, computer software, and even language itself) exchange precision, specific connectivity, narrative stability, and a focus on progressive products for flexibility, general compatibility, adaptiveness and a focus on aggregative processes. These attributes are well suited for new knowledge environments: Peter Schillingsburg sees modularity at the heart of dynamic digital collaboration and Susan Brown (et al) liken the modularity of digital projects to the cumulative nature of academic periodicals but caution that such projects are still often judged “as if they were a book,” or by their apparent finishedness. While scholarly journal articles and monographs, as finished products of scholarly activity, are not often constructed to demonstrate modularity or to function as modular components in broader arenas of scholarly communication, they could be reimagined as such (beyond citation). This is something that the NewRadial environment encourages through its modular design and in the kinds of modular scholarly communication that it facilitates.    Lev Manovich soutient que les nouveaux medias et le World Wide Web sont de nature modulaire et superposee, semblable a la programmation informatique structurale, en ce sens que leurs elements distincts sont combinatoires tout en conservant leur independance. Les structures et les systemes modulaires (comme Lego, les applications mobiles, les logiciels, et meme le langage lui-meme) echangent une precision, une connectivite specifique, une stabilite narrative, et une attention aux produits progressifs en termes de flexibilite, de compatibilite generale, d'adaptabilite, et d'attention aux procedes agregatifs. Ces attributs sont bien adaptes aux nouveaux environnements de connaissances: Peter Schillingsburg voit la modularite au cœur de la collaboration numerique dynamique et Susan Brown et al. font un rapprochement entre la modularite des projets numeriques et la nature cumulative des revues universitaires, mais precise toutefois que ces projets sont souvent juges « comme s'ils etaient un livre », ou d'apres leur aspect fini apparent. Bien que les articles et les monographies de periodiques, comme produits finis de l'activite erudite, ne sont pas souvent edifies de facon a demontrer la modularite ou a fonctionner comme elements modulaires dans les arenes plus vastes de la communication erudite, ils pourraient etre re-imagines comme tels (au-dela de la citation). C'est un concept que l'environnement NewRadial encourage par l'entremise de sa conception modulaire et dans les types de communication erudite modulaire qu'il facilite.","",""

This model is designed to make the most use of the capacities of the digital medium and it stems from an understanding of the material repercussions of the migration from print to digital.

"2017","Digital Humanities and the Geopolitics of Knowledge","In this article I briefly discuss the connections between the geopolitical scenario emerging from the creation of the BRICS New Development Bank, and the digitization of languages and cultures carried out in a substantially Anglophone-driven economic and technological context. The appearance of the new BRICS bank, and especially the plan for an “independent Internet” are not only challenging the financial system, but in the long-run could also affect the current digital knowledge monopolies, activating new ways to encode and decode cultural objects, and challenge present digital standards. Digital Humanists, on all levels, are called upon to react to this developing geopolitical scenario, asking themselves questions about political representation and cultural diversity, encoding standards, digital infrastructures and linguistic hegemonies. An old equilibrium based on unequal power relationships is perhaps close to an end, and this is a unique time and opportunity to create a genuinely democratic and international scholarly community. Dans cet article, je discute brievement des liens entre le scenario geopolitique qui emerge de la creation de la nouvelle banque de developpement des pays du BRICS, et la numerisation des langues et des cultures realisee dans un contexte economique et technologique essentiellement anglophone. L’apparition de la nouvelle banque des BRICS et en particulier le projet d’un « internet independant », remet en question non seulement le systeme financier, mais a long terme pourrait aussi toucher les monopoles de connaissances numeriques actuelles, en mettant en oeuvre de nouveaux moyens d’encoder de decoder les objets culturels, et remettre en cause les normes numeriques actuelles.

This paper uses a digitization project underway at the Marie-Victorin Herbarium to explore the learning process of adult volunteers and show how scientific and digital literacies are constructed simultaneously and socially. In the process of digitizing the Herbarium’s collection, volunteers draw on existing resources, including digital tools and sources, as well as create and share their own intermediary resources, thereby facilitating future work and enhancing informal learning. Individual goals — such as acquiring new skills or extending knowledge — are connected to the goals of the community — the production of a quality reference that will be available to everyone online.

"2017","Vanishing letters in text-based digital installations","New media shaped textuality, narrative, codeworks and digital poetry are deployed in electronic literature as a practice situated in Internet and post-Internet arts. E-literature embedded in online venues has outgrown a hyperfiction phase and become conceptual. Instead of hyperlink-based storytelling, it has begun dealing with itself, becoming e-literature after the end of e-literature-as-we-know it, aligning with contemporary art, science, philosophy, economy and politics. Entering the “after the end” phase is of essential importance for a particular field. In its conceptual phase, e-literature addresses its fundamental principles, investigates the limitations of digital media, Internet, language, narrative, text, sign and code. Its projects are laboratories for playing with different hypotheses. However, the reflection on the technology that generates it and the experience stimulated by its projects significantly contribute to an understanding of e-literature. This paper is focused on the second experience as defined according to Benjamin’s concept of the second technology, a playful experience enabled through technology. Based on play, the second experience promotes exploration and blurring boundaries, which in the case of digital textuality means dealing with a vanishing text which is only conditionally legible and whose existence is limited to a particular time.","",""
"2017","GIS and literary history:advancing digital humanities research through the spatial analysis of historical travel writing and topographical literature","Exploratory studies have demonstrated the benefits of implementing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology in literary and cultural-historical research. These studies have done much to affirm the power and flexibility of GIS technology as a resource for humanities scholarship. At the same time, however, these studies share a common limitation in that they tend to rely on the analysis of point-based cartographic representations. Such representations are suitable for modelling quantitative geographical phenomena, but they are inadequate for modelling qualitative human phenomena. This inadequacy constitutes a significant problem for researchers who aspire to analyse the geographical experiences and spatial relationships represented in works of literature, including works that contain accounts of travel. The present article proposes a solution to this problem by demonstrating how advanced spatial analyses within GIS such as Cost-Surface Analysis (CSA) and Least-Cost-Path Analysis (LCP) can be used to facilitate more nuanced interpretations of historical works of travel writing and topographical literature. Specifically, the article explains how GIS, CSA and LCP can be combined to build coherent spatial models of the journeys recorded in the works of three canonical eighteenth-century British travellers, each of whom composed influential accounts of their travels through the English Lake District: the poet Thomas Gray (1716–1771), the naturalist Thomas Pennant (1726–1798) and the agriculturist Arthur Young (1741–1820).","",""

"2017","The Digital Classicist: building a Digital Humanities Community","There has been much discussion about digital humanities (DH) both as a discipline and as a community of practice. Whatever the balance of opinion, the emergence of digital scholarship in the humanities has undoubtedly had considerable impact on many disciplines; one such discipline is Classics and the study of the ancient world more generally. This article uses the Digital Classicist (DC) as an example of a DH community in a case study which traces its development and growth to examine what might be learned. As a community the DC joins together practitioners interested in the application of innovative digital methods and technology to the study of the ancient world (in its widest sense). How has this come about and perhaps more importantly, how has it been sustained and indeed provided the inspiration for other affiliated communities? What do we understand by a community and the association of individual practitioners separated by distance? It is important that members feel that they are stakeholders, that they have a sense of ownership and derive value from participation and contribution. It is argued here that a community could be seen as a symbolic and intellectual construct, one of perception rather than physicality to facilitate the exchange of ideas and so effect growth and strengthen the discipline.","",""

The Colloquium has grown in recent years, to the point where it is now seen as an important part of the field’s conference calendar for emerging and established scholars alike, but it remains a non-threatening space in which students, scholars, and practitioners can share their ideas. This issue is testament to that diversity, as well as the strength of the research being presented at the Colloquium. It includes Scott B. Weingart and Nickoal Eichmann-Kalwara, Mary Borgo, William B. Kurtz, and John Barber. “What’s Under the Big Tent?: A Study of ADHO Conference Abstracts,” which portrays the discipline as one which is dominated by specific groups and practices. Using the Victorian Women Writers Project as a case-study, Mary Borgo treats models for the sustainable growth of TEI-based digital resources. William B. Kurtz details his experiences working on a digital initiative, in this instance, Founders Online: Early Access, and engages with the need for such projects to hold broader public appeal. John Barber’s “Radio Nouspace: Sound, Radio, Digital Humanities,” describes the curation of sound within the context of radio, and how such activity connects to creative digital scholarship. Together, these articles represent the purpose of facilitating a community comprised of divergent interests and perspectives, a community which can often be positively dissonant.

"2018","On the Value of Narratives in a Reflexive Digital Humanities","This paper returns to the relationship of “narrative versus database” (an argument originally made by Lev Manovich in 2001) as one that can be further addressed. A specific issue persists in text analysis research in the digital humanities: the difficulty of representing the figurative meaning of narratives through digital tools. Towards an accommodation, this paper adopts a narratological framework in order to propose alternative models of content management and organization that more closely resemble figurative meaning making in human language. These alternative models therefore better allow for the computational representation of figurative elements that N. Katherine Hayles describes as “the inexplicable, the unspeakable, the ineffable” of narrative literature. This paper argues that the construction of figurative meaning through paradigmatic substitution (as part of an imaginary vocabulary that is drawn from in the process of meaning making) is difficult to account for in the relational database—arguably still the most culturally prominent database model. By focusing on NoSQL (“no” or “not only” Structured Query Language) databases, this paper explores how layers of figurative meaning can be represented together through these flexible and non-relational models. In particular, the ability of non-relational databases to group together multiple values—encouraging their association, comparison, and juxtaposition—can be analyzed as a computational albeit imprecise counterpart to the formation of paradigmatic and figurative meaning. Thus, towards accounting for a word, image, or idea’s layers of meaning as expressed in literature, this paper offers a study of the limitations of digital tools and their critical negotiation with humanities research and reflection.","",""
"2018","From erasure poetry to e-mash-ups, “reel on/ another! power!”"," This article builds on an analysis of Sea and Spar Between by Nick Montfort and Stephanie Strickland and Tree of Codes by Jonathan Safran Foer to examine print and digital forms of writing through resonance, replication, and repetition. It explores the plastic and textual space of the page and screen and focuses more specifically on the composition of fragments and the way they can be apprehended by readers. Conversely, digital borrowing is not a mechanical process of self-identical recurrence, and like its print counterpart, it is a gesture of differenciation and a play of singularities (Deleuze). In investigating the entanglement of a work with a source text, this article also explores how creative gestures initiate a “floating” space as theorized by Jean-François Lyotard, that is, a space at once rigid and flexible where the reader is both bound and floating.

Situating the work in the contexts of Irish public literature and of public electronic literature, this paper explores both the work itself and issues of public electronic literature and in the process both divulges little known Irish American histories and suggests the potential for the public literature telling of narrative and poetry on the Internet.

"2018","Movable text"," During the early adoption of e-books, this unfamiliar digital format was made more palatable through analogy to the printed book. Texts were divided into ‘pages’ that could turn on screen, and e-book repositories were referred to as ‘libraries’. However, as digital texts have increasingly taken on characteristics of digital systems, the metaphor of the printed book has lost currency. Given the limitations of this conventional metaphor for the digital text, I propose an alternative conception, one that is as archaic in origin as the printed-book metaphor, yet surprisingly robust for describing the customizable texts of today’s Academy: the metaphor of movable text. The image derives from German printer Johannes Gutenberg’s 15th-century innovation for the mass production of books, a mechanical system that used paper, ink and the relatively cheap and reusable display of cubed, metal letters that could be arranged and rearranged into words on a tray ready to be pressed into print. This metaphor of book-as-movable text is useful in that it captures how the form of the academic textbook is now entangled with its process, as much as its context. But, how does this metaphor apply to the academic text in particular? If a movable academic book asks to be interpreted, does the mobility of meaning that it creates defy such interpretative engagement? In this article, I argue that when automated texts are effectively scaffolded by cultural critiques, they can support deep research processes. To become more effective, these searches demand focus as much as evaluation and thus drive towards the crafts of collation, synthesis and eventual reconfiguration. ","",""

"2018","Literacy and training in digital research: Researchers’ views in five social science and humanities disciplines"," This article examines the views of researchers in five social science and humanities disciplines on their digital literacy and the training they need or have undertaken. Theoretically, this article draws upon two competing conceptualisations of digital literacy: digital literacy as ‘user skills’ and digital literacy as ‘user–technology interactivity’. Empirically, it suggests that social science and humanities researchers’ understandings and evaluations of their digital literacy unfold at two levels – the factual and the perceptual – and involve not only (technical) skills but also user experiences, emotions and complex processes of learning, practising and self-development when interacting with technology. Furthermore, researchers challenge the value of generic institutional training for literacy enhancement and envision the development of informal communities of experience exchange and knowledge-sharing across the research community. These findings lead to recommendations on training provision and support the conceptualisation of digital literacy as a process where user interactivity with technology results in certain experiences, reflections and lessons, rather than merely reflecting users’ technical skills.

"2018","Digital ethnography: Principles and practice","scholars who do not wish to compromise on theoretical features and analytical tools. Menzel presents a very careful and thoughtful comparison of ellipsis in cohesive ties in an English-German corpus. She notes the difficulty in finding comparable text types and results and notes the need to manually transcribe spoken data. Shagalov and Fine work through clinical interviews of speakers with schizophrenia and mania, annotate and analyze the corpus using the UAM CorpusTool, and develop 46 linguistic variables to determine the “best subset” of combinations of variables which can more accurately classify the language of speakers with schizophrenia or mania. The importance of this kind of work for clinical diagnosis is made clear. Perhaps due to the large number of chapters (21 including the introduction) and likely constraints on space, some chapters lacked detailed analyses and discussions. Nevertheless, as a whole, the volume will appeal to a wide range of researchers in discourse analysis due to the variety in content, computational methodologies, and corpus tools. There is also a fairly broad spectrum of SFL concepts and analytical levels and frameworks covered, including lexicogrammar, register, method of development, multimodality, genre, appraisal, and cohesion. One area of work that might have been included, however, is O’Halloran’s (2015) work on “multimodal digital humanities.” For those new to SFL theory, most chapters do not require too much background in the theory. A theme particularly evident in the latter part of the volume is that there remain challenges in developing and adapting computational linguistic tools to text analysis from an SFL perspective because of the multifunctional nature of the lexicogrammar and the meaning-based focus of the theory.","",""

"2019","Illuminating Systemic Functional Grammatics (Theory) as a Viable Tool of Digital Humanities","The focus of the study is the application of Systemic Functional Grammatics (SFG) to text as a facility of meaning-making. Having provided a wide room for technological devices to read and account for elements of a text, it portrays the exercise within the scope of Digital Humanities (DH). The theory, championed by Halliday, describes a text from its systemic configurations to chain structures and social relationship frameworks. To explain the weight of SFG as an interface between text and technology, the author chose a poem, ‘Area Boy’, in which three perspectives of the mood system, thematic system, and transitivity system are instrumental to expose its nuances. The approach was followed by correlating the three systems together as a comparative analysis. The study reveals that ‘Area Boy’ operates in declarative clauses with heavy utilization of Subject and Finite. These are organized in marked themes. The contents of the text are represented in material processes (e.g. spent) with supports from both mental (e.g. remember) and verbal (e.g. said) processes. Some of the processes along with circumstances (e.g. Of washing …, Now that …) recur as repetitions for emphatic and enhancement purposes. On the one hand, the article concludes that SFG can assist in interpreting textual elements to generate meaning potential. On the other hand, through the SFG’s metafunctional applications to ‘Area Boy’, one can suggest that the society should give a helping hand to the less privileged. Such a behavior can eradicate vices experienced through the ‘Area Boys’ from the society. Cette etude se focalise sur l’application de la grammaire fonctionnelle systemique (GFS) a des textes comme moyen de facilitation de la creation de sens. Ayant pourvu une large marge pour des dispositifs technologiques pour lire et justifier des elements d’un texte, cette etude presente la mise en pratique dans le cadre des Humanites numeriques (HN). Cette theorie, promue par Halliday, decrit un texte, de ses configurations systemiques a ses structures de la chaine et structures des relations sociales. Pour expliquer la signification de GFS comme interface entre texte et technologie, cet auteur se sert du poeme « Area Boy », ou trois perspectives du systeme de mode, du systeme thematique et du systeme de transitivite ont des roles determinants dans l’exposition des nuances de GFS. Nous avons ensuite fait une analyse comparative en correlant les trois systemes ensemble. Cette etude revele que « Area Boy » fonctionne en des propositions declaratives avec une utilisation intensive du Sujet et du Fini. Elles sont organisees en themes indiques. Les contextes du texte sont representes par des processus materiaux (par exemple, spent) avec des soutiens des processus mentaux (par exemple, remember) et verbaux (par exemple, said). Certains des processus, ainsi que des circonstances (par exemple, Of washing…, Now that…), se reproduisent en tant que repetitions pour des raisons emphatiques et appuyees. D’un cote, cet article affirme que GFS peut aider a l’interpretation des elements textuels pour produire du potentiel de signification. De l’autre cote, a travers des applications metafonctionnelles de GFS a « Area Boy », on peut suggerer que la societe doit donner un coup de main aux moins privilegies.

"2019","Le positionnement éditorial dans l’édition critique numérique","Critical editing is a practice whose contours have been well established by the philological tradition. The different critical conventions are well known and have been subject to a myriad of scientific studies. Nevertheless, critical edition has been undergoing changes since the development of new technologies. Digital critical editions have multiplied and today represent a large and varied panel. As a consequence, it’s worth observing, beyond technological innovations, what digital editing brings in terms of methodology and publishing conceptualisation. Obviously, in digital editions as in traditional editions, the final goal is offering readers a text that they will be able to consult and use in their research: the edited text should be a stable one, that can be an authoritative resource. The uniqueness of digital edition’s design, however, requires editors to reflect, right from the start of the publication process, on the information that they are going to provide, as well as on the way in which they will be presenting it. From the very beginning of its development, digital editing entails, then, a true awareness of how it will be received. It permits, also, a significant diversification of information presented in editions. It ultimately distinguishes itself with its open nature: digital editing is open in terms of content evolution over time just as it is in terms of collaborative editing. Resume L’edition critique est une pratique dont les contours ont ete bien etablis par la tradition philologique. Les differents courants critiques sont bien connus et ont fait l’objet de nombreuses etudes scientifiques. Cependant, depuis le developpement des nouvelles technologies, l’edition critique est en pleine mutation. Les editions critiques numeriques se sont multipliees et constituent aujourd’hui un panel large et varie.

We understand these prototypes as experiments within our research through design process, rather than as stand-alone digital objects, and so this article presents the theoretical pursuits and design decisions that motivated, and were motivated by, these prototypes. We begin by establishing our theoretical framework, which focuses on the roles of inscription technologies in archives and is guided by Bruno Latour’s concept of a mediator (1993). We then discuss scrapbooks as polyvocal and hybrid mediators, which are nonetheless often pushed to the fringes of reading practices and material histories. In unpacking the fringe status of the Morgan scrapbooks in particular, we outline the copyright restrictions that complicate their digital publication. Reconceptualizing these restrictions as creative constraints, our prototypes experiment with forms of representation that go beyond the facsimile, drawing on detailed metadata and generating new visualizations that are inspired by the scrapbooks’ materially-specific grammars. Our aim with these prototypes is to open the scrapbooks to new forms of play and discoverability in online contexts, while using digital tools and methodologies to better understand the scrapbooks’ multifaceted modes of meaning creation. We conclude by discussing some of our prototypes’ limitations, as well as future directions for our research through design process for the Morgan Scrapbooks.","",""
"2019","Decolonizing International Research Groups: Prototyping a Digital Audio Repository from South to North","This article reflects on what it means to create a digital humanities (DH) project in the “Global South,” while it ponders some lessons it can offer to DH practitioners across the world, particularly from English-speaking academia. As a case study it considers the Digital Audio Repository for Latin American Sound Art and Poetry an initiative coordinated by PoeticaSonora, a research group formed by faculty members and students from Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM, Mexico City) and Concordia University (Montreal). The prototyping process has brought out some reflections on the correlation between access and participation through information and communication technologies (here termed “knowledge democratization”), in order to expound PoeticaSonora’s theoretical-political positioning, drawing not only from decolonial thinkers and their critics but also from feminist, new materialist, and border studies on technology, art, and society. Then it discusses how the coloniality of knowledge pervades the international distribution of labour in the digital world and academic milieus, particularly through what Leanne Simpson calls “cognitive extractivism.” After proposing some strategies to avoid an extractivist workflow while designing a DH project, it finishes by offering three insightful lessons learned from the PoeticaSonora prototype: online access does not equal universal access; well-intended digital projects are not beneficial per se for the target community; and we must bring back to discussion the political dimension of digital labor and the social practices around it. Cet article se concentre sur la signification de la creation d’un projet d’humanites numeriques (HN) dans les « pays du Sud », tout en reflechissant a des lecons qu’un tel projet peut offrir aux universitaires de HN du monde, en particulier a ceux du milieu academique anglophone.

"2019","How to Extract Good Knowledge from Bad Data: An Experiment with Eighteenth Century French Texts","From a digital historian’s point of view, Ancien Regime French texts suffer from obsolete grammar, unreliable spelling, and poor optical character recognition, which makes these texts ill-suited to digital analysis. This paper summarizes methodological experiments that have allowed the author to extract useful quantitative data from such unlikely source material. A discussion of the general characteristics of hand-keyed and OCR’ed historical corpora shows that they differ in scale of difficulty rather than in nature. Behavioural traits that make text mining certain eighteenth century corpora particularly challenging, such as error clustering, a relatively high cost of acquisition relative to salience, outlier hiding, and unpredictable patterns of error repetition, are then explained. The paper then outlines a method that circumvents these challenges. This method relies on heuristic formulation of research questions during an initial phase of open-ended data exploration; selective correction of spelling and OCR errors, through application of Levenshtein’s algorithm, that focuses on a small set of keywords derived from the heuristic project design; and careful exploitation of the keywords and the corrected corpus, either as raw data for algorithms, as entry points from which to construct valuable data manually, or as focal points directing the scholar’s attention to a small subset of texts to read. Each step of the method is illustrated by examples drawn from the author’s research on the hand-keyed Encyclopedie and Bibliotheque Bleue and on collections of periodicals obtained through optical character recognition. Du point de vue d’un historien numerique, les textes francais d’Ancien Regime souffrent d’une grammaire obsolete, d’une orthographe irreguliere et d’une reconnaissance optique des caracteres de faible qualite.

The means have certainly changed, but these striking changes have also influenced the methods and meaning of writing, the concepts of writer and reader, and the methods of access, the tools and methods of distributing texts, images, sounds, etc. Literature has played a major role in the development of cultural domains; it still holds a prominent place, perhaps even more so today, as our current context is greatly associated to the predominance of the textual form. The explosion of data and the transformation of knowledge, both in terms of the quality of available information and the manner of representing it, have furthermore had a considerable impact on human and social sciences research. This special issue, which brings texts together from presentations made at the 2015 Digital Humanities colloquium at Concordia University, offers an overview of current trends in theory and practice observed in the digital humanities domain in French, more specifically in the sphere of production and distribution of knowledge in the human and social sciences.

DPN is an informal interdisciplinary training network formed to foster the transfer of Digital Humanities (DH) knowledge and skills and to build connections between Simon Fraser University (SFU) and University of Victoria (UVic) faculty, students, librarians, educational partners, and the public. Central to the network has been the participation and experience of students, who have shared their digitally-focused work in a series of showcases and symposia that have alternated between SFU and UVic. What emerged during these events were student perspectives on current pedagogical practices in Digital Humanities, both inside and outside the classroom, as well as for the degree and beyond. Our special collection builds on these perspectives, featuring student authors addressing issues that over the past five years have been central to their DH learning and training. These student perspectives gather into four topic clusters, namely 1) Collaboration with Galleries, Libraries, Archives, & Museums (GLAM); 2) Digital Doctorates; 3) Major Research Projects; and 4) Transforming DH Pedagogy.

"2020","Listening at a Distance: Reading the Sound World of Gothic Literature with Topic Modeling and Text Analysis","Traditionally text-focused digital humanities tools can assist in sound studies research by revealing patterns in how sound is described in historical text. When combined with close reading, these patterns facilitate insight into how sound was interpreted and communicated in time periods for which no sound recording technology existed. This article centers on the literary works of gothic author Ann Radcliffe (1764–1823), whose texts have been recognized for their inclusion of rich descriptions of sound. I examine the results of text analysis and topic modeling performed on Radcliffe’s corpus in the context of how contemporaneous aestheticians understood and wrote about sound. The results reveal that Radcliffe’s sonic language encompasses a comprehensive and calculated narrative use of sound, which reflects an understanding of theories on obscurity, sublime terror, and associationism put forward by aestheticians during her time. On a larger level, this article illustrates the mutual value that stems from integrating digital humanities and sound studies research: analyzing sonic language expands the types of questions to which visually oriented digital humanities tools can be applied, and digital tools aid in excavating otherwise silent sound worlds of the past. Resume Les outils des humanites numeriques qui sont traditionnellement focalises sur les textes peuvent aider dans la recherche des sons en devoilant des modeles concernant la facon dont le son est decrit dans des textes historiques. Une fois combines avec la lecture attentive, ces modeles facilitent des apercus de la maniere dont le son a ete interprete et communique pendant des epoques ou aucune technologie d’enregistrement sonore n’existait. Cet article se concentre sur les oeuvres litteraires de l’auteure Ann Radcliffe (1764–1823), dont les textes sont connus pour l’inclusion de descriptions riches du son. J’examine les resultats d’analyses de textes, ainsi que ceux des modelisations thematiques realisees sur le corpus de Radcliffe, en prenant en compte l’interpretation et le traitement des sons d’estheticiens contemporains. Les resultats indiquent que le langage sonique de Radcliffe inclut l’usage narratif etendu et calcule d’un langage sonique qui reflete une interpretation theorique de l’obscurite, de la peur sublime et de l’associationnisme que les estheticiens avancaient a l’epoque. A plus grande echelle, cet article presente la valeur mutuelle qui se produit grâce a l’integration des humanites numeriques et de la recherche des etudes de son : analyser le langage sonique enrichit les types de questions auxquelles les outils axes sur les aspects visuels des humanites numeriques peuvent s’appliquer, et les outils numeriques aident a extraire du passe des mondes sonores, qui seraient autrement silencieux.

"2020","Why Map Literature? Geospatial Prototyping for Literary Studies and Digital Humanities","By focusing on the process of building A Map of Paradise Lost—a geospatial humanities text-to-map project that visualizes the locatable places in John Milton’s Paradise Lost— this paper addresses the question “why map literature?” and demonstrates how the process of research prototyping is in itself a form of knowledge production. Through a series of prototyping moments, we address how the different steps involved in building a geospatial humanities project can produce new knowledge about the fields it relates to: literary studies and digital humanities. The prototyping moments make arguments that advance our understanding of Milton’s Paradise Lost, approaches to data visualization for cartographic comparison in and beyond DH, and models for interdisciplinary collaboration. Resume En se concentrant sur le processus de construction d’une Carte du Paradis Perdu – un projet d’humanites geospatiales qui visualise, dans une carte a partir du texte, les places localisables dans le Paradis Perdu de John Milton – cet article aborde la question «pourquoi une litterature cartographique?» et demontre comment le processus de prototypage de recherche est en soi une forme de production de connaissances. A travers une serie de moments de prototypage, nous abordons comment les differentes etapes impliquees dans la construction d’un projet d’humanites geospatiales peuvent produire de nouvelles connaissances concernant les domaines relatifs a ce sujet: etudes litteraires et humanites digitales. Les moments de prototypage presentent des arguments qui ameliorent notre comprehension du Paradis Perdu de Milton, des approches de visualisation des donnees pour une comparaison cartographique «a l’interieur» et «au-dela» des humanites digitales ainsi que des modeles pour une collaboration interdisciplinaire.

"2020","Deference to Paper: Textuality, Materiality, and Literary Digital Humanities in Africa","This article explores the relationship between the forms of representation and the modes of production of African online writing, rendering visible an appreciation of the digital contexts that have occasioned new experimentations with regard to genre, style and the formation of digital publics. But it’s the bibliographic form and materiality of African digital texts that interest me the most. The medium of African literature, profoundly transformed since the arrival of the Internet, conditions the transmission, reception of meaning and the constitution of reading publics and the identity of audiences. More so, the new textual environment of African writing and creatives expressions such as digital networks and literary blogs are terrains of discursive contestations that activate these digital fields of cultural production in Africa as materially connected to prior literary forms. Deploying several examples, including the recent ‘transition’ of Saraba Magazine to print and Mike Maphoto’s Diary of a Zulu Girl, I argue that, despite the widespread uses of digital media forms in new African narratives, there is a lingering print imaginary in the digital articulations of African literary texts. While this tension between print and digital forms shapes textual meanings, it signals new directions in African literary studies more broadly. Resume Cet article explore la relation entre les formes de representation et les modes de production de l’ecriture africaine en ligne, en rendant visible une appreciation des contextes numeriques qui facilitent de nouvelles experimentations en ce qui concerne le genre, le style et la formation des publics numeriques. C’est pourtant la forme bibliographique et la materialite des textes africains numeriques qui m’interessent le plus.

En me servant des exemples de la « transition » recente vers la presse ecrite de la Saraba Magazine et le Journal d’une fille Zulu par Nkululeko Maphoto, j’argumente que, malgre les usages repandus des formes numeriques de media dans de nouvelles narrations africaines, il existe une anxiete persistante imaginaire ou archiviste dans les articulations numeriques de textes litteraires africains. Pendant que cette tension entre les formes imprimees et numeriques faconnent les sens textuels, cela indique plus generalement de nouvelles directions dans les etudes litteraires africaines.

"2020","The Digital Humanities in Ireland","If the digital humanities are to thrive they must be allowed to remain culturally dissonant. The ways in which DH is practiced will differ across national contexts, with each region having peculiarities representative of the culture-specific conditions which shaped the field as it first emerged and later developed. While scholars tend to belong and contribute to international communities of praxis, doing DH in one place might look very different to doing DH somewhere else. Disciplinary cultures are often transnational, but where scholars are trained and where they work will usually impact upon their own, individualised perspective of that discipline. This paper traces the history of the digital humanities in Ireland, providing on account of DH as it exists in a specifically Irish context. It mimics the Busa narrative, uncovering equivalent figures from Irish DH’s origin story, while detailing some of the key initiatives and institutions to have contributed to the national development of the discipline. As a small island with a close-knit academic community, culturally torn between US, British and European influences, Ireland represents an opportunity to examine DH as a national project, and how such a project might be contrasted with international norms, what it achieved, and where it has failed. Resume Si les humanites numeriques doivent prosperer, il faudra leur permettre de rester culturellement dissonantes. Les facons dont l’on pratique les HN varieront et dependront de contextes nationaux, ou chaque region a des particularites qui representent leurs propres situations culturelles qui ont faconne le domaine a son debut et ulterieurement. Tandis que les chercheurs ont tendance a contribuer et a faire partie de communautes internationales de praxis, les HN faites dans un endroit peuvent etre tres differentes par rapport a celles trouvees ailleurs. Les cultures disciplinaires sont souvent transnationales, mais le lieu ou les chercheurs ont ete formes et ou ils travaillent affectent normalement leur propre perspective individualisee de la discipline en question.

"2020","Absorbing DiRT: Tool Directories in the Digital Age","In the summer of 2017, Quinn Dombrowski, an IT staff member in UC Berkeley’s Research IT group, approached Geoffrey Rockwell about the possibility of merging the DiRT Directory with TAPoR, both popular tool discovery portals. Dombrowski could no longer offer the time commitment required to maintain the organizational structure of the volunteer-run tool directory (2018). This decommissioning of DiRT illustrates a set of problems in the digital humanities around tool directories and the tools within as academic contributions. Tool development, in general, is not considered sufficiently scholarly and often suffers from a lack of ongoing support (Ramsay & Rockwell, 2012). When tool discovery portals are no longer maintained due to a lack of ongoing funding, this leads to a loss of digital humanities knowledge and history. While volunteer-based directories require less outright funding, managing and motivating those volunteers to ensure that they remain actively involved in directory upkeep requires a vast amount work to ensure long-term sustainability (Dombrowski, 2018). This paper will explore the difficult history of tool discovery catalogues and portals and the steps being taken to save the DiRT Directory by integrating it into TAPoR. In particular, we will: – Provide a brief history of the attempts to catalogue tools for digital humanists starting with the first software catalogues, such as those circulated through societies, and ending with digital discovery portals, including DiRT Directory and TAPoR. – Discuss the challenges around the maintenance of discovery portals – Consider the design and metadata decisions made in the merging of DiRT Directory with TAPoR.","",""
"2020","How to Do Lexical Quality Estimation of a Large OCRed Historical Finnish Newspaper Collection with Scarce Resources","The National Library of Finland has digitized the historical newspapers published in Finland between 1771 and 1910. This collection contains approximately 1.95 million pages in Finnish and Swedish. Finnish part of the collection consists of about 2.40 billion words. The National Library's Digital Collections are offered via the this http URL web service, also known as Digi. Part of the newspaper material (from 1771 to 1874) is also available freely downloadable in The Language Bank of Finland provided by the FINCLARIN consortium. The collection can also be accessed through the Korp environment that has been developed by Sprakbanken at the University of Gothenburg and extended by FINCLARIN team at the University of Helsinki to provide concordances of text resources. A Cranfield style information retrieval test collection has also been produced out of a small part of the Digi newspaper material at the University of Tampere.  Quality of OCRed collections is an important topic in digital humanities, as it affects general usability and searchability of collections. There is no single available method to assess quality of large collections, but different methods can be used to approximate quality. This paper discusses different corpus analysis style methods to approximate overall lexical quality of the Finnish part of the Digi collection. Methods include usage of parallel samples and word error rates, usage of morphological analyzers, frequency analysis of words and comparisons to comparable edited lexical data. Our aim in the quality analysis is twofold: firstly to analyze the present state of the lexical data and secondly, to establish a set of assessment methods that build up a compact procedure for quality assessment after e.g. new OCRing or post correction of the material. In the discussion part of the paper we shall synthesize results of our different analyses.","",""
"2020","Continuous, not discrete: The mutual influence of digital and physical literature","The use of computational methods to develop innovative forms of storytelling and poetry has gained traction since the late 1980s. At the same time, legacy publishing has largely migrated to using digital workflows. Despite this possible convergence, the electronic literature community has generally defined their practice in opposition to print and traditional publishing practices more generally. Not only does this ignore a range of hybrid forms, but it also limits non-digital literature to print, rather than considering a range of physical literatures. In this article, I argue that it is more productive to consider physical and digital literature as convergent forms as both a historicizing process, and a way of identifying innovations. Case studies of William Gibson et al.’s Agrippa ( A Book of the Dead) and Christian Bök’s The Xenotext Project’s playful use of innovations in genetics demonstrate the productive tensions in the convergence between digital and physical literature.","",""
"2020","Discourse or gimmick? Digital marginalia in online scholarship"," Marginalia has been studied as discourse, as historical documentation and as evidence of reader response. As many academic texts are now available electronically, it seems a natural step to incorporate the interactive, social functions of the Web 2.0. Digital marginalia in an academic publishing context has been a largely unsuccessful venture to this date, yet there are several promising developments. Tools have emerged that enable readers annotate online texts in an approximation of paper-based marginalia, with the additional affordances of two- (or many-) way discourse, digital archiving, and the ability to hide the annotations. This article reviews the contemporary practices of digital marginalia, narrowing in to focus on digital marginalia as a form of academic discourse and peer review. I analyse several case studies of digital marginalia and discourse within this context, including Nature’s trial of open peer review, Wellcome Open Research, PLOS ONE and PubPeer’s systems, as well as my own experience using open peer review with Hypothes.is in a special ‘disrupted’ issue of the Journal of Media Practice. The article examines the relative success of these initiatives, attitudes toward open peer review and concludes with some promising developments for the future of digital marginalia and discourse in academic publishing.

Because visual resources make up a significant percentage of digital information, this paper focuses on the aforementioned concerns and proposes ways to address them, including swift progression and adoption of cohesive, multi-user, multilingual metadata standardization to improve digital access and to allow all descriptive image metadata to be approachable and translatable. We offer some recommendations such as those involved in visual resource management moving away from using primarily the English writing system based metadata schemas in order to provide flexible lexicon in non-Roman languages, which can easily be recognized and interpreted by both monolingual and multilingual users alike as well as facilitate digital metadata interoperability.","",""

In describing these projects, these essays reveal emerging models of digital pedagogy involving collaboration among students, faculty, and librarians.

"2021","Transcribing and Collating for Digital Stemmatology. The Case of Troilus and Criseyde","This paper explores the decisions involved in a digital stemmatology project. Traditionally, transcription, collation, and the creation of a stemma have been processes linked to the edition of texts. However, stemmatology on its own can provide valuable insight to further the understanding of literary works since it sheds light on their production process. The research on the textual tradition of Troilus and Criseyde offers the possibility to reconsider what are the difficulties and implications of a digital project of this sort. I focus particularly on transcription and collation. Transcription can be affected by aspects such as the availability of high-quality reproductions of manuscripts and early printed editions. Then, in order to produce useful transcriptions that serve the purpose of the project, the level of detail has to be established. It is important to find a balance between the overwhelmingly detailed and scarcity that could result in unfruitful transcripts. In regard to collation, which is the process of identifying variants, I mention the characteristics and purpose of a base-text. It is essential to understand what is a variant and how to work with them so that reliable stemmatta can be produced. Thus, I examine the case of two readings present in my research. By the end, I provide a brief example of how a phylogenetic tree can help us understand the distribution of variants and the relationships that the witnesses of Troilus and Criseyde bear. With that, I also hope that the usefulness of digital stemmatology is made evident. Resume Cet article explore les decisions prises dans un projet de stemmatologie numerique. Traditionnellement, la transcription, la collation et la creation d’un stemma etaient des processus lies a l’edition de textes. Cependant, la stemmatologie elle-meme peut fournir des informations precieuses qui contribuent a une meilleure comprehension d’œuvres litteraires, puisqu’elle eclaircit leur processus de production. La recherche sur la tradition textuelle de Troilus et Criseyde offre la possibilite de reexaminer les difficultes et les implications d’un projet numerique de ce genre. Je me concentre en particulier sur la transcription et la collation. La transcription peut etre affectee par des aspects tels que la disponibilite de reproductions de haute qualite de manuscrits et d’editions imprimees anciennes. Ensuite, pour produire des transcriptions utiles qui atteignent le but du projet, il faut etablir le niveau de details. Il est important de trouver l’equilibre entre des transcriptions massivement detaillees et celles qui sont peu detaillees pour eviter des resultats infructueux. En ce qui concerne la collation, le processus d’identifier des variantes, je mentionne les caracteristiques et buts d’un texte de base.

"2021","Towards Language Sensitivity and Diversity in the Digital Humanities","English Recent years have seen a growing focus on diversity in the digital humanities, and yet there has been rather less work on geolinguistic diversity, and the research which has been carried out often focuses on the structures of geographic representation in the field or has viewed ‘language’ as a technical or linguistic problem to solve. This article takes a different view, namely that we need to consider this diversity through multiple ‘frames’ of digitally-mediated language and culture, and that this is not just a question of epistemic justice or community manners, but that the digital humanities also need to address more actively challenges around global dynamics of digital multilingualism, transcultural exchange and geodiversity in its research agenda. This paper explores these questions through the prism of ‘language indifference’ in digital studies and, responding to Galina’s call for better data on the state of geolinguistic diversity in DH (2014), it articulates possible frameworks for addressing this diversity in a strategic, programmatic and research-led manner. We conclude by exploring the role of a greater multilingual focus in what Liu calls ‘the techne of diversity’ in digital humanities (2020), and contend that the digital humanities has much to gain, and much to offer, in engaging more fully with the languages-related cultural challenges of our era.&amp;nbsp;RésuméCes dernières années l’accent a été mis de plus en plus sur la diversité dans les sciences humaines numériques, et pourtant il y a plutôt eu moins de travaux sur la diversité geo linguistique, et les recherches qui ont été menées portent souvent sur les structures de la représentation géographique sur le terrain, ou estiment le ‘langage’ comme un problème technique ou linguistique à résoudre. Cet article adopte un point différent, à savoir que nous devons considérer cette diversité à travers plusieurs ‘cadres’ de culture et de language à médiation numérique, cela n’étant pas uniquement une question de justice ou de savoir-faire communautaire, mais que, dans son programme de recherches, les sciences humaines numériques doivent également relever plus activement les défis à la dynamique mondiale du multilinguisme numérique, aux échanges transculturels et à la geo diversité. Ce document explore ces questions à travers le prisme de ‘l’indifférence linguistique’ dans les études numériques et, en réponse à l’appel de Galina pour de meilleures données sur l’état de la diversité geo linguistique dans DH (2014), il définit des systèmes possibles pour faire face à cette diversité de manière stratégique, programmatique et axée sur la recherche.

Each essay takes a different approach that reveals the importance of pedagogy in bringing social justice to the digital humanities. One pedagogical approach lies in the design and development of a game that shows the experience of transgender, non-binary, and gender nonconforming youth, and the other emphasizes the significance of the Digital Humanities Summer Institute in offering a space to develop and teach a theory of inclusive and activist digital pedagogy. Taken together, these essays demonstrate that transforming DH into a politically engaged, socially just, and inclusive field is an ongoing process of teaching and learning in new and traditional places, forms, communities, organizations, and institutions.

"2021","Designing an API-Based Protocol for the Interoperability of Textual Resources","Designing a protocol for the interoperability of digital textual resources—or, more simply, a “IIIF for texts”—remains a challenge, as such a protocol must cater to their vastly heterogenous formats, structures, languages, text encodings and metadata. There have been many attempts to propose a standard for textual resource interoperability, from the ubiquitous Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) format to more recent proposals like the Distributed Text Services (DTS) protocol. In this paper, we introduce our proposal called SHINE, which prioritizes instead the ease for software developers to represent and exchange textual resources and their associated metadata. We do so by combining a hierarchical model of textual structure with a flexible metadata scheme in SHINE, and we continue to define and develop it based on user-centered and iterative design principles. Therefore, we argue that SHINE is a protocol for textual interoperability that successfully balances flexibility of resource representation, consistency across resource representation, and overall simplicity of implementation.RésuméConcevoir un protocole pour l’interopérabilité des ressources textuelles numériques – c’est-à-dire, un IIIF pour des textes – demeure un défi, puisqu’un tel protocole doit correspondre à leurs formats considérablement hétérogènes, ainsi qu’à leurs structures, langues, encodages textuels et métadonnées. Il existe déjà plusieurs tentatives de proposer des standards pour l’interopérabilité des ressources textuelles, tel que l’ubiquiste Text Encoding Initiative (TEI – Initiative d’encodage textuel) ou des propositions plus récentes comme le protocole de Distributed Text Services (DTS – Services de texte distribuées).

"2021","The technological informavore: Information behavior and digital sustainability in the global platform ecosystem","The typical approach to digital sustainability is related to digital business endurance, the persistence of digital records and objects, digital corporate communication and advertising, governance and knowledge access. In this article we offer a different approach, using an ecological perspective that relates the concepts of “informavore” and platforms as “digital ecosystems”, and human information behavior. We also carry out a domain analysis to follow the evolution of digital sustainability and its main discourses. We find that only one very recent article introduced a definition of digital sustainability that was consistent with the ecological approach. Taking that article as a point of inflexion, we complemented its definition of digital sustainability with some new elements. In conclusion we propose several breakthroughs required to advance the understanding of digital sustainability, and use the informavore-information behavior alternative as a basis for proposing some measures for digital sustainability.","",""
"2021","Investigating digital sustainability: A retrospective bibliometric analysis of literature leading to future research directions","This paper provides a bibliometric analysis of the digital sustainability literature from four angles: economics, management/business, information systems/IT, and sociology/communication. The core contribution is to map the development of the literature in digital sustainability over time and across various clusters. Through VOSviewer analysis, we identify the main keywords used by the literature; the countries from which most of the literature is emerging; the most influential authors working in the field; and, their impacts by observing their citations and networks. Moreover, through CitNetExplorer analysis, we track the development of the field over time, i.e., identify key publications and divide those into clusters. The analysis finds a much more developed coverage of digital sustainability in the scholarship of management/business and therefore reveals a clear need for greater exploration of the sociological and economic aspects of digital sustainability. We argue that more robust collaboration patterns should be established among all four considered disciplines to achieve progress in digital sustainability. We envisage that digital sustainability as a field of study will mature as publications and ideas will become consolidated. Such integration strengthens the evolution of the field and topics across all four considered disciplines.","",""

This collection is a forum for that conversation to develop as a venue in which social scientists, STS scholars, and other digital scholars explore the concept of digital sustainability. This special issue emerges in the context of two notable social trends. First, there is a push for global sustainable development, and second, all sectors of human endeavor are migrating into the digital sphere. These two trends combine into a single, nascent theme of digital sustainability, which is the topic of this collection of articles in First Monday. The focus is upon the role(s) of digital technologies in establishing a sustainable world. The collection includes seven papers, which make a modest contribution to the growing discourse about the sociological aspects of all things digital in sustainability practices. The aim is to establish a research agenda focusing on digital technologies' current and potential role (but also limitations). The articles pay special attention to the intricate interplay of technology, social dynamics of media, sustainability practices, and information change.

"2022","Modelling of a Heterogeneous Corpus: The Example of Chapbook Literature","This article proposes an analysis of Spanish chapbook literature from the digital perspective. It provides a systematic study of the metadata and services selected by seventeen digital libraries to model their collections.In the first part, we propose an overview of those libraries. Their great variety reflects the heterogeneity of this popular literature, which is at the margin of studies on printed productions, and escapes the classifications traditionally used for books. In the second part, we describe four different strategies used by digital libraries to model this type of content, focusing either 1) on the document as an archive to be preserved, 2) on the document as the result of an editorial process, 3) on the text, or 4) on the illustrations. Our objective is thus to outline a digital model for these types of documents and to help future projects in defining their own offer of services.This article is part of the research project """"Untangling the cordel / Démêler le cordel / Desenrollando el cordel (2020-2023)"""" financed by the Philanthropic Sandoz-Monique de Meuron Family Foundation and directed by the professor Constance Carta (University of Geneva).Cet article propose une analyse de la littérature de colportage espagnole au prisme du numérique, en étudiant de manière systématique les métadonnées et les services sélectionnés par dix-sept bibliothèques numériques pour modéliser leurs collections.Dans un premier temps, nous proposons un panorama de ces bibliothèques, dont la grande variété reflète celle de cette littérature populaire, à la marge des études sur les productions imprimées et qui échappe aux classifications traditionnellement employées pour le livre. Dans un second temps, nous décrivons quatre stratégies différentes employées par les bibliothèques numériques pour modéliser ce type de contenus, en mettant l’accent soit sur le document en tant qu’archives à conserver, soit sur le document en tant que résultat d’un processus éditorial, soit sur le texte, soit sur l’illustration. Notre objectif est ainsi d’esquisser les contours d’un modèle numérique pour ce type de documents et d’aider de futurs projets dans la définition de leur propre offre de services.Cet article s’inscrit dans le cadre du projet de recherche « Démêler le cordel / Desenrollando el cordel / Untangling the cordel (2020-2023) » financé par la Fondation philanthropique Famille Sandoz-Monique de Meuron et dirigé par la professeure Constance Carta (Université de Genève).","",""
"2022","Exploring Medieval Manuscripts Writer Predictability: A Study on Scribe and Letter Identification","Handwriting communication is a long-established human activity that has survived into the 21st century. Accordingly, research interest in handwritten documents, both historical and modern, is significant. The way we write has changed significantly over the past few centuries. For example, texts of the Middle Ages were often written and copied by anonymous scribes. The writing of each scribe, known as his/her """"scribal hand"""" is unique. It can be differentiated using a variety of consciously and unconsciously produced features. Distinguishing between these different scribal hands is a central focus of the humanities research field known as """"paleography."""" Character recognition within each scribal hand has also posed an interesting challenge. Some issues make these digital processes difficult, such as paper degradation and the soiling of the manuscript page. Thus, in this paper, we propose an investigation in both perspectives, character recognition and writer identification, in medieval manuscripts to better understand the specific behaviour of two 800-year-old scribes based on their manuscripts in comparison with a modern calligrapher. The experiments demonstrated that degradation and tremor can influence the analysis of medieval handwriting documents. However, the results presented an efficient accuracy with a better accuracy rate in letter classification than in writer identification.La communication manuscrite est une longue tradition humaine qui a persisté jusqu’à nos jours, au 21e siècle. Par conséquent, l’intérêt de la recherche concernant des documents manuscrits historiques et modernes est grand. La façon dont nous écrivons a changé au cours des derniers siècles. Par exemple, des textes du Moyen Âge ont souvent été écrits et copiés par des scribes. L’écriture de chaque scribe, appelée son «&amp;nbsp;écriture scribale&amp;nbsp;» (anglais scribal hand), est unique. Nous pouvons la différencier en observant une gamme de caractéristiques produites consciemment et inconsciemment. Faire la distinction entre ces écritures scribales différentes est au centre des préoccupations du domaine de recherche de paléographie. La reconnaissance de caractères dans chacune des écritures scribales pose des défis intéressants. Certains problèmes, tels que la dégradation de papier et l’encrassement de la page manuscrite, rendent difficiles ces processus numériques. Dans cet article, nous proposons ainsi une enquête sur les deux perspectives, la reconnaissance de caractères et l’identification de scribes, dans les manuscrits médiévaux dans le but de mieux comprendre le comportement spécifique de deux scribes vivant il y a 800 ans, en se basant sur leurs manuscrits en comparaison avec un calligraphe moderne. Les expériences démontrent que la dégradation et le tremblement peuvent influer sur l’analyse des documents manuscrits médiévaux. Cependant, les résultats ont présenté une précision efficace, avec un meilleur taux de précision dans la reconnaissance de caractères que dans celui de l’identification de scribe.","",""
"2022","The Computational Fallacy: A New Model for Understanding the Role of Computers in Humanities","The paper tries to counter some misassumptions about the computer and computation especially in relation to humanities and human behavior and they amount to what the author calls “the computational fallacy. The paper discusses a number of points such as the physiology of the computer, the Etymology of basic terms in the field, and the current approaches especially in mainstream digital humanities which reduce computation to a set of “tools”. The paper then proceeds to discuss some counter arguments such as rethinking the notion of programmability which should substitute “calculation” as the core of computation, considering the transformative nature of the computer and its media using the ideas of some theorists like Manovich and Drucker, and some new approaches that view computation differently like Computational Thinking, Algorithmic criticism, and Speculative computing.Cet article essaie de contrer quelques suppositions erronées sur l’ordinateur et la computation, plus particulièrement leur relation aux sciences humaines et au comportement humain qui équivaut à ce que l’auteur appelle « the computational fallacy » ou l’erreur computationnelle. Cet article aborde de nombreux points, tels que la physiologie de l’ordinateur, l’étymologie de termes de base dans ce domaine, ainsi que les approches courantes, particulièrement les approches dominantes dans les humanités numériques qui réduisent la computation comme un ensemble « d’outils ». Ensuite, l’article poursuit en discutant les contre-arguments comme les nouvelles réflexions des notions de programmation qui devraient substituer le calcul au cœur de la computation, considérant la nature transformante de l’ordinateur et ses médias utilisant les idées de quelques théoristes dont Manovich et Drucker, et quelques nouvelles approches qui voient la computation différemment comme « Computational Thinking » ou la pensée computationnelle, « Algorithmic criticism » ou la critique algorithmique et « Speculative computing » ou la computation spéculative.&amp;nbsp;","",""
"2022","Distant Approaches to the Printed Page","Laurence Sterne’s novel – The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentlemen – includes a tongue-and-cheek moment that prefigures distant reading. Near the end of the sixth volume, the narrator represents uncle Toby’s story as a meandering line with unexpected twists and predictable turns. The narrator’s precise line is inserted between two paragraphs. Its shape reminds the reader of the book’s tangential plot. But it also brings the reader back to the material contours of the story. It is a story that comes into being from the organization of lines and paragraphs on the printed page. The narrator’s precise line exists as a material object, in the middle of page 407 in volume 6 of the 1762 Lynch edition. The line gestures towards the physical space that it inhabits. In order to interpret its contours, the reader should also take into account the shape, organization and size of the printed page.This type of material analysis is under-represented in computational humanities, the majority of which has addressed segmented objects at the level of the book—actually, at the level of collections of books. The most common category of this text segmentation procedure is natural to literary scholars: the separation of individual works from within a larger collection of texts. Other categories or types of text segmentation might include the segmentation and parcellation of a longer text into its component chapters or automated algorithmically-defined procedures that ignore chapter and paragraph boundaries to cut a text or collection of texts into equally sized units of words. Segmentation enables comparison of textual objects to determine smaller effects—signals that within the larger stream of words might otherwise be lost.There has been some interest in examining individual sentences. Sarah Allison, Marissa Gemma, Ryan Heuser, Franco Moretti, Amir Tevel, and Irena Yamboliev argue that “style” exists at the level or scale of the sentence.  Thematic units, however, as Mark Algee-Hewitt, Ryan Heuser, and Franco Moretti argue, might be best captured at the level of the paragraph. Sentences and paragraphs are two different units of segmentation that are both connected with linear, human reading practices. However, segmenting a text into paragraphs rids us of information about the appearance of the paragraph and its relation to the rest of the page remains occluded. Where, for example, does a particular paragraph appear in the space of the page? Are there gaps between paragraphs? Are there printed ornaments, illustrations or annotations? When digital humanists erase the footnotes from Walter Scott’s novels, the marginalia from Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress and the irreverent experimental pages from Tristram Shandy, they lose the page-level context with which these texts are presented. Le roman Vie et Opinions de Tristram Shandy gentilhomme de Laurence Sterne inclut un momentironique qui préfigure la lecture à distance. Vers la fin du sixième tome, le narrateur décrit l’histoire de l’once Toby comme une ligne sinueuse avec des rebondissements inattendus et des tournures prévisibles. Les lignes précises du narrateur sont insérées entre deux paragraphes. Sa forme rappelle la tangente de l’intrigue au lecteur. Mais aussi, elle rappelle le lecteur du contour matériel de l’histoire. C’est une histoire qui voit le jour à partir d’une organisation de lignes et paragraphes sur des pages imprimées. Les lignes précises du narrateur existent en tant qu’objet matériel, dans le milieu de la page 407 du volume six de l’édition Lynch de 1762. Cette ligne fait signe à l’espace physique que celle-ci habite. Afin d’interpréter ces contours, le lecteur doit alors tenir compte de la forme, de l’organisation et de la grosseur de la page. Ce type de matériel d’analyse est sous-représenté dans le domaine des humanités informatiques, dont la majorité s’adresse à des objets segmentés au niveau du livre – et même au niveau des collections de livres. La catégorie la plus commune de cette procédure segmentée est naturelle pour les spécialistes littéraires&amp;nbsp;: la séparation de travaux individuels au sein de collections de textes plus larges. D’autres catégories ou types de textes segmentés peuvent inclurent la division et le morcellement d’un texte long dans son chapitre ou des procédures algorithmiques définies et automatisées qui ignorent les limites de chapitre ou paragraphe et coupent un texte ou une collection de textes en unités de mots de la même taille. Cette division permet la comparaison d’objets textuels pour déterminer de plus petits effets – des signaux qui seraient autrement perdus dans le flux de mots plus large. Il y a de l’intérêt pour examiner les phrases individuelles. Sarah Allison, Marissa Gemma, Ryan Heuser, Franco Moretti, Amir Tevel et Irena Yamboliev soutiennent que le «&amp;nbsp;style&amp;nbsp;» existe au niveau ou à l’échelle de la phrase. Toutefois, comme Mark Algee-Hewitt,Ryan Heuser et Franco Moretti soutiennent, les unités thématiques pourraient être mieux capturées au niveau du paragraphe. Les phrases et paragraphes sont deux unités de segmentation différentes qui sont toutes deux connectées aux pratiques humaines de lecture linéaire. Cependant, diviser un texte en paragraphes nous enlève l’information sur l’apparence du paragraphe et les relations au reste de la page demeurent obstruées. Par exemple, où est-ce qu’un paragraphe particulier apparait sur la page? Est-ce qu’il y a des espaces entre les paragraphes? Est-ce qu’il y a des décorations, illustrations ou annotations imprimées sur la page? Lorsque les humanités numériques effacent les notes de bas de page de romans de Walter Scott, les notes marginales de&amp;nbsp;Le Voyage du pèlerin de Bunyan et les pages expérimentales impertinentes de Tristam Shandy, ils perdent le contexte au niveau de la page dans lequel ces textes sont présentés.&amp;nbsp;","",""
"2022","Neither Computer Science, nor Information Studies, nor Humanities Enough: What Is the Status of a Digital Humanities Conference Paper?","This paper explores the disciplinary and regional conventions that surround the status of conference papers throughout their lifecycle from submission/abstract, review, presentation, and in some cases, publication. Focusing on national and international Digital Humanities conferences, while also acknowledging disciplinary conferences that inform Digital Humanities, this paper blends close readings of conference calls for papers with analysis of conference practices to reckon with what constitutes a conference submission and its status in relationship to disciplinary conventions, peer review, and publication outcomes. Ultimately, we argue that the best practice for Digital Humanities conferences is to be clear on the review and publication process so that participants can gauge how to accurately reflect their contributions.Cet article explore les conventions disciplinaires et régionales qui entourent le statut d’articles présentés à des conférences durant leurs cycles&amp;nbsp;de vie&amp;nbsp;; leur soumission/résumé, leur revue, leur présentation et, dans certains cas, leur publication.&amp;nbsp;En se concentrant sur des conférences d’humanités numériques nationales et internationales et en reconnaissant des conférences disciplinaires incorporant les humanités numériques, cet article intègre des lectures attentives d’appels de propositions pour des conférences avec une analyse de pratiques de conférences afin de tenir compte de&amp;nbsp;ce qui constitue une soumission de conférence et son statut par rapport à des conventions disciplinaires, à la critique des pairs et&amp;nbsp;aux&amp;nbsp;publications.&amp;nbsp;Finalement, nous soutenons que les bonnes pratiques pour les conférences d’humanités numériques consistent en un processus de revue et publication clair qui permet à des participants de mieux comprendre comment représenter leurs contributions de façon précise.","",""
"2022","Mining Medical Journals: Religion and Ideology in Nineteenth-Century Medicine.","In this paper, we present a multidisciplinary project, IMPRESS, which combines the digitization of three major nineteenth-century Belgian medical journals with a historical research project on the role of ideology in nineteenth-century Belgian medicine. We focus on the extent to which text mining has allowed us to identify and evaluate expressions of ideology in a corpus of medical texts. In showing how we used the digital tool AntConc to answer typically historical research questions, we intend to contribute to current debate on the gains and limitations of digital methods in the humanities. We conclude that, while acknowledging the many interpretative interventions in preparing searches and qualifying outcomes, the use of the tool has enabled us to shed new light on the role of ideology in scientific exchange. Text- mining operations have offered a fresh insight into the chronology of ideological vocabulary, the used language, and the distribution of ideological patterns across journal sections.Dans cet article, nous présentons un projet multidisciplinaire, IMPRESS, qui fusionne la numérisation de trois journaux médicaux belges du 19e siècle avec un projet de recherche historique enquêtant sur le rôle de l’idéologie dans la médecine belge au 19e siècle.

En montrant la façon dont nous avons employé l’outil numérique AntConc afin de répondre à des questions de recherche typiquement historiques, nous avons l’intention de contribuer au débat actuel sur les avantages et désavantages de méthodes numériques dans les humanités. Tout en reconnaissant les diverses interventions interprétatives dans la préparation de recherches et dans la qualification de résultats, nous concluons que l’usage de l’outil nous permet de jeter un nouvel éclairage sur le rôle de l’idéologie dans l’échange scientifique. Les opérations de la fouille de textes ont fourni un nouvel aperçu de la chronologie du vocabulaire idéologique, du langage utilisé et de la distribution de motifs idéologiques à travers des sections de journal.","",""

"2023","Archival Inversions: Rethinking Knowledge Infrastructures through the CUNY Distance Learning Archive","In the spring of 2020, doctoral students at the City University of New York (CUNY) Graduate Center produced a collective intervention in the knowledge infrastructures of the largest public university system in the United States. The CUNY Distance Learning Archive (CDLA) sought to document and bridge the lived experiences of faculty, staff, and students—particularly immigrant and working-class undergraduates—across the 25 campuses comprising the CUNY system. The archive’s three public-facing collections span the closure of the university, the transition to remote teaching and learning, and the resulting activism of the #CutCOVIDNotCUNY movement pushing against austerity in public higher education. These collections therefore highlight the various tension spaces made visible by the breakdown and maintenance of university infrastructure during this time of crisis. Here, the CDLA builds on the concept of infrastructural inversion by enacting a kind of “archival inversion” that inscribes these fissures into our institutional memory as a public university. By putting in conversation otherwise disjunctured constituencies and discourses, the collections in the archive offer an opportunity to rethink the relational nature of infrastructure and the frozen dialectics that are made visible by moments of crisis. This article takes the infrastructural interventions of the CDLA collections as a starting point to explore questions surrounding digital archival approaches to times of crisis and how these endeavours might facilitate prefigurative politics and memory-making practices.Au printemps 2020, des doctorants du Graduate Center de l'université de la ville de New York (CUNY) sont intervenus au niveau collectif sur les infrastructures de connaissances du plus grand système universitaire public des États-Unis. Les Archives Universitaire de l'Enseignement à Distance (CDLA) ont cherché à documenter et à relier les expériences vécues par le corps enseignant, le personnel et les étudiants - en particulier les immigrés et les étudiants de la classe ouvrière - sur les 25 campus du système de la CUNY. Les trois collections publiques des archives couvrent la fermeture de l'université, la transition vers l'enseignement et l'apprentissage à distance, ainsi que l'activisme résultant du mouvement #CutCOVIDNotCUNY qui pousse contre l'austérité dans l'enseignement supérieur public. Ces collections mettent donc en lumière les différents espaces de tension rendus visibles par la rupture et le maintien des infrastructures universitaires pendant cette période critique. Ici, le CDLA s'appuie sur le concept d'inversion infrastructurelle en mettant en œuvre une sorte d'""""inversion archivistique"""" qui inscrit ces fissures dans notre mémoire institutionnelle en tant qu'université publique. En mettant en conversation des groupes et des discours autrement disjoints, les collections des archives offrent l'opportunité de repenser la nature relationnelle de l'infrastructure et les dialectiques figées qui sont rendues visibles par les moments de crise. Cet article prend les interventions infrastructurelles des collections du CDLA comme point de départ pour explorer les questions relatives aux approches des archives numériques en temps de crise et la manière dont ces efforts peuvent faciliter les politiques préfiguratives et les pratiques mémorielles.","",""

Louise Moulin opens this discussion, drawing on her previous digital work to explore and critique the ways in which literature becomes data, a fundamental interpretive moment that has both technical and epistemological ramifications. This essay is followed by Chiara Azzaretti, who recounts how her apprehension about a first contact with DH turned to fascination with the ways in which digital outputs can enrich scholarly discussions by furnishing a responsive and interactive context for the close reading skills taught in literature PhD programs. Julien Le Goff then details how his work using the Anecdotes dramatiques collection in a coding context revealed the full extent of the challenge of reconciling these brief, sociologically acute stories with a programming framework that requires a level of precision and causality that texts only rarely provide. The last contribution, by Dr. Charlee M. Bezilla, recasts digital humanities work as a variety of translation, situating the literary skills learned working across linguistic traditions as a vital preparation for understanding meaning-making, for digital products as much as for works of literature.

"2023","Colonial and Nineteenth-Century Latin American Studies and Digital Public Humanities","Scholarship in colonial and nineteenth-century Latin American studies often does not reach beyond specialized academic audiences. The majority of work continues to be largely traditional in nature, with monographs, journal articles, and book chapters remaining the most common types of publications.Only a small portion of that production is distributed in an open-access format online, and even when that is the case, such scholarly output is generally not conceived with broader publics in mind, and engagement with stakeholder communities seldom plays a role in its creation.Digital methodologies and tools present opportunities to explore new modes of scholarly production and publication in these fields. Researchers working in a digital realm are designing and carrying out projects that speak to contemporary communities and involve diverse constituencies in new ways. Without seeking to supplant the more conventional scholarship that grounds their fields, these scholars are asking questions about how we conduct academic work in the twenty-first century and how we can make the products of our work relevant to larger audiences.This article examines five digital projects through which scholars of colonial and nineteenth-century Latin America are conducting work that looks outward from the academy towards inclusive scholarship: Ticha, the Biblioteca Digital Soledad Acosta de Samper, the Mexico team of the multinational project Oceanic Exchanges, Rendering Revolution, and coloniaLab. Through a commitment to producing scholarship for, and in collaboration with, diverse communities,these projects suggest models for conducting the work of colonial and nineteenth-century Latin American studies in the public sphere.Les études sur l'Amérique latine coloniale et du XIXème siècle ne s'adressent souvent qu'à un public universitaire spécialisé.

Because of the wide range of dissemination pathways and need for community engagement, the project team incorporated branding design from the beginning of the project lifecycle to help find a cohesive project voice and to tailor content and design towards the expected audience. This paper illustrates the design process of the project, the integration of branding principles, and highlights some real and potential difficulties in using branding principles in public digital humanities projects.Le projet """"Land Grab CT"""" en cours à l'Université du Connecticut est le résultat d'une collaboration entre les membres de Greenhouse Studios, l'Association des étudiants indigènes et amérindiens (NAISA) et l'Institut des droits de l'homme de l'Université du Connecticut. L'un des principaux axes du projet est la création d'un site web qui situe l'université du Connecticut en tant qu'institution coloniale dans le cadre de son statut d'institution d'octroi de terres financée par la loi Morrill de 1862. D'autres activités ont été organisées, notamment des séries de conférences, des dialogues, des entretiens et une campagne dans les reseaux sociaux, tous destinés à informer la communauté de l'université du Connecticut sur son histoire coloniale et sur les disparités actuelles en matière de ressources et de relations avec la communauté autochtone. En raison du large éventail de voies de diffusion et de la nécessité d'un engagement communautaire, l'équipe du projet a intégré la stratégie de marque depuis le début du cycle de vie du projet afin de trouver une voix cohérente et d'adapter le contenu et la conception à l'audience attendue. Cet article vise à presenter le processus de conception du projet, l'intégration des principes de stratégie de la marque et met en évidence certaines difficultés réelles et potentielles liées à l'utilisation des ses principes dans les humanités numériques publiques.","",""
"2023","Towards Accessible, Open, and Ethical Design-Led Digital Humanities Visualization Projects on the Web","This paper is an exploration of the design and material considerations for creating design-led digital humanities information visualizations using open and accessible web-based tools. It considers how we might approach or even re-approach the high-level material infrastructures of the web (network/code/browser) to facilitate these goals of openness and accessibility—what could perhaps be called a series of meta-considerations when developing visualization projects for the web. It emphasizes code as a material of design—a material that is argued should not always be the exclusive domain of software developers and engineers but can instead be an open and accessible material for, in this case, building dynamic immersive information visualizations. The aim of thinking of code as material in this way is to allow for the possibility of web-based projects being easily accessed and extended by others. It uses the Glossopticon VR visualization as an example throughout.Cet article est une exploration des considérations de conception et de matériel pour créer des visualisations d'information sur les humanités numériques dirigées par la conception en utilisant des outils Web ouverts et accessibles.

Il met l'accent sur le code en tant que matériau de conception - un matériau qui, selon nous, ne devrait pas toujours être le domaine exclusif des développeurs de logiciels et des ingénieurs, mais qui peut au contraire être un matériau ouvert et accessible pour, dans ce cas, construire des visualisations d'informations dynamiques et immersives. L'objectif de considérer le code comme un matériau de cette manière est de permettre aux projets basés sur le web d'être facilement accessibles et étendus par d'autres.

"2023","Digital sustainability: Ethics, epistemology, complexity and modelling","The growing attention to digital sustainability can arguably be linked to climate change and digital transformations as major megatrends rapidly altering our collective present and future. The current Russian-Ukrainian war and the recent pandemic, however, have both raised uncertainty over the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) achievement and the role of technology and innovation for sustainability. Without ignoring the dramatic consequences for people, the Ukrainian war can be deemed as a significant shift in geopolitics and global energy policies, with a short-term return to fossil fuel and commitments to renewable and clean energy transitions. At the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic acted as a catalyst for a more pervasive diffusion and adoption of information and communication technologies (ICTs) transforming our lives and notions of sustainability. By considering the disruptive impact triggered by the pandemic, this paper aims at advancing awareness and knowledge of digital sustainability and at drawing a coherent framework of arguments including ethical and epistemological issues, taking into account the approach of complexity science. This will be essentially carried out by considering digital sustainability as “the convergence of digital and sustainability imperatives that involves a trans-disciplinary approach of deploying digital technologies in tackling sustainability issues” (Pan and Zhang, 2020). Across different interpretations reflected within business and management debates (Sharma, et al., 2021), this definition gives meaning to the concept or construct by specifying operations that must be performed in order to measure or manipulate the concept (Berrío-Zapata, et al., 2021). This paper will focus on the profound transformations of our view of reality by ICTs acting as instrumentarian technologies, and the need to avoid determinism, rethink science-technology relations, and consider the distributed morality of multi-agent ecosystems as significant aspects to further a debate on the trans-disciplinary nature of digital sustainability, including the potential negative impacts of digital technologies on society, economy and environment.","",""
"2024","Land and Sea","Introduction The late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries saw a burst of interest by European powers in the scientific exploration of the Pacific. Well-equipped expeditions were sent to the far side of the world, although the technology of the time limited navigators’ ability to record their routes accurately. The journals and other publications produced by European expeditions to the Pacific are storehouses of observations of places and people, and the self-consciously scientific expeditions of this period provide particularly rich descriptions of the physical world they had set out to document. In addition, scientific expeditions brought back to Europe a vast array of physical specimens used to define species, as well as descriptions and drawings of people, landscapes, cultural objects, plants, and animals. However, the value of these records is diminished through uncertainty about where specimens were collected, and about the locations in which observations were made. The Coral Discovery project seeks to map scientific voyages to the Pacific completed by 1834 in order to clarify issues of coral taxonomy. Land provides the project with a way to map these voyages and trace the provenance of their specimens. Places named within navigators’ journals provide a more accurate way of mapping the locations visited by vessels than the multitude of calculated coordinates laboriously produced during the voyages. Land and Oceanic Travel Shipboard explorers used land to navigate. In 1697, English Astronomer Royal John Flamsteed wrote to Samuel Pepys, retired from administration of the navy, “’tis in vain to talk of observing the Longitude at Sea, except you know the true Longitude and Latitude of the Port for which you are designed” (qtd. in Kershaw 134). While that expert observation identifies the impossibility of reliably calculating longitude at sea, it omits to mention the difficulty of calculating the correct longitude of places on land. However, Flamsteed’s observation points to a means of mapping voyages undertaken before longitude could be effectively recorded. Land provided stable markers for mariners, and the accounts of voyages to the Pacific are linked to land through their inclusion of profiles of coasts, descriptions of approaches to harbours and surrounding regions, evocative names for landmarks, and records of Indigenous place names.  Fig. 1: Westall’s images are remarkable in their detail, and form part of a long tradition of coastal profiles. Coastal profiles formed an important part of records of expeditions—drawing had been part of the curriculum of the Portsmouth Naval Academy since 1733—and in concert with written descriptions, depictions of coasts enabled subsequent visitors to identify previously visited regions (Smith 9). Naming was also a means of making landmarks. James Cook named topographical features of land seen during his voyages. While many of the names he used were fanciful, or influenced by matters of patronage and power, or reflective of Cook’s personal history, or of events during his voyage, some were descriptive (Carter 3-33). Such opportunities to name visibly distinctive topographical features allowed navigators to offer guidance to subsequent visitors. Like Cook, later European visitors might see mountains that “very much resemble glass houses” and confidently identify them as the “Glasshouse Mountains” marked on their maps (17 May 1770). In addition to imposing their own names on the places they observed, European navigators also marked Indigenous names on their maps and charts, as evidenced by the plethora of Indigenous names on the map of the Society Islands that resulted from Cook’s Endeavour voyage. Such records made it possible for later visitors to establish their location by asking the people who lived there where they were (Gapps). European navigators recorded names in unfamiliar languages, writing without an established spelling system, working from a range of European languages, and while the names they recorded often differ from modern versions in their spelling they are still generally recognisable, and can be found on modern maps. Such detailed mapping demonstrates the significance of land to mariners. Records of coastlines, ports, and names allowed navigators to determine their whereabouts with an accuracy and precision impossible while at sea.  Fig. 2: Cheevers’s 1773 map of the Society Islands with Indigenous names for islands, regions, and geographical features including harbours. Dava Sobel’s well-known examination of John Harrison’s production of a marine chronometer and claiming of the longitude prize in 1773 suggests that the problem of longitude was solved between Cook’s first and second Pacific voyages (148-150). However, marine chronometers retained a significant margin of error throughout the nineteenth century (Miller 223). In 1855, the United States Coastal Survey sought to establish a baseline longitudinal measurement for the geodesic survey of North America by repeatedly shipping chronometers between Boston and Liverpool. Between 42 and 51 chronometers at a time were sent on five voyages across the Atlantic, and astronomical observations were made to repeatedly recalibrate the instruments while in port. However, even as late as 1855 such a concerted effort to establish the exact longitude of the continent of North America using chronometers failed. While an estimate of longitude was reached, the margin of error of the result was larger than that of the longitude calculated using astronomical methods alone (Stachurski 139-140). Advancements in certainty about the location of North America in relation to Greenwich came later and involved the use of telegraph technology in combination with the trans-Atlantic cable, and then, after 1963, satellites (Stachurski 207-8; NOAA). In the nineteenth century, even in ideal circumstances, the exact location of continents could not be determined. At sea in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, recorded locations were only ever estimates. The uncertainty even of land-based longitude was evident to the scientific voyagers of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Even when on land, scientific expeditions were aware of vagaries in their location and undertook extended astronomical observations with their attendant calculations, while also attempting to establish the accuracy and precision of their chronometers. During his 1793 observations at Cattle Point in Sydney Cove, Alejandro Malaspina, leading a well-equipped Spanish scientific expedition, found that clouds and a lack of suitable astronomical events hampered his efforts to establish longitude. He produced a range of estimates, based on the limited observations his astronomers could make, and on his chronometers. Those estimates varied by nearly 16 minutes of longitude (approximately 24 km; Malaspina 78). Similarly, during his 1802 visit to Sydney Cove, Matthew Flinders’s astronomical efforts were hindered by clouds, though he took what observations he could (Flinders 237). His average result for longitude was close to that obtained by Malaspina’s expedition, and to the result achieved by averaging that expedition’s results from all methods. Chronometers were useful for rough reckoning, but determining longitude accurately remained difficult and continued to use a range of methods throughout the nineteenth century (Higgitt and Dunn 3). While navigators regularly estimated their longitudes, even those skilled in astronomy and armed with chronometers were aware that there was considerable room for error. Such room for error means that named sites on land are the best indications of the waters visited by navigators in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. While navigators diligently recorded their calculated latitudes and longitudes, mapping those reckonings would misrepresent their voyages. Their chronometers were inconsistently unreliable, making the error in their readings impossible to correct. Calculations using astronomical observations are also imperfect due to observer error and reliance on imperfect astronomical predictions. Further confusion creeps in from navigators recording their positions with reference to places already visited, compounding error. Conversion from minutes and seconds of arc to modern digital format, and recalibration of estimates to account for the variety of reference meridians in use before the International Meridian Conference selected Greenwich as the ‘prime meridian’ in 1884, introduces potential for further error (Pimentel 13). This compounded confusion is most easily overcome by accepting Flamsteed’s observation, and mapping ocean voyages using the certainty of named places on dry land. Land Seen from Sea However, land also has its uncertainties, making interpreting navigators’ accounts of their locations challenging. While navigators sought to recognise priority and respect the names given to landforms by other Europeans, news of “discoveries” did not always travel quickly enough to reach expeditions before their departures from Europe. It is to the credit of navigators and their editors that many such issues were resolved before publication, although some remained to cause confusion. Frederick Beechey, in his account of the voyage of the HMS Blossom, demonstrated both the care navigators took to recognise priority of naming, and the difficult in doing so, in one case noting:  This island, which on our charts bears the name of Elizabeth, ought properly to be called Henderson’s Island, as it was first named by Captain Henderson of the Hercules of Calcutta. Both these vessels visited it, and each supposing it was a new discovery, claimed the merit of it on her arrival the next day at Pitcairn Island, these two places lying close together. But the Hercules preceded the former several months. To neither of these vessels, however, is the discovery of the land in question to be attributed, as it was first seen by the crew of the Essex, an American whaler, who accidentally fell in with it after the loss of their vessel. (50)  Despite such diligence in recording priority of naming, errors such as those on Beechey’s map meant that some places have different names accorded to them by different navigators. Places named in journals can be difficult to locate if they have been deliberately renamed, or if the names given to them by navigators have fallen into disuse. Some names selected by European navigators are offensive, making their inclusion on modern maps problematic. Cook gave the region of his first landfall in Aotearoa—a land mass at times known as Staten Land, Nieuw Zeeland, and New Zealand (Breen et al.)—the name Poverty Bay because “it afforded us no one thing we wanted” (11 Oct. 1769). In 2019 the region around that bay was officially renamed Tūranganui-a-Kiwa/Poverty Bay to reflect its Māori history and recognise its prior naming (Gisborne Herald). While Cook’s disgust has not been entirely banished, the local Māori name and its quite different implications has been given precedence in official nomenclature. The process of recognising the priority of Māori names in Aotearoa is well advanced, and such processes are widespread in postcolonial nations, including Australia (Sta Maria). Grace Karsken’s “Real Secret River Dyarubbin” project retrieved traditional names for places on the Hawkesbury River and demonstrated the potential to restore names, using documentation left by navigators and settlers (Karskens 14-17). Maps are frequently redrawn, and the names used by navigators are not always present on modern maps. And land itself is not always stable. In places, shorelines recorded and named in journals are no longer present. In Hawai’i, coastal erosion has changed coastlines, leaving beaches sighted by navigators underwater (Fletcher et al. 49). In other places, new land has emerged as the result of human efforts. Many European voyages of the nineteenth century anchored at the Typa River. That river has been reclaimed by the island of Macao, and the anchorage once used by expeditions is now underland. Similarly, on the east coast of Australia, what was named Coal Island by James Grant in 1801 had, by 1846, been reduced to Nobby’s Head by a causeway built using stone quarried from the island itself (Grant 152, Umwelt 14-15). The instability of coastal regions can make navigators’ landfalls difficult to locate. Beyond the problems of recognising real places, the journals of even scientific expeditions include sightings of places misperceived. Studying a shoreline from a ship at sea is difficult, and maps produced by European navigators include peninsulas depicted as islands and islands as peninsulas. The dangers of land at times led to the omission of significant river mouths and other features as ships sought safety out to sea (Brennan, Physical 146). In addition, some navigational accounts and maps include sightings of land that did not exist, and phantom islands could persist on maps for many decades (Brooke-Hitching 9). The second ship of Malaspina’s well-equipped expedition surveyed the sub-Antarctic Aurora Islands, approaching to within about a mile of the shore (Malaspina, 307-308). Despite being sighted both before and after that ‘visit’, the Aurora islands do not exist and the expedition’s co-commander José de Bustamante y Guerra most likely observed “ice-islands, incorporated with earth” (Weddell, quoted in Stommel 92). As well as being deceived by icebergs masquerading as mountainous and substantial islands, navigators could be misled by mirages and report land where there was none (Young). Mapping Coral Discovery Using Land The Coral Discovery project is in the process of digitally mapping European scientific voyages visiting the Indian and Pacific Oceans before 1834. Scientific voyaging began with the expedition of Bougainville 1766-9 and is distinguished by the inclusion of scientific workers among ships’ companies. The project limits itself to voyages completed by 1834 because of its interests in coral: 1834 marked the publication of C.G. Ehrenberg’s foundational work on coral taxonomy. While English speakers refer to Ehrenberg’s work as Corals of the Red Sea, the work includes descriptions of corals collected further afield including those from the Indian and Pacific Oceans (Ehrenberg). Within the long history of voyages of exploration, the late eighteenth century saw European empires use science to legitimise their imperial enterprises, and the project has identified 49 expeditions which meet its criteria (Gascoigne 230-234; Brennan, Expeditions). While real commitment to science varied between expeditions—the journal of one Russian expedition mentions the voyage’s naturalist only once, as he left the ship for the last time (Golovnin 293)—French, British, Russian, Spanish, United States, and Dutch expeditions all at times claimed scientific credentials. Generally, that claim to science influenced the records kept by the expeditions, as captains and other journal-keepers sought to make good on their promise to observe the natural world, collect specimens, and establish their priority through publication. Maps of expeditions’ routes already exist, ranging from global maps to detailed studies of individual bays and coastlines drawn from the hydrographic work of the expeditions themselves. However, digital maps offer the ability to move between these scales, and to compare the paths of expeditions in a way paper maps do not allow. The TLC Map project makes digital mapping infrastructure available to humanities scholars and allows the inclusion of temporal elements in mapping projects (TLC Map). Coral Discovery is making use of this infrastructure to produce voyage maps that can be put to many uses, including the comparison of accounts of visits to a site by different voyages (Brennan, Expeditions). Digital tools make it easy to layer voyages and compare their landfalls and observations. They also facilitate inclusion of all European scientific voyages, rather than the voyages of a single empire. This layering facility has underpinned a study of failures of acclimatisation attempts in Tahiti in the eighteenth century and promises to support the establishment of environmental baselines of a wide range of marine and terrestrial ecosystems observed in detail by expeditions (Brennan, Ecological). The project’s publicly accessible datasets can support other mapping projects and have been used in the creation of a map contrasting sites of Cook memorialisation with Cook’s landing sites in Australia and Aotearoa (Brennan and Stevenson). Such land-focussed projects are a by-product of the project’s marine interests. Coral Discovery is a cooperative enterprise between coral taxonomists and humanities scholars sparked by a peculiar marine organism. Since the late twentieth century, scientific study of species and their distributions has been greatly enhanced by the use of molecular analysis, but the coral specimens in museums are limestone skeletons that do not contain genetic material. Collecting duplicate specimens from the same sites as the original, species-defining specimens makes molecular analysis possible and improves clarity around coral phylogenetics (Bridge et al. 2-3). However, species descriptions dating from the nineteenth century are often imprecise regarding the origins of specimens. In 1817 French biologist Jean Baptiste Pièrre Antoine de Monet de Lamarck published seven volumes describing and naming invertebrate animal species, including corals. Within those seven volumes the description “Habite l’Océan des Grandes-Indes ou Austral” occurs numerous times, indicating that a specimen originated from somewhere within the Indian and southern Pacific Oceans. However, de Lamarck’s descriptions often include the names of the naturalists who collected the specimen, allowing identification of the relevant voyage and the possibility of identifying a more exact collection site. This is the case with the species Acropora pocillifera (named Madrepora pocillifera in de Lamarck’s work), which was collected by “Péron et le Sueur”, naturalists who sailed with the 1800-1804 Baudin expedition (de Lamarck 280). Consulting a published account of the voyage narrows the origin of the specimens from two oceans to two sites on the west coast of Australia (Baird; Peron). With other specimens, the date of publication of a description and knowledge of collecting networks may be enough to identify the voyage on which they were collected and narrow down their origins using Coral Discovery maps.  Fig. 3: Brué’s 1816 map shows the extent of the Oceans mentioned in de Lamarck’s species description. The map’s prime meridian runs through Paris. Conclusion The records created by European expeditions to the Pacific have long been treasure houses of information about Pacific societies in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Those of scientific expeditions contain detailed observations of environments, as well as of the people who lived in them. The emergence of digital mapping infrastructure facilitates comparison and promises to uncover new information both about Pacific environments and about the provenance of items within museum collections. Land has a part to play in the mapping of voyages across the trackless ocean in a period before the possibility of precisely establishing one’s location relative to known locations in Europe (and so placing oneself accurately on the globe). Triggered by interest in the taxonomy of a marine species, the Coral Discovery project is producing a new tool to understand European scientific voyages across the Indian and Pacific Oceans as they set about the task of cataloguing the natural history of the planet.

"2024","Readerly Cartography: Finding Fictional Places and Actual Readers on Digital Maps","ABSTRACT:Maps that provide pragmatic geographic and location information can also be used to document and describe fictional places. Readers have used the affordances of Google Maps to add settings from favorite books to this online information resource, demonstrating a complex form of reader response that I call readerly cartography. This practice aligns with an interdisciplinary scholarship on maps as culturally constructed texts. The effect of readerly cartography is to document and collocate communities of actual readers.","",""
"2024","Literary versus Nonliterary People: Rhetorical Strategies of Derogation in the           Sensitivity Reading Debate","ABSTRACT:Sensitivity reading (SR)—the expert, ameliorative assessment of literary texts for superficial, inaccurate, or degradative depictions of oppressed groups—is a hotly contested service in the book industry, one that some hold is censorious. This article explicates how these detractors’ critiques function as informal suppression, drawing inspiration from Joanna Russ to expose key rhetorical strategies that reinforce a pernicious distinction between “literary” insidersand “nonliterary” out siders. The construction and propagation of this distinction ultimately encodes minoritized editors as “sensitive readers” who constitute a threat to the literary enterprise itself, thereby rationalizing their continued marginalization on aesthetic grounds.","",""
"2024","Women to the Forefront: A Case for Digital Medieval Prosopography","Despite the growing number of medievalist projects, it is difficult to identify the ones that use Iberian chronicles to study people from the gender perspective in a digital setting. To bridge this gap, a prosopographical database of all women mentioned in the Crónica de Castilla (ca. 1300) has been produced. This article documents its development from the initial interests to the practical considerations of its published online version. On the one hand, carefully chosen examples illustrate various issues of the systematic approach, therefore firmly reminding us that the generated data sets are neither simply extracted nor neutral. On the other hand, the included visualizations and the preliminary observations help uncover new and engaging avenues for examining the women in the Crónica de Castilla and, by extension, in other historical narratives. Malgré le nombre croissant de projets médiévaux, il est difficile d’identifier ceux qui utilisent les chroniques ibériques pour étudier les individus sous l’angle du genre dans un cadre numérique. Pour combler cette lacune, une base de données prosopographique de toutes les femmes mentionnées dans la Crónica de Castilla (vers 1300) a été créée. Cet article documente son développement, depuis les intérêts initiaux jusqu’aux considérations pratiques la version qui a été publiée. D’une part, des exemples soigneusement choisis illustrent divers enjeux de l’approche systématique, rappelant ainsi fermement que les ensembles de données générés ne sont ni simplement extraits ni neutres. D’autre part, les visualisations incluses et les observations préliminaires permettent de découvrir de nouvelles pistes stimulantes pour examiner les femmes dans la Crónica de Castilla et, par extension, dans d’autres récits historiques.","",""
"2024","Oceanic Circuits in Portuguese America (between the Eighteenth and the Beginning of the Nineteenth Centuries): Mapping Political Communication through the Digital Humanities","The aim of this article is to present and discuss the creation process of the Oceanic Circuits database, centred on the mapping and analysis of petitions sent from Portuguese America to the Conselho Ultramarino (Overseas Council) and the Secretário de Estado da Marinha e do Ultramar (Secretary of State of the Navy and Overseas Territories) between 1736 and 1808. It proposes a reflection on the theoretical and methodological possibilities resulting from interdisciplinary dialogue between the areas of History and Data Systems. Initially, we present the historical sources held in the Arquivo Histórico Ultramarino (Overseas Historical Archive) in Lisbon that were selected for the research with the purpose of evidencing some of the main questions covered in the study, both in historiographic terms and in relation to the quantity and complexity of the data involved. Following this, we discuss the database pilot project, which was developed using a low code tool, signalling the potentials and limits of the application used. Finally, we look at the database specifically developed for an interdisciplinary team, discussing relevant aspects, as well as some of its characteristics. L'objectif de cet article est de présenter et de discuter le processus de création de la base de données Oceanic Circuits, centrée sur la cartographie et l'analyse des pétitions envoyées depuis l'Amérique portugaise au Conselho Ultramarino (Conseil d'Outre-Mer) et au Secretário de Estado da Marinha e do Ultramar (Secrétaire d'État de la Marine et des Territoires d'Outre-Mer) entre 1736 et 1808. Il propose une réflexion sur les possibilités théoriques et méthodologiques découlant du dialogue interdisciplinaire entre les domaines de l'Histoire et des Systèmes de données. Dans un premier temps, nous présentons les sources historiques conservées à l'Arquivo Histórico Ultramarino (Archives Historiques d'Outre-Mer) à Lisbonne, sélectionnées pour la recherche, afin de mettre en évidence certaines des principales questions abordées dans l'étude, tant en termes historiographiques qu'en relation avec la quantité et la complexité des données impliquées. Ensuite, nous discutons le projet pilote de la base de données, développé à l'aide d'un outil low code, en signalant les potentialités et les limites de l'application utilisée. Enfin, nous abordons la base de données spécifiquement développée pour une équipe interdisciplinaire, en discutant les aspects pertinents ainsi que certaines de ses caractéristiques.","",""
"2024","Taking the Middle Road: Reflections on Mixed Methodology within the Digital Humanities","In the rapidly evolving field of digital humanities, methodological considerations, especially the interplay between “distant reading” and “close reading,” play a prominent role. This paper, presented against the backdrop of these two critical approaches, undertakes a comprehensive exploration of reflections on mixed methodology that have emerged within the field, emphasizing calls for a blending of distant reading and close reading. Starting with an evaluation of the origins of such terminology in the field, the paper elucidates the ongoing debates surrounding the tensions between these two reading paradigms. Highlighting the multifaceted terrain of these debates, the paper enumerates the terminology on such methodology that has been explored and expanded by digital humanists. Furthermore, through analyzing a number of methodological reflections, the affordances and the practical implications of a mixed methodology in computational literary studies are discussed. Starting from bringing distant reading and close reading together in the research process, the focus shifts from a mere juxtaposition of these two reading modalities to a broader contemplation of the objects of study in digital humanities projects. Then, moving from scale to scope, collaboration emerges as an integral element in the discourse. Recognizing both its opportunities and inherent challenges, the paper examines the need for collaboration between scholars from different disciplines and explores the emergence of mixed methods in a collaborative context. The need to employ both distant reading and close reading in such context is formulated as a way to appeal to more traditional humanists. In its conclusion, the article heralds the significance of “alien reading,” emphasizing the need for understanding machine reading as a distinct, albeit integral, component in the digital humanities’ tapestry, especially in the age of AI and LLMs. Dans le domaine en rapide évolution des humanités numériques, les considérations méthodologiques, en particulier l’interaction entre le « distant reading » et le « close reading », occupent une place prépondérante. Cet article, présenté dans le contexte de ces deux approches critiques, propose une exploration approfondie des réflexions sur la méthodologie mixte qui ont émergé dans ce domaine, en mettant l’accent sur les appels à combiner la lecture de loine et la lecture de près. En commençant par une évaluation des origines de cette terminologie dans le domaine, l’article éclaire les débats en cours autour des tensions entre ces deux paradigmes de lecture. Soulignant la diversité de ces débats, l'article répertorie les terminologies liées à ces méthodologies, explorées et développées par les humanistes numériques. De plus, à travers l’analyse de plusieurs réflexions méthodologiques, les avantages et les implications pratiques d’une méthodologie mixte en études littéraires computationnelles sont discutés. En partant du rapprochement entre lecture de loine et lecture de près dans le processus de recherche, l’attention passe d’une simple juxtaposition de ces deux modalités de lecture à une réflexion plus large sur les objets d’étude des projets en humanités numériques. Ensuite, en évoluant de l’échelle à l’étendue, la collaboration apparaît comme un élément central dans le discours. Reconnaissant à la fois ses opportunités et ses défis inhérents, l’article examine la nécessité d’une collaboration entre chercheurs de disciplines différentes et explore l’émergence de méthodes mixtes dans un contexte collaboratif. Le besoin d’employer à la fois la lecture distante et la lecture rapprochée dans ce contexte est formulé comme un moyen de s’adresser aux humanistes plus traditionnels. En conclusion, l’article souligne l’importance de la « alien reading » (ou « lecture étrangère »), en mettant en avant la nécessité de comprendre la lecture par la machine comme une composante distincte mais intégrale dans le paysage des humanités numériques, notamment à l’ère de l’IA et des modèles de langage étendus (LLM).","",""
"2024","""""Much Material of 1821 Not Listed"""": Troubling Christina Colvin's Calendar of Maria Edgeworth's Correspondence with Digital Analysis","The Edgeworth family have been the subject of much scholarly research in terms of literature, science, and education over the past thirty years. This large family—the patriarch, Richard Lovell, had twenty-two children—participated in cultural, political, and scientific networks across Ireland, Britain, and Europe during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries and corresponded with several notable writers, thinkers, scientists, and politicians, which has resulted in a large manuscript archive housed in institutions across the world. Though selections of correspondence were made available in print during the twentieth century, now digital tools are being used to create a global """"virtual"""" collection and online, searchable catalogues of their extant correspondence, while digital research is making newly visible, and visible in new ways, the nature of their network and the collaborative nature of the ways it made and circulated knowledge. This article offers a new perspective on the extant Edgeworth correspondence, and the way it has been understood for the past half-century, made possible by reassessing the network data (including correspondents, dates, and location of letters) as presented in library catalogues.   La famille Edgeworth a fait l'objet de nombreuses recherches scientifiques en termes de littérature, de science et d'éducation au cours des trente dernières années. Cette famille nombreuse—le patriarche, Richard Lovell, a eu vingt-deux enfants—a participé à des réseaux culturels, politiques et scientifiques en Irlande, en Grande-Bretagne et en Europe à la fin du XVIIIe siècle et au début du XIXe siècle et a correspondu avec plusieurs écrivains, penseurs, scientifiques et hommes politiques de renom, ce qui a donné lieu à d'importantes archives manuscrites conservées dans des institutions à travers le monde. Bien que des sélections de correspondances aient été rendues disponibles sous forme imprimée au cours du XXe siècle, les outils numériques sont aujourd'hui utilisés pour créer une collection « virtuelle » mondiale et des catalogues consultables en ligne de leur correspondance existante, tandis que la recherche numérique rend nouvellement visible, et de manière inédite, la nature de leur réseau et la nature collaborative de ses modes d'élaboration et de circulation des connaissances. Cet article offre une nouvelle perspective sur la correspondance Edgeworth existante et sur la manière dont elle a été comprise au cours des cinquante dernières années, rendue possible par la réévaluation des données du réseau (y compris les correspondants, les dates et l'emplacement des lettres) telles qu'elles sont présentées dans les catalogues des bibliothèques.","",""
"2024","Towards Acknowledgement and Accreditation of Digital Labour in Digital Humanities: A Case Study from Emerging Indian Digital Humanities Projects","Digital labour (DL) in the context of digital humanities (DH) broadly comprises the process of data collection, curation, analysis, and visualization, leading to the creation of a final project. DL, when analyzed from an Indian DH perspective, consists of humanities scholars acquiring additional technical knowledge required for the research, finding suitable resources (technical and otherwise), infrastructures, and collaborating with other disciplines, etc. This DL, together with manual labour (ML) of writing about outcomes (Anderson et al. 2016), is complicated and time-consuming for DH scholars. Yet DL gets recognized due to the nascent state of DH in the subcontinent. Despite the evident DL involved in the creation and successful proliferation of DH projects, it is seldom addressed in academic scholarship (Anderson et al. 2016) and even more rarely in Indian DH academia. The lack of proper infrastructure (Anderson et al. 2016) and deficiency in technical knowledge (Thangavel and Menon 2020) have resulted in a greater DL among the DH practitioners in India when compared to their peers elsewhere, yet it has gone unrecognized, given the lack of literature and research on DL in Indian DH. The existing resistance in humanities towards accommodating the new approaches of DH (Greetham 2012) has made DL manifold. In an effort to recognize DL in DH, this paper attempts a definition of DL in DH, especially in the Indian context, followed by a broad classification of digital labourers (DLers) in DH in India. The paper utilizes a case study of selected DH projects in India to understand the gaps in recognizing the DLers and DL in Indian DH projects, especially the DL of students and researchers. The findings from the case study further lead to the proposal of a possible framework to address the emergence and evolving nature of DL in DH, as well as to compensate for the same appropriately. &amp;nbsp; Le travail num&amp;eacute;rique (TN) dans le contexte des humanit&amp;eacute;s num&amp;eacute;riques (HN) comprend largement le processus de collecte, de conservation, d'analyse et de visualisation des donn&amp;eacute;es, menant &amp;agrave; la cr&amp;eacute;ation d'un projet final. Lorsqu'il est analys&amp;eacute; du point de vue des HN indiennes, le travail num&amp;eacute;rique consiste pour les chercheurs en sciences humaines &amp;agrave; acqu&amp;eacute;rir des connaissances techniques suppl&amp;eacute;mentaires n&amp;eacute;cessaires &amp;agrave; la recherche, &amp;agrave; trouver des ressources appropri&amp;eacute;es (techniques et autres), des infrastructures et &amp;agrave; collaborer avec d'autres disciplines, etc. Ce TN, ainsi que le travail manuel (TM) de r&amp;eacute;daction des r&amp;eacute;sultats (Anderson et al. 2016), est compliqu&amp;eacute; et prend du temps pour les chercheurs en HN. Pourtant, le TN est reconnu en raison de l'&amp;eacute;tat naissant des HN dans le sous-continent.

"2024","Mapping Plants and Their Movements in and across Contemporary Francophone Narratives","In April 2021, the interactive digital platform Cartographie litt&amp;eacute;raire des plantes &amp;agrave; travers quelques r&amp;eacute;cits/Literary Cartography of Plants in and across Narratives went live after four years of research conducted jointly by researchers from UQ&amp;Agrave;M and McGill University, funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (L'imaginaire botanique 2024). Building on various interactive functionalities, the platform presents multiple mappings and cross-readings of ten plants and fifteen contemporary Francophone narratives (1985&amp;ndash;2020). Intended for botany and literary enthusiasts, professionals, and amateurs alike, it seeks to stimulate curiosity about literary plants, deepen knowledge about plants and their habitats, and encourage exchanges between digital and environmental humanists. The present article presents a moment of reflection and critique about this project, from which have emerged more questions than answers. At the intersection of the digital humanities, plant studies, and literary cartography, our article outlines the shifts in perspective that the development of this interactive digital platform required of us and our relationships to plants. Instead of offering a chronological account, we prefer to draw inspiration from the pitfalls encountered along the way and so do justice to the intellectual trials and tribulations that have brought us closer to the plant world. Moreover, it is in large part due to a collective approach of literary scholars, graphic designers, and a software developer that we have been able to discover plants and their movements from so many different angles. Our multi-authored article aims to illustrate the importance of such interdisciplinary work when it comes to understanding plants and their movements. &amp;nbsp; En avril 2021, la plateforme num&amp;eacute;rique interactive Cartographie litt&amp;eacute;raire des plantes &amp;agrave; travers quelques r&amp;eacute;cits/Literary Cartography of Plants in and across Narratives a &amp;eacute;t&amp;eacute; mise en ligne apr&amp;egrave;s quatre ann&amp;eacute;es de recherche men&amp;eacute;es conjointement par des chercheurs de l'UQ&amp;Agrave;M et de l'Universit&amp;eacute; McGill, financ&amp;eacute;es par le Conseil de recherches en sciences humaines du Canada (L'imaginaire botanique 2024).

"2024","Research Data Management in the Humanities: Challenges and Opportunities in the Canadian Context","In recent years, research funders across the world have implemented mandates for research data management (RDM) that introduce new obligations for researchers seeking funding. Although data work is not new in the humanities, digital research infrastructures, best practices, and the development of highly qualified personnel to support humanist researchers are all still nascent. Responding to these changes, this article offers four contributions to how humanists can consider the role of &amp;ldquo;data&amp;rdquo; in their research and succeed in its management. First, we define RDM and data management plans (DMP) and raise some exigent questions regarding their development and maintenance. Second, acknowledging the unsettled status of &amp;ldquo;data&amp;rdquo; in the humanities, we offer some conceptual explanations of what data are, and gesture to some ways in which humanists are already (and have always been) engaged in data work. Third, we argue that data work requires conscious design&amp;mdash;attention to how data are produced&amp;mdash;and that thinking of data work as involving design (e.g., experimental and interpretive work) can help humanists engage more fruitfully in RDM. Fourth, we argue that RDM (and data work, generally) is labour that requires compensation in the form of funding, support, and tools, as well as accreditation and recognition that incentivizes researchers to make RDM an integral part of their research. Finally, we offer a set of concrete recommendations to support humanist RDM in the Canadian context. &amp;nbsp; Ces derni&amp;egrave;res ann&amp;eacute;es, les organismes de financement de la recherche du monde entier ont mis en place des mandats de gestion des donn&amp;eacute;es de recherche (en anglais, Research data management, RDM) qui introduisent de nouvelles obligations pour les chercheurs en qu&amp;ecirc;te de financement. Bien que le travail sur les donn&amp;eacute;es ne soit pas nouveau dans les sciences humaines, les infrastructures de recherche num&amp;eacute;rique, les meilleures pratiques et le d&amp;eacute;veloppement d'un personnel hautement qualifi&amp;eacute; pour soutenir les chercheurs humanistes en sont encore &amp;agrave; leurs balbutiements. En r&amp;eacute;ponse &amp;agrave; ces changements, cet article propose quatre contributions sur la fa&amp;ccedil;on dont les humanistes peuvent consid&amp;eacute;rer le r&amp;ocirc;le des """"donn&amp;eacute;es"""" dans leur recherche et r&amp;eacute;ussir &amp;agrave; les g&amp;eacute;rer. Tout d'abord, nous d&amp;eacute;finissons les techniques de recherche et de gestion de donn&amp;eacute;esdonn&amp;eacute;es et les plans de gestion des donn&amp;eacute;es (en anglais """"data management plan"""", DMP) et soulevons certaines questions urgentes concernant leur d&amp;eacute;veloppement et leur maintenance. Deuxi&amp;egrave;mement, reconnaissant le statut incertain des """"donn&amp;eacute;es"""" dans les sciences humaines, nous proposons quelques explications conceptuelles de ce que sont les donn&amp;eacute;es, et soulignons certaines fa&amp;ccedil;ons dont les humanistes sont d&amp;eacute;j&amp;agrave; (et ont toujours &amp;eacute;t&amp;eacute;) engag&amp;eacute;s dans le travail sur les donn&amp;eacute;es. Troisi&amp;egrave;mement, nous soutenons que le travail sur les donn&amp;eacute;es n&amp;eacute;cessite une conception consciente - une attention &amp;agrave; la mani&amp;egrave;re dont les donn&amp;eacute;es sont produites - et que le fait de consid&amp;eacute;rer le travail sur les donn&amp;eacute;es comme impliquant une conception (par exemple, un travail exp&amp;eacute;rimental et interpr&amp;eacute;tatif) peut aider les humanistes &amp;agrave; s'engager de mani&amp;egrave;re plus fructueuse dans la RDM.

Enfin, nous proposons une s&amp;eacute;rie de recommandations concr&amp;egrave;tes pour soutenir la RDM humaniste dans le contexte canadien.","",""
"2024","Discovery of the New World’s Oldest Extant Metal-Type–Printed Book in Korea through Image Acquisition, Comparison, and Analysis","Image acquisition, comparison, and analysis technology was applied to address questions regarding medieval Korean printing technology that have existed for fifty years. Two nearly identical books of The Song of Enlightenment (南明泉和尙頌證道歌), with Korean treasure status, were investigated based on material properties of metal, wood, and ink. It led the discovery of the new world’s oldest extant metal-type-printed book in the thirteenth century in Korea. One version was identified as metal-type-printed in early September of 1239, as stated in the inscription. It predates Jikji (直指), the oldest extant metal-type-printed book officially recognized by UNESCO, by 138 years and the Gutenberg 42-line Bible by 216 years. This was a stunning discovery of the history of innovations in printing technology in the thirteenth century from the East. The other version was identified as woodblock-printed in the Joseon dynasty of Korea between the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Omni-directional shrinkage of printed pages was observed from the duplicated woodblock printed version. Ink tones and printing patterns of medieval Korean printing techniques were also significantly different and provide important clues for printing technique identification. The characteristics of the two books were compared with the Jikji and Bible to find similarities and differences between medieval prints from the East and the West. La technologie d'acquisition, de comparaison et d'analyse d'images a été appliquée pour répondre à des questions sur la technologie d'impression coréenne médiévale qui existent depuis cinquante ans. Deux livres presque identiques de *Le Chant de l'immédiat satori* (南明泉和尙頌證道歌), ayant le statut de trésor en Corée, ont été étudiés en fonction des propriétés matérielles du métal, du bois et de l'encre. Cela a conduit à la découverte du plus ancien livre imprimé en caractères métalliques existant dans le monde, datant du XIIIe siècle en Corée. Une version a été identifiée comme imprimée en caractères métalliques au début de septembre 1239, comme indiqué dans l'inscription. Elle précède le *Jikji* (直指), le plus ancien livre imprimé en caractères métalliques officiellement reconnu par l'UNESCO, de 138 ans, et la Bible de Gutenberg en 42 lignes de 216 ans. Cette découverte a bouleversé l'histoire des innovations en technologie d'impression au XIIIe siècle en provenance de l'Est. L'autre version a été identifiée comme imprimée en xylographie durant la dynastie Joseon en Corée, entre les XVe et XVIe siècles. Un retrait omnidirectionnel des pages imprimées a été observé dans la version imprimée en xylographie. Les tons d'encre et les motifs d'impression des techniques d'impression médiévales coréennes étaient également très différents et fournissent des indices importants pour l'identification des techniques d'impression. Les caractéristiques des deux livres ont été comparées avec le *Jikji* et la Bible pour trouver des similarités et des différences entre les impressions médiévales de l'Est et de l'Ouest.","",""
"2024","For a General Theory of Scholars–Digital Tools Interactions","Despite the growing prevalence of digital tools in humanistic research, we do not have a comprehensive theory of how these digital media and technologies affect and warp our research processes and outputs. The shift away from analog methods and towards digital tools is rapid and overwhelming, but even then, only a handful of these tools have been theorized as research practices. In the meantime, new technologies continue to shape, limit, and enable research: software, hardware, databases, and algorithms are not politically neutral objects, and they impact our epistemic horizon. We make the case that a general theory of digital tools in humanities research is necessary (and even overdue). Such a theory would be a shared set of principles and rules, to ascertain the effects of any given specific technological assemblage on a given community of practice. We further posit that digital tools are following a fast naturalization process, and that collaboration is necessary to avoid epistemic blind spots and to cover the various ways in which humanists relate and use digital tools. This article attempts to fill these gaps in three steps: it first demonstrates that today’s knowledge production occurs within an epistemic horizon shaped by digitality, even, or especially, outside digital humanities. Secondly, it recognizes the value of a plurality of phenomenal research experience with digital tools and establishes a method to visualize this diversity. Finally, it proposes a framework to integrate different forms of expertise and knowledge to create a collaborative theory of scholars–digital tools interactions. This framework, a protocol dubbed a plurilogue, is a nine-step process to foster acculturation and collaboration, which could be used on many other questions than the one covered in the current article. Malgré la prévalence croissante des outils numériques dans la recherche en sciences humaines, nous ne disposons pas d’une théorie complète sur la manière dont ces technologies influencent et modifient nos processus et résultats de recherche. La transition des méthodes analogiques vers les outils numériques est rapide et omniprésente, mais seuls quelques-uns de ces outils ont été théorisés en tant que pratiques de recherche. Pendant ce temps, de nouvelles technologies continuent de façonner, limiter, transformer et permettre la recherche : les logiciels matériel informatique (hardware), bases de données et algorithmes ne sont pas politiquement neutres, et ils ont des impacts importants sur notre horizon épistémique. Nous soutenons qu’une théorie générale des outils numériques dans la recherche en sciences humaines est nécessaire (et se fait attendre depuis trop longtemps). Une telle théorie consisterait en un ensemble partagé de principes et de règles permettant de déterminer les effets d’un assemblage technologique donné sur une communauté de pratique donnée. Nous affirmons également que les outils numériques suivent un processus rapide de naturalisation, et que la collaboration est nécessaire pour éviter les angles morts épistémiques et couvrir les diverses manières dont les humanistes se rapportent aux outils numériques et les utilisent. Cet article tente de combler ces lacunes en trois étapes : il démontre d’abord que la production de connaissances aujourd’hui s’inscrit dans un horizon épistémique façonné par la digitalité, même, ou surtout, en dehors des humanités numériques. Ensuite, il reconnaît la valeur d’une pluralité d’expériences phénoménologiques de recherche avec des outils numériques et établit une méthode pour visualiser cette diversité. Enfin, il propose un cadre permettant d’intégrer différentes formes d’expertise et de savoir afin de créer une théorie collaborative des interactions entre les chercheurs et les outils numériques. Ce cadre, un protocole appelé plurilogue, est un processus en neuf étapes destiné à favoriser l’acculturation et la collaboration, qui pourrait être appliqué à de nombreuses autres questions que celle abordée dans cet article.","",""
