"2002","Children's Influence on Internet Access at Home: Adoption and use in the family context","In this study, an integrated quantitative and qualitative research design was employed. From over 900 telephone interviews a typology of family types based on possession of media appliances was constructed, then divided into 'traditional' (low media density), 'intermediate' (average media density) and 'multimedia' (high media density) families. This typology was then used as a basis for selecting thirty-eight families for in-depth interviews. Of these, thirty-one contained children and it is these that form the basis for this article. The results of the family interviews indicate that children are a very important factor in the acquisition and use of the Internet. It was apparent from our interviews that Internet access and use become major issues in family discussions and conflicts - both between parents and children and between siblings.","",""
"2003","Public Internet Access for Young Children in the Inner City: Evidence to Inform Access Subsidy and Content Regulation","Significant U.S. policy initiatives in the late 1990s were intended to control Internet access, privacy, and indecency--specifically among children. This study reflects on these using quantitative data from a computer center in a children's library in the inner city. Researchers gathered 16 weeks of page requests ( n = 203,647) using """"click stream"""" and behavioral data, and analyzed these using nonparametric tests. Findings show that users are highly influenced by each other and browse only a small universe of sites. Game playing and communicating with individuals (via e-mail and chat) were the most popular uses. Children were uninterested in pornography and sites directed toward children. Advertising was extremely common. Children were most likely to engage in sharing when using games and chat. For this population, access, privacy and indecency initiatives to control Internet use fails to achieve its stated goals, but activities that encourage sharing in public places hold some promise for building computer knowledge.","",""
"2003","Children's Use of the Internet: Reflections on the Emerging Research Agenda"," As domestic access to the internet reaches the mass market in industrialized countries, this article identifies and evaluates the emerging research agenda, focusing particularly on children and young people. The nature of children's internet use generates public anxieties which both guide and undermine research, complicating the already challenging study of children within the privacy of the home. The body of empirical work reviewed is still small, but already key questions of academic and policy significance are being addressed regarding the opportunities and dangers of internet use. Such opportunities include communication, identity and participation, and education, learning and literacy; dangers arising from exclusion and the digital divide, and from certain kinds of use relating to inappropriate or undesirable contact, content and commercialism. In each of these domains, research strengths and gaps for future research are identified. The article concludes by noting areas of theoretical consensus and uncertainty framing the research agenda in this field. ","",""
"2006","Family characteristics and intergenerational conflicts over the Internet","The rapid expansion of computer use and Internet connection has the potential to change patterns of family interaction, with conflicts arising over adolescents' autonomy, parental authority and control of the computer. This study applied a conceptual framework derived from family development and human ecology theory to investigate family characteristics related to the likelihood of such conflicts. A secondary analysis was conducted of a special survey of 754 children aged 12 to 17 who used the Internet, and of their parents, performed by Pew Internet and the American Life project. Adolescent–parent conflicts over Internet use proved strongly related to the perception that the adolescent was a computer expert. Families in which adolescents were considered experts in new technologies were more likely to experience conflicts. Parents' attempt to reduce adolescent autonomy by regulating the time of Internet use increased the likelihood of family arguments over the Internet. Intergenerational conflicts over the Internet were higher in families in which parents expressed concern over the potentially negative consequences of Internet use. The implications of the findings are discussed.","",""
"2007","Taking risks when communicating on the Internet: the role of offline social-psychological factors in young people's vulnerability to online risks","Children and young people encounter a range of risks on the internet relating to communication. Making friends online has attracted particular attention as a risky behaviour, especially when this leads to offline meetings, as has giving out personal information online. This article, based on the ‘UK Children Go Online’ survey, seeks to explain the online communication of 9–19-year-olds in terms of their offline socio-psychological characteristics (shyness, life satisfaction, risk-taking), family communication patterns and online behaviour/skills. Findings show that older teens engage in more online communication activities than do younger children and so encounter more communication risks. Although girls communicate more on the internet, this seems not to put them more at risk. It was found that children's offline social psychological characteristics, particularly their levels of life satisfaction and risk-taking, influence their online communication, with different online communication activities being predicted by different patterns of off- and online characteristics. There are weak indications that, in families which have a more conversational style of communication, teens may take fewer risks online, including a lower likelihood of meeting online friends offline. Multiple regression analyses show that those children and teens who are less satisfied with their lives and who have become more frequent and skilled internet users are more likely to value the internet as a communicative environment in which they feel more confident than they do offline, particularly in relation to the potential for anonymous communication. Since this in turn leads some into risky activities, the implications for research and policy are discussed.","",""
"2009","MYTHS AND MISSED OPPORTUNITIES","Young people's use of online communication has increasingly become a concern for policy-makers, professionals, and parents. Sharing personal information and grooming or sexual solicitation by online predators have been prominent on the list of dangers. However, little research exists to support fears. This paper reviews the data we do have and shows that, far from being a major problem, the risks from online communication are small-scale and largely focused upon particular groups within the population. Furthermore, they are often misrepresented by safety campaigns and largely within the competencies of young people to manage. It goes on to argue that the over-zealous risk discourse may prevent many benefits of online communication being experienced by young people. Furthermore, the potential for using communication tools as policy vehicles has been largely ignored. The paper concludes by suggesting how risk discourses can be refined to more accurately reflect reality and also how professionals can harness the potential of online communication to benefit young people's lives.","",""
"2009","CHILDREN AND ONLINE RISK","Research on the risks associated with children's use of the internet often aims to inform policies of risk prevention. Yet paralleling the effort to map the nature and extent of online risk is a growing unease that the goal of risk prevention tends to support an over-protective, risk-averse culture that restricts the freedom of online exploration that society encourages for children in other spheres. It is central to adolescence that teenagers learn to anticipate and cope with risk – in short, to become resilient. In this article, we inquire into children and teenagers' responses after they have experienced online content or contact risks. Pan-European findings show that especially in Northern European countries with high internet access, parental perception of likelihood of online risk to their child is negatively associated with their perceived ability to cope. A comparison of representative surveys conducted among children in three relatively ‘high risk’ countries (Norway, Ireland and the United Kingdom) found that although the frequency of exposure to perceived online risks, especially content risks, is fairly high, most children adopt positive (e.g. seek help from friends) or, more commonly, neutral (e.g. ignoring the experience) strategies to cope, although a minority exacerbate the risks (e.g. passing risky content on to friends). Most strategies tend to exclude adult involvement. Significant differences in both risk and coping are found by gender and age across these countries, pointing to different styles of youthful risk management.","",""
"2010","Balancing opportunities and risks in teenagers’ use of the internet: the role of online skills and internet self-efficacy"," Many hopes exist regarding the opportunities that the internet can offer to young people as well as fears about the risks it may bring. Informed by research on media literacy, this article examines the role of selected measures of internet literacy in relation to teenagers’ online experiences. Data from a national survey of teenagers in the UK ( N = 789) are analyzed to examine: first, the demographic factors that influence skills in using the internet; and, second (the main focus of the study), to ask whether these skills make a difference to online opportunities and online risks. Consistent with research on the digital divide, path analysis showed the direct influence of age and socioeconomic status on young people’s access, the direct influence of age and access on their use of online opportunities, and the direct influence of gender on online risks. The importance of online skills was evident insofar as online access, use and skills were found to mediate relations between demographic variables and young people’s experience of online opportunities and risks. Further, an unexpected positive relationship between online opportunities and risks was found, with implications for policy interventions aimed at reducing the risks of internet use. ","",""
"2011","A Review of “Kids Online: Opportunities and Risks for Children”","My six-year-old nephew was visiting recently, along with his younger sister. It was my turn to entertain them. When my nephew saw my iPod he asked if there were any games on it. I said, “No, we are going to play with blocks.” “What kind of game is that?” he asked. He had apparently not heard of a computer game or iPod app by that name. I then produced the basket of real wood blocks—the blocks his dad had played with as a child. He and his sister then proceeded to construct a beautiful basketball court to hold a handmade wooden hoop and ball on a string. Are there risks, as well as opportunities, in playing with blocks? Sure. There can be some sibling disagreements about placement. They might pile too high and fall on a hand or foot. But they also enable the creative spirit to flow where the mind leads, tells the hand to place something where the eye has envisioned it, and so on. A great sense of pride and accomplishment—or possibly frustration and hurt—may follow. Much of the discussion about children’s use of the Internet, at least in the United States, has focused on the risks involved, and the decline of opportunities for creative handson entertainment and learning available through tools as simple as wooden blocks (Lenhart 2005; Becker 2004; Ybarra and Mitchell 2008; Polly Klass Foundation 2005). But three decades or so down the road since the beginning of home use of the Internet, as opposed to just scholarly, commercial, and government use, the discourse, at least in this volume, has begun to shift. Risks are still a primary interest of researchers and of donor organizations that fund research on children’s Internet use. In fact, such risk-driven research is on the rise. Yet the European editors and authors of Kids Online: Opportunities and Risks for Children call for a more nuanced approach with a greater sense of balance between risks and opportunities (23, figure 2.4). The multiple authors in this volume draw much of their data from almost 400 separate studies conducted across Europe. The network of research teams in twenty-one countries was called the EU Kids Online Project. It gathered data from 2006 to 2009. Indicative of the driving concern about risks, the study was funded by the European Commission’s Safer Internet Plus Programme. It was commissioned to identify and analyze studies concerning the intersection of children under age 18 years and their families, online technologies, and Europe-based empirical research on risk and safety. For those interested in examining the entire database of the 400 studies, it is available online at http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/EUKidsOnline/. The collection policy for the study is detailed at http://www.eukidsonline.net/. Some 46 percent of the mainly quantitative studies examined for this report include at least one aspect related to risks. Some of the leading risk concerns in the studies are: exposure to harmful or offensive content (25 percent); contact with strangers (25 percent); encountering sexual, racist, or hateful material (22 percent); revealing personal information (22 percent); and cyberbullying (15 percent), (24, table 2.1). Approaches to these and other risks and dangers associated with the Internet are compared across countries and analyzed in the context of varying cultural values.","",""
"2012","The influences of information literacy, internet addiction and parenting styles on internet risks"," The purpose of this study is to examine how demographics, addiction symptoms, information literacy, parenting styles and internet activities can predict ‘internet risks’. Data were gathered from a probability sample of 718 adolescents and teenagers, aged 9–19 in Hong Kong, using face-to-face interviews. Results show that adolescents who are often targets of harassment tend to be older boys with a high family income. They are targets probably because they spend a lot of time on social networking sites (SNSs) and prefer the online setting. Adolescents who encounter a lot of unwelcome solicitation of personal or private information online tend to be older girls. In information literacy, they are generally very competent with publishing tools but are not structurally literate, especially in understanding how information is socially situated and produced. Implications and recommendations for future research are discussed. ","",""
"2012","Mothers’ and fathers’ insights into teenagers’ use of the internet"," Previous research indicates that parents have limited insight into their teenagers’ activities and experiences on the internet. The purpose of the present study was therefore to investigate associations between mothers’ and fathers’ insight and teenagers’ experiences of the internet. A total of 538 teenagers (242 girls, 296 boys), aged between 13 and 15, and their 798 parents (491 mothers, 307 fathers) participated in the present study. Findings revealed that parental trust in sensible teenage internet use and parental active participation in teenage internet use were related to parental insight into teenage experiences on the internet. It is possible that a relationship based on trust and active engagement facilitates parental insight into teenage activities. ","",""
"2013","Exploring gender differences in Malaysian urban adolescent Internet usage","This study explored gender differences in urban adolescent Internet access, usage and motives. Data were collected from 914 urban school students in Malaysia. Factor analysis revealed that eroticism, entertainment, social-interaction, shopping and information/ surveillance are the key drivers for adolescence Internet usage. No differences between boys and girls were detected in Internet accessibility and home computer ownership. Boys and girls differed in their intensity of usage, place of access and their motivations to use the Internet. Girls were more motivated by social-interaction, shopping and surveillance/ information, while boys were more motivated by eroticism and had a higher tendency to be addicted to the Internet. However, boys and girls did not exhibit any significant differences in online entertainment motivation.","",""
"2013","Parental restrictive mediation of children’s internet use: Effective for what and for whom?"," The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of parental restrictive mediation and to examine the effects of restrictive mediation on children’s internet use. Data were obtained through a survey of Korean children from fourth to ninth grade, and their parents. According to the findings, the age of a child, parental perception of the negative influence of the internet, parental perception of their child’s low self-control, and parental internet skills were significant predictors of restrictive mediation. Restrictive mediation was significantly associated with reduced online risks and reduced time spent online, and was not associated with addictive use. In particular, the effects of restrictive mediation on online time and online risks were greater for a child with low self-control. This study advances the understanding of the effects, predictors and moderators of restrictive mediation. ","",""
"2015","Digitods: Toddlers, Touch Screens and Australian Family Life","Introduction Children are beginning to use digital technologies at younger and younger ages. The emerging trend of very young children (babies, toddlers and pre-schoolers) using Internet connected devices, especially touch screen tablets and smartphones, has elicited polarising opinions from early childhood experts. At present there is little actual research about the risks or benefits of tablet and smartphone use by very young children. Current usage recommendations, based on research into passive television watching which claims that screen time is detrimental, is in conflict with advice from education experts and app developers who commend interactive screen time as engaging and educational. Guidelines from the health professions typically advise strict time limits on very young children’s screen-time. Based for the most part on policy developed by the American Academy of Paediatrics, it is usually recommended that children under two have no screen time at all (Brown), and children over this age have no more than two hours a day (Strasburger, et al.).  On the other hand, early childhood education guidelines promote the development of digital literacy skills (Department of Education). Further, education-based research indicates that access to computers and the Internet in the preschool years is associated with overall educational achievement (Bittman et al.; Cavanaugh et al; Judge et al; Neumann). The US based National Association for Education of Young Children’s position statement on technology for zero to eight year-olds declares that “when used intentionally and appropriately, technology and interactive media are effective tools to support learning and development” (NAEYC). This article discusses the notion of Digitods—a name for those children born since the introduction of the iPhone in 2007 who have ready access to touchscreen technologies since birth.  It reports on the limited availability of evidence-based research about these children’s ICT use concluding that current research and recommendations are not grounded in the everyday life of very young children and their families. The article then reports on the beginnings of a research project funded by the Australian Research Council entitled Toddlers and Tablets: exploring the risks and benefits 0-5s face online. This research project recognises that at this stage it is parents who “are the real experts in their toddlers’ use of screen technologies. Accordingly, the project’s methodological approach draws on parents, pre-schoolers and their families as communities of practice in the construction of social meaning around toddlers’ use of touch screen technology. Digitods In 2000 Bill Gates introduced the notion of Generation I to describe the first cohort of children raised with the Internet as a reality in their lives. They are those born after the 1990s and will, in most cases; have no memory of life without the Net. [...] Generation I will be able to conceive of the Internet’s possibilities far more profoundly than we can today. This new generation will become agents of change as the limits of the Internet expand to include educational, scientific, and business applications that we cannot even imagine. (Gates)Digitods, on the other hand, is a term that has been used in education literature (Leathers et al.) to describe those children born after the introduction of the iPhone in 2007. These children often begin their lives with ready access to the Internet via easily usable touch screen devices, which could have been designed with toddlers’ touch and swipe movements in mind. Not only are they the youngest group of children to actively engage with the Internet they are the first group to grow up with a range of mobile Internet devices (Leathers et al.). The difference between Digitods and Gates’s Generation I is that Digitods are the first pre-verbal, non-ambulant infants to have ready access to digital technologies. Somewhere around the age of 10 months to fourteen months a baby learns to point with his or her forefinger. At this stage the child is ready to swipe and tap a touch screen (Leathers et al.). This is in contrast to laptops and PCs given that very young children often need assistance to use a mouse or keyboard. The mobility of touch screen devices allows very young children to play at the kitchen table, in the bedroom or on a car trip. These mobile devices have, of course, a myriad of mobile apps to go with them. These apps create an immediacy of access for infants and pre-schoolers who do not need to open a web browser to find their favourite sites. In the lives of these children it seems that it has always been possible to touch and swipe their way into games, books and creative and communicative experiences (Holloway et al. 149). The interactivity of most pre-school apps, as opposed to more passive screen activities such as watching television shows or videos (both offline or online), requires toddlers and pre-schoolers to pay careful attention, think about things and act purposefully (Leathers et al.). It is this interactivity which is the main point of difference, one which holds the potential to engage and educate our youngest children. It should be noted within this discussion about Digitods that, while the trope Digital Natives tends to homogenise an entire generation, the authors do not assume that all children born today are Digitods by default. Many children do not have the same privileged opportunities as others, or the (parental) cultural capital, to enable access, ease of use and digital skill development. In addition to this it is not implied that Digitods will be more tech savvy than their older siblings. The term is used more to describe and distinguish those children who have digital access almost since birth—in order to differentiate or tease out everyday family practices around these children’s ICT use and the possible risks and benefits this access affords babies, toddlers and pre-schoolers. While the term Digital Native has also been criticised as being a white middle class phenomenon this is not necessarily the case with Digitods. In the Southeast Asia and the Pacific region developed countries like Japan, Korea, New Zealand and Singapore have extremely high rates of touchscreen use by very young children (Child Sciences; Jie; Goh; Unantenne). Other countries such as the Philippines and Indonesia have moved to a high smart phone usage by very young children while at the same time have only nascent ICT access and instruction within their education systems (Unantenne). The Digitod Parent Parents of Digitods are usually experienced Internet users themselves, and many are comfortable with their children using these child-friendly touch screen devices (Findahl). Digital technologies are integral to their everyday lives, often making daily life easier and improving communication with family and friends, even during the high pressure parenting years of raising toddlers and pre-schoolers.  Even though many parents and caregivers are enabling very young children’s use of touch screen technologies, they are also concerned about the changes they are making. This is because very young children’s use of touch screen devices “has become another area where they fear possible criticism and in which their parental practices risk negative evaluation by others” (Holloway et al). The tensions between expert advice regarding young children’s screen-time and parents’ and caregivers’ own judgments are also being played out online. Parenting blogs, online magazines and discussion groups are all joining in the debate: On the one hand, parents want their children to swim expertly in the digital stream that they will have to navigate all their lives; on the other hand, they fear that too much digital media, too early, will sink them. Parents end up treating tablets like precision surgical instruments, gadgets that might perform miracles for their child’s IQ and help him win some nifty robotics competition—but only if they are used just so. (Rosin)Thus, with over 80 000 children’s apps marketed as educational in the Apple App Store alone, parents can find it difficult to choose apps that are worth purchasing (Yelland). Nonetheless, recent research regarding Australian children shows that three to five year olds who access touch screen devices will typically have five or more specific apps to choose from (5.23 on average) (Neumann). With little credible evidence or considered debate, parents have been left to make their own choices about the pros and cons of their young children’s access to touch screens. Nonetheless, one immediate benefit that comes to mind is toddlers and pre-schoolers video chatting with dispersed family member—due to increased globalisation, guest worker arrangements, FIFO (fly-in fly-out) workforces and family separation or divorce. Such clear benefits around sociability and youngsters’ connection with significant others make previous screen-related guidelines out of date and no longer contextually relevant.  Little Research Attention Family ownership of tablet devices as well as touch screen phones has risen dramatically in the last five years. With very young children being loaned these technologies by mum or dad, and a tendency in Australia to rely on market-orientated research regarding ownership and usage, there is very little knowledge about touch screen usage rates for very young Australian children.  UK and US usage figures indicate that over the last few years there has been a five-fold increase in tablet uptake by zero to eight year olds (Ofcom; Rideout). Although large scale, comparative Australian data is not available, previous research regarding older children indicates that Australia is similar to high use countries like some Scandinavian nations and the UK (Green et al.). In addition to this, two small research projects in Australia, with under 160 participant families each, indicate that two thirds of these children (0-5) use touchscreen devices (Neumann; Coenenna et. al.). Beyond usage figures, there is also very limited evidence-based research about very young children’s app use. Interactive technologies available via touch screen technologies have been available domestically for a very short time. Consequently, “valid scientific research has not been completed and replicated due to [the lack of] available time” (Leathers el al. 129) and longitudinal studies which rely on an intervention group (in this case exposure to children’s apps) and a control group (no exposure) are even fewer and more time-consuming.  Interestingly, researchers have revisited the issue of passive screen viewing. A recent 2015 review of previous 2007 research, which linked babies watching videos with poor language development, has found that there was statistical and methodological issues with the 2007 study and that there are no strong inferences to be drawn between media exposure and language development (Ferguson and Donellan). Thus, there seems to be no conclusive evidence-based research on which to inform parents and educators about the possible downside or benefits of touch screen use. Nonetheless, early childhood experts have been quick to weigh in on the possible effects of screen usage, some providing restrictive guidelines and recommendations, with others advocating the use of interactive apps for very young children for their educational value.  This knowledge-gap disguises what is actually happening in the lives of real Australian families. Due to the lack of local data, as well as worldwide research, it is essential that Australian researchers obtain a comprehensive understanding about actual behaviour around touch screen use in the lives of children aged between zero and five and their families. Beginning Research While research into very young children’s touch screen use is beginning to take place, few results have been published. When researching two to three year olds’ learning from interactive versus non-interactive videos  Kirkorian, Choi and Pempek found that “toddlers may learn more from interactive media than from non-interactive video” (Kirkorian et al).  This means that the use of interactive apps on touch screen devices may hold a greater potential for learning than passive video or television viewing for children in this age range.  Another study considered the degree to which the young children could navigate to and use apps on touch screen devices by observing and analysing YouTube videos of infants and young children using touch screens (Hourcade et al.). It was found that between the ages of 12 months and 17 months the children filmed seemed to begin to “make meaningful use of the tablets [and] more than 90 per cent of children aged two [had] reached this level of ability” (1923).  The kind of research mentioned above, usually the preserve of psychologists, paediatricians and some educators, does not, however, ground very young children’s use in their domestic context—in the spaces and with those people with whom most touch screen usage takes place. With funding from the Australian Research Council Australian, Irish and UK researchers are about to adopt a media studies (domestication) approach to comprehensively investigate digital media use in the everyday lives of very young children.  This Australian-based research project positions very young children’s touch screen use within the family and will help provide an understanding of the everyday knowledge and strategies that this cohort of technology users (very young children and their parents) have already developed—in the knowledge vacuum left by the swift appropriation and incorporation of these new media technologies into the lives of families with very young children. Whilst using a conventional social constructionist perspective, the project will also adopt a co-creation of knowledge approach. The co-creation of knowledge approach (Fong) has links with the communities of practice literature (Wegner) and recognises that parents, care-givers and the children themselves are the current experts in this field in terms of the everyday uses of these technologies by very young children. Families’ everyday discourse and practices regarding their children’s touch screen use do not necessarily work through obvious power hierarchies (via expert opinions), but rather through a process of meaning making where they shape their own understandings and attitudes through experience and shared talk within their own everyday family communities of practice. This Toddlers and Tablets research is innovative in many ways. It seeks to capture the enthusiasm of young children’s digital interactions and to pioneer new ways of ‘beginnings’ researching with very young children, as well as with their parents. The researchers will work with parents and children in their broad domestic contexts (including in and out-of-home activities, and grandparental and wider-family involvement) to co-create knowledge about young children’s digital technologies and the social contexts in which these technologies are used.  Aspects of these interactions, such as interviews and observations of everyday digital interactions will be recorded (audio and video respectively). In addition to this, data collected from media commentary, policy debates, research publications and learned articles from other disciplinary traditions will be interrogated to see if there are correlations, contrasts, trends or synergies between parents’ construction of meaning, public commentary and current research. Critical discourse tools and methods (Chouliaraki and Fairclough) will be used to analyse verbatim transcripts, video, and all written materials.  Conclusion Very young children are uniquely dependent upon others for the basic necessities of life and for the tools they need, and will need to develop, to claim their place in the world. Given the ubiquitous role played by digital media in the lives of their parents and other caregivers it would be a distortion of everyday life for children to be excluded from the technologies that are routinely used to connect with other people and with information.  In the same way that adults use digital media to renew and strengthen social and emotional bonds across distance, so young children delight in ‘Facetime’ and other technologies that connect them audio-visually with friends and family members who are not physically co-present.  Similarly, a very short time spent in the company of toddlers using touch screens is sufficient to demonstrate the sheer delight that these young infants have in developing their sense of agency and autonomy (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXV-yaFmQNk).  Media, communications and cultural studies are beginning to claim a space for evidence based policy drawn from everyday activities in real life contexts. Research into the beginnings of digital life, with families who are beginning to find a way to introduce these technologies to the youngest generation, integrating them within social and emotional repertoires, may prove to be the start of new understandings into the communication skills of the preverbal and preliterate young people whose technology preferences will drive future development – with their parents likely trying to keep pace.   Acknowledgment  This research is supported under Australia Research Council’s Discovery Projects funding scheme (project number DP150104734).

"2015","The Power of Youth: How the Bottom-up Technology Transmission from Children to Parents is Related to Digital (In)equality","This study explores to what extent youths’ perceived influence on their parents’ adoption of and learning about digital media is related to digital inequality. Particularly, it investigates whether bottom-up technology transmission is associated with a possible reduction of socioeconomic-, age-, and gender-based digital gaps. Using a dyadic survey conducted in Chile, this study found that youths’ perceived influence on their parents’ adoption of digital media and their learning processes were associated with reductions of socioeconomic gaps in technology use, particularly regarding computer and Internet use.","",""
"2015","Evidence on the extent of harms experienced by children as a result of online risks: implications for policy and research","Intense media and policy focus on issues of online child protection have prompted a resurgence of moral panics about children and adolescents' Internet use, with frequent confounding of different types of risk and harm and little reference to empirical evidence of actual harm. Meanwhile, within the academic literature, the quantity and quality of studies detailing the risks and opportunities of online activity for children and young people has risen substantially in the past 10 years, but this is also largely focused on risk rather than evidence of harm. Whilst this is understandable given the methodological and ethical challenges of studying Internet-related harms to minors, the very concept of risk is dependent on some prior understanding of harm, meaning that without efforts to study what harms are connected with children's online experiences, discussions of risk lack a strong foundation. This article makes a key contribution to the field by reviewing available evidence about the scale and scope of online harms from across a range of disciplines and identifying key obstacles in this research area as well as the major policy implications. The findings are based on a review of 148 empirical studies. Results were found in relation to main types of harms: health-related harms as a result of using pro-eating disorder, self-harm or pro-suicide websites; sex-related harms such as Internet-initiated sexual abuse of minors and cyber-bullying.","",""
"2015","Parental socialization of children’s Internet use: A qualitative approach"," This study explores how parents feel about the Internet and its impact on children, how they manage children’s Internet use, and how they view the role of various socialization agents in creating a safer Internet environment for children. In-depth interviews with parents of children aged 7–12 revealed that parents presumed more positive than negative influence of the Internet on their children and felt confident about their ability to manage their children’s Internet use. This high confidence in their own management, however, seemed to lead parents to be less engaged in purposeful and communication-based parental mediation and be less interested in updating their Internet knowledge. Nonetheless, they argued that parents should be actively engaged in communication with their children and be equipped with Internet knowledge to promote a safer online environment for children. Implications of the findings are discussed and suggestions for future research are provided. ","",""

It also explored structural factors that play a role in this bottom-up process, such as socio-economic differences and gender. Finally, it examined the relationship between this bottom-up technology transmission process and parents’ levels of internet self-efficacy and online activities. Drawing from socialization and diffusion of innovation research and using a self-administered random mail survey, we found that children play a role in including their parents in the digital environment, particularly among women, people who are older (35 years old and above), and belong to lower socio-economic groups. We also found that this bottom-up technology transmission is somewhat negatively associated with parents’ internet self-efficacy. Implications and possible interpretations of these results are discussed. ","",""
"2016","Internet risks and expert views: a case study of the insider perspectives of youth workers in Hong Kong","This study collects and analyses the viewpoints of front-line youth workers regarding the notion of ‘Internet risks’. Previous studies have examined and discussed various dangers of the Internet. Parental, school, and governmental interventions are often called for by those concerned. The implicit assumption is that these are the people who possess the expertise to tackle the problems at hand. Through participation in three forums focusing on ‘Internet risks’, and in-depth interviews with 10 such ‘experts’ in Hong Kong, the study examines if this is a valid assumption. It finds that experts perceive Internet risks rather differently. In addition to the more conventional views about content, contact and conduct risks, our interviewees are aware that a new order is quickly emerging in the new media environment. Despite being considered as ‘experts’, they do not necessarily know how to tackle the so-called ‘youth-at-risk’. Rather, they are exploring how they would capitalize on the opportunities offered by the developments. The key findings highlight the need to critically review the notion of ‘Internet risks’. As with other risk frameworks, the ultimate aim is to develop intervention programmes. In this regard, risks are often treated as concrete problems that can be solved. Youth experts, however, find that the changing scope, speed and persistence of communication in today's information society present the biggest challenge in youth work. The existing framework of risks was unable to describe and account for such risks. In response, Internet risk has to be reconceptualized so that more updated, relevant and imaginative intervention can be introduced.","",""
"2016","Boys and girls taking risks online: A gendered perspective on social context and adolescents’ risky online behavior"," This study explores gender differences in the relationship between adolescents’ risky online behavior and their social context, as in family factors and the prevalence of Internet use in a country. Using the EU Kids Online dataset, including information on 8554, 14- to 16-year-old adolescents in 25 countries, and applying multilevel modeling, this study shows that social context is additionally and differentially related to adolescent boys’ and girls’ risky online behavior. When taking individual characteristics such as sensation seeking and digital skills into account, particularly for male adolescents, growing up in a single-parent household and lacking parental co-use increases the chance of online risk behavior. Adolescents, especially males, however, are less likely to participate in risky online behavior in societies where Internet use is widespread. Overall, this study shows that it is important to take account of individual and social factors when explaining adolescents’ online risk taking and gender differences herein. ","",""
"2017","How does “talking about the Internet with others” affect teenagers’ experience of online risks? The role of active mediation by parents, peers, and school teachers"," This study investigated how active mediation employed by three key socialization agents—parents, peers, and school teachers—is associated with teenagers’ engagement in online risks. A survey with 746 students aged 12–18 years found that different socialization agents focus on different aspects of the Internet when they engage in active mediation. Parents and teachers focus more on making instructive remarks whereas peers are more likely to engage in neutral facets of active mediation (e.g. helping or recommending). However, parental mediation tends to diminish whereas peer mediation tends to escalate with age among teens. The findings also suggest that school teachers’ Internet-related discussions can reduce teens’ potential exposure to online risks while peer interactions may increase teens’ vulnerability to online risks.

"2018","Youth interaction with online strangers: experiences and reactions to unknown people on the Internet","ABSTRACT Previous research on youths’ experiences with online strangers has mostly utilized quantitative designs which may result in the omission of important parts of the youths’ experiences and perceptions. In this qualitative study, we adopt a child-centred approach and focus on the children’s and adolescents’ experiences with unknown people from the Internet. This is one of the most pronounced parental concerns, despite the fact that an online presence is now normative for most children. We use the data from focus-groups and individual interviews in nine European countries (N = 368) conducted with youths between the ages of 9 and 16 years. Participants were asked about their perceptions of potentially negative or problematic situations while using the Internet and digital technology. Using thematic analysis, we classified youths’ experiences and reactions related to interacting with online strangers in four themes: (1) non-verbal interaction; (2) initiation of contact; (3) communication; and (4) face-to-face meeting. In all four levels of interactions, children and adolescents reported a variety of positive and negative experiences and reactions. We interpret our findings with a co-construction model which perceives children and adolescents as active participants in the online world. We conclude that children are successfully making active decisions to initiate, continue, and stop interactions with unknown people from the Internet. These findings broaden the current perspectives of youths’ meetings with unknown people online.","",""
"2018","When digital natives instruct digital immigrants: active guidance of parental media use by children and conflict in the family","ABSTRACT Based on the premise that children are active agents who influence their parents’ media use, this study investigated child–parent digital media guidance. Children often introduce new media into the family and influence parents’ media adoption and use. This study also investigated whether this child–parent digital media guidance is associated with media conflicts in the family. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 187 parent–child dyads in Flanders, Belgium. Paired samples t-tests and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted. The results showed that both children and parents reported that children guide their parents how to use digital media, especially for newer media forms such as smartphones, tablets, and apps. Families where there was more child–parent digital media guidance reported more conflicts about media. These relationships were comparable in the parent and child reports.","",""
"2018","Is big brother more at risk than little sister? The sibling factor in online risk and opportunity"," This article uses data from the 25,142-child study EU Kids Online to investigate the impact of sibling status on a child’s experience of online risk and opportunities. In general, the effects associated with having a sibling appear to be comparatively small. The presence of older siblings slightly increases use and skills, while younger siblings are associated with slight reductions. These dynamics are particularly visible in the use of social networking sites. Older siblings have the effect of increasing the range and number of online activities pursued by their younger siblings. Patterns around concerning exposure to risk and possible harm are not straightforward but younger children with an older sibling are not at an increased risk. Where younger aged children have even younger siblings, this is associated with a slight reduction in risk, whereas older-aged children with a younger sibling, and only children, appear to experience slight increases in risk.

"2018","Online opportunities and risks for children and adolescents: The role of digital skills, age, gender and parental mediation in Brazil"," This article presents a study that applies integrated and multi-factor path analysis to report the direct and indirect effects of young Brazilian individual and home factors on their online opportunities and risks. The results show that engaging in more online opportunities, being older and having a lower level of parental mediation are associated with a higher number of online risks. At the same time, being older, having Internet access at home, having parents with a higher educational level, possessing more digital skills and receiving a higher level of co-use and active parental mediation are positively associated with online opportunities. Although restrictive parental mediation is negatively associated with online risks, it also reduces opportunities. In addition, co-use and active mediation are positively associated with parental educational level. These findings offer a starting point to understand children’s online behaviour and digital inclusion in Latin America and analyse its differences with other regions. ","",""
"2018","European research on children’s internet use: Assessing the past and anticipating the future"," In this article, we reflect critically on the research agenda on children’s Internet use, framing our analysis using Wellman’s three ages of Internet studies and taking as our case study the three phases of research by the EU Kids Online network from 2006 to 2014. Following the heyday of moral panics, risk discourses and censorious policy-making that led to the European Commission’s first Internet Action Plan 1999–2002, EU Kids Online focused on conceptual clarification, evidence review and debunking of myths, thereby illustrating the value of systematic documentation and mapping, and grounding academic, public and policy-makers’ understanding of ‘the Internet’ in children’s lives. Consonant with Wellman’s third age, which emphasizes analysis and contextualization, the EU Kids Online model of children’s online risks and opportunities helps shift the agenda from how children engage with the Internet as a medium to how they engage with the world mediated by the Internet.

Comprising two subscales, this 16-item measure was tested in a pilot study and then included in an online survey of 356 grandparents. The mediation constructs had good internal homogeneity, significant interconstruct correlations, and high loadings on a single latent factor for each subscale. Scores were well distributed along the range. A concurrent validity test indicated a significant negative association between attitudes toward media and restrictive mediation. These findings suggest that the new scale is reliable and useful.","",""

The findings suggest that among Internet users, about one-fourth learned from their children and a similar percentage relied on them to perform different tasks. Both the quantitative and qualitative results suggest that in many families, both processes are closely intertwined and are more likely to occur among people of a similar profile—women, older people, and less educated people. In addition, they are significantly associated with parents’ improved digital skills, but not with more online activities.","",""
"2019","Contextualizing connectivity: how internet connection type and parental factors influence technology use among lower-income children","ABSTRACT This project links research on digital inequality, which focuses on connection quality and its outcomes for under-connected individuals, and parental mediation, which focuses on the influence of parents on children’s technology experiences. We examine the internet connection type used by families, the technology experiences of lower-income parents, and their perceptions of opportunities that technology use offers their children. We then determine how these factors influence the frequency and scope of their school-age children’s technology use. Findings show that contextualizing children’s connectivity to account for infrastructural, socio-demographic, and relational influences provides new insights into the technology experiences of lower-income children. One set of findings suggests that direct benefit from increased connectivity is most evident for lower-income parents – those with the lowest household incomes, lowest levels of education, and whose dominant language is not English. These effects remain after controlling for other socio-demographic factors. The second set of results shows that greater connectivity increases how frequently both children and parents use the internet, but is associated only with a greater scope of internet activities for parents. Parents’ online activity scope is important for their children’s online experiences, directly predicting the scope of their online activities. High-scope parents were also significantly more likely to see digital opportunities in their children’s internet use, which in turn also predicted more frequent and broader internet use by their children. We conclude by considering the practical implications of these findings for digital equity initiatives targeting lower-income families.","",""
"2019","“I PREFER TO BUILD TRUST” – EXAMINING PARENTAL CONFIDENCE IN CHILDREN’S DIGITAL SKILLS","Digital and social media has become deeply intertwined into children’s mundane daily routines. Considered to be digital natives, young people are often assumed to be experts in using digital and social media. As they are indeed enthusiastic users of new devices and social media platforms, children might be quick in picking up on platform’s features and affordances. However, their ability for a strategic understanding of risks and opportunities is often questioned. Parental anxiety about children’s engagement with digital and social media stems from their lack of confidence in children’s ability to navigate online risk. While academic research attempted to identify and measure digital skills, less is known how these skills are negotiated in the family.&#x0D; Drawing on separate home-based interviews with children and parents, this paper looks at the approaches parents use to govern children’s digital and social media use. It discusses how confidence in children’s abilities – or varying degrees of it – affects the parental approach and success in working with their children on developing safe digital practices. Three dominant parental approaches identified across the sample are practices where parents act as *watchdog*, *chaperon* and/or *collaborator*. Central to each of these approaches are varying degrees of trust in children’s ability to engage in safe practices online.","",""
"2019","INTERNET SAFETY EDUCATION: HOW WE EDUCATE OUR GIRLS TO BEWARE OF OTHERS, AND OUR BOYS TO BEWARE OF THEMSELVES","Alongside its many advantages, the Internet presents a variety of challenges and risks to adolescents. From a perspective focusing on information flow processes, this study distinguishes between risks resulting from _exposure to information_, i.e. exposure of adolescents to inappropriate content: Harmful, sexual or violent, and risks resulting from _exposure of information_, i.e. disclosure of personal information online, privacy harms inflicted by the user or others, misuse of personal information which can result in identity theft, physical and sexual assault. The study examines gender differences in perceptions regarding adolescents’ online uses, habits and risks, and whether these lead to differences in emphasis of educational messages delivered by parents and teachers to adolescents. Based on a mixed-method study combining survey conducted among 513 adolescents and 50 semi-structured interviews with educators and adolescents, the findings illustrate how a common perception that girls share more personal information online and are (consequently) more vulnerable to online predators leads to more emphasis given on implications of personal information disclosure in messages delivered to girls. On the other hand, boys are considered naughty and nosy, searching for “forbidden”, mainly sexual, content, and emphasis is given on limiting and monitoring their searches and video consumption. Apparently, although parents, teachers and adolescents proclaim to be aware of the similar risks to boys and girls online, there is a message interwoven in internet safety education discourse: Girls are to be aware of others looking to harm them, and boys are to be aware of themselves, their curiosity and evil inclination.","",""
"2020","Parenting Style, Personality Traits, and Interpersonal Relationships: A Model of Prediction of Internet Addiction","This study examined how parenting style can help or hinder the development of healthy family relationships when Internet addiction is a concern. A sample of 700 middle school and 500 college students in Zhuhai (a special administrative city in Southern China) were surveyed using self-report questionnaire scales to examine the links among Internet addiction, parenting style, personality traits, and interpersonal communication skills. The findings indicate that problematic parenting styles, such as strict attitudes, heavy punishment, and regularly withholding affection significantly predict individuals’ Internet addiction. Dysfunctional parent–child relations can drive children to extensively use the Internet for escape. In addition, personality traits of introversion, tendency to lie, neuroticism, and psychoticism are positively associated with Internet addiction. Poor interpersonal skills are also linked to self-reported Internet addiction. This study found an interaction effect among parenting style, interpersonal relationships, and personality traits that produced a significant joint effect predicting Internet addiction. The findings provide some guidance for policy makers and professional counselors involved with youth and families struggling to treat Internet addiction.","",""

It includes six subscales: time management, compulsive Internet use, emotion adjustment influence, interpersonal and academic influence, preferred online social interaction, and daily life influence. This research utilized the survey method to understand the relationship between student backgrounds and their Internet use behaviors, and problematic Internet use. A total of 775 elementary school fifth and sixth graders from northern Taiwan were sampled based on the stratified random sampling method. There were 763 valid surveys. The results indicated that the factors of gender, parents’ attitudes towards Internet use, the time when subjects first started to use the Internet, number of hours spent getting online each time on weekdays, number of types of devices used to go online, and Internet activity preferences are significant. Boys have more serious problematic Internet use than girls. Different Internet activities present different risks of triggering problematic Internet use for male and female students. Students whose parents allow them to use the Internet without intervention have more serious problematic Internet use. Students exhibit more serious problematic internet use if they start using the Internet before beginning elementary school. When students use the Internet more and can go online using more types of devices, they tend to have more serious problematic Internet use. This study finds that students preferring Internet activities for recreational entertainment and social interaction have more serious problematic Internet use than students preferring Internet activities as learning tools.","",""

At the same time, however, children’s ‘natural’ process of development must be allowed to take its course. Digital media technologies promise to not only enhance children’s developmental capacity, but also threaten to disrupt their normal development. Drawing on qualitative research involving 40 Australian parents, this article examines parents’ concerns about their teenage children’s use of digital media. It examines how parents negotiate the tension between technological development and the benefits it affords their child, and the perceived risks that technological development poses to their child’s normal development, through mediating what they construct as positive and negative exposure to digital media. Parents distinguished between media use that was considered to enhance their child’s development and use that had the potential to disrupt it, by categorizing various activities as appropriate and inappropriate.

This study applied a multi-stage sampling technique to achieve an adequate representation of the population in six educational districts in Lagos, Nigeria. The study included 1,270 adult sample. Data were obtained through questionnaire from parents of children in the selected schools. Findings of the study showed that a strong and positive relationship exists between parent’s age and educational level and parent’s gender and educational level. These relationships were evident as strong moderating variables for the four mediation strategies measured in this study. It was found that, relating to the digital literacy of parents, the hierarchical regression analyses showed that only 7% of variance in parental mediation practice, in the case of participatory learning, was explained. By implication, the constructs of digital literacy are more relevant to participatory learning mediation practice compared to other parental mediation practices in the context of Nigerian families.

"2022","Familial digital mediation as a gendered issue between parents"," The different strategies explored by parents managing their children’s digital practices, the associated challenges, and the conditions for a successful outcome are central in the literature on digital mediation within families. However, few studies consider the family context in its entirety, which is essential if we wish to capture the meanings, perceptions, and negotiations that are played out in the daily family routine. Based on an ethnographic survey on the place of screens in Swiss families’ socialization processes, the paper shows, first, how paternal use undermines digital mediation within the family and, second, that this mediation is ultimately a maternal concern and responsibility. By interviewing all family members (including children) on their assessment of screen use by all family members (including parents), our research design provides access to the backstage of parental digital mediation. Our data shows that women confront fears and guilt in the face of social norms that a ‘good’ mother should regulate screens ‘well’ within her household. We conclude that parental digital mediation is embedded in a gendered social and relational context, where fathers and mothers do not adopt the same roles, the same duties, nor the same mental burden.

"2022","Emerging Digital Inequalities: A Comparative Study of Older Adults’ Smartphone Use"," Older adults are increasingly using smartphones. Researchers have identified demographic, attitudinal factors and social outcomes related to inequalities in access, skills, and activities of internet use. While this research has been ongoing for years, studies about the digital inequalities related to the use of smartphones by older adults are still scarce, and they rarely have undertaken sociocultural comparisons of usage. This article builds on an analysis of tracking data of older adults’ (pp. 55–79) smartphone use, to explore digital inequalities around traditional axes of inequality and sociocultural factors that shape older adults’ smartphone use. It adds a comparative perspective for understanding emerging inequalities related to sociocultural contexts to the existing literature. The results show that differences cannot be explained solely by sociodemographic factors, but also possibly by national policies and culture. Particularly, age, on its own, is not able to explain the differences reported. Older adults engage in a range of different activities on their smartphones, and differences between groups across the traditional axes of inequalities do not mirror exactly the differences found in previous research on internet use. This is important considering the risk of emerging new inequalities and the ongoing revisiting of policies to mitigate them. ","",""
"2023","Parental mediation of online interactions and its relation to adolescents’ contacts with new people online: the role of risk perception","ABSTRACT To ensure their children's safety online, parents can utilize number of strategies, including active and restrictive parental mediation. Active mediation encompasses parents discussing and advising children about safe usage of the internet, whereas restrictive mediation means limiting children's internet usage. Both strategies aim to affect children's online behavior, especially to minimize online risks. Using a sample of 1031 adolescents aged 11–17 (54% females) and structural equation modeling, we focused on the active and restrictive parental mediation of online interactions and their connections to adolescents’ potentially risky online contacts with new people. In addition, we considered the indirect effect of parental mediation on adolescents’ behavior through adolescents’ risk perception. In this way, we captured one of the potential explanatory mechanisms through which the parental mediation's effect occurs. The results showed that restrictive mediation decreased contacts with new people by increasing adolescents’ risk perception of this activity. In contrast, active mediation had neither a direct nor indirect effect on adolescents’ online contacts. The results enrich the theory of parental mediation by showing that risk perception is an important factor to consider when researchers examine the effects of parental mediation on children's potentially risky online behavior.","",""
"2023","Using the story completion method to explore Australian parent and child responses to online risk"," This study uses the story completion method to explore how young people and their parents respond to online risks. During 13 family workshops with Australian participants which utilised a participatory action research approach, 197 parents and children responded to hypothetical online risk scenarios by completing one of seven story ‘stems’. Reflexive thematic analysis of participants’ stories revealed empathy and compassion for the hypothetical protagonists, as well as a range of practical, technical and discursive/communicative strategies for addressing risk. Most participants – especially children – demonstrated a pragmatic approach that drew on a range of practical skills and knowledge, eschewing sensationalised accounts documenting worst-case scenarios. This study offers insights which may inform policy and educational approaches to online safety for adolescents, highlighting a need to move beyond a deficit and protectionist approach to minimising online risks for young people, towards recognition of children’s knowledge, competencies, agency and resilience.

Normatively, a four- to six-year-old child is expected to achieve numerous developmental milestones, as outlined in the nurturing early learners (NEL) framework. The NEL framework classifies these milestones under various learning domains, skills and competencies, namely Aesthetics and Creative Expression, Discovery of the World, Language and Literacy, Motor Skills Development, Numeracy, and Social and Emotional Development. Through qualitative interviews conducted with 21 parents (14 mothers and 7 fathers) online who spoke about their four- to six-year-old children, this study investigated how parents wielded digital devices to foster their children’s development in these key domains, but deliberately ring-fenced their children from pernicious use.","",""

A systematic review and meta-ethnography of research focusing on the understandings and experiences of digital resilience of children aged 8–12, their parents and educators identified 11 studies conducted since 2011 across 14 countries. Four main themes, ‘Using connective technologies’, ‘Risky online experiences’, ‘Mediation strategies’ (comprised of sub-themes ‘Proactive coping’ and ‘Reactive coping’), and ‘Risk and protective factors’ were constructed from our translation of first- and second-order constructs, with the overarching theme ‘ Constant balancing’ cross-cutting these themes. We argue one cannot have risky online experiences without the potential to develop digital resilience and vice versa. Insofar as current conceptualisations of digital resilience underestimate the role played by wider contexts, important knowledge gaps are highlighted. ","",""

Analysis of a survey of European parents distinguishes parental perceptions of the likelihood of risk and the severity of harm before testing the linearity of their relation to digital skills. Results show that parents with higher perceived control over online risk management and those with a broader set of digital skills are more involved in mediating their children’s online activities. The analysis also shows a non-linear, n-shaped relationship between parental skills and parental perception of the severity of harm. The results suggest that future research on parental mediation should distinguish parental knowledge of the digital world based on direct experience from their general perceptions of the likelihood of risk and severity of harm.
