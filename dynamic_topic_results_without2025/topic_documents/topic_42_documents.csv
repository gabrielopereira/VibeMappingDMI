Maybe they need good financial                 information, but I don't think people know what good information is when                 you get into culture, society, and politics.""""                 -- Steven Brill,Chairman and Editor-in-chief, Brill's Content                                               Once upon a time, not very long ago, advertisements were easy to                 recognise. They had simple personalities with goals not much more                 complicated than selling you a bar of soap or a box of cereal. And they                 possessed the reassuring familiarity of old friends or relatives you've                 known all your life. They were Pilgrims who smiled at you from Quaker Oats                 boxes or little tablets named """"Speedy"""" who joyfully danced into a glass of                 water with the sole purpose of giving up their short life to help lessen                 your indigestion from overindulgence. Yes, sometimes they could be a                 little obnoxious but, hey, it was a predictable annoyance.                And once, not very long ago, advertisements also knew their place in the                 landscape of popular culture, their boundaries were the ad space of                 magazines or the commercial time of television programs. When the ads got                 too annoying, you could toss the magazine aside or change the TV channel.                 The ease and quickness of their dispatch had the abruptness of slamming                 your front door in the face of an old door-to-door salesman.                This all began to change around the 1950s when advertisements acquired a                 more complex and subtle personality and began straying outside of their                 familiar media neighborhoods. The social observer Vance Packard wrote a                 best-selling book in the late 50s called The Hidden Persuaders which                 identified this change in advertising's personality as coming from hanging                 around Professor Freud's psychoanalysis and learning his hidden,                 subliminal methods of trickery.                Ice cubes in a glass for a liquor ad were no longer seen as simple props                 to help sell a brand of whiskey but were now subliminal suggestions of                 female anatomy. The curved fronts of automobiles were more than aesthetic                 streamlined design features but rather suggestive of a particular feature                 of the male anatomy. Forgotten by the new subliminal types of ads was the                 simple salesmanship preached by founders of the ad industry like David                 Ogilvy and John Caples. The word """"sales"""" became a dirty word and was                 replaced with modern psychological buzzwords like subliminal persuasion.                The Evolution of Subliminal Techniques               The book Hidden Persuaders made quite a stir at the time, bringing about                 congressional hearings and even the introduction of legislation. Prominent                 motivation researchers Louis Cheskin and Ernest Dichter utilised the new                 ad methods and were publicly admonished as traitors to their profession.                 The life of the new subliminal advertising seemed short indeed. Even Vance                 Packard predicted its coming demise. """"Eventually, say by A.D. 2000,"""" he                 wrote in the preface to the paperback edition of his book, """"all this depth                 manipulation of the psychological variety will seem amusingly old-                 fashioned"""".                Yet, 40 years later, any half-awake observer of popular culture knows                 that things haven't exactly worked out the way Packard predicted. In fact                 what seems old-fashioned today is the belief that ads are those simpletons                 they once were before the 50s and that products are sold for features and                 benefits rather than for images. Even Vance Packard expresses an amazement                 at the evolution of advertising since the 50s, noting that today ads for                 watches have nothing to do with watches or that ads for shoes scarcely                 mention shoes. Packard remarks """"it used to be the brand identified the                 product. In today's advertising the brand is the product"""". Modern                 advertising, he notes, has an almost total obsession with images and                 feelings and an almost total lack of any concrete claims about the product                 and why anyone should buy it. Packard admits puzzlement. """"Commercials seem                 totally unrelated to selling any product at all"""". Jeff DeJoseph of the J.                 Walter Thompson firm underlines Packard's comments. """"We are just trying to                 convey a sensory impression of the brand, and we're out of there"""".                Subliminal advertising techniques have today infiltrated the heart of                 corporate America. As Ruth Shalit notes in her article """"The Return of the                 Hidden Persuaders"""" from the 27 September 1999 issue of Salon magazine,               """"far from being consigned to the maverick fringe, the new psycho-                 persuaders of corporate America have colonized the marketing departments                 of mainstream conglomerates. At companies like Kraft, Coca-Cola, Proctor &amp;                 Gamble and Daimler-Chrysler, the most sought-after consultants hail not                 from McKinsey &amp; Company, but from brand consultancies with names like                 Archetype Discoveries, PsychoLogics and Semiotic Solutions"""".                Shalit notes a growing number of CEOs have become convinced they cannot                 sell their brands until they first explore the """"Jungian substrata of four-                 wheel drive; unlock the discourse codes of female power sweating; or                 deconstruct the sexual politics of bologna"""". The result, as Shalit                 observes, is a """"charmingly retro school of brand psychoanalysis, which                 holds that all advertising is simply a variation on the themes of the                 Oedipus complex, the death instinct, or toilet training, and that the goal                 of effective communications should be to compensate the consumer for the                 fact that he was insufficiently nursed as an infant, has taken corporate                 America by storm"""".                The Growing Ubiquity of Advertising               Yet pervasive as the subliminal techniques of advertising have become,                 the emerging power of modern advertising ultimately centres around """"where""""                 it is rather than """"what"""" it is or """"how"""" it works. The power of modern                 advertising is within this growing ubiquity or """"everywhereness"""" of                 advertising rather than the technology and methodology of advertising. The                 ultimate power of advertising will be arrived at when ads cannot be                 distinguished from their background environment. When this happens, the                 environment will become a great continuous ad.                In the process, ads have wandered away from their well-known hangouts in                 magazines and TV shows. Like alien-infected pod-people of early science                 fiction movies, they have stumbled out of these familiar media playgrounds                 and suddenly sprouted up everywhere. The ubiquity of advertising is not                 being driven by corporations searching for new ways to sell products but                 by media searching for new ways to make money.                Traditionally, media made money by selling subscriptions and advertising                 space. But these two key income sources are quickly drying up in the new                 world of online media. Journalist Mike France wisely takes notice of this                 change in an important article """"Journalism's Online Credibility Gap"""" from                 the 11 October 1999 issue of Business Week. France notes that subscription                 fees have not worked because """"Web surfers are used to getting content for                 free, and they have been reluctant to shell out any money for it"""".                 Advertising sales and their Internet incarnation in banner ads have also                 been a failure so far, France observes, because companies don't like                 paying a flat fee for online advertising since it's difficult to track the                 effectiveness of their marketing dollars. Instead, they only want to pay                 for actual sales leads, which can be easily monitored on the Web as                 readers' click from site to site.                Faced with the above situation, media companies have gone on the prowl                 for new ways to make money. This search underpins the emerging ubiquity of                 advertising: the fact that it is increasingly appearing everywhere. In the                 process, traditional boundaries between advertising and other societal                 institutions are being overrun by these media forces on the prowl for new               """"territory"""" to exploit.                That time when advertisements knew their place in the landscape of                 popular culture and confined themselves to just magazines or TV                 commercials is a fading memory. And today, as each of us is bombarded by                 thousands of ads each day, it is impossible to """"slam"""" the door and keep                 them out of our house as we could once slam the door in the face of the                 old door-to-door salesmen.                Of course you can find them on the matchbook cover of your favorite bar,                 on t-shirts sold at some roadside tourist trap or on those logo baseball                 caps you always pick up at trade shows. But now they have got a little                 more personal and stare at you over urinals in the men's room. They have                 even wedged themselves onto the narrow little bars at the check-out                 counter conveyer belts of supermarkets or onto the handles of gasoline                 pumps at filling stations. The list goes on and on. (No, this article is                 not an ad.)                Advertising and Entertainment               In advertising's march to ubiquity, two major boundaries have been                 crossed. They are crucial boundaries which greatly enhance advertising's                 search for the invisibility of ubiquity. Yet they are also largely                 invisible themselves. These are the boundaries separating advertising from                 entertainment and those separating advertising from journalism.                The incursion of advertising into entertainment is a result of the                 increasing merger of business and entertainment, a phenomenon pointed out                 in best-selling business books like Michael Wolf's Entertainment Economy                 and Joseph Pine's The Experience Economy. Wolf, a consultant for Viacom,                 Newscorp, and other media heavy-weights, argues business is becoming                 synonymous with entertainment: """"we have come to expect that we will be                 entertained all the time. Products and brands that deliver on this                 expectation are succeeding. Products that do not will disappear"""". And, in                 The Experience Economy, Pine notes the increasing need for businesses to                 provide entertaining experiences. """"Those businesses that relegate                 themselves to the diminishing world of goods and services will be rendered                 irrelevant. To avoid this fate, you must learn to stage a rich, compelling                 experience"""".                Yet entertainment, whether provided by businesses or the traditional                 entertainment industry, is increasingly weighted down with the """"baggage""""                 of advertising. In a large sense, entertainment is a form of new media                 that carries ads. Increasingly, this seems to be the overriding purpose of                 entertainment.                Once, not long ago, when ads were simple and confined, entertainment was                 also simple and its purpose was to entertain rather than to sell. There                 was money enough in packed movie houses or full theme parks to make a                 healthy profit. But all this has changed with advertising's ubiquity.                Like media corporations searching for new revenue streams, the                 entertainment industry has responded to flat growth by finding new ways to                 squeeze money out of entertainment content. Films now feature products in                 paid for scenes and most forms of entertainment use product tie-ins to                 other areas such as retail stores or fast-food restaurants. Also popular                 with the entertainment industry is what might be termed the """"versioning""""                 of entertainment products into various sub-species where entertainment                 content is transformed into other media so it can be sold more than once.                 A film may not make a profit on just the theatrical release but there is a                 good chance it doesn't matter because it stands to make a profit in video                 rentals.                Advertising and Journalism               The merger of advertising and entertainment goes a long way towards a                 world of ubiquitous advertising. Yet the merger of advertising and                 journalism is the real """"promised land"""" in the evolution of ubiquitous                 advertising. This fundamental shift in the way news media make money                 provides the final frontier to be conquered by advertising, a final               """"promised land"""" for advertising. As Mike France observes in Business Week,                 this merger """"could potentially change the way they cover the news. The                 more the press gets in the business of hawking products, the harder it                 will be to criticize those goods -- and the companies making them"""".                Of course, there is that persistent myth, perpetuated by news                 organisations that they attempt to preserve editorial independence by                 keeping the institutions they cover and their advertisers at arm's length.                 But this is proving more and more difficult, particularly for online                 media. Observers like France have pointed out a number of reasons for                 this. One is the growth of ads in news media that look more like editorial                 content than ads. While long-standing ethical rules bar magazines and                 newspapers from printing advertisements that look like editorial copy,                 these rules become fuzzy for many online publications. Another reason                 making it difficult to separate advertising from journalism is the growing                 merger and consolidation of media corporations. Fewer and fewer                 corporations control more and more entertainment, news and ultimately                 advertising. It becomes difficult for a journalist to criticise a product                 when it has a connection to the large media conglomerate the journalist                 works for.                Traditionally, it has been rare for media corporations to make direct                 investments in the corporations they cover. However, as Mike France notes,                 CNBC crossed this line when it acquired a stake in Archipelago in                 September 1999. CNBC, which runs a business-news Website, acquired a 12.4%                 stake in Archipelago Holdings, an electronic communications network for                 trading stock. Long-term plans are likely to include allowing visitors to                 cnbc.com to link directly to Archipelago. That means CNBC could be in the                 awkward position of both providing coverage of online trading and                 profiting from it. France adds that other business news outlets, such as                 Dow Jones (DJ), Reuters, and Bloomberg, already have indirect ties to                 their own electronic stock-trading networks.                And, in news organisations, a popular method of cutting down on the                 expense of paying journalists for content is the growing practice of                 accepting advertiser written content or """"sponsored edit"""" stories. The                 confusion to readers violates the spirit of a long-standing American                 Society of Magazine Editors (ASME) rule prohibiting advertisements with               """"an editorial appearance"""". But as France notes, this practice is thriving                 online. This change happens in ever so subtle ways. """"A bit of puffery                 inserted here,"""" notes France, """"a negative adjective deleted there -- it                 doesn't take a lot to turn a review or story about, say, smart phones,                 into something approaching highbrow ad copy"""". He offers an example in                 forbes.com whose Microsoft ads could easily be mistaken for staff-written                 articles.                Media critic James Fallows points out that consumers have been swift to                 discipline sites that are caught acting unethically and using """"sponsored                 edits"""". He notes that when it was revealed that amazon.com was taking fees                 of up to $10,000 for books that it labelled as """"destined for greatness"""",                 its customers were outraged, and the company quickly agreed to disclose                 future promotional payments.                Unfortunately, though, the lesson episodes like these teach online                 companies like Amazon centres around more effective ways to be less               """"revealing"""" rather than abstention from the practice of """"sponsored edits"""".                France reminds us that journalism is built on trust. In the age of the                 Internet, though, trust is quickly becoming an elusive quality. He writes               """"as magazines, newspapers, radio stations, and television networks rush to                 colonize the Internet, the Great Wall between content and commerce is                 beginning to erode"""". In the end, he ponders whether there is an                 irrevocable conflict between e-commerce and ethical journalism. When you                 can't trust journalists to be ethical, just who can you trust?                Transaction Fees &amp; Affiliate Programs - Advertising's Final Promised Land?               The engine driving the growing ubiquity of advertising, though, is not                 the increasing merger of advertising with other industries (like                 entertainment and journalism) but rather a new business model of online                 commerce and Internet technology called transaction fees.                This emerging and potentially dominant Internet e-commerce technology                 provides for the ability to track transactions electronically on Websites                 and to garner transaction fees. Through these fees, many media Websites                 take a percentage of payment through online product sales. In effect, a                 media site becomes one pervasive direct mail ad for every product                 mentioned on its site. This of course puts them in a much closer economic                 partnership with advertisers than is the case with traditional fixed-rate                 ads where there is little connection between product sales and the                 advertising media carrying them.                Transaction fees are the new online version of direct marketing, the                 emerging Internet technology for their application is one of the great                 economic driving forces of the entire Internet commerce apparatus. The                 promise of transaction fees is that a number of people, besides product                 manufacturers and advertisers, might gain a percentage of profit from                 selling products via hypertext links. Once upon a time, the manufacturer                 of a product was the one that gained (or lost) from marketing it. Now,                 however, there is the possibility that journalists, news organisations and                 entertainment companies might also gain from marketing via transaction                 fees.                The spread of transaction fees outside media into the general population                 provides an even greater boost to the growing ubiquity of advertising.                 This is done through the handmaiden of media transaction fees: """"affiliate                 programs"""" for the general populace. Through the growing magic of Internet                 technology, it becomes possible for all of us to earn money through                 affiliate program links to products and transaction fee percentages in the                 sale of these products.                Given this scenario, it is not surprising that advertisers are most                 likely to increasingly pressure media Websites to support themselves with                 e-commerce transaction fees. Charles Li, Senior Analyst for New Media at                 Forrester Research, estimates that by the year 2003, media sites will                 receive $25 billion in revenue from transaction fees, compared with $17                 billion from ads and $5 billion from subscriptions.                The possibility is great that all media will become like great direct                 response advertisements taking a transaction fee percentage for anything                 sold on their sites. And there is the more dangerous possibility that all                 of us will become the new """"promised land"""" for a ubiquitous advertising.                 All of us will have some cut in selling somebody else's product. When this                 happens and there is a direct economic incentive for all of us to say nice                 things about products, what is the need and importance of subliminal                 techniques and methods creating advertising based on images which try to                 trick us into buying things?                A Society Without Critics?               It is for these reasons that criticism and straight news are becoming an                 increasingly endangered species. Everyone has to eat but what happens when                 one can no longer make meal money by criticising current culture?                Cultural critics become a dying breed. There is no money in criticism                 because it is based around disconnection rather than connection to                 products. No links to products or Websites are involved here. Critics are                 becoming lonely icebergs floating in the middle of a cyber-sea of                 transaction fees, watching everyone else (except themselves) make money on                 transaction fees. The subliminal focus of the current consultancies is                 little more than a repackaging of an old theme discovered long ago by                 Vance Packard. But the growing """"everywhereness"""" and """"everyoneness"""" of                 modern advertising through transaction fees may mark the beginning of a                 revolutionary new era. Everyone might become their own """"brand"""", a point                 well made in Tim Peters's article """"A Brand Called You"""".                Media critic James Fallows is somewhat optimistic that there still may                 remain """"niche"""" markets for truthful information and honest cultural                 criticism. He suggests that surely people looking for mortgages, voting                 for a politician, or trying to decide what movie to see will continue to                 need unbiased information to help them make decisions. But one must ask                 what happens when a number of people have some """"affiliate"""" relationship                 with suggesting particular movies, politicians or mortgages?                Orville Schell, dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the                 University of California at Berkeley, has summarised this growing ubiquity                 of advertising in a rather simple and elegant manner saying """"at a certain                 point, people won't be able to differentiate between what's trustworthy                 and what isn't"""". Over the long run, this loss of credibility could have a                 corrosive effect on society in general -- especially given the media's                 importance as a political, cultural, and economic watchdog. Schell warns,               """"if people don't trust their information, it's not much better than a                 Marxist-Leninist society"""".                Yet, will we be able to realise this simple fact when we all become types                 of Marxists and Leninists? Still, there is the great challenge to America                 to learn how to utilise transaction fees in a democratic manner. In                 effect, a combination of the technological promise of the new economy with                 that old promise, and perhaps even myth, of a democratic America. America                 stands on the verge of a great threshold and challenge in the growing                 ubiquity of advertising. In a way, as with most great opportunities or                 threats, this challenge centres on a peculiar paradox. On the one hand,                 there is the promise of the emerging Internet business model and its                 centre around the technology of transaction fees. At the same time, there                 is the threat posed by transaction fees to America's democratic society in                 the early years of the new millennium.                Yes, once upon a time, not very long ago, advertisements were easy to                 recognise and also knew their place in the landscape of popular culture.                 Their greatest, yet silent, evolution (especially in the age of the                 Internet) has really been in their spread into all areas of culture rather                 than in methods of trickery and deceit. Now, it is more difficult to slam                 that front door in the face of that old door-to-door salesman. Or toss                 that magazine and its ad aside, or switch off commercials on television.                 We have become that door-to-door salesman, that magazine ad, that                 television commercial. The current cultural landscape takes on some of the                 characteristics of the theme of that old science fiction movie The                 Invasion of the Body Snatchers. A current advertising campaign from RJ                 Reynolds has a humorous take on the current zeitgeist fad of alien                 abduction with copy reading """"if aliens are smart enough to travel through                 space then why do they keep abducting the dumbest people on earth?""""                One might add that when Americans allow advertising to travel through all                 our space, perhaps we all become the dumbest people on earth, abducted by                 a new alien culture so far away from a simplistic nostalgia of yesterday.

"2001","From media audience to media public: a study of letters written in reaction to FDR's fireside chats"," This article investigates the process by which media audiences become media publics in an analysis of Franklin D. Roosevelt's (FDR) fireside chats. Data for this analysis includes 380 randomly selected letters written in reaction to the first ten chats delivered by FDR during his first term of office. I show that FDR borrowed the `for-anyone-as-someone' structure of broadcasting to address listeners as particular individuals and as members of a mass public. In response, listeners adopted this structure to speak for themselves and for a mass public. In this manner, listeners associated themselves with a larger collectivity, but on the basis of collective rather than personal feelings. These feelings inspired bouts of sociability - serial conversations with family, friends, neighbors, and strangers - that look very much like an instance of collective reflexivity. Thus I conclude that the mass public which formed around FDR's fireside chats represents an instance in which a media audience transformed itself into a media public. ","",""

"2003","Coercion","                The brand began, quite literally, as a method for ranchers to identify their cattle. By burning a distinct symbol into the hide of a baby calf, the owner could insure that if it one day wandered off his property or was stolen by a competitor, he’d be able to point to that logo and claim the animal as his rightful property. When the manufacturers of products adopted the brand as a way of guaranteeing the quality of their goods, its function remained pretty much the same. Buying a package of oats with the Quaker label meant the customer could trace back these otherwise generic oats to their source. If there was a problem, he knew where he could turn. More important, if the oats were of satisfactory or superior quality, he knew where he could get them again. Trademarking a brand meant that no one else could call his oats Quaker.         Advertising in this innocent age simply meant publicizing the existence of one’s brand. The sole objective was to increase consumers awareness of the product or company that made it. Those who even thought to employ specialists for the exclusive purpose of writing ad copy hired newspaper reporters and travelling salesmen, who knew how to explain the attributes of an item in words that people tended to remember.         It wasn’t until 1922 that a preacher and travelling “medicine show” salesman-turned-copywriter named Claude Hopkins decided that advertising should be systematized into a science. His short but groundbreaking book Scientific Advertising proposed that the advertisement is merely a printed extension of the salesman¹s pitch and should follow the same rules. Hopkins believed in using hard descriptions over hype, and text over image: “The more you tell, the more you sell” and “White space is wasted space” were his mantras. Hopkins believed that any illustrations used in an ad should be directly relevant to the product itself, not just a loose or emotional association. He insisted on avoiding “frivolity” at all costs, arguing that “no one ever bought from a clown.”         Although some images did appear in advertisements and on packaging as early as the 1800s - the Quaker Oats man showed up in 1877 - these weren¹t consciously crafted to induce psychological states in customers. They were meant just to help people remember one brand over another. How better to recall the brand Quaker than to see a picture of one?         It wasn’t until the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, as Americans turned toward movies and television and away from newspapers and radio, that advertisers’ focus shifted away from describing their brands and to creating images for them. During these decades, Midwestern adman Leo Burnett concocted what is often called the Chicago school of advertising, in which lovable characters are used to represent products.         Green Giant, which was originally just the Minnesota Valley Canning Company’s code name for an experimental pea, became the Jolly Green Giant in young Burnett’s world of animated characters. He understood that the figure would make a perfect and enticing brand image for an otherwise boring product and could also serve as a mnemonic device for consumers. As he watched his character grow in popularity, Burnett discovered that the mythical figure of a green giant had resonance in many different cultures around the world. It became a kind of archetype and managed to penetrate the psyche in more ways than one.         Burnett was responsible for dozens of character-based brand images, including Tony the Tiger, Charlie the Tuna, Morris the Cat, and the Marlboro Man. In each case, the character creates a sense of drama, which engages the audience in the pitch. This was Burnett’s great insight. He still wanted to sell a product based on its attributes, but he knew he had to draw in his audience using characters.         Brand images were also based on places, like Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressing, or on recognizable situations, such as the significant childhood memories labelled “Kodak moments” or a mother nurturing her son on a cold day, a defining image for Campbell’s soup.         In all these cases, however, the moment, location, or character went only so far as to draw the audience into the ad, after which they would be subjected to a standard pitch: ‘Soup is good food’, or ‘Sorry, Charlie, only the best tuna get to be Starkist’. Burnett saw himself as a homespun Midwesterner who was contributing to American folklore while speaking in the plain language of the people. He took pride in the fact that his ads used words like “ain’t”; not because they had some calculated psychological effect on the audience, but because they communicated in a natural, plainspoken style.         As these methods found their way to Madison Avenue and came to be practiced much more self-consciously, Burnett¹s love for American values and his focus on brand attributes were left behind. Branding became much more ethereal and image-based, and ads only occasionally nodded to a product’s attributes.         In the 1960s, advertising gurus like David Ogilvy came up with rules about television advertising that would have made Claude Hopkins shudder. “Food in motion” dictated that food should always be shot by a moving camera. “Open with fire” meant that ads should start in a very exciting and captivating way. Ogilvy told his creatives to use supers - text superimposed on the screen to emphasize important phrases and taglines.         All these techniques were devised to promote brand image, not the product. Ogilvy didn’t believe consumers could distinguish between products were it not for their images. In Ogilvy on Advertising, he explains that most people cannot tell the difference between their own “favourite” whiskey and the closest two competitors’: ‘Have they tried all three and compared the taste? Don¹t make me laugh. The reality is that these three brands have different images which appeal to different kinds of people. It isn¹t the whiskey they choose, it’s the image. The brand image is ninety percent of what the distiller has to sell.’ (Ogilvy, 1993).         Thus, we learned to “trust our car to the man who wears the star” not because Texaco had better gasoline than Shell, but because the company’s advertisers had created a better brand image.         While Burnett and his disciples were building brand myths, another school of advertisers was busy learning about its audience. Back in the 1920s, Raymond Rubicam, who eventually founded the agency Young and Rubicam, thought it might be interesting to hire a pollster named Dr. Gallup from Northwestern University to see what could be gleaned about consumers from a little market research. The advertising industry’s version of cultural anthropology, or demographics, was born.         Like the public-relations experts who study their target populations in order to manipulate them later, marketers began conducting polls, market surveys, and focus groups on the segments of the population they hoped to influence. And to draw clear, clean lines between demographic groups, researchers must almost always base distinctions on four factors: race, age, sex, and wages. Demographic research is reductionist by design. I once consulted to an FM radio station whose station manager wanted to know, “Who is our listener?” Asking such a question reduces an entire listenership down to one fictional person. It’s possible that no single individual will ever match the “customer profile” meant to apply to all customers, which is why so much targeted marketing often borders on classist, racist, and sexist pandering.         Billboards for most menthol cigarettes, for example, picture African-Americans because, according to demographic research, black people prefer them to regular cigarettes. Microsoft chose Rolling Stones songs to launch Windows 95, a product targeted at wealthy baby boomers. “The Women’s Global Challenge” was an advertising-industry-created Olympics for women, with no purpose other than to market to active females.         By the 1970s, the two strands of advertising theory - demographic research and brand image - were combined to develop campaigns that work on both levels. To this day, we know to associate Volvos with safety, Dr. Pepper with individuality, and Harley-Davidson with American heritage. Each of these brand images is crafted to appeal to the target consumer’s underlying psychological needs: Volvo ads are aimed at upper-middle-class white parents who fear for their children’s health and security, Dr. Pepper is directed to young nonconformists, and the Harley-Davidson image supports its riders’ self-perception as renegades.         Today’s modern (or perhaps postmodern) brands don’t invent a corporate image on their own; they appropriate one from the media itself, such as MetLife did with Snoopy, Butterfinger did with Bart Simpson, or Kmart did by hiring Penny Marshall and Rosie O’Donnell. These mascots were selected because their perceived characteristics match the values of their target consumers - not the products themselves. In the language of today’s marketers, brand images do not reflect on products but on advertisers’ perceptions of their audiences’ psychology.         This focus on audience composition and values has become the standard operating procedure in all of broadcasting. When Fox TV executives learned that their animated series “King of the Hill”, about a Texan propane distributor, was not faring well with certain demographics, for example, they took a targeted approach to their character’s rehabilitation. The Brandweek piece on Fox’s ethnic campaign uncomfortably dances around the issue.         Hank Hill is the proverbial everyman, and Fox wants viewers to get comfortable with him; especially viewers in New York, where “King of the Hill”’s homespun humor hasn’t quite caught on with the young urbanites. So far this season, the show has pulled in a 10.1 rating/15 share in households nationally, while garnering a 7.9 rating/12 share in New York (Brandweek, 1997)         As far as Fox was concerned, while regular people could identify with the network’s new “everyman” character, New Yorkers weren’t buying his middle-American patter. The television show’s ratings proved what TV executives had known all along: that New York City’s Jewish demographic doesn’t see itself as part of the rest of America.         Fox’s strategy for “humanizing” the character to those irascible urbanites was to target the group’s ethnographic self-image. Fox put ads for the show on the panels of sidewalk coffee wagons throughout Manhattan, with the tagline “Have a bagel with Hank”. In an appeal to the target market’s well-developed (and well-researched) cynicism, Hank himself is shown saying, “May I suggest you have that with a schmear”.         The disarmingly ethnic humor here is meant to underscore the absurdity of a Texas propane salesman using a Jewish insider’s word like “schmear.” In another Upper West Side billboard, Hank’s son appeals to the passing traffic: “Hey yo! Somebody toss me up a knish!” As far as the New York demographic is concerned, these jokes transform the characters from potentially threatening Southern rednecks into loveable hicks bending over backward to appeal to Jewish sensibilities, and doing so with a comic and, most important, nonthreatening inadequacy.         Today, the most intensely targeted demographic is the baby - the future consumer. Before an average American child is twenty months old, he can recognize the McDonald’s logo and many other branded icons. Nearly everything a toddler encounters - from Band-Aids to underpants - features the trademarked characters of Disney or other marketing empires. Although this target market may not be in a position to exercise its preferences for many years, it pays for marketers to imprint their brands early. General Motors bought a two-page ad in Sports Illustrated for Kids for its Chevy Venture minivan. Their brand manager rationalized that the eight-to-fourteen-year-old demographic consists of “back-seat consumers” (Leonhardt, 1997).         The real intention of target marketing to children and babies, however, goes deeper. The fresh neurons of young brains are valuable mental real estate to admen. By seeding their products and images early, the marketers can do more than just develop brand recognition; they can literally cultivate a demographic’s sensibilities as they are formed. A nine-year-old child who can recognize the Budweiser frogs and recite their slogan (Bud-weis-er) is more likely to start drinking beer than one who can remember only Tony the Tiger yelling, “They¹re great!” (Currently, more children recognize the frogs than Tony.) This indicates a long-term coercive strategy.         The abstraction of brand images from the products they represent, combined with an increasing assault on our demographically targeted psychological profiles, led to some justifiable consumer paranoia by the 1970s. Advertising was working on us in ways we couldn’t fully understand, and people began to look for an explanation.         In 1973, Wilson Bryan Key, a communications researcher, wrote the first of four books about “subliminal advertising,” in which he accused advertisers of hiding sexual imagery in ice cubes, and psychoactive words like “sex” onto the airbrushed surfaces of fashion photographs. Having worked on many advertising campaigns from start to finish, in close proximity to everyone from copywriters and art directors to printers, I can comfortably put to rest any rumours that major advertising agencies are engaging in subliminal campaigns. How do images that could be interpreted as “sexual” show up in ice cubes or elbows? The final photographs chosen for ads are selected by committee out of hundreds that are actually shot. After hours or days of consideration, the group eventually feels drawn to one or two photos out of the batch. Not surprising, these photos tend to have more evocative compositions and details, but no penises, breasts, or skulls are ever superimposed onto the images. In fact, the man who claims to have developed subliminal persuasion, James Vicary, admitted to Advertising Age in 1984 that he had fabricated his evidence that the technique worked in order to drum up business for his failing research company. But this confession has not assuaged Key and others who relentlessly, perhaps obsessively, continue to pursue those they feel are planting secret visual messages in advertisements.         To be fair to Key, advertisers have left themselves open to suspicion by relegating their work to the abstract world of the image and then targeting consumer psychology so deliberately. According to research by the Roper Organization in 1992, fifty-seven percent of American consumers still believe that subliminal advertising is practiced on a regular basis, and only one in twelve think it “almost never” happens. To protect themselves from the techniques they believe are being used against them, the advertising audience has adopted a stance of cynical suspicion.         To combat our increasing awareness and suspicion of demographic targeting, marketers have developed a more camouflaged form of categorization based on psychological profiles instead of race and age. Jim Schroer, the executive director of new marketing strategy at Ford explains his abandonment of broad-demographic targeting: ‘It’s smarter to think about emotions and attitudes, which all go under the term: psychographics - those things that can transcend demographic groups.’ (Schroer, 1997) Instead, he now appeals to what he calls “consumers’ images of themselves.”          Unlike broad demographics, the psychographic is developed using more narrowly structured qualitative-analysis techniques, like focus groups, in-depth interviews, and even home surveillance. Marketing analysts observe the behaviors of volunteer subjects, ask questions, and try to draw causal links between feelings, self-image, and purchases.         A company called Strategic Directions Group provides just such analysis of the human psyche. In their study of the car-buying habits of the forty-plus baby boomers and their elders, they sought to define the main psychological predilections that human beings in this age group have regarding car purchases. Although they began with a demographic subset of the overall population, their analysis led them to segment the group into psychographic types.         For example, members of one psychographic segment, called the ³Reliables,² think of driving as a way to get from point A to point B. The “Everyday People” campaign for Toyota is aimed at this group and features people depending on their reliable and efficient little Toyotas. A convertible Saab, on the other hand, appeals to the ³Stylish Fun² category, who like trendy and fun-to-drive imports. One of the company’s commercials shows a woman at a boring party fantasizing herself into an oil painting, where she drives along the canvas in a sporty yellow Saab.         Psychographic targeting is more effective than demographic targeting because it reaches for an individual customer more directly - like a fly fisherman who sets bait and jiggles his rod in a prescribed pattern for a particular kind of fish. It’s as if a marketing campaign has singled you out and recognizes your core values and aspirations, without having lumped you into a racial or economic stereotype.         It amounts to a game of cat-and-mouse between advertisers and their target psychographic groups. The more effort we expend to escape categorization, the more ruthlessly the marketers pursue us. In some cases, in fact, our psychographic profiles are based more on the extent to which we try to avoid marketers than on our fundamental goals or values.         The so-called “Generation X” adopted the anti-chic aesthetic of thrift-store grunge in an effort to find a style that could not be so easily identified and exploited. Grunge was so self-consciously lowbrow and nonaspirational that it seemed, at first, impervious to the hype and glamour normally applied swiftly to any emerging trend. But sure enough, grunge anthems found their way onto the soundtracks of television commercials, and Dodge Neons were hawked by kids in flannel shirts saying “Whatever.”         The members of Generation X are putting up a good fight. Having already developed an awareness of how marketers attempt to target their hearts and wallets, they use their insight into programming to resist these attacks. Unlike the adult marketers pursuing them, young people have grown up immersed in the language of advertising and public relations. They speak it like natives. As a result, they are more than aware when a commercial or billboard is targeting them. In conscious defiance of demographic-based pandering, they adopt a stance of self-protective irony‹distancing themselves from the emotional ploys of the advertisers.         Lorraine Ketch, the director of planning in charge of Levi¹s trendy Silvertab line, explained, “This audience hates marketing that’s in your face. It eyeballs it a mile away, chews it up and spits it out” (On Advertising, 1998). Chiat/Day, one of the world’s best-known and experimental advertising agencies, found the answer to the crisis was simply to break up the Gen-X demographic into separate “tribes” or subdemographics - and include subtle visual references to each one of them in the ads they produce for the brand. According to Levi’s director of consumer marketing, the campaign meant to communicate, “We really understand them, but we are not trying too hard” (On Advertising, 1998).         Probably unintentionally, Ms. Ketch has revealed the new, even more highly abstract plane on which advertising is now being communicated. Instead of creating and marketing a brand image, advertisers are creating marketing campaigns about the advertising itself. Silvertab’s target market is supposed to feel good about being understood, but even better about understanding the way they are being marketed to.         The “drama” invented by Leo Burnett and refined by David Ogilvy and others has become a play within a play. The scene itself has shifted. The dramatic action no longer occurs between the audience and the product, the brand, or the brand image, but between the audience and the brand marketers.

"2005","The Murray scheme: advertising and editorial independence in Canada, 1920","Canada’s capitalist economy faced several challenges in 1919. These threatened the ruling Conservative Party and its ideological ally, the Canadian Manufacturers’ Association. At stake was control over national tariff policies designed to protect Canadian industry. Gilbert Murray, late of the CMA, believed the press ‘poisoned the hearts and minds’ of Canadians against capital. He organized an advertisers’ boycott of all newspapers opposing the tariff and simultaneously acquired editorial control over several hundred weekly newspapers. He meant to silence ‘anti-business’ papers and thereby blanket Canada with Conservative news outlets in time for a general election due in 1921. Liberal and Conservative editors decried the scheme and its implications for a free press. More interesting, however, was the opposition of the business press, which argued that the scheme would undermine the emerging credibility of advertising itself. The scheme represents that moment in time when the media, advertisers and politicians recognized the social power of modern advertising.","",""

Without such an approach, criticism is easily conflated with consumerism, forcing two consequences: the relegation of judgment to mere personal preference, and the potential loss of an avant-garde.

"2017","Before Alternative Voices: &lt;em&gt;The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser&lt;/em&gt;","IntroductionIn 1802 George Howe (1769-1821), the recently appointed Government Printer, published Australia’s first book. The following year he established Australia’s first newspaper; an enterprise that ran counter to all the environmental factors of the day, including: 1) issues of logistics and a lack of appropriate equipment and basic materials to produce a regularly issued newspaper; 2) issues resulting from the very close supervision of production and the routine censorship by the Governor; and 3) issues associated with the colony’s primary purposes as a military outpost and as a penal settlement, creating conflicts between very different readerships. The Sydney Gazette was, critically for Howe, the only newspaper in the infant city for over two decades. Alternative voices would not enter the field of printed media until the 1820s and 1830s. This article briefly explores the birth of an Australian industry and looks at how a very modest newspaper overcame a range of serious challenges to ignite imaginations and lay a foundation for media empires.Government Printer The first book published in Australia was the New South Wales General Standing Orders and General Orders (1802), authorised by Governor Philip Gidley King for the purposes of providing a convenient, single-volume compilation of all Government Orders, issued in New South Wales, between 1791 and 1802. (As the Australian character has been described as “egalitarian, anti-authoritarian and irreverent” [D. Jones 690], it is fascinating that the nation’s first published book was a set of rules.) Prescribing law, order and regulation for the colony the index reveals the desires of those charged with the colony’s care and development, to contain various types of activities. The rules for convicts were, predictably, many. There were also multiple orders surrounding administration, animal husbandry as well as food stuffs and other stores. Some of the most striking headings in the index relate to crime. For example, in addition to headings pertaining to courts there are also headings for a broad range of offences from: “BAD Characters” to “OFFENSIVE Weapons – Again[s]t concealing” (i-xii).  The young colony, still in its teenage years, was, for the short-term, very much working on survival and for the long-term developing ambitious plans for expansion and trade. It was clear though, through this volume, that there was no forgetting the colony of New South Wales was first, and foremost, a penal settlement which also served as a military outpost. Clear, too, was the fact that not all of those who were shipped out to the new colony were prepared to abandon their criminal careers which “did not necessarily stop with transportation” (Foyster 10). Containment and recidivism were matters of constant concern for the colony’s authorities. Colonial priorities could be seen in the fact that, when “Governor Arthur Phillip brought the first convicts (548 males and 188 females) to Port Jackson on 26 January 1788, he also brought a small press for printing orders, rules, and regulations” (Goff 103). The device lay dormant on arrival, a result of more immediate concerns to feed and house all those who made up the First Fleet. It would be several years before the press was pushed into sporadic service by the convict George Hughes for printing miscellaneous items including broadsides and playbills as well as for Government Orders (“Hughes, George” online). It was another convict (another man named George), convicted at the Warwick Assizes on March 1799 (Ferguson vi) then imprisoned and ultimately transported for shoplifting (Robb 15), who would transform the small hand press into an industry. Once under the hand of George Howe, who had served as a printer with several London newspapers including The Times (Sydney Gazette, “Never” 2) – the printing press was put to much more regular use. In these very humble circumstances, Australia’s great media tradition was born. Howe, as the Government Printer, transformed the press from a device dedicated to ephemera as well as various administrative matters into a crucial piece of equipment that produced the new colony’s first newspaper. Logistical Challenges Governor King, in the year following the appearance of the Standing Orders, authorised the publishing of Australia’s first newspaper, The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser. The publication history of The Sydney Gazette, in a reflection of some of the challenges faced by the printer, is erratic. First published on a Saturday from 5 March 1803, it quickly changed to a Sunday paper from 10 April 1803. Interestingly, Sunday “was not an approved day for the publication of newspapers, and although some English publishers had been doing so since about 1789, Sunday papers were generally frowned upon” (Robb 58). Yet, as argued by Howe a Sunday print run allowed for the inclusion of “the whole of the Ship News, and other Incidental Matter, for the preceeding week” (Sydney Gazette, “To the Public” 1).The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser Vol. 1, No. 1, 5 March 1803 (Front Page)Call Number DL F8/50, Digital ID a345001, State Library of New South WalesPublished weekly until 1825, then bi-weekly until 1827 before coming out tri-weekly until 20 October 1842 (Holden 14) there were some notable pauses in production. These included one in 1807 (Issue 214, 19 April-Issue 215, 7 June) and one in 1808-1809 (Issue 227, 30 August-Issue 228, 15 May) due to a lack of paper, with the latter pause coinciding with the Rum Rebellion and the end of William Bligh’s term as Governor of New South Wales (see: Karskens 186-88; Mundle 323-37). There was, too, a brief attempt at publishing as a daily from 1 January 1827 which lasted only until 10 February of that year when the title began to appear tri-weekly (Kirkpatrick online; Holden 14). There would be other pauses, including one of two weeks, shortly before the final issue was produced on 20 October 1842. There were many problems that beset The Sydney Gazette with paper shortages being especially challenging. Howe regularly advertised for: “any quantity” of Spanish paper (e.g.: Sydney Gazette, “Wanted to Purchase” 4) and needing to be satisfied “with a variety of size and colour” (P.M. Jones 39). In addition, the procurement of ink was so difficult in the colony, that Howe often resorted to making his own out of “charcoal, gum and shark oil” (P.M. Jones 39).The work itself was physically demanding and papers printed during this period, by hand, required a great deal of effort with approximately “250 sheets per hour … [the maximum] produced by a printer and his assistant” (Robb 8). The printing press itself was inadequate and the subject of occasional repairs (Sydney Gazette, “We Have” 2). Type was also a difficulty. As Gwenda Robb explains, traditionally six sets of an alphabet were supplied to a printer with extras for ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘r’ and ‘t’ as well as ‘s’. Without ample type Howe was required to improvise as can be seen in using a double ‘v’ to create a ‘w’ and an inverted ‘V’ to represent a capital ‘A’ (50, 106). These quirky work arounds, combined with the use of the long-form ‘s’ (‘∫’) for almost a full decade, can make The Sydney Gazette a difficult publication for modern readers to consume. Howe also “carried the financial burden” of the paper, dependent, as were London papers of the late eighteenth century, on advertising (Robb 68, 8). Howe also relied upon subscriptions for survival, with the collection of payments often difficult as seen in some subscribers being two years, or more, in arrears (e.g.: Sydney Gazette, “Sydney Gazette” 1; Ferguson viii; P.M. Jones 38). Governor Lachlan Macquarie granted Howe an annual salary, in 1811, of £60 (Byrnes 557-559) offering some relief, and stability, for the beleaguered printer.Gubernatorial Supervision Governor King wrote to Lord Hobart (then Secretary of State for War and the Colonies), on 9 May 1803:  it being desirable that the settlers and inhabitants at large should be benefitted by useful information being dispersed among them, I considered that a weekly publication would greatly facilitate that design, for which purpose I gave permission to an ingenious man, who manages the Government printing press, to collect materials weekly, which, being inspected by an officer, is published in the form of a weekly newspaper, copies of which, as far as they have been published, I have the honor to enclose. (85)In the same letter, King wrote: “to the list of wants I have added a new fount of letters which may be procured for eight or ten pounds, sufficient for our purpose, if approved of” (85). King’s motivations were not purely altruistic. The population of the colony was growing in Sydney Cove and in the outlying districts, thus: “there was an increasing administrative need for information to be disseminated in a more accessible form than the printed handbills of government orders” (Robb 49). There was, however, a need for the administration to maintain control and the words “Published By Authority”, appearing on the paper’s masthead, were a constant reminder to the printer that The Sydney Gazette was “under the censorship of the Secretary to the Governor, who examined all proofs” (Ferguson viii). The high level of supervision, worked in concert with the logistical difficulties described above, ensured the newspaper was a source of great strain and stress. All for the meagre reward of “6d per copy” (Ferguson viii). This does not diminish Howe’s achievement in establishing a newspaper, an accomplishment outlined, with some pride, in an address printed on the first page of the first issue:innumerable as the Obstacles were which threatened to oppose our Undertaking, yet we are happy to affirm that they were not insurmountable, however difficult the task before us.The utility of a PAPER in the COLONY, as it must open a source of solid information, will, we hope, be universally felt and acknowledged. (Sydney Gazette, “Address” 1)Howe carefully kept his word and he “wrote nothing like a signature editorial column, nor did he venture his personal opinions, conscious always of the powers of colonial officials” (Robb 72). An approach to reportage he passed to his eldest son and long-term assistant, Robert (1795-1829), who later claimed The Sydney Gazette “reconciled in one sheet the merits of the London Gazette in upholding the Government and the London Times in defending the people” (Walker 10). The censorship imposed on The Sydney Gazette, by the Governor, was lifted in 1824 (P.M. Jones 40), when the Australian was first published without permission: Governor Thomas Brisbane did not intervene in the new enterprise. The appearance of unauthorised competition allowed Robert Howe to lobby for the removal of all censorship restrictions on The Sydney Gazette, though he was careful to cite “greater dispatch and earlier publication, not greater freedom of expression, as the expected benefit” (Walker 6). The sudden freedom was celebrated, and still appreciated many years after it was given:the Freedom of the Press has now been in existence amongst us on the verge of four years. In October 1824, we addressed a letter to the Colonial Government, fervently entreating that those shackles, under which the Press had long laboured, might be removed. Our prayer was attended to, and the Sydney Gazette, feeling itself suddenly introduced to a new state of existence, demonstrated to the Colonists the capabilities that ever must flow from the spontaneous exertions of Constitutional Liberty. (Sydney Gazette, “Freedom” 2)Early Readerships From the outset, George Howe presented a professional publication. The Sydney Gazette was formatted into three columns with the front page displaying a formal masthead featuring a scene of Sydney and the motto “Thus We Hope to Prosper”. Gwenda Robb argues the woodcut, the first produced in the colony, was carved by John W. Lewin who “had plenty of engraving skills” and had “returned to Sydney [from a voyage to Tahiti] in December 1802” (51) while Roger Butler has suggested that “circumstances point to John Austin who arrived in Sydney in 1800” as being the engraver (91). The printed text was as vital as the visual supports and every effort was made to present full accounts of colonial activities. “As well as shipping and court news, there were agricultural reports, religious homilies, literary extracts and even original poetry written by Howe himself” (Blair 450). These items, of course, sitting alongside key Government communications including General Orders and Proclamations.Howe’s language has been referred to as “florid” (Robb 52), “authoritative and yet filled with deference for all authority, pompous in a stiff, affected eighteenth century fashion” (Green 10) and so “some of Howe’s readers found the Sydney Gazette rather dull” (Blair 450). Regardless of any feelings towards authorial style, circulation – without an alternative – steadily increased with the first print run in 1802 being around 100 copies but by “the early 1820s, the newspaper’s production had grown to 300 or 400 copies” (Blair 450).In a reflection of the increasing sophistication of the Sydney-based reader, George Howe, and Robert Howe, would also publish some significant, stand-alone, texts. These included several firsts: the first natural history book printed in the colony, Birds of New South Wales with their Natural History (1813) by John W. Lewin (praised as a text “printed with an elegant and classical simplicity which makes it the highest typographical achievement of George Howe” [Wantrup 278]); the first collection of poetry published in the colony First Fruits of Australian Poetry (1819) by Barron Field; the first collection of poetry written by a Australian-born author, Wild Notes from the Lyre of a Native Minstrel (1826) by Charles Tompson; and the first children’s book A Mother’s Offering to Her Children: By a Lady, Long Resident in New South Wales (1841) by Charlotte Barton. The small concern also published mundane items such as almanacs and receipt books for the Bank of New South Wales (Robb 63, 72). All against the backdrop of printing a newspaper.New Voices The Sydney Gazette was Australia’s first newspaper and, critically for Howe, the only newspaper for over two decades. (A second paper appeared in 1810 but the Derwent Star and Van Diemen’s Land Intelligencer, which only managed twelve issues, presented no threat to The Sydney Gazette.) No genuine, local rival entered the field until 1824, when the Australian was founded by barristers William Charles Wentworth and Robert Wardell. The Monitor debuted in 1826, followed the Sydney Herald in 1831 and the Colonist in 1835 (P.M. Jones 38). It was the second title, the Australian, with a policy that asserted articles to be: “Independent, yet consistent – free, yet not licentious – equally unmoved by favours and by fear” (Walker 6), radically changed the newspaper landscape. The new paper made “a strong point of its independence from government control” triggering a period in which colonial newspapers “became enmeshed with local politics” (Blair 451). This new age of opinion reflected how fast the colony was evolving from an antipodean gaol into a complex society. Also, two papers, without censorship restrictions, without registration, stamp duties or advertisement duties meant, as pointed out by R.B. Walker, that “in point of law the Press in the remote gaol of exile was now freer than in the country of origin” (6). An outcome George Howe could not have predicted as he made the long journey, as a convict, to New South Wales. Of the early competitors, the only one that survives is the Sydney Herald (The Sydney Morning Herald from 1842), which – founded by immigrants Alfred Stephens, Frederick Stokes and William McGarvie – claims the title of Australia’s oldest continuously published newspaper (Isaacs and Kirkpatrick 4-5). That such a small population, with so many pressing issues, factions and political machinations, could support a first newspaper, then competitors, is a testament to the high regard, with which newspaper reportage was held. Another intruder would be The Government Gazette. Containing only orders and notices in the style of the London Gazette (McLeay 1), lacking any news items or private advertisements (Walker 19), it was first issued on 7 March 1832 (and continues, in an online format, today). Of course, Government orders and other notices had news value and newspaper proprietors could bid for exclusive rights to produce these notices until a new Government Printer was appointed in 1841 (Walker 20).Conclusion George Howe, an advocate of “reason and common sense” died in 1821 placing The Sydney Gazette in the hands of his son who “fostered religion” (Byrnes 557-559). Robert Howe, served as editor, experiencing firsthand the perils and stresses of publishing, until he drowned in a boating accident in Sydney Harbour, in 1829 leaving the paper to his widow Ann Howe (Blair 450-51). The newspaper would become increasingly political leading to controversy and financial instability; after more changes in ownership and in editorial responsibility, The Sydney Gazette, after almost four decades of delivering the news – as a sole voice and then as one of several alternative voices – ceased publication in 1842.  During a life littered with personal tragedy, George Howe laid the foundation stone for Australia’s media empires. His efforts, in extraordinary circumstances and against all environmental indicators, serve as inspiration to newspapers editors, proprietors and readers across the country. He established the Australian press, an institution that has been described asa profession, an art, a craft, a business, a quasi-public, privately owned institution. It is full of grandeurs and faults, sublimities and pettinesses. It is courageous and timid. It is fallible. It is indispensable to the successful on-going of a free people. (Holden 15)George Howe also created an artefact of great beauty. The attributes of The Sydney Gazette are listed, in a perfunctory manner, in most discussions of the newspaper’s history. The size of the paper. The number of columns. The masthead. The changes seen across 4,503 issues. Yet, consistently overlooked, is how, as an object, the newspaper is an exquisite example of the printed word. There is a physicality to the paper that is in sharp contrast to contemporary examples of broadsides, tabloids and online publications. Concurrently fragile and robust: its translucent sheets and mottled print revealing, starkly, the problems with paper and ink; yet it survives, in several collections, over two centuries since the first issue was produced. The elegant layout, the glow of the paper, the subtle crackling sound as the pages are turned. The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser is an astonishing example of innovation and perseverance. It provides essential insights into Australia’s colonial era. It is a metonym for making words matter. AcknowledgementsThe author offers her sincere thanks to Geoff Barker, Simon Dwyer and Peter Kirkpatrick for their comments on an early draft of this paper.

In this article we critically review theories of media choice, showing that they have not explicitly dealt with this phenomenon. Although digitalization has recently made it more salient, the communication literature on inconsistent choice still remains highly fragmented. We draw on behavioral economics literature to address blind spots in our theorization of inconsistent media selection.","",""

Does creativity have a place in titles or should titles be descriptive and scientific? This article examines the 408 articles titled “Should I Stay or Should I Go?” and asks why there are so many articles with the same title. The academic culture of publication pressure can lead to researchers choosing creative titles, including popular song titles, to stand out from the crowd. Furthermore, risk assessment leads researchers to choose the same songs as others, because well-known, easy-to-understand cultural references are better rewarded than more obscure references. The collective outcome of this, many researchers choosing the same title for their articles, reflects the mass production of cultural products, wherein creativity is standardized and panders to the largest possible audience.","",""
