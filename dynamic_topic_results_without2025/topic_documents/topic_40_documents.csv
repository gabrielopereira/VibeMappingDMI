"2000","INFORMATION, CAPITALISM AND UNCERTAINTY","This article argues that the changes characterized by many commentators as announcing the ‘information age’ are better seen, not as heralding a new type of society, but as the continuation, consolidation and extension of capitalism – something which is accompanied by constant upheaval and innovation. The shift from conceiving the ‘information society’ as a result of technological breakthroughs to one which lays emphasis on the primacy of ‘information’ itself is observed. The importance especially of informational labour’s ‘flexibility’ is regarded, not as indicative of a new age but of the requirements of globalized capitalism which engenders change the better to consolidate its practices. The instability of life today is ascribed, not to the upheavals resulting from the ‘information revolution’, but rather to the insatiable dynamic that has long been a distinguishing feature of capitalist enterprise. These processes are examined in terms of the shift from public to private provision of information and in the heightened uncertainty of existence today.","",""
"2000","‘INFORMATION SOCIETY’ AS THEORY OR IDEOLOGY: A CRITICAL PERSPECTIVE IN TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT IN THE INFORMATION AGE","This paper argues that the concept of Information Society fails as theory because it is internally incoherent and unsupported by evidence. Its current popularity within policy discourse can only be understood ideologically. In particular it is argued that one of the drivers of current policy towards higher education is based upon the supposed growth of knowledge work linked to a theory of human capital formation as crucial to international competitiveness and to an explanation of unemployment in terms of a skills gap. The paper goes on to argue that current labour market indicators and research into the skills gap do not support this policy thrust and that a better explanation of the current push towards the creation of virtual universities is the desire to cut educational labour costs rather than to upgrade the economic status of so-called knowledge workers.","",""
"2000","INFORMATION INTERDEPENDENCE: Keohane and Nye's complex interdependence in the information age","A well-known and respected attempt to theorize interdependence in the field of international relations is complex interdependence. In Power and Interdependence , Robert O. Keohane and Joseph S. Nye, Jr define interdependence as reciprocal effects among actors resulting from 'international transactions - flows of money, goods, people and messages across international boundaries'. Though much research has been done on the effects of interdependence on the first three, the flows of messages have been studied less often. Keohane and Nye addressed the issue in a 1998 article in Foreign Affairs , discussing changes in the global environment resulting from the information age which have had an impact on their ideas. This article proposes to go deeper into complex interdependence. The world is becoming increasingly 'information interdependent' and this essay is an attempt to apply the assumptions and concepts presented in complex interdependence to the information age. In the final analysis, complex interdependence complements research from the field of communications, that information flows should be understood as underlying mechanisms and processes that facilitate contextual understanding of issues. It maintains the integrity of the assumptions of complex interdependence, while adding an understanding of the nature of information and information flows.","",""
"2000","THE INFORMATION SOCIETY AS MEGA-MACHINE","Too often the history of information and communication technologies (ICTs) is wrenched out of the history of technology and presented as something altogether separate and therefore different, rendering previous analyses irrelevant. However, there are sufficient analytical tools to hand without the continual invention of new paradigms to understand the current stage of technological advance. To support this contention, in this article, the continuing relevance of Lewis Mumford is explored. Mumford's discussion of the megalopolis and the emergence of the invisible city as its most developed state make a direct link with the networked information society, establishing a link between the information society and Mumford'sanalysis of the previous history of technology.At the centre of Mumford'sdiscussion of this history is the dialectic interaction of authoritarian and democratic technics. Mumford's notion of technics stresses that technologies can not be divided from the social relations in which they appear. In the information society,this dialectical pair map onto the twin dynamics of enclosure and disclosure. The former dynamic represents the control of information through commodification and marketization, the latter the recognition of the empowering and emancipatory qualities of ICTs. Up until now,discussions of the information society have regarded only one or other dynamic as normal, whereas utilizing Mumford'sinsight, the contradictory character of the information society can be theorized without rendering the second dynamic abnormal. Thus, the article concludes that recourse to Mumford's ideas, to re-embed ICTs in the history of technology, allows a more nuanced and fruitful treatment of current developments in information society.","",""

"2000","Refining and Extending the Business Model With Information Technology: Dell Computer Corporation","The exceptional performance of Dell Computer in recent years illustrates an innovative response to a fundamental competitive factor in the personal computer industry - the value of time. This article shows how Dell's strategies of direct sales and build-to-order production have proven successful in minimizing inventory and bringing new products to market quickly, enabling it to increase market share and achieve high returns on investment. The Dell case illustrates how one business model may have inherent advantages under particular market conditions, but it also shows the importance of execution in exploiting those advantages. In particular, Dell's use of information technology (IT) has been vital to executing both elements of its business model - direct sales and build-to-order - and provides valuable insights into how IT can be applied to achieve speed and flexibility in an industry in which time is critical. Many of the insights gained from this case can be applied more generally to other time-dependent industries, suggesting that the findings from the Dell case will have implications for a growing number of companies and industries in the future.","",""
"2000","The social life of information - Table of contents","For years pundits have predicted that information technology will obliterate the need for everything from travel to supermarkets to business organizations to social life itself. They have heralded the coming of the virtual office, digital butlers, electronic libraries, and virtual universities. Beaten down by info-glut and exasperated by computer systems with software crashes, viruses, and unintelligible error messages, individual users tend to wax less enthusiastic about technological predictions. Amid the hype and the never-narrowing gap between promise and performance, they find it hard to get a vision of the true potential of the digital revolution. John Seely Brown and Paul Duguid in their book The Social Life of Information (Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 2000) help us see through frenetic visions of the future to the real forces for change in society. Arguing elegantly for the important role that human sociability plays in the world of bits, this book, and the chapters published here in First Monday, gives us an optimistic look beyond the simplicities of information and individuals. The authors show how a better understanding of the contribution that communities, organizations, and institutions make to learning, knowledge, and judgement can lead to the richest possible use of technology in our work and everyday lives.","",""

We consider the problem of information glut, the quality of public discourse, the question of privacy and technological alienation. Concerning the basic attitudes, we discuss the aesthetic, the moral and the religious views, considered in the context of the present life-space pervaded and shaped by information technology. The paper concludes with a discussion of the possible consequences of global homogenization and of the cultural ahistoricity that are being created by the massive use of information technology. Among the positive aspects of this new 'global culture of the present' we point out the possible increase of global human solidarity; among the negative ones, we point out the flattening and shrinking of the space of human experience, which this uniform culture of the present imposes.","",""

"2001","CYBER-UTOPIA AND THE MYTH OF PARADISE: USING JACQUES ELLUL'S WORK ON PROPAGANDA TO ANALYSE INFORMATION SOCIETY RHETORIC","Whereas Jacques Ellul's work on the role of myth in propaganda about the technological society has been largely overlooked, it presents an effective means to analyse the ways in which the information society is symbolically constructed. The French thinker'sexamination of mid-twentieth-century propaganda has much relevance in studying current rhetoric about the 'information revolution', 'global information infrastructure' and 'knowledge-based society'. Not only did he prove prophetic in his description of the increasing intensification of technique in various aspects of life, but also his work offers significant insight into the ways the integrally capitalist vision of 'global information society' is being publicized around the world. The promotion of new media on a transnational scale by government, industry and media can be usefully studied within a myth-based framework. Unlike other writers on myth and communication Ellul underlined the religious roots of myth, therefore drawing attention to the ancient origins of contemporary notions. He suggested that ideology in itself was not able to mobilize individuals, but was dependent on the psychological/spiritual force of myth to move people to action. Propagandists use networks of various myths, which operate interactively with each other to reinforce prevailing ideologies. This article uses a set of technological myths identified by Ellul (science, history, nation, work, happiness, youth and the hero) to show how they can be used in developing a framework to analyse and challenge current propaganda about information society. Such applications of the French sociologist's work on myth, propaganda and technological society will encourage the broadening of scholarly activity beyond the strictly positivist confines of dominant social science.","",""
"2001","The Victorian Information Society: Surveillance, Bureaucracy, and Public Librarianship in 19th-Century Britain","Contrary to the """"retro"""" image often awarded them, and despite their continuing enthusiasm and responsibility for the organization of printed materials, librarians are upbeat about the prospects of an information society driven primarily by electronic technologies, but in which libraries can play an important part. Public librarians detect a natural correlation between the historic democratic mission of their institution and the increased accessibility made possible by digitalized sources. The library community's acceptance of the information society idea as a """"given"""" social phenomenon supports discourses that play down historical continuities and herald the dawn of a new age. Such discourses ignore or reject historical evidence that points to the existence of past information societies, revolutions, and infrastructures defined, in part, by the operation of indirect surveillance, constituted by the bureaucratic information systems of modernity. Victorian Britain serves as a good example of an early information society, to which public libraries, themselves micro-information societies, contributed significantly. The role played by public librarians in the Victorian information society, illustrated in this article by evidence drawn from the contemporary library press, is seen in their preoccupation with the surveillance and ordering of knowledge; their adoption for library operations of the businesslike, bureaucratic procedures described recently by business historians; and their panoptic tracking of users and their activities.","",""

"2002","Critical Theory, Information Society and Surveillance Technologies","This article offers an account of information and communication technologies (ICTs) that draws upon the tradition of critical theory, arguing that an application of the latter to the former can be categorized as a theory of 'cyber criticalism'. Its aim is not to provide an exhaustive theoretical analysis or any kind of literature review, but to suggest that such a theorization is possible because cyber criticalism (1) offers an account of social power and (2) suggests how and why alternatives to existing social practices and institutions can be formed. The first section relates the debate about information society to that concerning globalization and argues that two main theories square off against each other in the race to explain that society: one which, in Castells's terminology, emphasizes the power of flows and the other which emphasizes the flows of power. If the former is inadequate in crucial respects then the way is clear for critical theorists to explore the latter. Cyber criticalism is then sketched in outline and the article proceeds to identify information systems, the flows of power, as potential sites of resistance. The final section focuses upon biometrics and argues that the way forward for cyber critical theorists lies in exploiting the cultural insecurities of informatic capitalism. Ultimately, then, cyber criticalism is critical theory updated for the information age. Unlike those such as Castells it identifies flows of power and the intensification of those flows around the dominant nodes of the informational net. It insists that information systems constitute potential sites of resistance. Nevertheless, acts of resistance are still relatively marginal and fragmented events due to they way in which social problems are pathologized and criminalized.","",""
"2002","Local Adaptations to Global Trends: A Study of an IT-Based Organizational Change Program in a Nigerian Bank","The working assumption of this research is that the utilization of information technology (IT) and IT-based practices in any part of the world currently is taking place within the globalization trends. In recent times, studies in information systems (IS) are beginning to examine whether the globalization process portends homogeneity for developing countries' organizations or whether these organizations can utilize IT and IT-based management techniques according to the sociocultural requirements of their contexts. These studies show the importance of the local context and, more specifically, the importance of adapting global IT-based practices when implementing them in developing countries. However, the precise nature of these adaptations and the factors that shape them are still poorly understood--leaving this a fruitful area for research. In line with this view, this article explores how a Nigerian bank implemented and adapted a global IT-based technique, the factors that influence such adaptations, and what results are achieved.","",""

"2002","Continuities and Transformations: Challenges to Capturing Information about the 'Information Society'","Continuous change and radical transformations are intrinsic and often contradictory in the 'Information Society.' If the 'Information Society' marks a radical social shift, i.e. discontinuous change, then theorizing what the phenomenon is becomes crucial in capturing useful information about it. Yet, if continuities with other changes, both economic and social, characterize the 'Information Society,' then well-tested information systems might be adapted to collect needed information.  The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris is working to develop statistics which are both internationally comparable and illuminating of public policy debates on the 'Information Society.' This effort focuses infrastructure and content. For both, goods and services are produced, traded, and consumed by firms and individuals. There are social impacts and inputs. The process, whether of continuous change or radical transformation, of developing 'Information Society' is a social process.  Thus far, OECD has identified information and computing technologies (ICTs) as providing an infrastructure necessary to displaying, moving, processing and storing data, information and codified knowledge. The OECD's ongoing work on indicators for the information society opens possibilities for a discursive sociological examination of the processes involved in, and operative with, 'Information Society' to ask whether and to what extent continuous change exists, and if radical transformation is occurring, how best to capture it. We can, relying on the work of the OECD as a case study, ask crucial sociological questions. Is information society defined and driven by electronic products, or is it a social creation which then requires electronic products? Is the central issue the electronic products, their production and distribution, or is it the electronic networks that deliver them? Is society transforming? What role does knowledge play?","",""
"2002","Posthuman Law: Information Policy and the Machinic World"," It has been an unspoken assumption that the law is made by humans for humans. That assumption no longer holds: The subject of information policy is increasingly flows between machines, machinic rather than social values play ever-more important roles in decision-making, and information policy for human society is being supplemented, supplanted, and superceded by machinic decision-making. As the barrier between the human and machinic falls with implantation of chips within the body and other types of intimate relationships, and as dependence upon the information infrastructure continues to grow, the question of the rights of technological systems themselves is entering the legal system. This paper explores information technologies as the policy subject, as determinant of the values that inform information policy, and as policy-makers. All of these are manifestations of a transformation in the legal system so fundamental that it may be said that we are entering a period of posthuman law. ","",""
"2002","Mapping the Information Society Literature: Topics, Perspectives, and Root Metaphors","This article concerns the Information Society literature and is set in the context of teaching and learning about it, particularly in educational technology settings. In spite of the infancy of the Information Society phenomenon, a large literature has emerged in recent years that discusses its nature. Not surprisingly, the literature does not present a uniform view; rather, there are differences of opinion as to the nature and significance of the Information Society. We argue that the literature constitutes an educational problem for those teaching and learning about this complex territory. The discussion visits the complexity by constructing a comprehensive map that charts 1) topics, 2) perspectives, and 3) root metaphors. Mapping the literature helps both teachers and learners find their way in a potentially confusing field of study. Special emphasis is devoted to root metaphors - philosophical views about the nature of reality that in turn help teachers and learners become more sensitive to critical, underlying features of the Information Society discussion. We argue that some root metaphors are more helpful than others for understanding literature about the Information Society.","",""

Confronting these realities, the communication industries are using monopolization strategies, surveillance, and technological design in their, often elusive, attempts to manage risk and turn the scarce resources of the media economy - time, money and attention - into economic value. These strategies erode the ‘soft factors’ of trust, confidence, social networks and privacy that are vital to people’s willingness to embrace new ICTs and the legitimacy of the information society. Although these trends have created space for new privacy enhancing technologies and trust-brokers, the translation of sociocultural norms into technology and market-based solutions renders communicative spaces more opaque than ever.

This analysis builds upon previous critiques of language and policy by focusing on language as a mode of social action. Four major discourses are identified: threat/opportunity, technological determinism, market dominance and citizen vs consumer. Despite the articulation of a broad set of policy goals, it is argued that these discourses act to structure the debate in such a way that its economic parameters become privileged, at the expense of social and cultural factors. Further, it is contended that this has consequences for information policy, and the type of information society that will ultimately be achieved. ","",""
"2003","Addressing the Negative Consequences of the Information Age Lessons from Karl Polanyi and the industrial revolutionA note on the politics of theorizing technology","One of the great dilemmas of the information age is the tension between two dynamics: (1) the tendency of information to be free-flowing and not to lose its value as it moves and (2) the tendency to want to control that flow of information in order to profit from its value. In 1944, Karl Polanyi identified similar contradictions in the industrial revolution, except the flowing material was capital instead of information. He spent a lifetime exposing what he felt to be the negative consequences of this increasingly free-flowing capital, the hallmark of a free market economy. He advocated for a welfare state in which government intervention is necessary to control these negative effects. Given issues of the information age such as the digital divide, the commoditization of information, and security and privacy, as well as the arguments of the proponents and critics of these issues, Polanyi's concepts can provide insight into the complexities of increasingly technical and information-based societies.","",""
"2003","Opening the ‘Black Box’ of Software The micro-foundations of informational technologies, practices and environments","The technical and production structures of informational development, the mechanisms that translate information into new products and power, remain opaque. Without defining these micro-foundational patterns, simple questions - what is information, how is it produced, is this production structure significantly unique - remain unanswered, limiting analysis of informational development generally, and evaluation of higher-level """"information' theories specifically. Opening the """"black box' of software outlines these production practices in one of the central industries of the coming decades, helping explain its social and economic impact and locating its evolution within broader global economic patterns. Software is a unique informational practice that draws on socially structured domain-knowledge as its central resource. This clarifies the importance of information and design in an informational environment, as well as signalling the impact of digital architectures in structuring new patterns of social interaction. These informational patterns are embedded in software both technically and through the development process, resulting in a strong cohesion between production, product and industry structures. The expansion of software process and products throughout society raises the impact of these unique patterns in shaping future economic and social structures in multiple industries, locations and institutions. Detailing the informational patterns in software opens a path to consider an ideal-typology of informational production. Such an ideal type helps define terms and hypotheses that capture both unique differences and general patterns in an informational environment, opening more rigorous analysis of the broader social transformations in the global environment. Failing to recognize these processes limits the space for social debate, policy and action around the establishment and evolution of new digital architectures at the locus of their development.","",""
"2004","The Past, Present, and Future of Information Policy","The profile of information policy in academic and policy-making circles has been rising in recent decades, a function, presumably, of the expansion of an ‘information society’. Nevertheless, there is widespread confusion over its meaning and purpose. This paper seeks to produce a clearer picture, building on useful groundwork in information science and other disciplines. The history of information policy is traced, featuring exposition of the pioneering contribution of Marc Porat in the 1970s. The present state of information policy is then described, with particular reference to some salient themes of current literature: issue inventories (i.e. the scope of information policy); academic identity (including a critique of attempts to appropriate information policy for one discipline); and the ideal – or, it is argued, illusion – of a ‘national information policy’. In the final section of the paper, some suggestions are made for the future direction of information policy. First, information policy should engage much more thoroughly with the tradition of political philosophy. Second, information policy may benefit from more forays into the field of futures studies. Finally, it is proposed that information policy could be positioned as a subset of the interdisciplinary specialism of information society studies, in which case its definition might be resolved in terms of the ‘normative theory of the information society’","",""
"2004","The Sickness of an Information Society R. H. Tawney and the post-industrial condition","R. H. Tawney is frequently cited as one of the most distinguished social theorists of the twentieth century, and his position in the British school of ethical, democratic socialism is assured. This paper revisits that contribution for the so-called post- industrial age. It emphasizes Tawney’s roots in philosophical idealism and Christian socialism, demonstrating how these systems underpinned his famous critiques of inequality and the acquisitive society. His deontological morality anticipates key ideas of John Rawls, leading similarly to a robust social egalitarianism. The moral basis of Tawney’s left-liberal politics explains its durability and thus its relevance for the Great Information Society Debate. Tawney would have rejected many of the propositions associated with the information society thesis, including the allegedly axial role of information itself. While recognizing the importance of information and knowledge in democracy, he would not have supported transformationist rhetoric on behalf of an electronic information polity. Tawney’s essentialist socialism may be vulnerable to some of the better documented post-industrial trends, notably the move from goods to services. However, his work supplies useful resources for critical perspectives on the technocratic social structure and on the exaggerated economic role of teleworkers, inter alia. As regards the last in Daniel Bell’s triad of polity, social structure and culture, some might lament the anchorage of Tawney’s progressive politics in a particularist metaphysics, specifically Christianity. Yet the return of religious modes seems now as certain as the rise of new modes of information and communication. The Christian socialist values that inspired Tawney’s ideal of social democracy, especially an expansive vision of brotherhood or ‘fellowship’, could therefore be appropriated for a modern normative theory of the information society.","",""

"2004","Critique of Information, by S. Lash. London: Sage Publications, 2002. xii + 234 pp. $37.95. ISBN 0-7619-5269-1","Critique of Information is an important book of social theory that deserves a wide audience among students of media and society, although its dense conceptual structure and style of argument may challenge readers. It will certainly send them reaching for their copies of earlier work by McLuhan, Bell, Habermas, Giddens, Luhmann, Deleuze and Guattari, Lefebvre, Latour, Haraway, Poster, Luke, and a half dozen more; here, Scott Lash has attempted a major feat of theoretical synthesis, and to a great extent succeeds. Unlike more skeptical observers such as Frank Webster, Lash takes the phrase “information society” seriously, even literally. He identifies what he considers to be the key characteristics of information in a technologically-saturated media environment (embeddedness, nonlinearity, flow, space/time compression, real-time circulation and use) and then argues that because contemporary society itself is intrinsically informational, it too has these same characteristics. Crucially, information is not in society or related to society; information is society, and vice versa. This development has been facilitated by the spread of information and communication technologies (ICTs), so that all aspects of social life are, to echo Bruno Latour, sociotechnical, with social action and technical infrastructure inextricably tied in codetermining networks of people and things. The centerpiece of Lash’s argument is his departure from critical theory of both the “German dialectic[s] and French post-structural aporetic[s]” schools (p. 8) to contend that today there is no longer any transcendental, objective, or privileged position from which critique or social analysis can be undertaken. If society is intrinsically informational, and the analyst is inescapably part of the society, so too must the analyst and the analysis be informational, as tied up with and characterized by the nature of information as every other social entity or phenomenon. As Lash repeatedly insists, “The critique of information is in the information itself” (p. 220); “Information critique must be critique without transcendentals” (p. 9). By the same token, fundamental social phenomena like power, capital, sociality, and so on are also essentially informational and share the same character. Lash makes the case that in such an environment power is exercised not so much as exploitation of certain classes, groups or regions by others, but (following Castells) by exclusion from the flows and means of communication: “Previously exploited, semi-skilled and ethnic minority working classes become increasingly irrelevant to informationalaccumulation, which now takes place not on their backs but behind their backs” (p. 5). Therefore, Lash believes, the resistance or response to power must be informational too—real-time, nonlinear, a matter of navigation through networks and flows. Overall, Lash draws from an extraordinary range of contemporary social theories to contend that there must be a new form and practice of social analysis and critique. Due to the sheer velocity, constant flow, and succession of information (bits, images, text, sounds, etc.), social critics and analysts no longer have the luxury of holding variables constant, of suspending action in principle in order to make abstract comparisons, of focusing narrowly on a single phenomenon or relationship at a time. Conventional causal models must be replaced by “additive” models or theories where “and” is the central operator rather than “because.” (This would also imply that subtractivity is a corollary; if the propelling dynamic of networks and flows is cumulative, there would also seem to be a counterdynamic of breakdown and loss that permits further accumulation to occur. Lash doesn’t state this explicitly, but it is suggested by his claims about power exercised as exclusion; social groups have “spaces to dis-identify as well as re-identify” [p. 5].) The intriguing possibility he suggests is a move away from conventional forms of social analysis and critique and toward conceptual art as the new critical practice, or perhaps a merger of art and critique.

"2005","Knowledge Society and Third Way","&#x0D;         &#x0D; &#x0D;  The recent threats to a presumed international order posed by acts of heightened terrorism have overshadowed the promise of an emergent order evoked by such concepts as ‘the third way’ and ‘the knowledge society’. Part of the problem with these notions is that they have resonance for only a fairly selective group of intellectuals. Additionally, the terms are somewhat amorphous, so they have not achieved secure purchase in the popular media. But their meanings are not necessarily cancelled by the disordering events of political extremism, worrying as those events are. In the domestic policies of governments, and in workplaces, these other calls to (a beneficent) order continue to be heard and acted upon. The questions are those one must ask of any putative order: what kind of order is it, and is it really beneficial? It is perhaps all the more important to ask these questions when we might be otherwise distracted by the more dramatic events.   The End of History?   Both the knowledge society and the third way are variations on the ‘end of history’ thesis proposed by the US political scientist, Francis Fukuyama, after the collapse of the Soviet Union. For Fukuyama, as is by now well known, this collapse (for him of Marxism or communism, not just of the Soviet Union) ushered in the triumph of liberalism and capitalism as practiced in the United States and other Western-style democracies. In the third way thesis, as propounded by Anthony Giddens and others, a similar conviction about the bankruptcy of Marxism is accompanied by a more tempered view of liberal capitalism. The third way is, in practice, a middle path between the two, one which recognizes the need for State intervention, not only to condition and discipline the market – which left to its own devices will inevitably have detrimental social effects – but also to facilitate optimum participation in society generally. Hence, the focus of governments on what they call ‘capacity building’, which strongly emphasizes education and training amongst their responsibilities. As a result, the antithesis between communism and capitalism can now appear to have been resolved in a higher synthesis, leaving no room for further dramatic shifts in social organization.   The knowledge society – formerly and still sometimes referred to as ‘the knowledge economy’ – has a similar ‘end of history’ flavor because it promises to resolve or at least ameliorate class conflict. It is based on the idea that, increasingly, machines can perform repetitive work, and that basic necessities can be easily met in modern economies. This creates ample scope for product differentiation (niche marketing) and for the provision of cultural goods – entertainment and so on. Everybody will have the opportunity to learn and apply knowledge, and therefore find fulfilling work. Everybody will have the capacity to innovate, and therefore improve the company’s performance, by which each person gains satisfaction and a stake in the future of the business. Technology is also frequently evoked: the interactive new media are said to be particularly amenable to knowledge sharing and innovation. At least in theory, the knowledge society can itself be seen as a third way, or meeting point, between economics and culture, science and arts; and therefore all disciplines, all areas of education and training, are equally important to future social and economic wellbeing.   Both these notions have their clear attractions, and can be logically argued to institute improvements on previous orders. But how fully can they achieve their promises, or more importantly, are their promised benefits not just logical entailments but reasonably certain consequences of their social realization? Or can this new order be exploited to the same ends as previous orders? In this short essay, I can do no more than signal a few warnings or reservations concerning the promises that have been made.   Social Unity?   First of all, both concepts appeal to a putative unity of society, typically grounded in such notions as ‘social capital’ or ‘civil society’. This is problematic, if it is suspected that such unity is a chimera, impossible to achieve, and indeed a dangerous ambition in that it licenses the powerful to find a scapegoat for its elusiveness. Glyn Daly sums the situation up as follows:     In every attempt to command the social terrain – to create an antagonism-free new order – various culprits are identified and made responsible for the original loss, or theft, of the fantastical object: Society, Harmony, Salvation, etc. Indeed, the very construction(s) of the social might be understood as a never-ending attempt to solve the original ‘crime’: to identify who has possession of the lost/stolen objects that would enable the full realization/representation of ‘us’. (79)     So today, in my own country, New Zealand, we are given a false picture of a nation that lacks enterprise, drives away its best young intellects, can’t convert ideas into business reality, and so on. That paradise of the past when we ‘punched above our weight’, produced Nobel Prize winners and dominated the world in sports, has been stolen away from us. But all around is evidence that is at least partially to the contrary (it is also a fact that it is a big world, and the rest of it is catching up to our once privileged position). Any edition of the Dominion Post’s technology supplement, Info Tech Weekly, is bursting with technological and new media success stories: new start-ups, joint ventures, profitable sellouts, investment from overseas, revolutionary software, value-added agricultural products. Some of these crash and burn: contrary to the myth about the over-gentle, risk-averse New Zealanders, this is sometimes the result of brashness, rashness, and arrogance.   New Artisans?   Secondly, similar promises about new and improved orders of capitalism have been made before, but the situation was turned to the advantage of capital. In his book on Walter Benjamin, Julian Roberts refers to the ‘cooperative patterns of control’ implied by technology in the new order emerging between the wars. The production management systems that came to be known as Taylorism and Fordism, for example, by instituting processes based on the division of labor, ensured – in theory – that all participants in production were mutually dependent and therefore in some sense equal. Roberts suggests that these new arrangements threatened the old dispensation centered on private ownership of the means of production, and corrective action was not long following. ‘In order to retain this ownership, capitalism . . . resorted to a number of stratagems of which the most important was the division of the world into thinkers and doers, directors and directed, controllers and controlled’ (170).   Does contemporary technology, particularly the advent of computers and the Internet as a significant means of production, imply a change in the pattern of control? Conceivably, computer technology and virtual knowledge products (software, etc.) could facilitate a return to a widespread artisan-like mode of production, and we see this to some extent in the new start-ups based on one or a few individuals, engaged in small-scale production. But we have also already seen that where these new enterprises are successful, they tend to expand and subsume, or are bought out by larger concerns. Significantly, we are in a business climate that remains strongly pro-growth, a feature of which is the repeated exhortation of self-employed or small firms to expand, to gear up to an export level of production. In the dissemination of this entrepreneurial message, the business media, which have themselves multiplied in recent years, have played a prominent role.    Diverse and Mutually Enriching Knowledges?   The concept of knowledge society has come to privilege science and technology. In the news media, as influenced by powerful interests, knowledge society and science and technology are more or less conflated. They are as well in the minds of important people, including those in the all-important research-funding bodies. A pertinent example in New Zealand is the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology. While official foundation publicity is relatively embracing of different approaches to knowledge – ‘the concept of a knowledge society includes the creation, distribution and application of new knowledge to all aspects and across all parts of society’ (FRST, “Foundation’s Role” 4) – specific individual pronouncements betray the actual emphases. For example, in announcing the appointment of a new CEO, the foundation’s Chairman, Neil Richardson said: ‘We live in exciting times and one can sense that the country is finally embracing the value of science and innovation and with it, the concept of a knowledge economy’ (FRST, “Permanent CEO” 1).   By such means, ‘knowledge society’ is being used to maintain a division between science and arts, science and culture, when the term’s initial appearance promised a new or renewed awareness of the entanglement of these categories. (This is an outcome which has been only partly mitigated by the burgeoning of the creative industries, since there has been a trend to coining other terms such as ‘the creative economy’ to characterize this phenomenon.) In consequence, a fully nuanced evaluation of the role of scientific and technological development in contemporary society, as well as of its creeping commercialization, is further postponed.   Conclusion   Immanuel Wallerstein suggests that what he calls the Capitalist World-System has entered a period of transition towards a new system that may or may not be better than the present one. It is possible to imagine that the ‘third way’ and the ‘knowledge society’ – despite the reservations I have outlined – represent a moderating of the capitalist order that will usher in or help condition the arrival of the new. Or failing that, the privileging of knowledge will foster a reflectivity that will enable society to find a better way. Interestingly, however, Wallerstein suspects that such moderation will only prolong the current order, and that something more drastic (if not revolutionary) will be required in the long run if any significant improvement is to be achieved. And as far as reflectivity is concerned, the opposite is arguably true: that ‘knowledge’ merely serves rhetorically to conceal an intensification of the drive for profit and the general expansion of the business mentality.

"2005","Reply to critics","Let me right off say thank you to Roger Burrows, Steve Fuller and Nicholas Gane for their thoughtful and constructive criticisms of my essay. I was gratified to find considerable agreement about my concerns regarding attempts to come to terms with the Information Age. One concern appears to be shared by us all: the need to debate the status and success (and failure) of disciplines so that we may improve research into what is agreed is a period of great significance and tumult. In my article the focus was on Sociology and Cultural Studies, with an emphasis on the former. I would observe here that we ought not to be too inward looking in this examination. In the UK there was been considerable discussion internal to Sociology regarding the relative merits of quantitative and qualitative Sociology. This has had important consequences for funding and training of postgraduates who receive Economic and Social Research Council support. However, I would want to stress that this debate has been limiting. First, it demotes important issues within Sociology. To me especially, schooled in the tradition by the late Phillip Abrams (1982), Historical Sociology has been largely sidelined. Indeed, a one-time convention that Sociology and History were indistinguishable – as C. Wright Mills (1958) put it, ‘all Sociology worthy of the name is “historical sociology”’ (p. 162) – is nowadays pretty well ignored in practice. It has been hard for any Historical Sociology to get significant research funding over the past 20 years, and the results are evident in the diminishment of outputs. I would urge that any adequate account of the Information Age must incorporate high-quality Historical Sociology if it is to grasp the relations of continuity and change. As it is, most research into informational matters is ridden with a presentist bias, an almost exclusive focus on the here and now. Funds flow to research subjects such as the Internet and political engagement, e-community or mobile telephony, but where might be support for a serious historical study of, say, the development of information employment? Presentism’s conceit is that now is of singular import, and such a presumption pervades research on the Information Age. We are so enveloped in the tumult of now that research readily comes fixated on the present and its priorities. We easily come dazzled, lose perspective and are convinced without argument that we do indeed live in ‘new times’. Historical Sociology helps us ask questions of","",""
"2005","An information age without technology?","Frank Webster’s article ‘Making sense of the Information Age’ advances a normative statement of what Sociology in or of the Information Age should look like: a form of macro-analysis that combines grand narratives of social change with ‘real-world’ empirical research. In making this statement, Webster aligns himself with an ‘admirable tradition’ of ‘middle range’ theory that runs from Dahrendorf, Touraine, Halsey, Mills and Miliband through to Bell (to whom he pays tribute) and, more recently, Castells. He also distances himself, on one hand, from social constructivist approaches to science and technology that proved ‘unable to come up with any ‘big’ thinking as regards the character of change’, and on the other, Cultural Studies, which is said to be ‘methodologically flawed’ and excessively voluntaristic. Alongside this, Webster makes an argument against technological determinism. While he commends Bell for the scope and empirical ambition of his work, he takes issue with the technological determinist framework within which it operated. In this regard, he sympathizes with social constructivism and mainstream Cultural Studies for objecting to the idea that technology causes social change, while stressing that this is not enough in itself to redeem these approaches. By the end of the article, the only thinker that measures up in this respect is Manuel Castells, who ‘does much to shift away from technological determinism without abandoning the big picture’. By way of response, I would like to draw attention to some of the limits of Castells’s work. These limits, in turn, will be used to question Webster’s refusal to see technology as an agent of social and cultural change. Before doing so, however, I will look briefly at Webster’s reading of the boundaries between Sociology and Cultural Studies, and between these two disciplines and the related sphere of Media Studies.","",""
"2005","Making sense of the information age","This article traces the development in Britain of research on information and communications in relation to trends in Sociology and this discipline's relations with Cultural Studies. It observes at the outset the seminal contribution of Daniel Bell's conception of Post-Industrial Society, characterizing it as blending theory with empirical observation while providing an account of the most consequential features of change. Sociology in the UK during the 1980s largely ignored macro-level analysis and focused on work and employment, took its starting point as opposition to the technological determinism associated with this first wave enthusiasm for the ‘microelectronics revolution’, and produced localized and textured studies. Manuel Castells' conception of the Network Society, while distinctive, signalled a return to the scale and scope offered by Bell, notably in being a macro analysis that combined theory and empirical evidence. Castells' contribution coincided with a second wave of technological enthusiasm associated especially with the Internet. Alongside this Sociology in Britain has experienced the rise of Cultural Studies, a field that has competed for important parts of what might have been considered Sociology's terrain. Indeed, Cultural Studies has outpaced Sociology in response to recent changes in the information domain. Its emergence expressed little concern with technological determinism, embracing ‘virtuality’ and being more open to the exploration of expanding culture. Nonetheless, Cultural Studies remains methodologically flawed while, like so much sociological research on ICTs and information, seemingly incapable of combining theory and empirical evidence that identify and explain the major contours of change.","",""

ISBN 1-84150-106-9.Although there always have been critical and skepti-cal voices in the (academic) debates on the emergenceof a radically “new” information society (Schement L Webster, 1995; Calabrese & Burgelman,1999), those voices were not listened to, disregarded, orneglected altogether. Instead, the coming of the informa-tion society was heralded and propagated by (most) aca-demics, governments, and corporate actors alike as havingrevolutionaryeffectsonalmosteveryaspectoflife—work,leisure,politics,capitalisteconomy,welfare,andsoon.Assuch, the technologies that facilitate the real-time distribu-tion of information and supposedly allow us to communi-cate more, more quickly, and more cheaply; form part ofnewly construed myths in support of the dominant “sus-tainablegrowth”and“revolutionist”paradigmincapitalistdiscourses. Within these so-called boom visions, technol-ogy is sacralized, and the machine becomes a god, capa-ble of any- and everything, and above all unquestionable(Kubicek et al., 1997). Such techno-optimistic discoursesdefend the idea that technology as such is neutral and thatthe rapid spread of information and communication tech-nologies (ICTs) in society will cause a social, economic,and political transformation of society that will be posi-tive and progressive by default. Authors challenging thesedeterministic assumptions were often labeled as diehardpessimists or doom thinkers.However, when the so-called “new economy/dot.com”bubbleburst,moreskepticalvoicesinthedebatesurround-ing the emergence of an information society suddenlygained more respectability. Some economic—as well asstate—actors even started adopting a more cautious dis-course. On the economic side, the collapse of the “new”economy and the failure of e-commerce, especially inEurope, showed that “old” business—and especiallyﬁnancial—practices, as well as long-standing economiclaws, were still relevant and valid (Lennon, 2000). Onthe policy side, discourses also shifted gradually fromblatantly technologically deterministic to a more shadedperspective, taking social contexts and divides into ac-count (HLGIS, 1994; HLEG, 1997; European Commis-sion, 2001). Nevertheless, we can still observe a ratherclassic continuum in the debate concerning the role ofICTs in society, going from radical discontinuity to the-ses of (accelerated) continuity, and it is fair to say thatthe dominant discourse is still ﬁrmly situated within thediscontinuity paradigm.The three books under review all take a critical stance,opposing these dominant discourses, but within those crit-ical perspectives different positions emerge. The skepticalview that Christopher May (2002) defends with strong ar-guments is clearly situated on the continuity end of thecontinuum revolution/evolution. One by one he rejects themost common revolutionary assumptions with regard tothe impact of ICTs on society.

However, despite its comprehensive and insightful analysis, it illustrates a common trend amongst theorists whereby the inherent pessimism of their arguments' logic tends to be replaced by an unwarranted optimism regarding their conclusions. This criticism is applied to Lash's critique, which is further supplemented by a rejection of Lash's argument that the transcendent perspective necessary for critical theory has been supplanted in the information age by an immanent all-at-onceness. The much more negative perceptions of the social and cultural effects of the Order to be found within literature and cultural history are defended as valuable sources of critical perspectives that may still help to aid theory as it struggles to keep up with the Order's discombobulating flows.","",""

The book's main thesis is that critique in the information age must be immanent critique. Taylor reproaches this for neglecting the necessity of a transcendental for critique. The response accepts this criticism. However, it rejects Taylor's aporetic notion of critique. Instead, a dialectical notion of critique is proposed. Like all dialectics this informational dialectic is one of materiality and idea. The major difference in the information age, however, is that there is a tendency for the material and the ideal to fuse in information itself. Thus the critique of information, it is argued, is a sort of immanent dialectic. This notion of critique is illustrated with reference to media art and metadata. Throughout there is an engagement with Taylor of the political implications of such critique.","",""

"2006","‘Laying a foundation of fact’: Fabianism and the information society thesis","This article explores affinities between postindustrialism and modes of thinking characteristic of the Fabian Society, especially in the first half of the twentieth century. In the hands of Daniel Bell and others, the information society thesis postulates the coming of a postindustrial society marked by the centrality of information and knowledge. While caveats abound in Bell's version, the thesis has been generally optimistic in outlook, portraying postindustrial society as an advanced level of social development. Interestingly, the Fabian Society, a British-based organization highly influential in the twentieth-century project of social democracy, also emphasized information in its advocacy of social progress: ‘laying a foundation of fact’, according to one commentator, was a key ingredient of the Fabian approach. Texts by thinkers such as Sidney Webb and H.G. Wells suggest that ‘informationalism’, a commitment to information in an original sense of hard facts and figures, must indeed be construed as the essence of Fabianism, as that which distinguishes the Fabians from more metaphysical or emotional expressions of socialism. The article traces the link between information-powered politics and the largely successful practice of social engineering in Britain. However, social engineering can, and in the case of some Fabians did, degenerate into a technocratic and even totalitarian mindset. Critiques of Fabianism are therefore also acknowledged here, including those claiming that the Fabian preoccupation with data-gathering and filing, its ‘proceduralism’, actually constituted a major weakness. However, given its noble informational ideal, Fabianism can, the article concludes, illuminate contemporary information society problems. The Fabian tradition contains suggestive materials on such topical themes as fair access to information, the role of facts in progressive politics, and the prospects for an international institutional order.","",""

ISBN 1-904558-07-0”","This book is an overview of society in the information age using some examples from Ireland as well as the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries. It is presented as a polemic against uncritical and utopian technological determinism. The 10 chapters of the book are clustered around 5 themes. In Chapter 1, Komito presents his thesis: The “information society” is neither monolithic (which he equates with following the path of the United States) nor an inevitable result of the digital revolution. The next two chapters introduce the basic concepts of information processing and computing by taking the reader on a journey through information processing in animals and humans, nonverbal communication, writing, printing, and various precomputer information technologies leading to the history of computing and an introduction to the concept of technological determinism. The third theme of the book appears in Chapters 4 and 5, in which Komito analyzes the concepts of “information economy” and “postindustrial society” and questions the existence of an “information society.” The next theme of the book appears in Chapters 6, 7, and 8. In these chapters Komito discusses regulation, politics, and policy. He links new information and communication technology (ICT) to e-government, freedom of information, censorship, data protection, political participation, information-age work practices, and the digital divide. The final theme of the book, in Chapters 9 and 10, acknowledges that an “information society” does exist and considers the implications for individuals, communities, and cultures. This book strives to address a very broad audience, from the technological neophyte to the sophisticated technological critic. On the one hand, the in-depth discussion of the history of information and ICT in Chapters 2 and 3 suggests that the audience is the university student or general reader. On the other hand, the absence of detailed explanation and documentation of the technological deterministic stance suggests that the reader is assumed to be one who is already familiar with this intellectual debate. On balance, I think the best audience for this book is the 21st-century university student who uncritically assumes a single, inevitable path of technological evolution. Thus, this book could be required reading in a social study of technology course. However, I wish Komito had painted the picture of the “deterministic enemy” in finer detail. The book contains many contestable statements that are not defended by either evidence or logical development. The challenge of an overview book is always how to manage the absence of detail on any one topic. But for a book such as this, ensuring sufficient evidence to support the arguments is particularly challenging. Komoto makes strong statements against technological determinism. I would have preferred that he present the technological determinist view and its apologists before mounting his own attack. For example, I would have liked to have seen the citations to those scholars who believe that information and communications technology (ICT) linked with the information society is a force external to society and beyond its control. Ireland is used as a setting to exemplify information society issues, but so are the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries. As one who has been following—since the 1980s—the sociocultural factors that both motivated and were changed by the creation of an information economy in Ireland (Trauth, 2000), I think this country could have been a fascinating setting for Komito to use in developing his arguments in Chapters 4 and 5. On the face of it, one could draw the conclusion that the transformation of Irish society and economy in the latter half of the 20th century was a direct and inevitable result of the introduction of ICT (in the forms of first electronics manufacturing and offshore data processing, and then software development work).

The paper discusses the distribution of attention and reputation over sets of works; the number of works in a given media; and, the degree of symmetry between creation and reception of contents.  It concludes that many of the present models and estimates are biased by the present economic conditions of media services and that some commonly accepted “laws” are mistaken regarding diversity in a many–to–many information society.

A revised and expanded version of PI and IE emerges here, one that brings to the foreground PI's status as a philosophical naturalism—one with both current application and important potential in the specific domains of privacy and information law. Further, the pluralism already articulated by Floridi in his PI is now more explicitly coupled with an ethical pluralism in IE that will be enhanced through IE's further incorporation of discourse ethics. In this form, PI and IE emerge as still more robust frameworks for a global ICE; in this form, however, they also profoundly challenge modern Western assumptions regarding reality, the self, and our ethical obligations.","",""
"2009","Regimes of Information: Land Use, Management, and Policy","Socio-ecological systems are inherently complex. One source of complexity is the uncertainties involved in the decisions and behaviors of human actors that determine how landholdings are managed. Land management decisions are often influenced by diverse factors and considerations. Particularly significant among these are (1) the sources of information land managers utilize with their perceived quality, reliability, and accessibility; (2) the social networks of the decision maker with their pertinent history, appeal, and authority; and (3) the interests, resources, and prior experiences of individual decision makers. This degree of diversity and uncertainty gives rise to behaviors that cannot be entirely explained in terms of rational choice or any variation thereof. How can we best understand and explain these behaviors, as spatial but also social and informational, in land-use decision making? This article presents the case of land management in a county in the Midwest United States to develop a conceptual model of decision making of environmental resources in socio-ecological systems. This model conceives environmental decision making as a multivalent process that operates on the basis of different “regimes of worth,” incorporating not only the economic value of outcomes but also other personal and social values within different worlds or polities. These worlds, in turn, incorporate particular “regimes of information” based on particular higher principles that they uphold. The article examines these regimes, provides examples of what constitutes information in each regimes, and explores the management and policy implications of this framework.","",""

"2009","Environmental Communication in the Information Society: The Blueprint from Europe","I start this article by noting the lack of a sustained theoretical engagement between the discourses concerning the information society and environmentalism, and contrasting that lack with the environmentalists' practical usage of information technology. Explaining why this discrepancy requires probing, I go on to introduce and interpret a European report that brings the aforementioned discourses together via its blueprint for ecological communication in the information society. Further, noting the contextual significance of development, I argue that the report uniquely places ecological communication between development and the information society, on the one hand, and environmentalism and the information society, on the other. I also underline the report's significance in disciplinary terms—contrasting its conceptualizations with the underlying orthodoxies of the academic discipline of ecological communication [EC]. On another level, I deem the report a culmination of post-1990 European efforts at developing an eco-informational and eco-communicational dimension to its environmental policy. Here, I introduce the key efforts, outlining their contributions and the broader factors contributing to their orientation and substance. I conclude the article by illustrating the report's distinction from those efforts, elucidating the report's novel conception of ecological communication, and speculating about the reasons behind the report's continued neglect within the intellectual realm (and outside the European environmental policy circles).","",""

"2010","THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS OF DEFINING THE PARTICIPATORY, CO-OPERATIVE, SUSTAINABLE INFORMATION SOCIETY","The task of this paper is to provide a comparative and theoretically grounded discussion of the notions of sustainability, inclusion, and participation in the information society discourse. A theoretical model of society as dialectical system is introduced, in which the economic base and the political–cultural superstructure are mutually shaping each other. Based on a distinction between reductionistic, holistic, dualistic, and dialectical worldviews, four different theoretical approaches on defining the sustainable information society are distinguished, which are based on how the relationship between base and superstructure is conceived. Reductionistic approaches see ecological, technological, or economic changes as the sole driving forces of a sustainable information society. Projectionistic approaches see superstructures (polity and/or culture) as the determining forces of a sustainable information society. They are the least frequently found approaches in the literature. Dualistic approaches define multiple goals and dimensions of a sustainable information society, but do not consider if these goals are compatible and if and how they are causally linked. Dualistic models are the ones that can be found most frequently in the literature. As an alternative to these three models, the dialectical notion of the participatory, co-operative, sustainable information society (PCSIS) is introduced. Co-operation is based on an inclusive logic that establishes social systems, in which all involved actors benefit. The logic of co-operation is the binding force of a progressive society that connects its various dimensions.","",""

ISBN 978-0-7456-4179-9 (paper)","In some ways, Robert Hassan’s The Information Society is decidedly anachronistic—picture an anthropomorphic edition of the book on a platform running after its missed train, which is filled with books investigating technology, cybernetics, and the cyborg—while in others it is strongly prescient and rather refreshing. Hassan’s critical analysis of the information society is admirably balanced as he follows the development of the information society from Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations in the 18th century to contemporary sources, among them Jean Baudrillard, Fredric Jameson, Ray Kurzweil, Paul Virilio, Noam Chomsky, and Naomi Klein. The central tenet of Hassan’s argument is that the information society has replaced the industrial society as a result of global neoliberal capitalist proliferation. “Information,” he says, “in the form of ideas, concepts, innovation and run-of-the-mill data on every imaginable subject—and replicated as digital bits and bytes through computerization—has replaced labour and the relatively static logic of fixed plant and machinery as the central organizing force of society” (23). The shift from the “static logic of fixed plant and machinery” to information production would not, apparently, be so bad except keeping up with information’s tendency to constantly accelerate has ill effects on humanity. Hassan points to what he calls “the ‘network effect’ that is expressed as an increasingly strong compulsion to be part of the information society” functioning as an ideological state apparatus and social normative influence to ensure that individuals are both made jealous of and goaded into envying others who possess the latest and flashiest new technology (2). The angst of this situation is nicely summed up a few pages later, where Hassan clarifies, through the illustrative example of paper mail (now pejoratively called “snail mail”) versus e(lectronic) mail, that the “network effect thus presents us with a choice: which is either to get connected and speed up your mode of communication—or be left behind” (9). The onset of “always on” technology has bereft humanity of its self-reflexivity and ability to think deeply, or essentially its ability to be, well, human. In his historical analysis, Hassan remarks upon the trend beginning with late-18th-century industrialization in Britain moving toward the Fordist method of production in the United States in the early 20th century. Fordism, which quickly became a global standard, viewed complete control of the production process as a given. Ownership of the materials of production, from the factory where goods were assembled and produced down to the mines and fields from which the raw materials were gathered, was a positive, even necessary, means for both quality and cost control. Technology, by which Hassan usually means computers or other networkable devices, was the inspiration for a shift in trend to operating a “weightless” method of industry, meaning that companies became less concerned about who was physically producing their products than about to whom and in what numbers they could sell them. This trend shift has the appearance of inevitability, but only through the effects of historicizing. Here Hassan is quick to remark that much good came during early industrialization, from the standardization of work-day hours to the legal age of employment. However, he expresses a feeling of skepticism that any such corrections are forthcoming to the information society; the ring of your new cell phone calls you, like Althusser’s (1968; 2004) police officer, to remind you that you always already were implicated. If Hassan’s argument seems anticapitalist, it is only in relation to capitalism’s tacit (if not overt) support of the information society as a method of corrupting humanity. It is difficult to say, given the equanimity of Hassan’s prose,","",""

The authors discovered a disparity between the realization of the information society in everyday life and the state of the research in the area which is at a fairly early stage of evolving into a mature research discipline. Preliminary analysis of the data uncovers the three disciplinary foundations as Library and Information Science, Communication, and Information systems. The Bradford distribution reveals that the core of information society journals is not yet fully established. Journal citation and self-citation patterns lend further support for this and help identify which journals are firmly part of the core and which are less so. Finally, research collaboration patterns demonstrate that this area of research is moving towards disciplinary maturity. The paper concludes with some practical and academic recommendations.","",""
"2011","Analyzing Peer-to-Peer Technology Using Information Ethics","Much of the ethical debate on peer-to-peer (P2P) focuses on the use of this technology for unauthorized and illegal sharing of copyrighted materials. This fixation has led some to believe that P2P is an intrinsically unethical technology. However, P2P has a much wider significance than the unauthorized circulation of copyrighted material. Scholars therefore need to evaluate the global ethical effects of P2P architecture on society, as opposed to focusing on the specific implementations of this architecture. Several criteria have been proposed for the assessment of these implications, ranging from the effects of P2P on the technological progress of a society to its influence on the development of virtuous interactions. This article contributes to this debate by presenting a new approach, which distinguishes between local effects (content related) and systemic effects (communication modality related) of the use of P2P and focuses on the latter. Employing Floridi's information ethics, it considers whether or not P2P is an ethical technology, in a global sense.","",""
"2011","FYI: TMI: Toward a holistic social theory of information overload","Research into information overload has been extensive and cross-disciplinary, producing a multitude of suggested causes and posed solutions. I argue that many of the conclusions arrived at by existing research, while laudable in their inventiveness and/or practicality, miss the mark by viewing information overload as a problem that can be understood (or even solved) by purely rational means. Such a perspective lacks a critical understanding in human information usage: much in the same way that economic models dependent on rationality for their explanations or projections fail (often spectacularly, as recent history attests), models that rely too heavily upon the same rational behavior, and not heavily enough upon the interplay of actual social dynamics—power, reputation, norms, and others—in their attempts to explain, project, or address information overload prove bankrupt as well. Furthermore, even research that displays greater awareness of the social context in which overload exists often reveals a similar rationality in its conceptualization. That is, often the same “social” approaches that offer potential advantages (in mitigating information overload) over their “non-social” counterparts paradoxically raise new problems, requiring a reappraisal of overload that takes social issues into account holistically.","",""
"2013","PUNDIT FOR POST-INDUSTRIAL TIMES? WALTER LIPPMANN AS AN INFORMATION SOCIETY THEORIST","Walter Lippmann (1889–1974) was perhaps the most prominent pundit of the late-industrial era. His place in the annals of journalism is secure, but his legacy should not stop there. The article argues for a fresh interpretation of Lippmann as an early theorist of the information society. This thesis rests on three propositions. First, in Public Opinion and other less famous books, Lippmann focused productively on the empirical and normative aspects of information's role in a democratic polity. Second, Lippmann's comments upon the nature of social morality, especially his defence of the idea of a universal natural law, are shown to be serviceable for coming to terms with some of the profound challenges and dilemmas of the information age. Third, and decisively, a little-known manuscript, one of Lippmann's final essays, faced directly the issue of technocracy, arguably the paramount threat of the cyber century. The Lippmann corpus, both published and archival, is therefore highly relevant to post-industrial times.","",""

In this article, we discuss a range of strategic information-management options available to individuals and institutions in the networked society, and contrast these ‘blueprints’ to Foucault’s well-known panopticon model. We organize these observations and analyses within a new conceptual framework based on the geometry of ‘information flux’, or the premise that the net flow of information between an individual and a network is as relevant to power dynamics as the nature or volume of that information. Based on this geometrical model, we aim to develop a lexicon for the design, description and critique of socio-technical systems. ","",""

"2014","Does the Internet shape a disciplinary society? The information-knowledge paradox","In the post–modern era, knowledge is being understood as information. In reality, knowledge is commoditized and objectified as decontextualized representations. More information may mean that the society is drawn into a critical phase where loss of knowledge occurs with the unlimited flow of information. Such ubiquitous information could lead to less understanding, less trust and less truth, which would erode rationality in the governance of the society. Using a framework based on Michel Foucault’s archeological methodology, i.e., unearthing how information and communication technologies (ICT) came to be viewed as a source of truth/knowledge, this paper explores the question: Do ICT contribute information that can be construed as knowledge? Does this knowledge contribute to truth or to power? Do ICTs push an information society towards Foucault’s disciplinary society, where the so–called knowledge speaks ‘truth to power’?","",""
"2014","Towards a relational theory of IS/IT adoption and usage: Metaphor and lessons from interpersonal relationship literature","Extant literature has indicated the need to view information systems (IS) and information technologies (IT) as interaction–centric, as well as to understand individuals’ relationships with IS/IT, to fully understand and more accurately predict various IS phenomena. This paper aims to create further discussion around this topic by applying metaphor to IS adoption, rejection, and usage via an examination of the interpersonal relationship literature. Through a hermeneutic review, I interpret interpersonal relationships in terms of beginning and ending point for action (identity), mechanism (control), and strength multiplier (closeness). Parallels are then drawn to the IS literature, illustrating that individuals may interact with IS/IT as if they were human. This metaphorical approach may allow practitioners to transcend much of the anxiety associated with adoption across situations and contexts rather than attempting to further control them.","",""

"2015","Needing NoDI (normal democratic information)? The problem of information poverty in post-industrial society","The paper addresses one of the main paradoxes of post-industrial society: information poverty. While digital divides of various types have been extensively theorized and researched, the actual condition of the information poor – those at the wrong end of socioeconomic information-divides – has not received sufficient attention. Yet if advanced nations have ‘informatized’ and thus become, at least in some measure, information societies, the plight of those lacking the definitive resource ought surely to be high on academic and political agendas. The article reviews the scattered multidisciplinary literature on the condition, confirming the iron link between economic poverty and information poverty, while also registering cultural and behavioural dimensions. Building on such work, a focused, up-to-date and, it is believed, original conception is able to be introduced, namely, information poverty as a deficiency in certain taken-for-granted categories of political and cognate information, or normal democratic information (NoDI). The new construct is then trialled in the field, among a sample of severely disadvantaged men in the city of Edinburgh, Scotland. The informants are indeed found to be, by and large, wanting in these key categories of information, an epistemic pathology that reflects and reinforces their material malaise. The article concludes that the ‘option for the poor’ – the political duty of care for the worst off – in the twenty-first century demands new modes of State action to combat an acute and increasingly salient social problem.","",""
"2015","Getting Information Systems to Interact: The Social Fact Character of “Object” Clarity as a Factor in Designing Information Systems","This article considers challenges to getting information systems to recognize “objects” in other information systems. We explore a tension between commitment to standardization and the constitutive and situated social fact requirements of human comprehension and work through an ethnographic study of an information system design team meeting.2 Facilitating interoperability between systems is an important challenge currently facing design teams. Our study elucidates—in the design team's own words—problems that design teams confront with “object” and “concept” certainty, practical “use” and “language”: with defining what they call a “What” when data objects must cross boundaries. The refrain “What is the ‘What’?” punctuates the meeting. Although human use and comprehension frame their concerns, they treat meaning, practical use, and language as “technical” and “philosophical” issues. The social issues they acknowledge are confined to “governance.” Given their reliance on performed social objects, including “role” and “identity”, at key points in their discussion, however, and the importance of “language” and “concepts” to their concerns, we point out social dimensions of their task, suggesting that a broader understanding of the importance of constitutive practices and their situated character in achieving information objects—and social objects more generally—could change the team's perception of their options.","",""

"2016","<i>The Ethics of Information</i>, by Luciano Floridi","Due to the unprecedented revolutions and evolutions affected by technological, digital, and informational advancements, every aspect of our lives—whether economic, ecological, political, educational, cultural, or social—alongside people, organizations, and even governmental activity, has been tirelessly faced with an unyielding overtaking. As Kalantzis-Cope emphasizes, “We need to think more critically about the properties of new technologies, the cultural content that flows through them, and the social forms new technologies both reproduce and disrupt” (2011, 8). Floridi answers this call, noting that “our technological tree has been growing its far-reaching branches much more widely, rapidly, and chaotically than its conceptual, ethical, and cultural roots” (xiii). Therefore, we should be wary of this imbalance, alleviate it, and diminish this undeniable theoretical gap in the literature by creating a philosophical foundation or platform entitled information ethics (IE), which concerns itself with a comprehensive scholarly investigation into the (un)ethical considerations of information age consequences. In this vein, dealing mainly with meta-theoretical, introductory, and constructive goals, met in the form of 16 chapters, The Ethics of Information aims to provide a better philosophical understanding of the conceptual foundations of IE. To meet its meta-theoretical goal, chapters 1 to 5 provide readers with some theoretical foundations and conceptual connotations. Serving as a “problem statement” section, chapter 1 is an attempt to give a picture of ethics after the information revolution as a determinant driver that is turning information into our ecosystem. Posing the question “What is information ethics?,” chapter 2 discusses four stages of IE, including “IE as an ethics of informational resources,” “IE as an ethics of informational products,” “IE as an ethics of the informational environment,” and “IE as a macroethics.” To clarify the idea “IE as a macroethics,” Floridi proposes, in chapter 3, “the method of abstraction” by which a change in our view of the world can be possible. In chapter 4, Floridi uses the term “e-nvironmental ethics” (synthetic ethics or ethics of infosphere) to delineate an individual interpretation of IE. Confirming the foundationalist debate regarding what IE and CE (computer ethics) are, chapter 5 defines IE as the philosophical foundational counterpart of CE. In relation to the introductory goal of the book, chapters 6 to 11 collectively examine the main pillars or players of the infosphere in terms of value and evil. Accordingly, the intrinsic value of the infosphere itself, the morality of artificial agents as interactive autonomous systems, and the constructionist values of homo poieticus (demiurge) are considered in chapters 6 to 8, respectively. On the other hand, some issues like artificial evil (a mistake perpetrated by artificial agents) and the tragedy of Good Will are explored. The last chapter of this second section of the work, chapter 11, tries to respond to the question “Who are we online, or in the infosphere?” by taking an informational approach to the nature of personal identity (selves). Finally, chapters 12 to 16 are in line with meeting the constructive goal of the volume. Due to a tangible shift from human ecology to multifaceted global informational ecology—fired, fueled, and affected by the transformative engine of information and communication technologies (ICTs)—informational privacy, distributed morality, information business ethics, and global information ethics are among the major topics debated. In the last chapter, entitled “In defence of information ethics,” Floridi’s goal seems to be to remove some ambiguities, defuse possible sources of confusion, and correct mistaken objections that might prevent the proper evaluation of IE in its various interpretations, so that disagreement can become more constructive. In this conclusion, the author highlights that “there is a unique ethical duty that follows from humanity’s unique semanticizing role. The epistemic responsibility involved in the design of a meaningful reality is not just an epistemological task, placed on our shoulders as individual epistemic agents. It is also, and probably more importantly, a social and ethical obligation that we have towards each other” (332). Structurally, regardless of the coherence, interconnectedness, and robustness tangible in the entire book, each chapter can be treated as a stand-alone ethics-related article. Furthermore, at the end, Floridi provides an abundant bibliography, which can help readers easily sort through and find many related works.

That is to say, as our interactions and activities become less dependent on the movement of atoms and more focused on the manipulation of bits, they seem less limited by the constraints of physical reality. But when we look closely at the material underpinnings of the information economy—from the minerals that make up digital devices to the massive amounts of energy and water required to power data centers—it becomes clear that information technologies are firmly grounded in the physical environment. In fact, information technologies continuously shape not only the physical environment but also representations of the relationship between natural and built worlds.","",""

Our analysis focuses on implications of information determinism in three cases: California disaster response plans in the 1980s, an Indian development project in the 1990s, and an education project directed at the Global South in the 2000s. Our analyses shows that planning based on information deterministic assumptions tends to overlook the sociomaterial circumstances of information production and circulation, including how social structures and materiality shape information in practice. Further, they imbue what we call “information” with the agency to bring about change. While we do not deny that “information” can be useful, we argue that policy needs to move away from information deterministic thinking and its singular focus on information access to address the needs of marginalized and vulnerable populations.","",""

The trending use of this language arises from non-academic applications — for example in big data (the Hadoop ecosystem) or software development (the node.js ecosystem) — and there remains little critical examination of the use of this metaphor. Indeed, the definition of ecosystem as the set of relations between living organisms and their surrounding non-living environment is apparently not directly a part of the metaphor. This paper first describes the emergence of ecological thinking and how it was influenced by early information science and then explores how different “ecologies” are used within the academy, including in the emergent field of information ecology. A short critique of the metaphor is then posed and the paper concludes that the information ecosystem metaphor is useful, yet at the same time there are dangerous elements that render aspects of human societies and natural ecosystems invisible.","",""

Today, it is fair to say that IS have come to rule the world. They do this literally, by the rules they embody, which dictate how much of everyday life, as it relates to individuals and organizations and the transactions they engage in, takes place around the globe. In essence, IS have become important social and economic infrastructure. Seeking an understanding of how this has come about, I review historical developments in IS, focusing in particular on accounting systems, enterprise systems, retail automation, and electronic commerce. I argue that it is transactions and their facilitation that lie at the heart of IS and its development as a field of practice. I reflect on why this has gone mostly overlooked as such. I consider where we have now arrived with transaction facilitation as infrastructure and its importance in the light of current issues. I suggest how future studies might contribute to our learning more about where we should want to be with our transaction facilitation infrastructure.","",""
