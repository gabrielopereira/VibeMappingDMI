"2000","The Suitability of Employing Digital Technology for Accessing Photographic Collections","The problems of The storage of photographic material is undertaken by thousands of archiving establishments throughout the world and millions of images are held photographic either in official archives or stored by individuals in various storage collections conditions. The need for archiving standards is no more apparent than when a large collection of images is discovered or obtained such a collection may be a valuable asset and contain precious works in a state of decay. Many neglected collections contain photographic prints that are not mounted or contained in folders but stored loose in files","",""

"2000","Digital image managers: A museum/university collaboration","The University of North Texas and the African American Museum in Dallas are partners in a program designed to produce expert managers of digital images and information. The School of Library and Information Sciences in cooperation with the School of Visual Arts received a 1998 National Leadership Grant from the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services to build a collaborative program that includes a digital imaging laboratory and fellowships for students in a Certificate of Advanced Study Program.  The work of the digital image manager includes the production of visual images, the creation and management of databases, and the ability to use advanced network and information technologies to improve access to digital images and information. The program of study prepares individuals to work as digital image managers in museums, libraries, archives, and other information centers.  The Project provides a unique educational experience made possible by the cooperation between a museum and a university. Students digitize objects from the Museum collection and build an image database that will be accessible on the Web. The experience includes the use of video-conference technologies to enhance collaboration between the Museum and the University. Students communicate with the Museum staff, work on images and database information simultaneously, and share experiences immediately. By linking the digital image laboratory and the African American Museum, students have every opportunity to learn from museum professionals as well as from the University community.","",""

"2000","Preserving digital assets: Cornell's digital image collection project","This paper describes a two-year project at Cornell University Library to develop an archiving solution to safeguard Cornell's digital image collections, consisting of two and a half million images created over a decade. The Project has inventoried Cornell's digital image collections, investigated current and emerging file formats for long-term utility, explored functional requirements for storage, and drafted recommendations for requisite preservation metadata. These efforts demonstrated the need to develop institutional policies and resources to facilitate long-term maintenance. The final goal of this Project, therefore, is the development of a mainstreaming effort to move digital preservation from a project to program mode. A Digital Preservation Policy Working Group has been assembled that will present its recommendations to the Library Management Team in September 2000. Their report will cover requirements for conversion and metadata, a technical strategy for storage, maintenance, and long-term care, and an assessment of the resources needed to maintain these digital assets.","",""
"2000","Oh what a tangled Web we weave: Opportunities and challenges for standards development in the digital library arena","Standards development is particularly difficult within the digital library arena, primarily because the most active players have not yet formed a true community in the sense of having evolved a common vocabulary, commonality of interest, or structures for collaboration and communication. Competition, the need to allow for innovation and experimentation, and the need for speed in a rapidly changing technological environment all help to foster a culture that does not necessarily value standards. Appropriate responses can help encourage the development of standards even in this environment. Among these is the recognition that collections of practices, best practices, local and global guidelines, normative standards and implementers' agreements can all be useful under different circumstances, and to aim for the level of standarization most appropriate to the situation.","",""

"2001","They threw me a computer but what I really needed was a life preserver","Libraries and museums have a central role to play in ensuring that all Americans are able to access and use effectively emerging communications tools, such as the Internet. These institutions are key pillars of the public sphere of communications, the realm of civil society independent of government and commercial forces that provides citizens the tools to become full participants in republican self-government. This paper identifies four attributes of the digital divide -- literacy, access, content and training -- and discusses the role of libraries and museums in cultivating each of these capacities. The central thrust of the paper is that there are comprehensive solutions to bridge the divide (in the realization of these four elements) where the technological component is necessary but not sufficient to move the truly disadvantaged into the mainstream of American life.","",""

"2001","A tool for multipurpose use of online flora and fauna: The Biological Information Browsing Environment, BIBE",") is a facility to help novices and experts find information about plants and animals in digital collections. The Project is funded by the National Science Foundation Biological Databases and Informatics Program and is a collaboration between the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at the University of Illinois, Illinois Natural History Survey, Missouri Botanical Garden, Flora of North America Project at the Harvard Herbarium, and Illinois Department of Natural Resources.  The objectives of the Project are to facilitate access to online flora and fauna by both novices and experts through enhanced indexing, searching, and visualization techniques. Specific search facility and content will be added to help users with different levels of domain knowledge identify species based on the augmentation of professionally developed taxonomic treatments or species descriptions. This is a novel use of taxonomic descriptions. In the course of development the system will undergo a series of qualitative and quantitative evaluations and re-designs by several communities of users, including professional entomologists and botanists as well as citizen scientists performing biodiversity surveys.","",""
"2001","Visualising historical knowledge using virtual reality technology","This paper discusses virtual reality reconstructions of historical sites. Seeing the past as a cultural construction makes the process of representation problematic. Two case studies illustrate aspects of the visualisation of virtual environments: how authenticity in computer reconstructions is reduced to their visuality, and how historically-based VR environments as copies honour their original. The paper asks for more implementation of life forms into architectural settings, and also examines the impact of user expectations on the VR experience.","",""
"2001","Museums and virtual reality: using the CAVE to simulate the past","This project looks at virtual reality (VR) as a mode of displaying history in museums. It focuses on CAVE technology, a form of immersive VR, and examines how current CAVE presentations based on digital reconstructions of buildings and landscapes mediate the historic past. The project is partly based on observations from the use of the CAVE at the Foundation of the Hellenic World (FHW) in Athens, Greece. A special emphasis is placed on the digital reconstruction of ancient cities now in ruins. Miletus, an Athenian and later a Roman colony on the coast of Asia Minor, is the first created so far and constitutes the focus of my investigation. The empirical material I have collected consists of data (video/audio tapes) recording group visits to the CAVE (both school and adult groups) in April 2000. The virtual tourists are ‘shown round’ a digital version of Roman Miletus of the 1st century AD by a museum educator. My analysis concentrates on: • the structure of the CAVE experience (the way information is verbally and visually communicated); • the patterns of producing and communicating knowledge (historical/archaeological discourses practiced within the general pedagogic framework of FHW).","",""
"2002","Whose History?","                           The continual (re)development associated with urban spaces results in the demand that heritage spaces be preserved. This raises a number of questions to be considered such as:             which spaces will be preserved,              what stories will be associated with these, and              how will the embodied experience of these spaces be mediated?             Since Foucault, it has been accepted that knowledge, power and truth are inextricably interwoven. There are no golden sands of freedom, there is no transcendent truth free from composing discourses.            The construction of truth and history as discursive practice has a strong spatial component in museums. Objects are taken out of their original contexts, placed into knowledge regimes that delimit how these shall be known and then fixed in a stasis that regulates any change or flow in the meanings that might be constructed around these.                       Figure 1 - Skeleton of a middle age woman on display in the Dublinia MuseumThe body in the museum becomes either an object to be displayed or a nuisance to be excluded from contact with 'artefacts'. The picture above is of the skeleton of a middle age woman who died in Dublin hundreds of years ago and is now on display in the Dublinia Museum. Once the decision is made that this skeleton is no longer a body but an artefact it is placed behind glass so that the living bodies which come to view it may not 'interfere' with its discursive or physical existence. Once 'preserved' in this way, 'she' becomes an 'it', an object translated and removed from the everyday. In this case, the skeleton is placed within a scientific-medical discourse where the fact that it once belonged to an old woman who had worn away teeth tells us that she lived in a time when the people of Dublin had a poor diet.            Similar undertakings are accepted practice in the Hyde Park Barracks Museum. All 'real' artefacts are kept behind glass, preserved in carefully controlled conditions that prevent human physical contact. Only replicas or reconstructions are available for everyday handling by the general public. In the example below, the item discussed was kept behind glass, a thing to be observed, revered, a relic to lend authority to the power-knowledge-truth regime of the Hyde Park Barracks Museum.                      Figure 2 - box containing a lock of Captain James Cook's hair and a rendition of his death scene in Hawaii on display at the Hyde Park Barracks MuseumSo 'precious' was this object that it was kept doubly removed, a small wooden casket within a timber and glass case behind the display panel of the museum.                                  Figure 3 - closer view of box containing a lock of Captain James Cook's hair and a rendition of his death scene in Hawaii on display at the Hyde Park Barracks MuseumThis particular item contains a lock of Captain James Cook's hair and a rendition of his death scene in Hawaii. The case is made from the wood of the Resolution (his ship at the time of his death) and the entire item was a memento given to his widow upon the Resolution's return to Britain. This 'relic' is iconic of the approach adopted by the presentation of the Barracks as a museum.            But what happens when the history being 'preserved' is the fabric of a built space?            The spatial process of 'encasing', 'preserving' and physically removing 'artefacts' from everyday contact is an ongoing aspect of the presentation of the Barracks. In 1996, not long after I began my employ with the Barracks as part of an extended engagement with the embodied experience of cityspace, the curator decided that each guide should have their skills at presenting the Barracks in an appropriate light assessed. The result was that each guide was required to prepare and present a 'wall talk'.            The 'wall talk' was literally that. Each guide was assigned a physical section of the museum to research and then discuss for ten minutes to an audience composed of other guides, the curator, the manager and education staff. The aims were to get each guide to re-assess their lecture presentation technique and to spread awareness amongst the guides that each physical section of the museum held its own unique part in the story of the Barracks. My assignment was a piece of wall on the second floor directly above the reception area.            Deep into the persona I created so that I could 'pass' in this environment, I began by examining the wall. It was constructed of the convict made brick laid down in 1818 held together by Aboriginal midden material that dated back thousands of years, overlaid with whitewash applied in 1848 when the men moved out and the women moved in, the whitewash was overlaid with plaster held in place by cows hair in 1887 when the building was converted to a courts complex which was topped with remnants of wall paper that dated back to 1952 when the room was renovated as a Judge's chambers. On a section of the wall that had once been covered by this wallpaper was a pencil drawn outline of a pair of scissors, the name Max Fry and the date 1952 was written next to these. Both the floor and ceiling above and below the wall had sections that had been replaced when air conditioning was installed in the first incarnation of the building as a museum under the management of the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences. A red builders' chalk mark showing where this was to installed remained even though the ducting had been removed in a later enactment of this museum space under the auspices of the Historic Houses Trust. In the rebated corner closest to this wall, out of sight to any but the closest inspection, there was a pencil drawing of a boxer shaping up to an unseen opponent. The skirting board was two inches higher than in the next room and of an Edwardian rather than a Victorian style. 'Ghosts' from zinc tiles were etched upon the ceiling and scratch marks from the iron beds used by the immigrant women remained upon the floors.            I considered the wall carefully and even more carefully thought about the discourses of this institution, the personality of the curator and the predilections of the manager and other guides. If I was to continue 'passing', which story should I tell? How should it be told? What emphasis should be made and, most importantly of all, what must be elided?            I considered raising the awareness that anthrax spores had been found in similar cow-hair reinforced plaster in the London Tube system but this somehow seemed irreverent. Starting with an statement about the mortar, Aboriginal land claims and how the entire Historic Houses Trust functioned to legitimate European seizure of Aboriginal land and that this was reflected by the way in which Aboriginal artefacts were ignored seemed equally inadvisable. Perhaps a discussion of the judge who inspired the boxer was in order. Rumour had it that he used to pay 'taxi-drivers' to join him in his rooms and engage in a little 'wrestling' and 'boxing'. This was reputedly such a physical activity that grunts, groans and cries of pain (?) were heard throughout the building. I could talk about the rats that had infested the ceilings above and below the room from the time that false ceilings were put in place during the renovation of the building into a courts complex and perhaps even display some of the 'artefacts' that had been stolen by the rats and hidden under the floor or in the ceiling space. A straight 'history' of the wall that simply discussed its physical composition would have 'passed', but that was perhaps more superficial than I felt the material warranted. Instead, set to a background audio tape of Tracey Chapman singing """"Talking Bout a Revolution"""", a selection from Pink Floyd's The Wall and The Beatles Revolution 9, I told a story about the scissors.            The scissors tale began by introducing Max Fry as a humble paperhanger working in the chambers of a powerful Judge in the 1950's. Oppressed, voiceless, the only impact he could make within the Barracks was to trace his scissors, sign his name, date it and then paper over this minor act of rebellion. For nearly thirty years his legacy remained hidden under the paper as judge after judge used the room to write the judgements that ordered the lives of those unfortunate enough to pass before them. In 1979 this legacy was unveiled but ignored, covered over by an air-conditioning system decreed necessary to preserve the artefacts displayed in the building.            This oversight was rectified (so my story went) by the current generation of carers for the heritage of the building when the air conditioning was removed and the slice of social history and iniquitous power relations that Max Fry's rebellion illustrated was put on display for all to see.            The talk was received well by all except for the chief guide who felt the music was distracting. He wanted me to do another wall some other time and 'get it right this time'. The curator was delighted and over-ruled the chief guide and the wall talks were over as far as I was concerned.            A few months later, I was surprised to discover that on one of my 'time in lieu' breaks from the Barracks, that the wall had been encased in glass. The original scissors whose outline was traced upon the now preserved wall had been 'rescued' from Max's tool shed and hung behind the glass along with a picture of himself and some other of his tools. A story panel iterated a simplified version of the story I had told that elided any reference to class inequality or the powerlessness of his position.            History's truth and permanence was now safely assured and no meddling fingers would ever again touch the pencilled scissored outline or smudge the bleary red chalk-line. The boxer, however, remains un-encased, a few hands-breadths from Max's sanitised and now unapproachable history, awaiting the right 'story' to bring it to prominence and preservation.

"2002","Creating a Framework of Guidance for Building Good Digital Collections","As technologies to digitize primary source content mature and become better understood, more widely accessible, and more efficient, the volume of available digital content increases and issues of integration and aggregation become more important. Today's digitization project managers must give high priority to factors such as reusability, persistence, interoperability, verification, and documentation when planning their projects. Digitization project funding agencies, like the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) and the National Science Foundation (NSF), must give substantial weight to these same factors when assessing programs and evaluating project proposals. A Digital Library Forum convened by the IMLS and working in collaboration with participants from the NSF's National Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology Education Digital Library program has released a Framework of Guidance for Building Good Digital Collections to serve as a resource for practitioners and funding agencies. This Framework pays particular attention to digitization collection practices that facilitate integration and aggregation of digital information resources developed by museums, libraries, and similar institutions. To protect against obsolescence and to better accommodate the wide range of digitization projects funded by the IMLS, NSF, and other granting organizations, the Framework is not wedded to any particular set of standards or best practices. Rather it articulates principles fundamental to planning, implementation, and evaluation of digitization projects and links to specific resources and exemplary models that support and illustrate good application of these principles. This paper describes the context and development of the Framework, briefly presents the major principles articulated in the Framework, and concludes with remarks regarding the immediate impacts of the work accomplished by the IMLS Digital Library Forum and a call for the continued development and maintenance of the Framework.","",""

This has led us to a definition of the task–oriented user. To address this new model The J. Paul Getty Museum is introducing GettyGuide. The system, with personalization online and personal devices at the Museum, puts everything a visitor may want to know in the palm of his or her hand while at the museum, and also allows users to continue their research elsewhere via http://www.getty.edu/. As we rethink our strategy of sharing information based on user access, we may finally be approaching a point of useful convergence of technology and the institutional missions of teaching, learning, and research.","",""

"2005","From libraries to ‘libratories’"," While the eighties of the last century were a time of local automation for libraries and the nineties the decade in which libraries embraced the Internet and the Web, now is the age in which the big search engines and institutional repositories are gaining a firm footing. This heralds a new era in both the evolution of scholarly communication and its agencies themselves, i.e. the libraries.  Until now libraries and publishers have developed a digital variant of existing processes and products, i.e. catalogues posted on the Web, scanned copies of articles, e–mail notification about acquisitions or expired lending periods, or traditional journals in a digital jacket. However, the new OAI repositories and services based upon them have given rise to entirely new processes and products, libraries transforming themselves into partners in setting up virtual learning environments, building an institution’s digital showcase, maintaining academics’ personal Web sites, designing refereed portals and — further into the future — taking part in organising virtual research environments or collaboratories. Libraries are set to metamorphose into ‘libratories’, an imaginary word to express their combined functions of library, repository and collaboratory. In such environments scholarly communication will be liberated from its current copyright bridle while its coverage will be both broader — including primary data, audiovisuals and dynamic models — and deeper, with cross–disciplinary analyses of methodologies and applications of instruments. Universities will make it compulsory to store in their institutional repositories the results of research conducted within their walls for purposes of academic reporting, review committees, and other modes of clarification and explanation.

"2006","Machine-assisted Metadata Generation and New Resource Discovery: Software and Services","Research and other libraries are priceless given that they hold, organize and provide sensible, generally open, access to many of the treasures of knowledge of our species. Especially when mass media, popular culture and/or governmental information flows fail in making available the objective and relevant information needed to enable us to make informed decisions about our lives, businesses or planet, libraries usually will provide the information needed. As both a first and last refuge for knowledge, libraries could come to play an increasingly expansive and critical role in society, given this need, if we can develop and better keep pace with the expanding role of technology in scholarly and educational communication and information access. Librarians and the technological directions we choose to develop and/or follow are more important, on a societal scale, than most us think. Libraries and related services are not inexpensive to develop and maintain, though, and, with the information boom that both preceded (in print resources) and continues to follow the advent of the Web (in both print and digital resources), are not keeping up with the large numbers of significant information resources being produced.

"2008","From Loss of Objects to Recovery of Meanings: Online Museums and Indigenous Cultural Heritage","IntroductionThe debate about the responsibility of museums to respect Indigenous peoples’ rights (Kelly and Gordon; Butts) has caught our attention on the basis of our previous research experience with regard to the protection of the tangible and intangible heritage of the San (former hunter gatherers) in Southern Africa (Martin and Vermeylen; Vermeylen, Contextualising; Vermeylen, Life Force; Vermeylen et al.; Vermeylen, Land Rights).  This paper contributes to the critical debate about curatorial practices and the recovery of Indigenous peoples’ cultural practices and explores how museums can be transformed into cultural centres that “decolonise” their objects while simultaneously providing social agency to marginalised groups such as the San.  Indigenous MuseumTraditional methods of displaying Indigenous heritage are now regarded with deep suspicion and resentment by Indigenous peoples (Simpson). A number of related issues such as the appropriation, ownership and repatriation of culture together with the treatment of sensitive and sacred materials and the stereotyping of Indigenous peoples’ identity (Carter; Simpson) have been identified as the main problems in the debate about museum curatorship and Indigenous heritage. The poignant question remains whether the concept of a classical museum—in the sense of how it continues to classify, value and display non-Western artworks—will ever be able to provide agency to Indigenous peoples as long as “their lives are reduced to an abstract set of largely arbitrary material items displayed without much sense of meaning” (Stanley 3). Indeed, as Salvador has argued, no matter how much Indigenous peoples have been involved in the planning and implementation of an exhibition, some issues remain problematic. First, there is the problem of representation: who speaks for the group; who should make decisions and under what circumstances; when is it acceptable for “outsiders” to be involved? Furthermore, Salvador raises another area of contestation and that is the issue of intention. As we agree with Salvador, no matter how good the intention to include Indigenous peoples in the curatorial practices, the fact that Indigenous peoples may have a (political) perspective about the exhibition that differs from the ideological foundation of the museum enterprise, is, indeed, a challenge that must not be overlooked in the discussion of the inclusive museum. This relates to, arguably, one of the most important challenges in respect to the concept of an Indigenous museum: how to present the past and present without creating an essentialising “Other”? As Stanley summarises, the modernising agenda of the museum, including those museums that claim to be Indigenous museums, continues to be heavily embedded in the belief that traditional cultural beliefs, practices and material manifestations must be saved. In other words, exhibitions focusing on Indigenous peoples fail to show them as dynamic, living cultures (Simpson). This raises the issue that museums recreate the past (Sepúlveda dos Santos) while Indigenous peoples’ interests can be best described “in terms of contemporaneity” (Bolton qtd. in Stanley 7). According to Bolton, Indigenous peoples’ interest in museums can be best understood in terms of using these (historical) collections and institutions to address contemporary issues. Or, as Sepúlveda dos Santos argues, in order for museums to be a true place of memory—or indeed a true place of recovery—it is important that the museum makes the link between the past and contemporary issues or to use its objects in such a way that these objects emphasize “the persistence of lived experiences transmitted through generations” (29). Under pressure from Indigenous rights movements, the major aim of some museums is now reconciliation with Indigenous peoples which, ultimately, should result in the return of the cultural objects to the originators of these objects (Kelly and Gordon). Using the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 (NAGPRA) as an illustration, we argue that the whole debate of returning or recovering Indigenous peoples’ cultural objects to the original source is still embedded in a discourse that emphasises the mummified aspect of these materials. As Harding argues, NAGPRA is provoking an image of “native Americans as mere passive recipients of their cultural identity, beholden to their ancestors and the museum community for the re-creation of their cultures” (137) when it defines cultural patrimony as objects having ongoing historical, traditional or cultural importance, central to the Native American group or culture itself. According to Harding (2005) NAGPRA’s dominating narrative focuses on the loss, alienation and cultural genocide of the objects as long as these are not returned to their originators. The recovery or the return of the objects to their “original” culture has been applauded as one of the most liberating and emancipatory events in recent years for Indigenous peoples. However, as we have argued elsewhere, the process of recovery needs to do more than just smother the object in its past; recovery can only happen when heritage or tradition is connected to the experience of everyday life. One way of achieving this is to move away from the objectification of Indigenous peoples’ cultures.      ObjectificationIn our exploratory enquiry about new museum practices our attention was drawn to a recent debate about ownership and personhood within the context of museology (Busse; Baker; Herle; Bell; Geismar). Busse, in particular, makes the point that in order to reformulate curatorial practices it is important to redefine the concept and meaning of objects. While the above authors do not question the importance of the objects, they all argue that the real importance does not lie in the objects themselves but in the way these objects embody the physical manifestation of social relations. The whole idea that objects matter because they have agency and efficacy, and as such become a kind of person, draws upon recent anthropological theorising by Gell and Strathern. Furthermore, we have not only been inspired by Gell’s and Strathern’s approaches that suggests that objects are social persons, we have also been influenced by Appadurai’s and Kopytoff’s defining of objects as biographical agents and therefore valued because of the associations they have acquired throughout time. We argue that by framing objects in a social network throughout its lifecycle we can avoid the recurrent pitfalls of essentialising objects in terms of their “primitive” or “traditional” (aesthetic) qualities and mystifying the identity of Indigenous peoples as “noble savages.” Focusing more on the social network that surrounds a particular object opens up new avenues of enquiry as to how, and to what extent, museums can become more inclusive vis-à-vis Indigenous peoples. It allows moving beyond the current discourse that approaches the history of the (ethnographic) museum from only one dominant perspective. By tracing an artwork throughout its lifecycle a new metaphor can be discovered; one that shows that Indigenous peoples have not always been victims, but maybe more importantly it allows us to show a more complex narrative of the object itself. It gives us the space to counterweight some of the discourses that have steeped Indigenous artworks in a “postcolonial” framework of sacredness and mythical meaning. This is not to argue that it is not important to be reminded of the dangers of appropriating other cultures’ heritage, but we would argue that it is equally important to show that approaching a story from a one-sided perspective will create a dualism (Bush) and reducing the differences between different cultures to a dualistic opposition fails to recognise the fundamental areas of agency (Morphy). In order for museums to enliven and engage with objects, they must become institutions that emphasise a relational approach towards displaying and curating objects. In the next part of this paper we will explore to what extent an online museum could progressively facilitate the process of providing agency to the social relations that link objects, persons, environments and memories. As Solanilla argues, what has been described as cybermuseology may further transform the museum landscape and provide an opportunity to challenge some of the problems identified above (e.g. essentialising practices). Or to quote the museologist Langlais: “The communication and interaction possibilities offered by the Web to layer information and to allow exploration of multiple meanings are only starting to be exploited. In this context, cybermuseology is known as a practice that is knowledge-driven rather than object-driven, and its main goal is to disseminate knowledge using the interaction possibilities of Information Communication Technologies” (Langlais qtd. in Solanilla 108). One thing which shows promise and merits further exploration is the idea of transforming the act of exhibiting ethnographic objects accompanied by texts and graphics into an act of cyber discourse that allows Indigenous peoples through their own voices and gestures to involve us in their own history. This is particularly the case since Indigenous peoples are using technologies, such as the Internet, as a new medium through which they can recuperate their histories, land rights, knowledge and cultural heritage (Zimmerman et al.). As such, new technology has played a significant role in the contestation and formation of Indigenous peoples’ current identity by creating new social and political spaces through visual and narrative cultural praxis (Ginsburg).Online MuseumsIt has been acknowledged for some time that a presence on the Web might mitigate the effects of what has been described as the “unassailable voice” in the recovery process undertaken by museums (Walsh 77).  However, a museum’s online engagement with an Indigenous culture may have significance beyond undercutting the univocal authority of a museum. In the case of the South African National Gallery it was charged with challenging the extent to which it represents entrenched but unacceptable political ideologies. Online museums may provide opportunities in the conservation and dissemination of “life stories” that give an account of an Indigenous culture as it is experienced (Solanilla 105). We argue that in engaging with Indigenous cultural heritage a distinction needs to be drawn between data and the cognitive capacity to learn, “which enables us to extrapolate and learn new knowledge” (Langlois 74). The problem is that access to data about an Indigenous culture does not necessarily lead to an understanding of its knowledge. It has been argued that cybermuseology loses the essential interpersonal element that needs to be present if intangible heritage is understood as “the process of making sense that is generally transmitted orally and through face-to-face experience” (Langlois 78). We agree that the online museum does not enable a reality to be reproduced (Langlois 78).This does not mean that cybermuseology should be dismissed. Instead it provides the opportunity to construct a valuable, but completely new, experience of cultural knowledge (Langlois 78). The technology employed in cybermuseology provides the means by which control over meaning may, at least to some extent, be dispersed (Langlois 78). In this way online museums provide the opportunity for Indigenous peoples to challenge being subjected to manipulation by one authoritative museological voice. One of the ways this may be achieved is through interactivity by enabling the use of social tagging and folksonomy (Solanilla 110; Trant 2). In these processes keywords (tags) are supplied and shared by visitors as a means of accessing museum content. These tags in turn give rise to a classification system (folksonomy). In the context of an online museum engaging with an Indigenous culture we have reservations about the undifferentiated interactivity on the part of all visitors. This issue may be investigated further by examining how interactivity relates to communication. Arguably, an online museum is engaged in communicating Indigenous cultural heritage because it helps to keep it alive and pass it on to others (Langlois 77). However, enabling all visitors to structure online access to that culture may be detrimental to the communication of knowledge that might otherwise occur. The narratives by which Indigenous cultures, rather than visitors, order access to information about their cultures may lead to the communication of important knowledge. An illustration of the potential of this approach is the work Sharon Daniel has been involved with, which enables communities to “produce knowledge and interpret their own experience using media and information technologies” (Daniel, Palabras) partly by means of generating folksonomies. One way in which such issues may be engaged with in the context of online museums is through the argument that database and narrative in such new media objects are opposed to each other (Manovich, New Media 225). A new media work such as an online museum may be understood to be comprised of a database and an interface to that database. A visitor to an online museum may only move through the content of the database by following those paths that have been enabled by those who created the museum (Manovich, New Media 227). In short it is by means of the interface provided to the viewer that the content of the database is structured into a narrative (Manovich, New Media: 226). It is possible to understand online museums as constructions in which narrative and database aspects are emphasized to varying degrees for users. There are a variety of museum projects in which the importance of the interface in creating a narrative interface has been acknowledged. Goldblum et al. describe three examples of websites in which interfaces may be understood as, and explicitly designed for, carrying meaning as well as enabling interactivity: Life after the Holocaust; Ripples of Genocide; and Yearbook 2006.As with these examples, we suggest that it is important there be an explicit engagement with the significance of interface(s) for online museums about Indigenous peoples. The means by which visitors access content is important not only for the way in which visitors interact with material, but also as to what is communicated about, culture. It has been suggested that the curator’s role should be moved away from expertly representing knowledge toward that of assisting people outside the museum to make “authored statements” within it (Bennett 11). In this regard it seems to us that involvement of Indigenous peoples with the construction of the interface(s) to online museums is of considerable significance. Pieterse suggests that ethnographic museums should be guided by a process of self-representation by the “others” portrayed (Pieterse 133). Moreover it should not be forgotten that, because of the separation of content and interface, it is possible to have access to a database of material through more than one interface (Manovich, New Media 226-7). Online museums provide a means by which the artificial homogenization of Indigenous peoples may be challenged.We regard an important potential benefit of an online museum as the replacement of accessing material through the “unassailable voice” with the multiplicity of Indigenous voices. A number of ways to do this are suggested by a variety of new media artworks, including those that employ a database to rearrange information to reveal underlying cultural positions (Paul 100). Paul discusses the work of, amongst others, George Legrady. She describes how it engages with the archive and database as sites that record culture (104-6). Paul specifically discusses Legrady’s work Slippery Traces. This involved viewers navigating through more than 240 postcards.  Viewers of work were invited to “first chose one of three quotes appearing on the screen, each of which embodies a different perspective—anthropological, colonialist, or media theory—and thus provides an interpretive angle for the experience of the projects” (104-5). In the same way visitors to an online museum could be provided with a choice of possible Indigenous voices by which its collection might be experienced. We are specifically interested in the implications that such approaches have for the way in which online museums could engage with film. Inspired by Basu’s work on reframing ethnographic film, we see the online museum as providing the possibility of a platform to experiment with new media art in order to expose the meta-narrative(s) about the politics of film making. As Basu argues, in order to provoke a feeling of involvement with the viewer, it is important that the viewer becomes aware “of the plurality of alternative readings/navigations that they might have made” (105). As Weinbren has observed, where a fixed narrative pathway has been constructed by a film, digital technology provides a particularly effective means to challenge it. It would be possible to reveal the way in which dominant political interests regarding Indigenous cultures have been asserted, such as for example in the popular film The Gods Must Be Crazy. New media art once again provides some interesting examples of the way ideology, that might otherwise remain unclear, may be exposed. Paul describes the example of Jennifer and Kevin McCoy’s project How I learned. The work restructures a television series Kung Fu by employing “categories such as ‘how I learned about blocking punches,’ ‘how I learned about exploiting workers,’ or ‘how I learned to love the land’” (Paul 103) to reveal in greater clarity, than otherwise might be possible, the cultural stereotypes used in the visual narratives of the program (Paul 102-4). We suggest that such examples suggest the ways in which online museums could work to reveal and explore the existence not only of meta-narratives expressed by museums as a whole, but also the means by which they are realised within existing items held in museum collections.ConclusionWe argue that the agency for such reflective moments between the San, who have been repeatedly misrepresented or underrepresented in exhibitions and films, and multiple audiences, may be enabled through the generation of multiple narratives within online museums. We would like to make the point that, first and foremost, the theory of representation must be fully understood and acknowledged in order to determine whether, and how, modes of online curating are censorious. As such we see online museums having the potential to play a significant role in illuminating for both the San and multiple audiences the way that any form of representation or displaying restricts the meanings that may be recovered about Indigenous peoples.

"2008","Multimedia for Peanuts: The Pachyderm Project at Five","The genesis for this paper was a panel discussion held in March 2008 at the annual WebWise conference on the topic of “The Power of Presentation.”  In that discussion a number of projects were profiled that featured new approaches to presentation – some using virtual worlds, some recreating history – and some using a generic multimedia development platform called Pachyderm. As it happened, the invitation came at the same time that the Pachyderm Project, initially funded by the Institute for Museum and Library Services, was celebrating its fifth year of operations, under a model in which it had achieved self-sustaining status by the end of its third year.  This paper captures the story of the Pachyderm Project in brief, and aims to highlight some of the insights and learnings the team had as they moved from a model of external support to one in which the project could move forward under its own power.","",""
"2009","Digital Museums and Diverse Cultural Knowledges: Moving Past the Traditional Catalog","Web 2.0 technologies have introduced increasingly participatory practices to creating content, and museums are becoming interested in the potentials of “Museum 2.0” for reaching and engaging with new audiences. As technological advances are opening up the ways in which museums share information about the objects in their collections, the means by which museums create, handle, process, and transmit knowledge has become more transparent. For this to be done effectively, however, some underlying contradictions must be resolved between museum practices, which privilege the account of the “expert,” and distributed social technology practices, whose strengths lie in allowing for many, sometimes contradictory, perspectives. This article presents a theoretical position and framework for the adaptation of Web 2.0 technologies within the traditional work of the museum, in ways that support the generation and representation of knowledge in, by, and for diverse communities. We then expand on this theoretical perspective by discussing several case studies of exploratory work in this area, and close the article by presenting a few tactical, bottom-up initiatives that museums and distributed communities can take to facilitate the diffusion of this new conceptual framework. Though the subject of this article is online museums, the issues are relevant to all online collections, in particular portals, online public access catalogs (OPAC), and content management systems.","",""
"2010","A software agent and Web service based system for digital preservation","Digital objects have extensively existed in daily work and life. Some of them often need to be kept accessible and usable for a relatively long period of time. Therefore, digital preservation has emerged as a pressing demand for the communities of archives, libraries, and publishers, and even for ordinary computer users. However, compared to traditional papery and magnetic preservation, digital preservation poses novel challenges to these communities. In this paper, we briefly introduce how the challenges are addressed in the PROTAGE system developed by integrating the widely adopted software agent and Web service technologies.","",""

It describes the results of a 2008 survey of CI professionals at U.S. archives, libraries and museums which gathered data on motivations to control access to and use of digital collections, factors discouraging control, and levels of concern associated with different types of unauthorized reuse. Analysis presents three general themes that explain many of the CI motivations for control:“Controlling descriptions and representations,” “Legal risks and complexities” and “Getting credit: fiscal and social costs and revenue.”  It concludes by offering a set of examples of varying levels of reuse control (from none to complete) to serve as heuristics.","",""
"2012","The Politics of Ethnic Heritage Preservation in Canada: The Case of the Multicultural History Society of Ontario","    This article examines the constitution of the collections of the Multicultural History Society of Ontario between 1976 and 1982 in the context of the Canadian policy of multiculturalism. Set up as an independent nonprofit organization to document the history of ethnocultural communities in Ontario, the society was funded with public money. This article considers how competition with other cultural heritage organizations and relationships with ethnic donors affected collecting strategies. While the society’s mission was scholarly, the politicization of multiculturalism influenced its collecting process in significant ways. This case study illustrates the importance of understanding contextual factors when assessing the scope, content, and limitations of library, archive, or museum collections.  ","",""

"2015","Beyond Braille on Toilet Doors: Museum Curators and Audiences with Vision Impairment","The debate on the social role of museums trundles along in an age where complex associations between community, collections, and cultural norms are highly contested (Silverman 3–4; Sandell, Inequality 3–23). This article questions whether, in the case of community groups whose aspirations often go unrecognised (in this case people with either blindness or low vision), there is a need to discuss and debate institutionalised approaches that often reinforce social exclusion and impede cultural access. If “access is [indeed] an entry point to experience” (Papalia), then the privileging of visual encounters in museums is clearly a barrier for people who experience sight loss or low vision (Levent and Pursley). In contrast, a multisensory aesthetic to exhibition display respects the gamut of human sensory experience (Dudley 161–63; Drobnick 268–69; Feld 184; James 136; McGlone 41–60) as do discursive gateways including “lectures, symposia, workshops, educational programs, audio guides, and websites” (Cachia). Independent access to information extends beyond Braille on toilet doors.Underpinning this article is an ongoing qualitative case study undertaken by the author involving participant observation, workshops, and interviews with eight adults who experience vision impairment. The primary research site has been the National Museum of Australia. Reflecting on the role of curators as storytellers and the historical development of museums and their practitioners as agents for social development, the article explores the opportunities latent in museum collections as they relate to community members with vision impairment. The outcomes of this investigation offer insights into emerging issues as they relate to the International Council of Museums (ICOM) definitions of the museum program. Curators as Storytellers“The ways in which objects are selected, put together, and written or spoken about have political effects” (Eilean Hooper-Greenhill qtd. in Sandell, Inequality 8). Curators can therefore open or close doors to discrete communities of people. The traditional role of curators has been to collect, care for, research, and interpret collections (Desvallées and Mairesse 68): they are characterised as information specialists with a penchant for research (Belcher 78). While commonly possessing an intimate knowledge of their institution’s collection, their mode of knowledge production results from a culturally mediated process which ensures that resulting products, such as cultural significance assessments and provenance determinations (Russell and Winkworth), privilege the knowing systems of dominant social groups (Fleming 213). Such ways of seeing can obstruct the access prospects of underserved audiences.When it comes to exhibition display—arguably the most public of work by museums—curators conventionally collaborate within a constellation of other practitioners (Belcher 78–79). Curators liaise with museum directors, converse with conservators, negotiate with exhibition designers, consult with graphics designers, confer with marketing boffins, seek advice from security, chat with editors, and engage with external contractors. I question the extent that curators engage with community groups who may harbour aspirations to participate in the exhibition experience—a sticking point soon to be addressed. Despite the team based ethos of exhibition design, it is nonetheless the content knowledge of curators on public display. The art of curatorial interpretation sets out not to instruct audiences but, in part, to provoke a response with narratives designed to reveal meanings and relationships (Freeman Tilden qtd. in Alexander and Alexander 258). Recognised within the institution as experts (Sandell, Inclusion 53), curators have agency—they decide upon the stories told. In a recent television campaign by the National Museum of Australia, a voiceover announces: a storyteller holds incredible power to connect and to heal, because stories bring us together (emphasis added). (National Museum of Australia 2015)Storytelling in the space of the museum often shares the histories, perspectives, and experiences of people past as well as living cultures—and these stories are situated in space and time. If that physical space is not fit-for-purpose—that is, it does not accommodate an individual’s physical, intellectual, psychiatric, sensory, or neurological needs (Disability Discrimination Act 1992, Cwlth)—then the story reaches only long-established patrons. The museum’s opportunity to contribute to social development, and thus the curator’s as the primary storyteller, will have been missed. A Latin-American PerspectiveICOM’s commitment to social development could be interpreted merely as a pledge to make use of collections to benefit the public through scholarship, learning, and pleasure (ICOM 15). If this interpretation is accepted, however, then any museum’s contribution to social development is somewhat paltry. To accept such a limited and limiting role for museums is to overlook the historical efforts by advocates to change the very nature of museums. The ascendancy of the social potential of museums first blossomed during the late 1960s at a time where, globally, overlapping social movements espoused civil rights and the recognition of minority groups (Silverman 12; de Varine 3). Simultaneously but independently,  neighbourhood museums arose in the United States, ecomuseums in France and Quebec, and the integral museum in Latin America, notably in Mexico (Hauenschild; Silverman 12–13). The Latin-American commitment to the ideals of the integral museum developed out of the 1972 round table of Santiago, Chile, sponsored by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Giménez-Cassina 25–26). The Latin-American signatories urged the local and regional museums of their respective countries to collaborate with their communities to resolve issues of social inequality (Round Table Santiago 13–21). The influence of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire should be acknowledged. In 1970, Freire ushered in the concept of conscientization, defined by Catherine Campbell and Sandra Jovchelovitch as:the process whereby critical thinking develops … [and results in a] … thinker [who] feels empowered to think and to act on the conditions that shape her living. (259–260)This model for empowerment lent inspiration to the ideals of the Santiago signatories in realising their sociopolitical goal of the integral museum (Assunção dos Santos 20). Reframing the museum as an institution in the service of society, the champions of the integral museum sought to redefine the thinking and practices of museums and their practitioners (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 37–39). The signatories successfully lobbied ICOM to introduce an explicitly social purpose to the work of museums (Assunção dos Santos 6). In 1974, in the wake of the Santiago round table, ICOM modified their definition of a museum to “a permanent non-profit institution, open to the public, in the service of society and its development” (emphasis added) (Hauenschild). Museums had been transformed into “problem solvers” (Judite Primo qtd. in Giménez-Cassina 26). With that spirit in mind, museum practitioners, including curators, can develop opportunities for reciprocity with the many faces of the public (Guarini).   Response to Social Development InitiativesStarting in the 1970s, the “second museum revolution” (van Mensch 6–7) saw the transition away from: traditional roles of museums [of] collecting, conservation, curatorship, research and communication … [and toward the] … potential role of museums in society, in education and cultural action. (van Mensch 6–7)Arguably, this potential remains a work in progress some 50 years later. Writing in the tradition of museums as agents of social development, Mariana Lamas states:when we talk about “in the service of society and its development”, it’s quite different. It is like the drunk uncle at the Christmas party that the family pretends is not there, because if they pretend long enough, he might pass out on the couch. (Lamas 47–48)That is not to say that museums have neglected to initiate services and programs that acknowledge the aspirations of people with disabilities (refer to Cachia and Krantz as examples). Without discounting such efforts, but with the refreshing analogy of the drunken uncle still fresh in memory, Lamas answers her own rhetorical question:how can traditional museums promote community development? At first the word “development” may seem too much for the museum to do, but there are several ways a museum can promote community development. (Lamas 52) Legitimising CommunitiesThe first way that museums can foster community or social development is to:help the community to over come [sic] a problem, coming up with different solutions, putting things into a new perspective; providing confidence to the community and legitimizing it. (Lamas 52)As a response, my doctoral investigation legitimises the right of people with vision impairment to participate in the social and cultural aspects of publicly funded museums. The Australian Government upheld this right in 2008 by ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (and Optional Protocol), which enshrines the right of people with disability to participate in the cultural life of the nation (United Nations).At least 840,700 people in Australia (a minimum of four per cent of the population) experiences either blindness or low vision (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2009). For every one person in the Australian community who is blind, nearly five other people experience low vision. The medical model of disability identifies the impairment as the key feature of a person and seeks out a corrective intervention. In contrast, the social model of disability strives to remove the attitudinal, social, and physical barriers enacted by people or institutions (Landman, Fishburn, and Tonkin 14). Therein lies the opportunity and challenge for museums—modifying layouts and practices that privilege the visual. Consequently, there is scope for museums to partner with people with vision impairment to identify their aspirations rather than respond as a problem to be fixed. Common fixes in the museums for people with disabilities include physical alterations such as ramps and, less often, special tours (Cachia). I posit that curators, as co-creators and major contributors to exhibitions, can be part of a far wider discussion. In the course of doctoral research, I accompanied adults with a wide array of sight impairments into exhibitions at the Museum of Australian Democracy at Old Parliament House, the Australian War Memorial, and the National Museum of Australia. Within the space of the exhibition, the most commonly identified barrier has been the omission of access opportunities to interpreted materials: that is, information about objects on display as well as the wider narratives driving exhibitions. Often, the participant has had to work backwards, from the object itself, to understand the wider topic of the exhibition. If aesthetics is “the way we communicate through the senses” (Thrift 291), then the vast majority of exhibits have been inaccessible from a sensory perspective. For people with low vision (that is, they retain some degree of functioning sight), objects’ labels have often been too small to be read or, at times, poorly contrasted or positioned. Objects have often been set too deep into display cabinets or too far behind safety barriers. If individuals must use personal magnifiers to read text or look in vain at objects, then that is an indicator that there are issues with exhibition design. For people who experience blindness (that is, they cannot see), neither the vast majority of exhibits nor their interpretations have been made accessible. There has been minimal access across all museums to accessioned objects, handling collections, or replicas to tease out exhibits and their stories. Object labels must be read by family or friends—a tiring experience. Without motivated peers, the stories told by curators are silenced by a dearth of alternative options.Rather than presume to know what works for people with disabilities, my research ethos respects the “nothing about us without us” (Charlton 2000; Werner 1997) maxim of disability advocates. To paraphrase Lamas, we have collaborated to come up with different solutions by putting things into new perspectives. In turn, “person-centred” practices based on rapport, warmth, and respect (Arigho 206–07) provide confidence to a diverse community of people by legitimising their right to participate in the museum space. Incentivising Communities  Museums can also nurture social or community development by providing incentives to “the community to take action to improve its quality of life” (Lamas 52). It typically falls to (enthusiastic) public education and community outreach teams to engage underserved communities through targeted programs. This approach continues the trend of curators as advocates for the collection, and educators as advocates for the public (Kaitavouri xi). If the exhibition briefs normally written by curators (Belcher 83) reinforced the importance of access, then exhibition designers would be compelled to offer fit-for-purpose solutions. Better still, if curators (and other exhibition team members) regularly met with community based organisations (perhaps in the form of a disability reference group), then museums would be better positioned to accommodate a wider spectrum of community members. The National Standards for Australian Museums and Galleries already encourages museums to collaborate with disability organisations (40). Such initiatives offer a way forward for improving a community’s sense of itself and its quality of life. The World Health Organization defines health as a “state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity”. While I am not using quality of life indicators for my doctoral study, the value of facilitating social and cultural opportunities for my target audience is evident in participant statements. At the conclusion of one sensory based workshop, Mara, a female participant who experiences low vision in one eye and blindness in the other, stated:I think it was interesting in that we could talk together about what we were experiencing and that really is the social aspect of it. I mean if I was left to go to a whole lot of museums on my own, I probably wouldn’t. You know, I like going with kids or a friend visiting from interstate—that sort of thing. And so this group, in a way, replicates that experience in that you’ve got someone else to talk about your impressions with—much better than going on your own or doing this alone.Mara’s statement was in response to one of two workshops I held with the support of the Learning Services team at the National Museum of Australia in May 2015. Selected objects from the museum’s accessioned collection and handling collection were explored, as well as replicas in the form of 3D printed objects. For example, participants gazed upon and handled a tuckerbox, smelt and tasted macadamia nuts in wattle seed syrup, and listened to a genesis story about the more-ish nut recorded by the Butchulla people—the traditional owners of Fraser Island. We sat around a table while I, as the workshop mediator, sought to facilitate free-flowing discussions about their experiences and, in turn, mused on the capacity of objects to spark social connection and opportunities for cultural access.  While the workshop provided the opportunity for reciprocal exchanges amongst participants as well as between participants and me, what was highly valued by most participants was the direct contact with members of the museum’s Learning Services team. I observed that participants welcomed the opportunity to talk with real museum workers. Their experience of museum practitioners, to date, had been largely confined to the welcome desk of respective institutions or through special events or tours where they were talked at. The opportunity to communicate directly with the museum allowed some participants to share their thoughts and feelings about the services that museums provide.  I suggest that curators open themselves up to such exchanges on a more frequent basis—it may result in reciprocal benefits for all stakeholders.    Fortifying IdentityA third way museums can contribute to social or community development is by:fortify[ing] the bonds between the members of the community and reaffirm their identities making them feel more secure about who they are; and give them a chance to tell their own version of their history to “outsiders” which empowers them. (Lamas 52)Identity informs us and others of who we are and where we belong in the world (Silverman 54). However, the process of identity marking and making can be fraught: “some communities are ours by choice …  [and] … some are ours because of the ways that others see us” (Watson 4). Communities are formed by identifying who is in and who is out (Francois Dubet qtd. in Bessant and Watts 260). In other words, the construction of collective identity is reinforced through means of social inclusion and social exclusion. The participants of my study, as members or clients of the Royal Society for the Blind | Canberra Blind Society, clearly value participating in events with empathetic peers. People with vision impairment are not a homogenous group, however. Reinforcing the cultural influences on the formation of identity, Fiona Candlin asserts that “to state the obvious but often ignored fact, blind people …  [come] … from all social classes, all cultural, racial, religious and educational backgrounds” (101). Irrespective of whether blindness or low vision arises congenitally, adventitiously, or through unexpected illness, injury, or trauma, the end result is an assortment of individuals with differing perceptual characteristics who construct meaning in often divergent ways (De Coster and Loots 326–34). They also hold differing world views. Therefore, “participation [at the museum] is not an end in itself. It is a means for creating a better world” (Assunção dos Santos 9). According to the Australian Human Rights Commissioner, Professor Gillian Triggs, a better world is:   a society for all, in which every individual has an active role to play. Such a society is based on fundamental values of equity, equality, social justice, and human rights and freedoms, as well as on the principles of tolerance and embracing diversity. (Triggs)Publicly funded museums can play a fundamental role in the cultural lives of societies. For example, the Powerhouse Museum (Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences) in Sydney partnered with Vision Australia to host an exhibition in 2010 titled Living in a Sensory World: it offered “visitors an understanding of the world of the blindness and low vision community and celebrates their achievements” (Powerhouse Museum). With similar intent, my doctoral research seeks to validate the world of my participants by inviting museums to appreciate their aspirations as a distinct but diverse community of people.  ConclusionIn conclusion, the challenge for museum curators and other museum practitioners is balancing what Richard Sennett (qtd. in Bessant and Watts 265) identifies as opportunities for enhancing social cohesion and a sense of belonging while mitigating parochialism and community divisiveness. Therefore, curators, as the primary focus of this article, are indeed challenged when asked to contribute to serving the public through social development—a public which is anything but homogenous. Mindful of cultural and social differences in an ever-changing world, museums are called to respect the cultural and natural heritage of the communities they serve and collaborate with (ICOM 10). It is a position I wholeheartedly support. This is not to say that museums or indeed curators are capable of solving the ills of society. However, inviting people who are frequently excluded from social and cultural events to multisensory encounters with museum collections acknowledges their cultural rights. I suggest that this would be a seismic shift from the current experiences of adults with blindness or low vision at most museums.ReferencesAlexander, Edward, and Mary Alexander.

To address the significant discrepancy between the historic practice of the art school and its material representation within holdings, ArchiveKSA emerged as a digital archiving platform. As researcher on ArchiveKSA, I am at the nexus of several alumni, student and staff communities. Collecting for ArchiveKSA involves nurturing these nascent online communities to connect personal narratives and virtual artefacts in Webs of social relations. Using ArchiveKSA as a case study, this article examines theories of online community-fostered archives and compares their functioning to traditional archives. The positioning of digital archives within memory frameworks and the possibilities of multivocality in online and physical display are areas considered, with the similarities and differences between the digital and physical versions of the archive thrown into relief.

But how do we relate to archives as material memories? What do we gain in their preservation, and what, paradoxically, might we lose? For good reason, archival materials are conserved and preserved in order to ward off dissolution, of both the things themselves and their memory function. But what does archival preservation prevent us from feeling, seeing and doing? What creative possibilities might be released when the archive is dissolved? In this article, we discuss our art–science collaboration, after | image. This project is about personal and material memory and about archival preservation and dissolution; it features time-lapse macrophotography of photographic negatives being chemically and physically destroyed. The negatives come from Grayson Cooke’s studies in photography at high school – this archive has been stored in his parents’ attic for 20 years, nominally ‘preserved’ for posterity but degrading nevertheless, as all material objects do. The submission of a personal archive to chemical destruction not conservation, and to a digital recording of this destruction, highlights the crux of the project’s enquiry and introduces its affective charge. Why destroy the archive, why commit archival treason? Because in doing so, you can make it live again. ","",""

Digital opportunities for traditional film archive policy"," This article investigates the high-profile film repatriation projects between such organizations as the US Library of Congress, the Museum of Modern Art, the National Film and Sound Archive in Australia, and the New Zealand Film Archive. Heralded for bringing ‘home’ the so-called lost films, repatriation projects capture public imagination and prove vital in galvanizing the much needed press interest in the media preservation movement. National film archives, however, continue to pursue traditional modes of repatriating film material, spending thousands of dollars to ship nitrate film prints to underfunded and overwhelmed US media repositories, and perpetuating the dominance of the nation-state in preservation discourse. This article challenges the long-standing, celluloid-focused approach by providing an overview of media repatriation practice and policy, contemporary analysis of cultural property theory and law, and offering a pragmatic suggestion for digital repatriation models that can empower a greater number of regional participants.

Situated within two different but complementary disciplines, film (Atkinson) and dance (Whatley), our aim in this issue has been to bring together a range of viewpoints and perspectives that represents a range of specialisms and subject domains. In conjunction with the fourth in the series of ‘Digital Echoes’ symposia at Coventry University, UK, in January 2014, which brought together a range of speakers and delegates from a broad cross section of the arts, we invited contributions that would capture some of the initiatives and dialogues that are taking place in archival practices within the digital environment. In line with the journal’s title, the convergence between scholars, arts professionals and digital experts has led to a very rich corpus of papers that cover a range of territories and speak to the shift from the closed to the open and from the traditional single-user archive model to emerging multi-user, collaborative forms of archival practices and scholarship. The collection explores how digital preservation and presentation of archival materials dramatically impacts upon the nature and notion of access and how the types of discoveries, insights and findings made through online digital interfaces can be radically altered. We were delighted that the call for contributions to this issue elicited a large number of submissions and what we include here is just a selection of what could have represented this lively area of activity. We are pleased that we are able to bring together an international group of writers, thus demonstrating how there are common and convergent themes within the broad frame of archival practice. Some articles focus on a very specific collection or art form/practice, whilst others offer a more expansive theorization of a body of work. Some are grounded in a particular community or social context and show how digital technologies have the potential to create or reveal new kinds of narratives.

"2015","Digital commonplacing","This paper presents illustrative examples of digital technology that facilitates information sorting and recontextualizing. A number of online media, like microblogging and photo sharing Web sites, allow collecting and systematizing information over time. Citations and user annotations, along with copied and embedded multimodal material, are compiled into new works through a complex interplay between users and Web services. The resulting texts can be seen as remixes, created by tags and links to various sources, which let individual contributions become part of a large number of potentially new texts. This article examines two examples to highlight qualities of tagging written and visual information: Twitter and Pinterest.This way of reusing digital information may be compared to similar analogue information management practices, known as commonplacing, found in early modern Europe. Readers would keep useful information to be retrieved later by copying passages from their own reading into notebooks called commonplace books.","",""

The quality of reports has been a subject of debate, and recently it has been argued that more emphasis should be placed on making primary research data at least similarly available. This study explores the changing materialities and reciprocal formation of documents and their users with the advent of digitization, and how documents form and lose their status as boundary objects in these processes. The study posits that in order to be functional, a boundary object needs to provide a disclosure that makes it accessible to cognate communities. Further, it shows how assumptions about the functioning of the human and nonhuman (material artifacts) influence the ways in which archaeologists conceptualize the preservation and archiving of archaeological information and the role and potential of different types of digital and paper-based documents. This article is based on an interview study of Swedish archaeology professionals (N = 16) with theoretical underpinnings in the notions of boundary objects, mangle of practice, and disclosure.","",""

However, no State can accomplish all these tasks without mobilizing a wide network of institutions, associations, and individuals. The national ICH policies intersect, overlap, and often transform the existing relationships among these actors. This study aims at comparing several national networks (France, Italy, and Switzerland) involved in the implementation of the 2003 UNESCO Convention to highlight national trends and specificities. The analysis has employed an innovative methodology based on digital methods and is aimed at exploring the landscapes of websites dedicated to the intangible heritage. By analyzing the hyperlinking strategies of ICH actors, we have identified the specific web topology of each nation, showing which actors are central and peripheral, whether clusters or cliques are formed, and who plays the roles of authority and hub.

Although initiatives in digital preservation in Europe, North America, Asia and sporadic attempts in Africa appear to have yielded some level of progress, permanent access to information and longevity of digital records continue to be a problem. Whilst Africa’s contribution to the growth of digital records may be insignificant, it is growing and Ghana cannot be insulated from this threat of digital growth. This paper examines the current challenges of digital preservation in sub-Saharan Africa with particular reference to Ghana. It identified funding, level of security and privacy, skills training and technological obsolescence as factors that pose key threats to digital preservation. The paper recommends that the ministries and agencies can address many of the digital preservation challenges if they adopt backup, refreshing, metadata and migration strategies.","",""
"2017","Tracing exploratory modes in digital collections of museum Web sites using reverse information architecture","Museums are broadening their program beyond the physical institutions by providing digital collections online. In digital collections, objects are prepared and presented particularly for the Web and the ambition is to provide the entirety of a physical collection. To make these rich and comprehensive data sets accessible, an explore mode is increasingly offered. The present study considers this mode, first by making sense of the term “exploration” and suggesting four functional principles in support of exploration in digital collections — view, movement, contextualization, and participation. On this basis, we compare eight well-known museums with regard to the explore modes for their digital collections. We have devised a three-part methodology, reverse information architecture, to address the question: How is the function of exploration manifested in the structure and interface elements of digital collections? With this unique method we use the given content to investigate how far the four principles are implemented in explore modes of digital collections and, broadly said, how explorable they are. The introduced approach to studying digital collections could be opened up to other fields to analyze a variety of Web interfaces in general.","",""

To this end, we propose to implement upgradeable digital models that include the time dimension. These models are designed to illustrate the evolution of heritage buildings and sites over time and record the historian’s interpretation of documentary sources. The research objective is to develop a 4D modelling protocol to optimize data organization so information is easier to access and modify. This paper explains why BIM platforms do not seem appropriate tools for the work we are doing. We describe our method based on the synergy between a SQLite database and a 3D software (Autodesk Maya) linked by an algorithm written in Python. We conducted a case study involving a heritage place in Montreal, Canada. This site provided an opportunity to test the protocol developed because it is composed of several buildings that have evolved asynchronously. L’objectif de notre recherche est de bonifier le processus de diffusion de la connaissance dans le domaine du patrimoine bâti. A cette fin, nous proposons la mise en oeuvre de modeles numeriques evolutifs incluant la quatrieme dimension, soit le temps. Ces modeles sont elabores dans l’optique de rendre compte du processus evolutif de bâtiments et sites patrimoniaux, et de formaliser la facon dont l’historien interprete les sources documentaires.

"2018","Introduction to the DHQ Special Issue: Digital Technology in the Study of the Past.","Digital technology is transforming the assemblage and dissemination of historical information. Museums, libraries, archives, and universities increasingly modify their digital research infrastructures in order to make data open and available. The imminent assessment and representation of historical data has admittedly challenged the boundaries of historical knowledge and generated new research questions. The process of reconstructing, visualizing and rendering historical data has equally developed together with technology. This is the case in both academic and heritage contexts and in less immediatedly obvious popular uses, such as the increasingly significant presence and use of history within videogames. Regardless of specific context, as this collection of articles shows, the process of digitally capturing and representing historical data is often analogous to and determined by the digital platform used.","",""

Although the initial build and methodology surrounding the projects are well documented, the current status and end results are not. Now that a decade has passed since their production, this article examines the issues that have arisen with these Indigenous digital heritage projects. The primary emphasis is on sustainability, and the discussion concentrates on outdated software, funding problems, and maintenance issues that have afflicted these projects over the years.

"2019","‘Everything’ disappears … reflexive design and norm-critical intervention in the digitalization of cultural heritage","ABSTRACT According to narrative trends, digitalization has the potential to deconstruct both power structures and practices of exclusion in society. What we argue here is that this deconstruction is not the result of digitalization alone, it is dependent on how digitalization is done. On the contrary, digitalization has often resulted in reproduction instead of transformation and deconstruction, i.e. digitalization tend to uphold practices instead of challenging them. Being slightly more provocative, what becomes digitalized is often what we can easily capture and understand. Similarly, when we open up for an increased participation in the creation of digital artifacts (sometimes expressed as demand-driven, citizen-centered, or participatory development), those participating in digitalization are often already known; the use of already established contact channels making them easy to reach and connect with. Such logics raise questions about the intersections of norms and power and the potential transformative character of digitalization. The aim of this paper is to, through a theoretical framework combining critical information systems, policy enactment and norm critical design, introduce a reflexive design method to gently provoke norms. We analyze the need to intervene in the everyday practices of digitalization. This is done in an empirical case study of the making of a regional digital cultural heritage portal. The results indicate that digitalization needs norm critical interventions to change existing practices and prevent norm reproduction. Otherwise, as in this case of the digitalization of cultural heritage, digitalization runs the risk of strengthening existing power structures and excluding practices instead of challenging them.","",""

Drawing on the insights of rhetorical genre studies, we examine how the catalog has been implicated in the formation and shaping of anthropological knowledge in the museum over the course of its history. In this first part, we focus on the ledgers that served as the catalog between 1879 and 1960 and examine how they participated in collecting, ordering, and transforming knowledge within the museum during that time period. In specific terms, we explore the sociohistorical context in which the ledger catalog emerged, the kinds of knowledge it communicated through its structure and content, and the particular understanding of Indigenous material culture as embodied knowledge it communicated and perpetuated over time.","",""

Drawing on the insights of rhetorical genre studies, we examine how the catalog has been implicated in the formation and shaping of anthropological knowledge in the museum over the course of its history. In this second part, we trace the catalog’s evolution from internal management tool to public access tool between 1960 and 2018 and examine how it participated in the actions of systematizing, communicating, and reconciling knowledge within the museum during that time period.","",""
"2020","The Wearable Past: Integrating a Physical Museum Collection of Wearables into a Database of Born-Digital Artifacts","This paper describes the collaborative process involved in the novel creation of The Wearable Past: a collection of physical museum artifacts, presently on display at the Canada Science and Technology Museum in Ottawa, digitally re-presented in the context of the Fabric of Digital Life (or Fabric), a database of born-digital objects run by the Decimal Lab at Ontario Tech University. We discuss the multiple stages involved in integrating a physical exhibit of wearables within a database of born-digital artifacts. We argue that the inclusion of historic artifacts in Fabric effectively connects the past to the future, creating a dialogic relationship between digital artifacts rather than a hierarchical schema, facilitated by Fabric’s metadata. Fabric provides a means to explore the cultural turn in wearable technology adoption, contextualized through a complex range of artifact representations. Following Bakhtin’s notion of “dialogic interaction,” we argue that the historic artifacts become dialogically entangled, and weave “in and out of complex interrelationships” (Bakhtin 1981, 276–277). We use Carole L. Palmer’s thematic research collections framework to explain the overarching structure and intent for Fabric’s born-digital collections. We then proceed to explain how The Wearable Past weaves historical cultural narratives from material artifacts into Fabric. We argue that they persist amid technologies that are proposed for future bodies to wear, reframing the conceptualization of wearables as lived phenomena. We draw on the work of several writers, including Lai Tze Fan (2018), Moynihan and Putra (2019), and Johanna Drucker (2009) to interpret The Wearable Past’s contribution to Fabric’s content, metadata, and ontology. Resume Cet article decrit le processus collaboratif qui a donne naissance a La technologie pret-a-porter (The Wearable Past) : une collection d’artefacts physiques de musees, ce qui est actuellement presentee au Musee des sciences et de la technologie du Canada a Ottawa. Cela est represente dans le contexte du Tissu de la vie numerique (Fabric of Digital Life; appele Fabric), une base de donnees qui est geree par La laboratoire decimale (Decimal Lab) a l’Institut universitaire de technologie de l’Ontario et qui se compose d’objets qui n’existent qu’au format numerique. Dans cet article, nous discutons des etapes multiples impliquees dans l’integration d’une exposition physique de technologies portables dans le cadre d’une base de donnees d’artefacts n’existant qu’au format numerique. Nous avancons que l’inclusion d’artefacts historiques dans Fabric lie efficacement le passe a l’avenir, ce qui cree une relation dialogique entre des artefacts numeriques, au lieu de creer un schema hierarchique, et ce que facilitent les metadonnees de Fabric. Fabric fournit un moyen d’explorer le tournant culturel qui est l’adoption de la technologie portable, contextualise par une gamme complexe de representations d’artefacts. Suivant la notion de Bakhtin d’≪ interaction dialogique ≫, nous avancons que les artefacts historiques deviennent empetres de facon dialogique et s’imbriquent ≪ les uns dans les autres dans des interrelations complexes ≫ (Bakhtin 1981, 276–277). Nous nous servons du cadre de recherche de collections thematique de Carole L. Palmer afin d’expliquer la structure principale et l’intention concernant les collections d’objets n’existant qu’au format numerique de Fabric. Ensuite, nous presentons comment La technologie pret-a-porter produit des narrations culturelles historiques a partir des artefacts materiels dans Fabric. Nous avancons que ces narrations persistent avec des technologies qui sont proposees pour le port de corps futurs, recadrant la conceptualisation des portables comme des phenomenes vecus. Nous nous appuyons sur les travaux de plusieurs auteurs, y compris Lai Tze Fan (2018), Moynihan et Putra (2019) et Johanna Drucker (2009), pour interpreter la contribution de La technologie pret-a-porter au contenu, aux metadonnees et a l’ontologie de Fabric.

"2020","Paradata in Documentation Standards and Recommendations for Digital Archaeological Visualisations","Abstract                 Digitalisation of research data and massive efforts to make it findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable has revealed that in addition to an eventual lack of description of the data itself (metadata), data reuse is often obstructed by the lack of information about the datamaking and interpretation (i.e. paradata). In search of the extent and composition of categories for describing processes, this article reviews a selection of standards and recommendations frequently referred to as useful for documenting archaeological visualisations. It provides insight into 1) how current standards can be employed to document provenance and processing history (i.e. paradata), and 2) what aspects of the processing history can be made transparent using current standards and which aspects are pushed back or hidden. The findings show that processes are often either completely absent or only partially addressed in the standards. However, instead of criticising standards for bias and omissions as if a perfect description of everything would be attainable, the findings point to the need for a comprehensive consideration of the space a standard is operating in (e.g. national heritage administration or international harmonisation of data). When a standard is used in a specific space it makes particular processes, methods, or tools transparent. Given these premises, if the standard helps to document what needs to be documented (e.g. paradata), and if it provides a type of transparency required in a certain space, it is reasonable to deem the standard good enough for that purpose.","",""
"2020","Europeana, EDM, and the Europeanisation of Cultural Heritage Institutions","Abstract                 Over the past two decades, the European Commission has mobilised cultural heritage to bolster a European identity. One of the main flagship initiatives promoted to this end has been Europeana, the most extensive digital cultural project financed by the EU. At the core of the project stands europeana.eu, a digital cultural portal aggregating metadata provided by national and local heritage institutions. Central in our analysis is the Europeana Data Model (EDM). Using standardised thesauri and vocabularies, EDM offers the possibility to create a semantic contextualisation for objects, allowing semantic operations on the metadata and their enrichment with Linked Open Data on the web. Due to its overarching nature, EDM cannot deliver the granularity that cultural heritage institutions need when documenting their resources. Nonetheless, heritage institutions accept to sacrifice accuracy to have their information represented in a Europewide collection. We study how this digital heritage infrastructure was designed to enact a sense of Europeanness amongst national and local institutions. Policy documents, ethnographic research and a systematic survey amongst the European heritage institutions enabled us to trace how a standardised European metadata structure plays a role in governing local and national heritage institutions. The EDM might enable heritage stakeholders to benefit from Europeana’s online exposure while enacting a European mindset. Ultimately, this study of the metadata model enriches the debate on the EU’s cultural heritage politics, which has not fully explored the role of the digital. At the same time, it also taps into debates about infrastructure and digital governmentality.","",""
"2020","Man, Woman, Child","Abstract                 This paper is concerned with the ethical aspects of museum metadata. These are not always immediately evident when working with the metadata related to museum objects, although, I will argue, they are embedded in the object, accumulated at each phase of its journey into the institution; and continue to accumulate while it is part of a collection. This takes place against a backdrop of new development and possibilities afforded by digital technologies for building connections between and across heritage collections online, which can result in these complicated metadata potentially entering the data ecosystem. This eventuality, I will argue, has ethical and technical implications which need to be considered and understood through the theoretical lenses of critical data studies, museum informatics and the growing calls from museum scholars and others to decolonisation of museum collections. Using a small collection of drawings from the Pitt Rivers Museum of Anthropology and World Archaeology at the University of Oxford, I will demonstrate how difficult museum metadata can be buried deep in museum documentation, and how this data, once brought to the surface by digitisation, can expose the trauma of a collection’s origins. I will go on to ask whether the current models used to share heritage data online are appropriate mechanisms for materials with such sensitive histories, and ask how best to handle them in the increasingly digital future.","",""
"2020","Archiving the Leftovers of Science","Abstract                 In this article, I focus on digital scientific archives which are made up of the leftovers of science, such as drafts, obsolete instruments, photographs, documentation, etc. The artifacts exhibited in such collections were neither meant to be representations, nor objects of gaze, but means used to achieve scientific results. As they lose functionality, they acquire aesthetic and historical value and emerge as clues, traces of past scientific practices and institutional histories. Therefore, the ways in which institutions situate these objects within the archive, the vocabularies and metadata they use, bear testimony on the manner they present and depict their past. How do the digital archives of the scientific institutions represent their histories? To address this question, I analyse the subject metadata of twenty-five institutional archives, turning them into objects of distant reading. Quantitative methods offer a way to discern the discursive frameworks that scientific institutions tend to adopt: Do they frame their collections as cultural heritage? represent them as corporate histories? emphasise technical specifications? scientific value? big names? A closer look at the metadata sets reveals that, in fact, these very different perspectives intermingle and clash with each other within the archive structures: the logic of heritage is juxtaposed with scientific classifications, institutional categories stand side by side with natural objects, and minority histories with celebrity narratives. Discussing this interplay of discourses, the article frames the digital archive of science as a specific mode of historical representation, which gives rise to a new (and still political) order of things.","",""
"2020","The Diversity Paradox","Abstract                 At the core of museum practice is the notion of diversity. However, as this analysis of different types of metadata production shows, contradictory ideas and ideals pervade both metadata production among information specialists (i.e. archivists, metadata managers, curators working in the heritage institutions), and the systems for, and practices of, participatory metadata production. While the discourse on metadata standards is permeated by ideas of objectivity and interoperability the field is, in practice, far from coherent, being marked by a great variety as regards templates, formats and vocabularies. Conversely, the discourse on digital participation in the cultural heritage is permeated with notions of diversity, as means to increase democracy and support variety. In practice, however, the available crowdsourcing platforms are often formulaic offering few possibilities for the crowd to add individual interpretations and their own agenda. This analysis of the practice of producing descriptive metadata reveals the complex, multifaceted implications of notions of diversity for the cultural heritage. Diversity, meaning great variety, is then not solely a positive end in itself but can in fact hinder the distribution and linkability of information and thereby the creation and building of new knowledge. Likewise, participatory activities where heritage institutions reach out to the crowd do not automatically generate diversity as there is no direct correlation between the magnitude of the group and variability. To understand this complexity and acknowledge the, sometimes, contradictory demands and effects related to the notion and norms of diversity is at the core of the making and preservation of our cultural heritage.","",""
"2020","One-Eyed Archive","Abstract                 During 2016, the Royal Danish Library digitized more than 200.000 pages from the library’s, collections all of which related to the former colonies in the Caribbean. This included books and other printed matter, but also sheet music, manuscripts, personal documents, photographs and drawings. Images were published in Digital Collections, the library’s platform for digitized materials, and were accompanied by limited metadata, thereby posing challenges in terms of accessibility and important historical contextualisation. This essay therefore reflects on the gaps and the silences that haunt indexing and descriptive practices in the migration online. Mette Kia Krabbe Meyer is Senior Research Fellow at the Royal Danish Library and has been project-managing the digitisation. Temi Odumosu is Senior Lecturer in Cultural Studies at Malmö University and has worked intensively with the collection as user and collaborator in the project What Lies Unspoken. As the Library embarks on initiatives to address the limited metadata associated with its digital collections, the authors come together to unfold key questions about approaches and process. They describe the characteristics of Digital Collections and the metadata currently provided, and ask what is left out and why; thereby engaging cultural biases that uneasily mirror the colonial project. The authors also explore how more inclusive user involvement, particularly in the United States Virgin Islands (USVI), could shift language and epistemology. The leading inquiry question is: In the one-eyed colonial archive, what is it possible for metadata to do?","",""
"2020","The sale of heritage on eBay: Market trends and cultural value"," The marketisation of heritage has been a major topic of interest among heritage specialists studying how the online marketplace shapes sales. Missing from that debate is a large-scale analysis seeking to understand market trends on popular selling platforms such as eBay. Sites such as eBay can inform what heritage items are of interest to the wider public, and thus what is potentially of greater cultural value, while also demonstrating monetary value trends. To better understand the sale of heritage on eBay’s international site, this work applies named entity recognition using conditional random fields, a method within natural language processing, and word dictionaries that inform on market trends. The methods demonstrate how Western markets, particularly the US and UK, have dominated sales for different cultures. Roman, Egyptian, Viking (Norse/Dane) and Near East objects are sold the most. Surprisingly, Cyprus and Egypt, two countries with relatively strict prohibition against the sale of heritage items, make the top 10 selling countries on eBay. Objects such as jewellery, statues and figurines, and religious items sell in relatively greater numbers, while masks and vessels (e.g. vases) sell at generally higher prices. Metal, stone and terracotta are commonly sold materials. More rare materials, such as those made of ivory, papyrus or wood, have relatively higher prices. Few sellers dominate the market, where in some months 40% of sales are controlled by the top 10 sellers. The tool used for the study is freely provided, demonstrating benefits in an automated approach to understanding sale trends. ","",""
"2020","Strokes of serendipity: Community co-curation and engagement with digital heritage"," This article explores the potential that community-led digital engagement with heritage holds for stimulating active citizenship through taking responsibility for shared cultural heritage and for fostering long-lasting relationships between local community heritage groups and national museums. Through the lens of a pilot project titled Science Museum: Community-in-Residence, we discovered that – despite working with community groups that were already loyal to and enjoyed existing working ties with the Science Museum in London, United Kingdom – this undertaking proved challenging owing to a range of structural and logistical issues even before the application of digital devices and tools had been considered. These challenges notwithstanding, the pilot found that the creation of time and space for face-to-face dialogue and interactions between the Science Museum and the participating community heritage groups helped to establish the parameters within which digital co-curation can effectively occur. This, in turn, informed the development of a digital prototype with huge potential to enable remote, virtual connectivity to, and interactivity with, conversations about shared heritage. The ultimate goal was twofold: (a) to help facilitate collaborative sense-making of our shared past and (b) to aid the building of sustainable institutional and community/public working ties around emerging affinities, agendas and research questions in relation to public history and heritage.

"2020","UX design in online catalogs: Practical issues with implementing traditional knowledge (TK) labels","At the center of the evolving debates of open access and intellectual property in memory institutions is a long history of excluding Indigenous Peoples from conversations concerning the access and use rights to their belongings. In recent decades many memory institutions challenged prevalent historical and current classifications of Indigenous Peoples in online catalog records. Most recently the Library of Congress (LC) adopted a new cataloging practice called Traditional Knowledge (TK) labeling as a way to return control over access and use of Indigenous materials to their rightful Indigenous owners. The advent of this emergent digital rights tool disrupts previously held assumptions about the purpose of rights statements in catalog records as well as challenges the existing balance between the rights of Indigenous communities and the interests of public access. The adoption of TK Labels in the LC’s “Ancestral Voices” digital collection brings serious practical implementation issues to light that deserve further consideration before memory institutions invest in this new digital access rights metadata standard. Although TK Labels are a technological opportunity that provide more space for community-based relationships within memory institutions, this paper suggests that the practical implementation of TK Labels in Ancestral Voices falls short of its promise to return authority to the Passamaquoddy people. Rather, TK Labels raise more logistical and technical questions about the effectiveness of the TK labeling framework and purpose of re-cataloging records describing Indigenous materials.","",""
"2021","‘Place a book and walk away’: archival digitization as a socio-technical practice","ABSTRACT Over the last couple of decades, libraries, archives, museums and other cultural institutions have begun to scan archival documents and develop digital collections of analog-born materials. Theories of the archive politicize archival practices and highlight the mediating role of both archivists and preservation technologies, and recent accounts of the digital archive underscore both its pervasiveness and its algorithmic post-humanism. Both strands, however, ignore scanning – a human–computer interaction that shapes the ways in which archival sources will be preserved. Drawing on STS, HCI and HMC scholarship, this ethnography opens the black box of scanning at the National Library of Israel. The analysis focuses on three """"breakdowns"""" that involve the handling of a torn photo, an ancient map and a scan robot. We show that instead of an automated process in which machines convert materials into copies, archival scanning is a symbolic human–computer interaction that produces digital objects with varying relationships to the analog originals. We discuss the ramifications of these insights to the social study of archival technology and future memory.","",""

What are the implications of viewing large-scale cultural heritage data as an economic resource, to build new products and services upon? Drawing upon valuation studies, we reflect on both the theory and practicalities of using mass-digitised heritage content as an economic driver, stressing the need to consider the complexity of commercial-based outcomes within the context of cultural and creative industries. However, we also problematise the act of considering such heritage content as a resource to be exploited for economic growth, in order to inform how we consider, develop, deliver and value mass-digitisation. Our research will be of interest to those wishing to understand a rapidly changing research and innovation landscape, those considering how to engage memory institutions in data-driven activities and those critically evaluating years of mass-digitisation across the heritage sector.

Using a theoretical framework adapted from digital history and historiography, it will investigate the implications of archival digitization. Through an empirical study of the National Library of Israel’s digital depository of ephemera entitled ‘Time Travel’, the article demonstrates how the selection of archival records for digital preservation, the design of the search interface, and the crowdsourcing of metadata collection are all directing archive users toward certain narratives about Israeli history and away from others. Drawing on interviews with professionals, analysis of reports, and investigations of user experience, I will unearth the political, religious, and cultural tensions that lie beneath the surface of ‘Time Travel’. This research demonstrates that digitization of archival documents is not just a technical process but a cultural, social, and political one as well. ","",""
"2021","The archive and the scene: On the cultural techniques of retrocomputing databases"," Several digital spaces are now archiving artifacts from the first 1980s home computer boom. These spaces are not only storages but also social venues and “memory banks,” and thereby depend on several concurrent practices: software and hardware developed to read, run, and preserve computer code; archiving of old software, magazines, and personal stories; contemporary conferences dedicated to retrocomputing; and making artifacts, which used to be private, publicly available. The article argues that retrocomputing can be seen as a foreshadowing in terms of managing collective digital archives, memories, and relationships to digital material. Taking the Commodore 64 Scene Database as a case, this article (1) engages with both users and cultural techniques in order to (2) theorize collective digital archives as “performative in-betweens” and (3) discuss how retrocomputing may become a default mode for people seeking access to their digital pasts in a time when planned obsolescence is rampant.

"2021","The role of digital technologies in recording values of human settlements: testing a practical Historic Urban Landscape approach in China and India","ABSTRACT UNESCO’s 2011 recommendation on Historic Urban Landscapes (HUL) advocated for an integrated, holistic approach to heritage places, in terms of how they are conceptualised and how they are recorded and managed in practical terms. Digital technologies offer increased capacity for recording places of all kinds, especially in terms of the physical environment and increasingly within heritage settings. Diverse case studies from China and India representing challenges in historic environments aim to test how a combination of the latest technologies and their current deployment better work toward goals within the HUL imperative. Further, we investigate where HUL approaches cannot be met by current technologies or analysis of digital data, providing a clear set of goals for future technologies or data interpretation that can work towards a more holistic capturing of place. This study analyses the interpretation of digital data in two different cultural settings between 2017 and 2018 – a historic water town in China and an informal settlement in India. Both cases employed digital technologies, including 3D laser scanning, photogrammetry, digital photography, video and audio recording to capture both the physical attributes of human settlements and how those places were used, reflecting residents’ values and cultural practices. Findings suggest that digital technologies are useful tools to illustrate layers of value beyond the built environment by connecting physical, social and cultural landscapes and associated place attachment. The combined use of various digital technologies helps to reveal interconnected place values and support better solutions for more sustainable and equitable development.","",""

However, public institutions have little authority to intervene and preserve it, and their doing so is not always a desirable alternative. The goal of this article is to propose a mitigation of this dilemma. I do so in three steps. First, I introduce the concept of digital world heritage, which denotes digital artifacts with a value beyond their utility to any single individual or community. Second, I specify three ways commercial management threatens digital world heritage. Third, I argue that many of these threats may be mitigated by the introduction of a digital world heritage label. This proposal, I contend, does not interfere with the integrity of private data controllers since it does not involve the donation of data archives, yet it does support the long-term preservation of digital heritage.","",""

Since the platform launched in late 2015, the Smithsonian Office of Education Technology has engaged more than 20,000 educators on the use of the SLL through PD that was offered both in-person and digitally, synchronously and asynchronously, frequently through partners within the network of Smithsonian Affiliate museums. Results from more than 1,100 aggregated surveys, 50 in-depth interviews, and five focus groups were triangulated and demonstrated that PD was associated with increased participants’ awareness of, skills in, and frequency in using the SLL, creating, and sharing content, and overall satisfaction with the platform. Educators, especially those who participated in PD, agreed with statements about successfully achieving student learning outcomes when using SLL in classrooms. Findings highlighted the importance of cultivating long-term, supportive relationships with PD participants and partners and offering consistently available support with museum staff well beyond the workshops. They also pointed to the value of user-centered marketing research and strategies to broaden the reach of digital learning resources. As museums and cultural organizations work to meet the increasing demand to engage educators digitally, these concrete lessons can be adapted and applied to institutions that provide access to digital resources to educators.

"2022","Using AI and ML to optimize information discovery in under-utilized, Holocaust-related records","AbstractDigital cultural assets are often thought to exist in separate spheres based on their two principal points of origin: digitized and born digital. Increasingly, advances in digital curation are blurring this dichotomy, by introducing so-called “collections as data,” which regardless of their origination make cultural assets more amenable to the application of new computational tools and methodologies. This paper brings together archivists, scholars, and technologists to demonstrate computational treatments of digital cultural assets using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques that can help unlock hard-to-reach archival content. It describes an extended, iterative study applied to digitized and datafied WWII-era records housed at the FDR Presidential Library, rich content that is regrettably under-utilized by scholars examining American responses to the Holocaust. Authors detail the benefits of interdisciplinary collaboration for evaluating user needs, identifying and applying tools and methodologies (including ML through object detection and AI through Named Entity Recognition or NER), and reaching the real-world outcome of public access to augmented data. They also discuss issues of digital representation, relational context, and interface design to enable new modes of public and scholarly access. While based on a case study, we believe that this work is a substantial contribution to revealing the strengths and weaknesses of using AI/ML systems in cultural organizations. We give particular care to lessons learned, and generalize the approach taken across broad classes of collections with a focus on responsive iterations, reproducibility, and the relevance of data and its structures to users.","",""
"2022","Unlocking digital archives: cross-disciplinary perspectives on AI and born-digital data","AbstractCo-authored by a Computer Scientist and a Digital Humanist, this article examines the challenges faced by cultural heritage institutions in the digital age, which have led to the closure of the vast majority of born-digital archival collections. It focuses particularly on cultural organizations such as libraries, museums and archives, used by historians, literary scholars and other Humanities scholars. Most born-digital records held by cultural organizations are inaccessible due to privacy, copyright, commercial and technical issues. Even when born-digital data are publicly available (as in the case of web archives), users often need to physically travel to repositories such as the British Library or the Bibliothèque Nationale de France to consult web pages. Provided with enough sample data from which to learn and train their models, AI, and more specifically machine learning algorithms, offer the opportunity to improve and ease the access to digital archives by learning to perform complex human tasks. These vary from providing intelligent support for searching the archives to automate tedious and time-consuming tasks.  In this article, we focus on sensitivity review as a practical solution to unlock digital archives that would allow archival institutions to make non-sensitive information available. This promise to make archives more accessible does not come free of warnings for potential pitfalls and risks: inherent errors, """"black box"""" approaches that make the algorithm inscrutable, and risks related to bias, fake, or partial information. Our central argument is that AI can deliver its promise to make digital archival collections more accessible, but it also creates new challenges - particularly in terms of ethics. In the conclusion, we insist on the importance of fairness, accountability and transparency in the process of making digital archives more accessible.","",""

Although born-digital assets for cultural heritage may have inundated the Internet in some areas, most of the time they are stored in “digital warehouses,” and the questions of the digital ecosystem’s sustainability, meaningful public participation and creative reuse of data still remain. Emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), are used to bring born-digital archives to light, aiming to enhance the public’s engagement and participation. At the core of this debate lies both the openness of data and issues of privacy. How open to the public should born-digital archives be? Should everything be open and available online, and what does it take to achieve balance between openness and privacy, especially through AI initiatives? The study is qualitative and builds on the rationale of grounded theory. The role of AI development is critically investigated in relation to opening up born-digital archives online, by considering privacy and ethics issues. Grounded in the context of the author’s PhD research, the paper proposes a human-centred approach to AI development for democratising its development towards fairness and social inclusion, contrary to the stereotypical cliché of blackboxing, allowing space for the plurality of born-digital archives to flourish.","",""
"2022","Digital cultural heritage standards: from silo to semantic web","AbstractThis paper is a survey of standards being used in the domain of digital cultural heritage with focus on the Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS) created by the Library of Congress in the United States of America. The process of digitization of cultural heritage requires silo breaking in a number of areas—one area is that of academic disciplines to enable the performance of rich interdisciplinary work. This lays the foundation for the emancipation of the second form of silo which are the silos of knowledge, both traditional and born digital, held in individual institutions, such as galleries, libraries, archives and museums. Disciplinary silo breaking is the key to unlocking these institutional knowledge silos. Interdisciplinary teams, such as developers and librarians, work together to make the data accessible as open data on the “semantic web”. Description logic is the area of mathematics which underpins many ontology building applications today. Creating these ontologies requires a human–machine symbiosis. Currently in the cultural heritage domain, the institutions’ role is that of provider of this  open data to the national aggregator which in turn can make the data available to the trans-European aggregator known as Europeana. Current ingests to the aggregators are in the form of machine readable cataloguing metadata which is limited in the richness it provides to disparate object descriptions. METS can provide this richness.","",""

However, little attention has been given to evolutionary aspects of the phenomenon of digitalization. Thus, in this paper, we aim to contribute by focusing on the concept of digitalization in a structured manner and answering the following question: How has the concept of digitalization travelled throughout academic discourse? To focus on digitalization as a scholarly object, we utilized bibliometric analyses of research articles ranging across 10 decades. We produced bibliographic maps of keywords and co-citation networks of sources and performed visual cluster analysis of these maps using techniques from VOSviewer and ScientoPy bibliometric software. This operation was conducted to facilitate discussion on the evolution of digitalization from a semi-genealogical perspective and to open up a discussion on continuity, density, convergence, and digitalization as a signifier. By combining bibliometric data with genealogical analysis, we identified how digitalization has traveled from specific contexts (medical use and information conversion) to a more general use after the turn of the millennium. Moreover, a pattern of convergence during the last decade surfaced, where digitalization has become associated with ideas of a digitally transformed society. Through these findings, this paper contributes to current literature on digitalization with a novel analysis of the term’s evolution.","",""
"2023","Discovering the local in national cultural heritage collections. How web maps can help the UK public engage with their ‘own places’","ABSTRACT Identity is a critical influence on the public’s engagement with cultural heritage. This article emphasises the role of geographical scale in this relationship examining how the presentation of local heritage can foster meaningful engagement with collections. The geographical information embedded in digital collections – such as where objects were made or the locations they depict and describe – can help varied audiences to discover digital heritage records that are significant to them. Yet the interactive web maps used by cultural heritage organisations have not presented the breadth of collections effectively. Audience research conducted by the Locating a National Collection project offered insights into how the presentation of local heritage using web maps can broaden engagement. A survey explored the values, motivations and identities of the UK public in relation to geography and web technologies. ‘Pretotypes’ or sketches of interfaces prompted focus groups to offer insights into interface design and the suitability of collections. The public were not only interested in heritage connected to the area where they reside but also a range of familiar locations drawn from memory, genealogy and community, termed their ‘own places’. Only particular collections offer geographical information of suitable quality and distribution to support engagement with familiar locations at a local scale. This user-centred approach can help organisations to design web maps that help audiences discover the parts of collections they find meaningful. The article offers the first step in a pathway to achieving social impact such as community building through digital collections.","",""

In this study, a mobile AR system for ICH education was developed to understand user acceptance of digital technology. This study developed a conceptual model and hypotheses based on cultural awareness, generic learning outcomes (GLOs), and the technology acceptance model, aiming to construct an appropriate digital learning model for ICH. The results of the study indicated that the reliability and validity of the measurement model were satisfactory. In addition, the importance of external variables was confirmed. Cultural awareness and GLOs affected users’ perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. In addition, perceived usefulness and ease of use had a positive effect on attitudes toward the use, which in turn had a positive effect on behavioural intention to use.","",""
"2024","Accessing Software: Emulation in Information Institutions","ABSTRACT:This article presents a study of preservationists implementing emulation workflows in three information institutions that collect and provide access to software: an academic research library, a university technology lab and archive, and a museum of technology. Drawing on participant observation and interviews (N = 25), I present a theory of emulation for preservation based on visions of accessing software, building a vocabulary to represent the temporality and durability of software as both an object and experience. The findings reveal issues preservationists now face in representing multiple temporalities when emulating software and software-dependent resources. These findings contribute to social studies of information institutions where emulation workflows are being planned and implemented as part of providing access to evidence and knowledge. The article also contributes to the study of the invisible technicians and information professionals who maintain computational infrastructure for long-term digital preservation.","",""
"2024","Indigenous Digital Projects: An Assessment Framework","ABSTRACT:What are the critical characteristics that we can use to assess Indigenous digital projects? We have examined the literature, developed an assessment framework, and used the framework to analyze twenty-one online platforms in order to answer this question. Our framework identifies five characteristics of Indigenous digital projects with accompanying evaluative questions: (1) traditional knowledge protection, (2) design and interaction, (3) description and classification, (4) community relationships, and (5) sustainability. Our analysis shows the range of work being done in this complex area of digital practice. Our goal is to offer a set of questions that encourage critical reflection, not a one-size-fits-all requirement checklist for those working on digital projects in cultural heritage institutions.","",""

Headquartered in San Francisco, the museum experimented with the rise of new digital technologies and evolved into a virtual museum with global outreach. Through innovative online approaches, they actively engaged communities around the world and gathered perspectives from a wide spectrum of visitors, whose voices were included in the exhibition narratives. In order to safeguard the museum’s legacy and its groundbreaking digital exhibitions, The Feminist Institute in New York launched a digital preservation initiative, working closely with the Global Fund for Women, a non-profit foundation that merged with the International Museum of Women in 2014. On July 31, 2023, we conducted an interview with Marie Williams Chant, Director of Archives and Special Projects, to delve into the museum’s historical significance. We also discussed their archival strategies and procedures, along with its potential impact on the museum’s legacies.","",""
"2024","Digital Pierrot Museum from Pristina to the Moon: an interview with Willred Dallto","Abstract In this interview with Willred Dallto, recorded on April 2nd 2023, the founder of the Digital Pierrot Museum explores how artists can create autonomous spaces in a context of fragile crossborder contemporary art scenes in the Balkans. The Digital Pierrot Museum first began in 2018 with a physical exhibition in the Termokiss social centre in Pristina. Inspired by the poems of symbolist Belgian poet Albert Giraud, 50 digital illustrations were exhibited with the respective poems in French translated to English and Albanian, accompanied by music performances and film screenings. The planned transfer of the exhibition from Pristina (Kosovo) to Tirana (Albania) proved to be complex. The lack of a contemporary art scene and museums in Tirana fostered misconceptions about contemporary and digital art, all occurring in an aggravated context of the COVID 19 pandemic. Acting as curator, Dallto decided to digitalize the museum. Experienced in Microsoft Encarta virtual tours, it was logical to take the leap towards the digital space. Rather than being purely an online tool, the museum seeks to empower the visitors to have their own individual experience by exploring the virtual building freely. Relying on Unity Gameplay, the museum enables the visitor to navigate and interact with the surroundings. It seeks two objectives: “educating youth regarding art, multimedia and culture, while showing adults and parents the educative sides of video games”. This “unfinished museum” constantly receives new contributions and provides an open and living space for all artists in the Balkans.","",""
"2024","Quantifying Relevance in Art Exhibition Systems at the Turn of the Twentieth Century: A Case Study of a Cultural Network Approach","This paper presents a digital humanities framework for the study of the art exhibition phenomena in Europe in the late nineteenth and first half of the twentieth centuries, which deploys a mixed-methods approach based upon the concept of relevance. This matter is examined from the perspective of art history, previous contributions are discussed, and the rationale for the proposed framework is specified. After modelling the exhibition phenomenon as a cultural network, the calculation of a relevance index is developed and the defined attributes, values, and weights used in this method are thoroughly described. Finally, this conceptualization is tested on a case study of a dataset that comprises 2,845 solo exhibitions held in Barcelona (Spain) and surrounding municipalities between 1890 and 1938, setting grounds for improvement through future iterative work. Cet article présente un cadre en humanités numériques pour l'étude du phénomène des expositions d'art en Europe à la fin du XIXe siècle et pendant la première moitié du XXe siècle, qui utilise une approche mixte fondée sur le concept de pertinence. Cette question est examinée du point de vue de l'histoire de l'art, les contributions précédentes sont discutées, et la justification du cadre proposé est précisée. Après avoir modélisé le phénomène des expositions comme un réseau culturel, le calcul d'un indice de pertinence est développé, et les attributs, valeurs et poids définis dans cette méthode sont décrits en détail. Enfin, cette conceptualisation est testée sur une étude de cas d'un ensemble de données comprenant 2 845 expositions individuelles organisées à Barcelone (Espagne) et dans les municipalités environnantes entre 1890 et 1938, jetant les bases d'améliorations grâce à des travaux itératifs futurs.","",""
"2024","Snails, time, data: On the politics of mass-digitization and the possibility of data drift"," In natural history museums around the globe, museum staff are working on making collections of specimens (such as insects on pins, snail shells, dried plants, mounted birds) digitally available through online databases en masse. The mass-digitization of specimens is urgent especially now, so museum actors and biodiversity scientists stress, as natural history collections could provide the biodiversity sciences with crucial data for research into the effects of climate-change induced biodiversity loss. This paper investigates the processes and practices through which these biodiversity data are produced. It argues that the work of data production requires the negotiation of- and grappling with different temporalities, and that attending to these temporalities contributes to a further understanding of the politics of mass-digitization. Building on ethnographic fieldwork in the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin's collection of snail shells, the paper brings into view the work required to make snail specimens and their metadata digital. Following steps in a mollusk digitization workflow—meant to streamline and scale up digitization processes—it attends to the misalignment of rhythms; the importance of informal cleaning labor; the negotiation of social, biological, and colonial temporalities in practices of label transcription; and the anticipatory and expansive logics of mass-digitization. Drawing on snails’ ability to “drift,” it raises data drift as a way of engaging with natural history collections and their data. ","",""
"2024","Heritage values, digital storytelling, and heritage communication: the exploration of cultural heritage sites in virtual environments","ABSTRACT Cultural heritage communication (CHCom) refers to the transfer of values that underlie heritage attributes and settings to intended audiences. Emerging digital storytelling approaches combined with advanced technologies can advance the dissemination and interpretation of information on heritage sites, particularly the intangible values essential to conveying the multifaceted complexity of sites in virtual environments. However, the holistic integration of layered heritage values into digital storytelling in heritage experience design for virtual environments remains underexplored. The present study therefore examined value-based digital storytelling as an effective CHCom method and the improvement of visitors’ recognition and contextualization of heritage values. To this end, the research addressed the communication of the diverse sociocultural significance of Seonamsa Temple of Korea as the venue of interest. The findings suggest that value-based digital storytelling helps reveal interconnected sociocultural values beyond built environments and supports the formulation of strategies for deepening visitors’ heritage interpretation.","",""
