"2000","Neither Male or Female","       Very large numbers of people habitually spend time interacting in online social spaces based on the software developed by Pavel Curtis for Lambda MOO. Although chatting is part of the functionality of these spaces, it is much richer than the functionality given by basic chat rooms. In particular, members of these spaces explicitly declare a gender within the space (I will call it their 'presenting gender'), which may or may not correspond with their offline gender. As well as the traditional options of """"male"""" and """"female"""", it is possible to choose presenting genders such as """"neutral"""", """"royal"""", or """"witch"""". Around 35% of the members of Media MOO and 22% of Lambda MOO have a presenting gender that is neither """"male"""" nor """"female"""" (Danet).       I surveyed active citizens of another such space, Little Italy, by examining 400 characters that had accessed the space during the preceding month. Of these, 72 (18%) had a presenting gender other than """"male"""", """"female"""", and the default, """"neutral"""" (assigned to Little Italians who haven't yet chosen a presenting gender). 11% had default presenting gender. I found that those who had a presenting gender 'other' than """"male"""", """"female"""", or the default were more likely to still be active in Little Italy a year later. This result holds at the 80% significance level -- in other words, there is a less than 1 in 5 probability that the difference observed could have arisen by chance if the distributions were in reality identical. In fact, 'other'-gendered active citizens were 23% more likely than """"male"""" and 32% more likely than """"female"""" active citizens to be still active a year later. This suggests that 'other'-gendered chat may be more a pleasant (or addictive) activity than male- or female-gendered chat. Amazingly, 49% of the 'other'-gendered citizens sampled were still active a year later.        This intrigued me, so I sent a message to currently active Little Italians with presenting genders other than male or female, asking them why they had chosen such a presenting gender. I had 28 responses. Quotations from the responses below are by permission, and translated from the Italian.       A popular idea amongst gender theorists (e.g. Stone) is that choosing a presenting gender other than """"male"""" and """"female"""" is a strategy for people who don't feel they fit precisely into gender stereotypes. This may include most of us to some degree. As the Kinks sang, """"girls will be boys and boys will be girls, it's a mixed-up, muddled-up, shook-up world, except for Lola"""" -- where Lola has ambiguous presenting gender, and thus is the only non-mixed-up one. This is indeed the reason given by one respondent for choosing a presenting gender other than male or female: """"despite being a man, I feel very feminine (since I was small I've always wanted to be a woman)"""". However, no other respondents gave this as their reason.       Another idea from the literature is that of """"gender masking"""" (Jaffe et al. 11-2, and table 1). According to this theory, people, especially women, hide their gender online in order to avoid discrimination and harassment, or gender-related assumptions. Indeed, one respondent described his/her 'masked' character as """"a mind without sex or body, an entity without appearance, as insubstantial as a cloud of smoke"""". On the other hand, the majority of other-gendered Little Italians give some clue that they are either male or female in their character descriptions, and most give some clue when speaking socially within Little Italy. Italian is an inflected language, and has many constructions that reveal whether the speaker is male or female -- it is rare (although not unknown) for a Little Italian to avoid these constructions or to use them ambiguously, as might be expected by someone masking their gender.       To consider another idea, Bruckman (also Reid ch. 3 iii) suggests that the online world can be an """"identity workshop"""" (1), where people can emphasise particular aspects of their personality, or try out new personae, or experience what it is like to be someone completely different. Some Little Italians emphasise part of their real identity through their presenting gender, choosing for example to have a gender such as """"rebel"""", """"dutch"""", or """"angel"""". One respondent suggested, """"I chose 'angel' because I help everyone who asks me -- and some who don't ask -- let's say I like being a guardian angel ;) and because my name is Michelangelo"""". Other Little Italians choose 'other' presenting genders precisely because these genders do not have an offline equivalent. Their choice is a form of creativity or escapism. One such respondent asked, """"if everything is just like reality, what's the point of logging on?"""" This creative aspect becomes clear in the more outr√© genders invented by Little Italians, such as """"\V/amp!"""" for a vampire character, which includes a visual reference to Dracula's high collar, and """"...nothing like the sun"""" (the ellipsis is part of the gender).       One surprise was that several citizens became 'other'-gendered by accident! Offline it is difficult to have a sex-change without realising, but online a badly-designed interface can have this effect. 3% of the sample had gender """"me"""", which is a side-effect of a particular mistake in the use of the space.       Another surprise was the joke gender. If you ask the system for information about a Little Italy character, one line of the answer is of the form """"Sex: &lt;the character's presenting gender&gt;"""". Around 2% of the sample had presenting genders such as """"If only!"""", """"Too much!!"""", and """"Go ahead!!"""". Several other citizens told me their genders were references to in-jokes amongst their online friends.      Some characters had an 'other' gender because the character portrayed was not a human being -- such as a duck with presenting gender """"duck"""", and a character called Harley with presenting gender """"H-D"""". Looking at the 'other' genders in the sample, I was struck by the diversity both of the genders themselves, and of the reasons for which they are chosen. There is no single motive valid for most 'other'-gendered citizens.              I was also struck by their lightheartedness. Gender studies texts tend to treat the choice of presenting gender as something highly serious and important. Several writers deal with gender as performance (Butler interviewed by Osborne and Segal, 109-26) or masquerade (Danet) with playful and ironic characteristics (Haraway 149-81). These writers, however, tend to emphasise a serious purpose underlying the performance. Haraway talks of """"serious play"""" (149) and Butler is interested in performing gender as a subversive practice that aims to undermine the dominant forms of gender. Little Italy shows that in online spaces this need not be the case. The Little Italian with presenting gender """"duck"""" does not think of herself as a duck, she is not critiquing female stereotypes, she is not questioning the idea of femaleness, she is not hiding her offline gender to avoid harassment, she is not asserting her inner duckiness; she's just having a bit of fun. Little Italy is more of an identity playground than an identity workshop.       The creation of 'other' presenting genders in Little Italy is an example of the unexpectedly creative use of public space by members (in this case the space after Sex: in the character information) that was not originally designed with this use in mind. It is perhaps even more fascinating than other examples of folk art in unexpected places, such as graffiti, crop circles, bumper stickers or carved spoon handles, because of the clarity of its relationship with the artists' (lighthearted) construction of their identities.       'Stickiness' -- the likelihood of visitors to continue visiting a Website over an extended period of time -- is a quality much sought after by e-companies. Little Italy is very 'sticky' for all its citizens, but exceptionally so for other-gendered ones. In my opinion, it is the personal creative investment of the other-gendered citizens in Little Italy that makes them especially likely to remain active citizens. 'Other' presenting genders are possible in Little Italy because Pavel Curtis's software does not limit the options to male and female. This research suggests that designers and administrators of commercial Websites who want stickiness should avoid making assumptions about how their visitors may wish to present and express themselves. Rather, they should try to leave spaces open for their visitors' creativity. Many commercial Websites try to control and limit visitors' interaction, using forms and limited-choice menus. But if I am right about the stickiness of personal creative investment, then this may be a mistake. Creative empowerment of visitors may be better for the bottom line.

"2000","Out and About on Japan's Gay Net"," This paper looks at the development of media aimed at same- sex desiring men in Japan. The development of 'gay' magazines in the early 1970s is outlined, although terms such as 'gay' and 'homosexual' which were produced in a Western context are shown to have undergone a shift of meaning when imported to Japan. Many of the functions of these Japanese gay magazines are shown to have been taken over by gay sites on the internet. The variety of gay material on the internet is described, and, using interview information derived from Japanese gay men over the internet, the different ways in which these men use the internet is discussed. Finally, the role the internet is playing in the process of 'global queering' in which a variety of western discourses about homosexuality confront and interact with non-western indigenous constructions is questioned.

"2000","A ROM of One's Own or a Home for Sharing?"," In the last few years, new multimedia products have been designed in order to attract female users. Some of these products even reflect some kind of feminist programme to make girls and young women more interested and better qualified to exploit new information and communication technologies. The article analyses two Norwegian examples of such initiatives, a CD-ROM called JenteROM and a webservice called HjemmeNett, based on interviews with the most prominent actors of the respective design constituencies. The analysis focuses on the ways gender is constructed in multimedia form and content, in order to explicate gender as a process of social learning. What is observed is a set of ongoing transformations of gender as well as computers, related to controversies about proper definitions of gender and femininity as well as about how new media content and form should be designed in order to cater to women's interests.

"2002","Conflicting Concepts of Self and The Michigan Womyn's Music Festival","                 In 1991 the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival evicted two female identified transsexual attendees on the grounds that they violated its women only policy of admittance. The Festival, established in 1976 and now the largest of its kind, turned into a """"microcosm of the conflicts that have plagued the women's movement"""" (Rubin 18) and revived widespread debate about the place of trans and non-standard gender performances in feminist activism. A pro-trans event, aptly named Camp Trans, was held outside the Festival's gates with the aim of inciting greater interest in the area. The Festival's founder and on going organiser, Lisa Vogel, responded with a statement in 2001 claiming the """"intention is for the Festival to be for womyn-born womyn, meaning people who were born and have lived their entire life experience as female"""" (Vogel 2000). This resulted in the exclusion of not only trans individuals, but also a plethora of non-conventional gender identities. Bitter debate ensued, revealing the Festival's role not just in appealing to a defined, recognisable demographic, but in constructing and maintaining an entire category of identity.          My initial encounters with the Festival occurred through independent media and the internet. It become particularly widely debated after artists from the Queer orientated Mr Lady record label (most famously Le Tigre, fronted by riot grrl icon Kathleen Hanna) confirmed that they would perform at the event, despite knowledge of the anti-trans policy. Perhaps the most poignant reflection came from Ciara Xyerra's 2001 zine A Renegade's Handbook To Love And Sabotage. She comments that the Festival's intent was to provide """"not only just a 'safe space' for women, but specifically for 'womyn born womyn.'""""                     [‚Ä¶] this essentialist logic is [‚Ä¶] flawed in that it assumes every """"womyn born womyn"""" was socialized in exactly the same way, that differences regarding race, class, ability, personal history, have no bearing on how a woman perceives herself as a woman [‚Ä¶](69).                  Certainly the revised womyn born womyn label is a problematic way of dealing with the situation. The standard woman is assumed not to encounter trans issues, at least not in a way that impacts on her sense of gendered self.          This issue provokes comparisons to the race debates that wreaked havoc through US feminism in early eighties. The sentiments of the Camp Trans protest echo Audre Lorde's 1984 criticism that:                     As white women ignore their built-in privilege of whiteness and define women in terms of their experience alone, then women of Color become 'other', the outsider whose experience is too alien to comprehend (632).                  In retrospect what remains most striking about the race debates is how incredibly poorly they were handled. The period is marked by a tendency towards splinter and separatist groups, evident in the writing of people like bell hooks and Mary Daly. Communication between various factions collapsed amid accusations of racism and ignorance of the wider struggle, leaving ruptures still visible today. (Gubar 884-890)          The emphasis has shifted from presumed racial background to presumed biological characteristics, but at its core this is the same argument about which performances of self are given legitimacy, and which are passed off as outside the interests of the feminist community. Indeed the Festival's anti-trans policy can also be traced back to the early 1980's, stemming from clashes between separatists and post-operative transsexuals entering feminist activism.          In both instances there has been an assumption that the majority of members within the community experience the world from a common perspective, a collective sense of self at the core of the movement, outlining its wider agenda. I am reminded of Gayatri Spivak's comment that """"We take the explanations we produce to be the grounds of our action; they are endowed with coherence in terms of our explanation of self"""" (In Other Worlds 104). Conflict arises when internal factions find their concerns being overlooked, and begin questioning exactly whose experience is taken as the model for the collective self. There is a tendency towards viewing this as a threat to the movement's solidarity. In an effort to maintain wider group cohesion, divergent voices are often dealt with by claiming they arise from entirely different strains of selfhood. New identities, or at the least hyphenated subcategories, proliferate under """"the essentialist's claim that there must be an ultimate (that is, comprehensive), complete, consistent, coherent set of types"""" (Spinosa and Dreyfus 72). These redefinitions explain and dispel difference without actually addressing it.          It would be naive to assume this sort of essentialism exists only for the Festival and older activist methodology. While Queer theory has certainly given us new tools for understanding the issues, its practical application does not necessarily avoid """"knitting out more fashionably an otherwise reconstructed [‚Ä¶] essentialism"""" (Jagose). As people like Martha Nussbaum and Benita Parry have argued, if somewhat problematically, there is a fine line between fluidity and dissolution. Activist and liberal scepticism towards deconstructive methodology contains an at least reasonably justified trepidation towards tinkering with political communities which have proved historically successful. The unfortunate revival of the 'old school' activism versus 'new school' theory attitude, itself founded on an essentialist belief in a single, correct ideological stance, has further complicated matters.          Festival attendee Janel Smith, writing for one of the bastions of 'old school' activism, Off Our Backs, voiced activist scepticism when commenting that post structuralism is """"an entire movement and theory [‚Ä¶] designed to debunk these 'myths' about gender and racial identity."""" She continues:                     We often make sense of other people by categorizing them into labels and boxes that we ourselves feel comfortable with. Dominant discourse tends to dismiss this process as inherently negative, one that limits people and their understanding of self and projected identity (17).                  The criticism of dominant academic discourse is worth consideration. If it """"is not possible for us to describe our own archive, since it is from within these rules that we speak"""" (Foucault 130), we need to be acutely aware of the way we act within culture, and wary of any movement which claims to fully recognise and transcend its boundaries. Our treatment of identity needs to """"avoid the mistake of slipping between 'no absolute truth' and 'absolutely no truth,'"""" as Felicity Newman, Tracey Summerfield and Reece Plunkett suggest.          From the alternate perspective, Aviva Rubin argues """"our activism is characterized by seemingly incompatible inclinations to generalize and to particularize"""" (17). She writes that the Festival's attempt to develop a """"theoretical 'she'"""" with which we """"identify sameness ‚Äì she shares our politics, our goals, our place"""" is fundamentally flawed as """"the notion collapses when confronted with the differences we've deliberately ignored"""" (8).          This leaves the situation double bound. A standard sense of gendered self provides unity and a workable common agenda, but comes into conflict with the identities it has excluded from its definition. The unified self combats repression, but, as Judith Butler so aptly puts it, """"exclusion operates prior to repression"""" (71). However there are certainly areas of common ground. Rubin's """"plea for grey"""", or an area """"between absolutes,"""" (20) is remarkably similar to Smith's endeavour to exist """"somewhere in-between butch and femme"""" (14). Yet, for the Festival, that difference was enough to cause a gap between those who found it """"an atmosphere of unparalleled safety"""" (Smith 13) and the pro-trans attendees who felt they needed """"an escort to get out safely after darkness fell"""" (Wilchins 2000). As these relative similarities exist, it is disappointing to see that the arising differences have met with such aggressively negative reactions. Given the unlikeliness of everyone agreeing on a definitive understanding in the near future, it would seem beneficial to shift the focus away from searches for correct identities and ideologies, and develop new approaches to the debates themselves.          I am again reminded of a comment from Gayatri Spivak, this time from her 1992 essay """"More on Power/Knowledge"""". She comments that """"if the lines of making sense of something are laid down in a certain way, then you are able to do only those things with that something which are possible within and by arrangement of those lines"""" (151). This is as true for our concepts of self as it is for any other issue. If we cannot reach outside of the structures of culture to find more universally true categories, or expect an ideological stance to present entirely new and more correct understandings, how we handle the arising debate is of major importance. Homi Bhabha's comment that """"our political references and priorities [‚Ä¶] are not there in some primordial, naturalistic sense"""" (26) does not necessarily render them null and void. There is a difference between needing to debate an identity or ideology, and needing to discard or reinvent it. Instead of looking for a true model of self or a correct ideology, the problem becomes looking at the cultural structure we have, trying to """"recognise it as best one can and, through one's necessarily inadequate interpretation, to work to change it"""" (Spivak 1988 120).          From this perspective the conflict that emerges from the Festival is as important as the possibilities for final resolution. Rather than treating differences as immediate problems and being """"shocked, disappointed and instantly sidetracked into seeking resolution"""" (Rubin 20), it seems possible to consider the debate important in its own right. In practice this would mean keeping the lines of communication between the various factions open, and treating debate as an integral and on going process, rather than an unwelcome confrontation to be settled as quickly and quietly as possible.          The commitment of the Camp Trans protesters to """"workshops to educate festival goers"""" (Wilchins 2000), and their modest success, indicates that maintaining ongoing debate is a workable and productive approach. On the other hand Vogel's unwillingness to talk to the Camp Trans group is perhaps as open to criticism as her definitions of gender identity. Surely if a definitive concept of self cannot be settled upon easily, the lines of communication between Camp Trans and the Festival can at least be expected to keep the search from stagnating.          The role the Festival has served as """"a locus of political and cultural debate"""" (Delany) combined with its relatively successful negotiations of class and race issues indicates that it can play this role successfully. Although the womyn born womyn policy might not have changed, it is difficult to imagine many other platforms on which trans related debates could occur on such a large scale. In light of this it does not seem unrealistic to think of the debate as beneficial in ensuring continued rethinking of the issues, and not just as part of some potential revision or creation of identities which will hopefully be completed some time in the future.

"2002","‚ÄòStreaming Physical Love‚Äô","                           I first met with the enigmatic Dutch artist-couple, Zoot and Genant, in the Summer of 2000. We talked about their performances as part of the collective Artporn and their later work as a duo. Zoot and Genant combine the best of Amsterdam hippie culture with advanced technological networking. As good Dutch citizens, they intervene in global media debates with bodily performances and a harsh critique of consumerist sex industries. A uniquely burlesque quality pervades their work, as their performances take on dreamy and raw forms. Performance modes are invented ‚Äòfrom the bottom up‚Äô with performances such as Oysterbarpiece (1995) and Anal Restaurant (1996) translating clever concepts into physically bawdy gestures.            In Anal Restaurant, a naked performer is tied to a platform, his/her bottom stuffed with mashed potatoes, and the mixture released into the gallery when the fastly rotating platform is abruptly brought to a halt. In Oysterbarpiece, Genant asks participants to suck oysters from between her legs. She stands on her head with legs wide open and ‚Äògazes back‚Äô at the participant by taking his/her picture with a camera. By assuming this position, she wants to make audiences aware of their voyeuristic role by ‚Äòreversing their gaze‚Äô, as she argues that every voyeur is a sexual being to somebody‚Äôs else‚Äôs gazing eye. Reversing the gaze means opening up new and uncensored spaces of eroticism ‚Äì as they write in the Irotic Manifesto: ‚ÄúThe historically situated gaze is turned upside down and no longer do we stare into a void. We create many more spaces than are actually allowed ‚Ä¶ You may enter space with a certain literary baggage, the handcuffs of Sacher-Masoch welded to the wonders of Rabelais‚Äù (Artporn).            Theories of erotic space are tested in community spaces where special attention is paid to the strong grip of commodified sex regimes on the audience. Zoot and Genant circulate their own sexual energy as ‚Äòart‚Äô, distributing it to audiences who react sometimes with their own heightened energy and sometimes half-paralyzed. Zoot explains that the difference between live performances and mediated performances is enormous, as live performances are short-lived and cannot conceal the performer‚Äôs body or his/her state of excitement.            They opted for an extended internet performance with Fucking Retreat 8x8x72. For this, they held an‚Äòartist retreat‚Äô in the Amsterdam Gallery De Praktijk and demonstrated their sexual intercourse by means of a webcam. Going back to a Taoist ritual, they fucked eight times a day for eight days in a row, with 72 thrusts on each particular occasion and an attempt not to reach orgasm. With this extremely popular web action, they reached a high/height in media activism, as the loving couple became the medium itself, and they were able to manipulate cameras and stream their digital images to hordes of sexually conditioned net viewers. Philosopher Cees Maris signals the performance as ‚Äòpost-revolutionary‚Äô as the couple represent the integration of both monogamy and polymorphous perversity in contemporary society.            Libidot: Did you want to hold a ‚Äòsexual think-tank‚Äô with Fucking Retreat 8x8x72 and distribute it as free porn on the Internet?            Genant: 8x8x72 was an abstraction-exercise in making love within our relationship. It was a performance where we were sealed inside a gallery and used a webcam to enable viewers to participate in the concept of the experiment. But we never intended to distribute ‚Äòpornographic‚Äô images. For many years we have separated the realm of pleasure from that of pornography. We wanted people to participate in the abstract experiment itself, the result of which only we, as performers, could feel in our bodies.            Zoot: What we did was an everyday action ‚Äì fucking ‚Äì stretched out over a manipulated time-line. As performers it was a challenge to play with the time-line and make it more complex because, on the actual stage, the interaction with the audience is short-lived and intense. It was a very complex experience for me, to engage in such an extremely intimate action in front of a webcam, making love to Genant. A maximum viewing public was created by the computer and cameras, which were also acting as a filter between ourselves and the audience. This filter gave us the possibility of reaching a high level of intimacy and softness, together with lots of laughter ‚Äì just the way we ourselves are. But it took a while before we figured that out. Once we loosened up and incorporated the technology of ‚Äòstreaming‚Äô into the performance, I became aware of the relationship with the public and all the machine-buttons we could manipulate. That is very different from reality television or commercial porn sites, where the machines are owned and steered by a company. The entire complex of autonomous media activism made a big impression on me. We actually accomplished one of our long-time artistic goals, that is, to become the medium itself and to be completely autonomous.            Genet: The technological distribution of ‚Äòlive‚Äô events has become essential after 9/11. We used machinery welded to physical effort to offer the viewer many options, including going through our web archives. It is momentarily frightening to perform such actions, to do actions in front of a camera using autonomous media.            Libidot: You are wary of the Internet‚Äôs sexual energy, as you write in your announcement: ‚ÄúZoot and Genant laugh at those who are excessively sexualized by Internet, they hover above the hypererotic nausea of gazing eyes and digital drifters, performing cyber-squatting amidst digital slavery of cybersexual commodification‚Äù. How did your own sexual energy transfer to remote viewers?            Zoot: In the first instance the performance was food for the average voyeuristic web user, as the strength of his/her unconscious pornographic desire was nurtured by recognizable movements. Sex is, indeed, the lubricant of the Internet. But the images we delivered to the Internet were of a different nature and, hopefully, caused a mutation in the subconscious pornographic gaze of the viewer.            Lots of pleasing reactions resonated in the city. I believe that people started experimenting themselves. I heard from ‚Äòreal‚Äô men that they found it hard to believe that we fucked 64 times in 8 days. Why are people looking for quantity rather than quality? In order to be really effective one would have to get feedback from all of those people, but it was hard for us to plough through the endless piles of ‚Äòchat-diarrhea‚Äô in the chatroom.            Libidot: Bianca Stigter‚Äôs review in NRC Handelsblad indicates that webcams documenting ‚Äòeverydayness‚Äô have flooded the Internet and that your work is in line with this trend: ‚ÄúTheir webcam is in tune with all the other webcams on the Internet that give access to life here and there, everywhere. In a zoo in Singapore a monkey is eating an apple. Tourists in Times Square are crossing the road. In the Lauriergracht in Amsterdam, two people are fucking‚Äù (Stigter). Would it be possible for your performance to be perceived as part of an expanding webcam ‚Äòamateur porn‚Äô industry?            Genant: We do not want to add anything to the porn industry. Ours was an art experiment, a physical performance around the subject of physical love. I don‚Äôt think that lions in Artis Zoo or whales in Oahu are fucking in a similar series, but our performances do reach similar mass audiences to the Tour de France or American football. Of course we got a big kick when the statistics revealed that we were visited by viewers from 48 countries, including Easter Island. Just the idea that on Easter Island, on the other side of the globe, Rapa Nui in winter time, people were watching a performance in an Amsterdam gallery and chatting with somebody from Japan about the difference between an imagined performance and the actual event: that was a big ‚Äòopening‚Äô for us.            Libidot: How does Taoist ritual affect your actual relationship and your sex life?            Genant: Taoism is about making a commitment to a partner, cutting through random animal attractions and irritations. Artificial seduction rituals fall apart after a couple of days. In our performance, there was no extended foreplay or afterplay, just an abstention of climax. Before the climax dissipated, our bodies recharged with energy and returned to remembering moments of enjoyment, each time a little more quickly. I got an energy charge from top to toe and by the time I wanted to surrender and come completely, my bodily cells had been exposed to a routine pattern. Abstention then is like a coitus interruptus, a spectacular thing to feel from a partner whom you love.            The numbers 8 and 64 are magical. I felt the symbolism of an alchemical wedding as we tuned into the mantra of a fully controlled electronic network. It felt like deafening energy, rather than lust or an act of procreation. The effect of this was very rewarding and, afterwards, we lingered in a state of creative sexual energy for a week. When we arrived home we were free to do whatever we wanted and let the holy juices flow. We realized love was a blessing. We made love day after day and gave energy to each other, as if we were in love for the first time. Sweet monogamic love, we embraced and worshipped her.

"2003","Resistances of Gender","                           Online life is embedded within the complexes, organisations, power ratios, and conceptualisations of offline life. The ambiguities of the interaction between online and offline - the testing and questioning, asking and affirming of their match - make a vital part of their current phenomenology. One factor which seems to exert resistance - some form of implacability - however unexpectedly, is that of gender. Other categories, such as politics and nationality, seem to have similar, but more direct, effects.           Online folklore is quite specific, and the folklore can be academic as analysts are affected by the same forces and experiences as other people. Firstly, it is claimed that gender is unimportant online - that you are free to be yourself, or whomsoever you choose. Mark Poster, who is not alone, claims: """"one may experience directly the opposite gender by assuming it and enacting it in conversations"""" (1997: 223), which seems to confuse a temporary imagining with a long term imposed. Secondly, however, there are the repeated tales that online life is full of cross-gender impersonation and that, as a result, it is full of potential betrayal and disillusionment. Kolko writes:                        The stories of online cross-dressing that abound‚Ä¶ often culminate in narratives of betrayal. In this accumulated body of scholarship, participants talk of how their notions of the world and their selves and others has been destabilized, rocked beyond recognition, until they are left feeling adrift, at sea, that they 'cannot trust anyone,' that 'everything online can be a lie,' that 'no one tells who they really are.' (1997: np).                      These stories seem a little contradictory. If gender is unimportant online, then how come it is such a source of anxiety? Often the anxiety seems concealed under a discourse of futurity, in which attention is given to what life online might become - with contradictions deleted - rather than giving attention to what actually happens or has happened. This move maintains the theory that the Internet is free of the effects of offline life, perhaps in compensation for increasing restrictions and insecurities in offline life. It also keeps the Internet in the realm of science fiction, where it is without history, and is cutting edge by default.           People generally seem sure they can detect the gender of others (Suler 1996). A person might use a lot of emoticons and be female (Witmer &amp; Katzman 1998: 6, 9), they might flame and be male (Baym 1995: 158, Herring 1994), they might not know American pantyhose sizes and be male (irrespective of if they come from a country which uses different sizings - most of the rest of the world - or are a woman who does not wear pantyhose). People read books by academics describing how the sexes use language differently in order to detect these differences - while, at the same time, others read them in order to fake better (Wright 2000). If people select gender neutral pronouns in a MOO, then others will not assume they do not have a gender, they will generally attempt to work it out (Kendall 1996: 217), and some research suggests that if a person refuses to reveal their offline gender then they will be dropped from interactions (O'Brien 1999: 90).           Most of these ways of determining 'real gender', use offline gender clich√©s to make that detection, or to manufacture that production. Thus McRae, after arguing in favour of absolute gender freedom, remarks that if someone plays a woman and wants to """"attract partners as 'female' [they] must craft a description within the realm of what is considered attractive"""" (1996: 250). They are likely to exaggerate conventions of gender (as with plastic surgery). As Kendall writes: """"choosing one gender or another does nothing to change the expectations attached to particular gender identifications"""" (1996: 217). In fact, as people online can ignore the gender of those contradicting their expectations of gender, then those expectations may grow stronger. Categories of gender might strengthen rather than weaken.           A performance which follows rules and conventions in order to convey a message, which to some extent any successful performance must, may not challenge the accepted conceptual order at all. As not all the rules and conventions of performance may be conscious or understood by performers, their performance may unintentionally harden those conventions. This is especially so as in Western online social practice, whatever the complexity of our theory, gender seems to be treated as an 'essential' and equated with an offline body.           Further, gender impersonation appears to happen in specific circumstances, namely on IRC, or MOOs, or in games. It rarely if ever happens on Mailing Lists, where anonymity is rarer (names are often given in addresses, and email often signed with a gendered name), and people try to manifest real authentic identities, rather than play with possible identities. An experimental mailing list I was involved in, in which members, previously known to each other from another list, were anonymous and their gender not specified, was short lived. It did not become a site of play with, or 'beyond', gender.           As well, people seem only disturbed when males are thought to be impersonating females - which indicates a degree of gender specificity itself. I have never seen a list of ways to detect whether a male avatar was female, while the opposite is common. This is not just anxiety from heterosexual males seeking sex partners but, in a famous case, occurred when women found that a supposedly female confidant was male (Van Gelder 1996, Stone 1995: 69-81). So why does this happen?           Answers to such questions must be provisional, but it is probably connected with the role of women, in offline life, in maintaining and marking intimacy and support. We might over-quickly say that, offline (outside of male homosexual groups in which gender may function differently), an intimate relationship usually includes one woman. Emotional or support bonding is female. Male bonding has become almost suspect, particularly if it involves intimacy. We also live in a society with a common discourse about the decline of support through kinship, a rise in single person households, increased insecurity in work, and decline in state support for people in times of stress, at the very time that kinship no longer is able to give support (Castells 1997: 97). The Western generative atom of kinship, intimacy and support, approaches being the heterosexual pair bond.           Wuthnow claimed in 1994 that, faced with these kinds of insecurities, 40% of American adults became members of small groups meeting regularly to provide support for members (1994: 45-50). There is no reason to assume the percentage has declined. Internet groups can be seen to function similarly; they are means by which people make contacts, provide help, discuss problems or interests, and sometimes get work - fibreculture being a case in point. There is often, in such groups, a fairly active 'off-group' life of correspondence and contact between particular members. Structurally, life which is off a mailing list, or in a private MOO room, approaches the structure of the dyadic, private and intimate pair bond, which should contain at least one woman. Finding out that a person you have been intimate with was not female, almost automatically changes the relationship from the realm of intimate and private into a public betrayal. Our private role and its vulnerabilities has broken into the public male domain and symbolically been exposed rather than shared.           Gender functions as a way in which people interpret the actions of others. As Ten Have argues (2000), categorisation is one of the ways in which people decide what kinds of messages others are emitting, whether they have much in common and whether they can be trusted. The importance of particular categories can frequently be ascertained by how often they are requested - and gender is one of the most requested when unknown and when people are seeking support or intimacy. Because authenticity, or trying to find the truth of others, is important in Western thought about relationships, this truth becomes anchored in the 'real' body and the customs surrounding it. 'Truth' is confirmed the more private the information, and the more it is received offline. As a result, and because of models of intimacy, 'real gender' then becomes important and is central to current online life. It may also point to other ways in which the tension between the online and offline manifest, or in which an apparently abstract flow meets resistance.

"2003","Too close to see: men, women, and webcams"," Internet studies researchers should consider how internet spectators are addressed and encouraged to engage. In this article, I offer some basic comments about internet spectatorship and present a detailed analysis of the ways in which spectatorship operates in the women‚Äôs webcam form. Webcam spectators may have less control than they expect because women webcam operators exert authority and achieve agency through their visibility. Feminist considerations of spectatorship and the gaze offer important methods for considering these representations, and suggest how viewing positions are being revised. Spectators are in a position that has been associated with women and is believed to be undesirable because of their nearness to the computer screen. The cultural and technological reconceptualization of spectatorship and the particular aspects of women‚Äôs webcams offer some unique opportunities to intervene in the ways that looking at and categorizing bodies produces gender and sexual difference. ","",""
"2004","The Amateur Pornographer and the Glib Voyeur","                  This article forwards a new way of thinking about pornography, based on the changing work practices of web-based and film/video amateur porn producers and their spectators. Their efforts are not to be confused with individuals who pose for porn sites and simulate sex as glossy ‚Äúamateurs‚Äù ‚Äì bored housewives, horny freshmen, nasty teen virgins, battered Russian migrants, pregnant mommies, crude aunts or rapist uncles, etc. In most types of commercial porn, amateur roles are scripted, filmed and edited by producers who direct and pay models to enter their stage setups and sex scenes.  Different from those are sexually driven media practitioners who make sex scenes to explore personal desires and respond to those of others. They use a variety of recording devices to capture moments, screen scenes privately or in small groups, or upload them on the web through webcams, live journals and web logs. Looking at the website of ‚Äúpornblogger‚Äù Carly, for instance, we can see how the sexual body is revealed through daily online writing modes and feedback from other web users. Moreover, Carly masters the discourses of eroticism and porn theory as overlapping knowledge regimes of sexual representation. In an entry  uploaded on March 26, 2004, she writes about Internet porn debates and the plight of children and parents. Moreover, in the same entry, she shows pictures of her collection of dildos and how she uses them on her anal region.    One could think of Carly‚Äôs body as inhabiting ‚Äúperformance strata‚Äù of porn cultures as they mediate real-life contexts. As explained by performance theorist Jon McKenzie in Perform or Else: From Discipline to Performance, strata are layers of forces and intensities that give form to matter by organizing small molecular entities into aggregations. The performance strata bundle a variety of cultural, organizational and technological performances as discursive and normative working methods. McKenzie explains that the agents of the performance strata harbor new forms of normativity, while they may also recognize cracks, fissures and ‚Äúoutside‚Äù discourses as agents in their force fields (176). The strata are solidified and disrupted by an attentiveness to the active-performative nature of language and bodily gestures, as we develop creativity in our dealings with art and technology, or new attitudes towards social-sexual networking and cultural vitality. Work ethics, the use of technological languages, social and intellectual curiosities, intermingle and intersect to become strata of power and knowledge. Whereas nation-state governments and capitalist porn industries are arguably organized by an older ‚Äúdiscipline or punish‚Äù maxim (as consolidated empires decide to ‚Äúpush-down‚Äù content onto consumers, or punish consumers who access porn in surveilled places), amateur pornography thrives on a different type of exhibitionism and voyeurism. Pornographers and voyeurs communicate with each other and learn how to articulate fluctuating sexual scenarios and pornographic roles.  This new trend towards mutual communication and bonding is currently developed in two types of pornography, in web-based platforms for alternative pornography, where the exchanges can be complex and partly private; and in community theaters where the exchange is raw and carried out in public.    A good example of the first type would be web sites where individuals collaborate in scripting, shooting, and responding to pornographic portraits. www.spread.com (note: no longer available online) is a good example such of such a porn site. The site was set up by Barbara DeGenevieve, Professor at the School of the Art Institute Chicago, in collaboration with Terry Pirtle, the web master and manager of the site. As the announcement read, the site is ‚Äú‚Ä¶ committed to the queer community, to serve a segment of that community that is under-represented in web pornography.‚Äù The ssspread.com site encourages queer and transgender people to submit porn scripts and organize film-shoots to act out scenarios. The outcome of this collaboration process is filmed and still-images are uploaded on the site on a weekly basis. For instance, in the ‚ÄúRoad Side Service‚Äù slide-show, posted on October 30, 2003, Chicago-based singer Nomy Lamm acts out a macho-redneck scenario as a ‚Äúmale trucker‚Äù who receives a blowjob from a ‚Äútransman‚Äù partner, then penetrates the partner anally with a dildo on the hood of the vehicle, only to finally reveal her cock to be in the form of an amputated leg.    De Genevieve explains the collaboration process with participants in an interview:     I usually collaborate with the people that I am filming, and I ask them ahead of time to carefully consider what they want to do in the session. Very often, I just leave the scene up them, or they come up with a scenario that we have discussed beforehand. I will add something to it or ask them to do something slightly different. But, of course, I myself could never come up with the variety of scenarios that they come up with. A lot of people I shoot are young and into punk aesthetics. The environments they live in are definitely not mainstream, and this becomes part of the ambience of a shoot. Yesterday, I shot in a model‚Äôs kitchen. It was a pretty chaotic environment with dishes in the sink, food remnants on the countertops and floors, and stuff all over the place. There was another shoot a couple months ago in a room where I literally couldn‚Äôt see the floor for the clothes, CDs, magazines, over-flowing ashtrays, sex toys, pillows‚Ä¶ But I find these living spaces really fascinating because these are the places where people really have sex. ‚Äù (DeGenevieve, 2002)    www.spread.com also encourages social activities between members. Moreover, the site contains links to pornographic stories in the ‚ÄúStory Lounge‚Äù area. The ‚ÄúArticles and Interviews‚Äù area has interviews with sex scholars and activists such as Shannon Bell and Annie Sprinkle. The members also give feedback to weekly still-images by writing messages on the messageboard.    This is an important development in the history of pornography, as spectators may be increasingly interested in giving feedback to producers to complement their habits of voyeuristic specatorship and masturbation. The model of amateur porn is thus an important challenge for the commercial porn industries, which for the most part construct an imagined audience of quietly masturbating and orgasmic voyeurs. This is the normative impulse in commercial pornography, exemplified in the tendency to show extreme close-ups of human intercourse or sex with underage models. These normative elements are contested by the growing masses of alternative pornographers, who crack the system while marking symbolically varied porn movies and diverse body types as ‚Äúordinary‚Äù.     A parallel development to web-based producers would be amateur pornographers screening their works in community centers or arthouse theaters, where voyeurs once again are invited to watch and share responses. This development has started to gain attention in the US mass media with TV and film critics expressing both revulsion and propulsion towards this trend (Dana 2002). In the Boston area, for instance, Kim Airs and the arthouse theater Coolidge Corner Cinema have started to organize annual screenings of amateur porn movies. The event, entitled You Oughta Be in Pictures, brings together home-made porn movies and low-budget movies made by artists and filmmakers. The appeal of the event lies exactly in the communication between makers and viewers, the untrained screen-performers and filmmakers, whose movies cause exhilarating responses in the audiences. Audiences in this screening are large and loud, at times shouting out their reactions, or laughing at how the filmmakers conceive of sexual positions and camera angles. In some movies, the scenes fail to be explicit or dynamic at all. For example, a female masturbation scene shows a moving hand on a hidden vagina, where the soundtrack consists of quiet and camera-shy moaning. This is amateur porn, a bundle of an ‚Äúordinary‚Äù person‚Äôs sexual efforts and their representation.    As the above example demonstrates, amateur porn does not always cater to arousal or masturbation, but can nevertheless trigger fulfilling reactions in audiences, as screenings give producers an opportunity to interact with spectators and get immersed in changing feedback loops. One man in the audience of the 2002 screening of You Oughta Be in Pictures described his confused reaction: ‚ÄúI have seen pornography before. I‚Äôve seen quite a bit of it. But this was unlike any of those experiences. I am not exactly sure what is different about it. But the response that it generated made me feel asexual‚Äù (Syme 2002). A female respondent emphasized the importance of humor in the implicit communication between the filmmakers and the viewers. She writes: ‚ÄúBut I think it was the humor part that I really enjoyed. It allows you to step back from all the taboo-ness of sex. There is a give and take in the sense that some filmmakers will poke fun at audience response by deliberately putting extreme images on screen, while audience members will at points poke fun at the filmmaker‚Äôs attempt at ‚Äòsexiness‚Äô at certain intervals‚Äù  (Yu, 2002).   Amateur pornographers and their respondents are the everyday agents of mediated sex, exploring acts of media making and porn debates. Amateur pornographers assert their bodies as sexually active entities negotiating power structures through performative modes of awareness within media communities. Amateur pornographers live the era of Internet porn, indie media and globalization, inventing ‚Äúpeer-to-peer‚Äù languages of eroticism and small-scale economies as pockets of sexual health and experimentation.    This is perhaps the long-awaited schooling of pornography, its rapid democratization, its turn to more diversified expressions of sexual-aesthetic lust.  As was reported in a recent New York Times article, more women and queer producers are entering small-scale sex sites and industries, and making attempts to promote better working conditions for sex workers and media art‚Äù (Navarro, 2004). McKenzie predicts that there will be no ‚Äúgood schools‚Äù of performance to replace the ‚Äúbad‚Äú ones. There are only pockets of activism that assert a need to perform and be performed, as communication technologies are rapidly modifying the way we share knowledge and nurture the body.

"2004","The Tumescent Citizen","                  Are male porn stars full-fledged citizens?  Recent political developments make this question more than rhetorical.  The Bush Justice Department, led by Attorney General John Ashcroft, has targeted the porn industry, beginning with its prosecution of Extreme Associates.  More recently, the President requested an increase in the FBI‚Äôs 2005 budget for prosecuting obscenity, one of the few budget increases for the Bureau outside of its anti-terrorism program (Schmitt A1).   To be sure, the concept of ‚Äúcitizen‚Äù is itself vexed.  Citizenship, when obtained or granted, ostensibly legitimates a subject and opens up pathways to privilege: social, political, economic, etc.  Yet all citizens do not seem to be created equal.  ‚ÄúThere is, in the operation of state-defined rules and in common practices an assumption of moral worth in which de facto as opposed to de jure rights of citizenship are defined as open to those who are deserving or who are capable of acting responsibly,‚Äù asserts feminist critic Linda McDowell.  ‚ÄúThe less deserving and the less responsible are defined as unworthy of or unfitted for the privileges of full citizenship‚Äù (150).  Under this rubric, a citizen must measure up to a standard of ‚Äúmoral worth‚Äù‚Äîan individual is not a full-fledged citizen merely on the basis of birth or geographical placement.  As McDowell concludes, ‚Äúcitizenship is not an inclusive but an exclusive concept‚Äù (150).   Thus, in figuring out how male porn stars stand in regard to the question of citizenship, we must ask who determines ‚Äúmoral worth,‚Äù who distinguishes the less from the more deserving, and how people have come to agree on the ‚Äúcommon practices‚Äù of citizenship.  Many critics writing about citizenship, including McDowell, Michael Warner, Lauren Berlant, Russ Castronovo, Robyn Wiegman, Michael Moon, and Cathy Davidson (to name only a few) have located the nexus of ‚Äúmoral worth‚Äù in the body.  In particular, the ability to make the body abstract, invisible, and non-identifiable has been the most desirable quality for a citizen to possess.  White men seem ideally situated for such acts of ‚Äúdecorporealization,‚Äù and the white male body has been installed as the norm for citizenship.  Conversely, women, people of color, and the ill and disabled, groups that are frequently defined by their very embodiment, find themselves more often subject to regulation.   If the white male body is the standard, however, for ‚Äúmoral worth,‚Äù the white male porn star would seem to disrupt such calculations.  Clearly, the profession demands that these men put their bodies very much in evidence, and the most famous porn stars, like John C. Holmes and Ron Jeremy, derive much of their popularity from their bodily excess.  Jeremy‚Äôs struggle for ‚Äúlegitimacy,‚Äù and the tenuous position of men in the porn industry in general, demonstrate that even white males, when they cannot or will not aspire to abstraction and invisibility, will lose the privileges of citizenship.  The right‚Äôs attack on pornography can thus be seen as yet another attempt to regulate and restrict citizenship, an effort that forces Jeremy and the industry that made him famous struggle for strategies of invisibility that will permit some mainstream acceptance.   In American Anatomies, Robyn Wiegman points out that the idea of democratic citizenship rested on a distinct sense of the abstract and non-particular.  The more ‚Äúparticular‚Äù an individual was, however, the less likely s/he could pass into the realm of citizen.  ‚ÄúFor those trapped by the discipline of the particular (women, slaves, the poor),‚Äù Wiegman writes, ‚Äúthe unmarked and universalized particularity of the white masculine prohibited their entrance into the abstraction of personhood that democratic equality supposedly entailed‚Äù (49).  The norm of the ‚Äúwhite masculine‚Äù caused others to signify ‚Äúan incontrovertible difference‚Äù (49), so people who were visibly different (or perceived as visibly different) could be tyrannized over and regulated to ensure the purity of the norm.   Like Wiegman, Lauren Berlant has written extensively about the ways in which the nation recognizes only one ‚Äúofficial‚Äù body: ‚ÄúThe white, male body is the relay to legitimation, but even more than that, the power to suppress that body, to cover its tracks and its traces, is the sign of real authority, according to constitutional fashion‚Äù (113).  Berlant notes that ‚Äúproblem citizens‚Äù‚Äîmost notably women of color‚Äîstruggle with the problem of ‚Äúsurplus embodiment.‚Äù  They cannot easily suppress their bodies, so they are subjected to the regulatory power of a law that defines them and consequently opens their bodies up to violation.  To escape their ‚Äúsurplus embodiment,‚Äù those who can seek abstraction and invisibility because ‚Äúsometimes a person doesn‚Äôt want to seek the dignity of an always-already-violated body, and wants to cast hers off, either for nothingness, or in a trade for some other, better model‚Äù (114).   The question of ‚Äúsurplus embodiment‚Äù certainly has resonance for male porn stars.  Peter Lehman has argued that hardcore pornography relies on images of large penises as signifiers of strength and virility.  ‚ÄúThe genre cannot tolerate a small, unerect penis,‚Äù Lehman asserts, ‚Äúbecause the sight of the organ must convey the symbolic weight of the phallus‚Äù (175).  The ‚Äúpower‚Äù of male porn stars derives from their visibility, from ‚Äúmeat shots‚Äù and ‚Äúmoney shots.‚Äù  Far from being abstract, decorporealized ‚Äúpersons,‚Äù male porn stars are fully embodied.  In fact, the more ‚Äúsurplus embodiment‚Äù they possess, the more famous they become.   Yet the very display that makes white male porn stars famous also seemingly disqualifies them from the ‚Äúlegitimacy‚Äù afforded the white male body.  In the industry itself, male stars are losing authority to the ‚Äúbox-cover girls‚Äù who sell the product.  One‚Äôs ‚Äúsurplus embodiment‚Äù might be a necessity for working in the industry, but, as Susan Faludi notes, ‚Äúby choosing an erection as the proof of male utility, the male performer has hung his usefulness, as porn actor Jonathan Morgan observed, on ‚Äòthe one muscle on our body we can‚Äôt flex‚Äô‚Äù (547).  When that muscle doesn‚Äôt work, a male porn star doesn‚Äôt become an abstraction‚Äîhe becomes ‚Äúother,‚Äù a joke, swept aside and deemed useless.   Documentary filmmaker Scott J. Gill recognizes the tenuousness of the ‚Äúcitizenship‚Äù of male porn stars in his treatment of Ron Jeremy, ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs most famous porn star.‚Äù  The film, Porn Star: The Legend of Ron Jeremy (2001), opens with a clear acknowledgment of Jeremy‚Äôs body, as one voiceover explains how his nickname, ‚Äúthe Hedgehog,‚Äù derives from the fact that Jeremy is ‚Äúsmall, fat, and very hairy.‚Äù  Then, Gill intercuts the comments of various Jeremy fans: ‚ÄúAn idol to an entire generation,‚Äù one young man opines; ‚ÄúOne of the greatest men this country has ever seen,‚Äù suggests another.  This opening scene concludes with an image of Jeremy, smirking and dressed in a warm-up suit with a large dollar sign necklace, standing in front of an American flag (an image repeated at the end of the film).  This opening few minutes posit the Hedgehog as super-citizen, embraced as few Americans are.  ‚ÄúEveryone wants to be Ron Jeremy,‚Äù another young fan proclaims.  ‚ÄúThey want his life.‚Äù   Gill also juxtaposes ‚Äúconstitutional‚Äù forms of legitimacy that seemingly celebrate Jeremy‚Äôs bodily excess with the resultant discrimination that body actually engenders.  In one clip, Jeremy exposes himself to comedian Rodney Dangerfield, who then sardonically comments, ‚ÄúAll men are created equal‚Äîwhat bullshit!‚Äù  Later, Gill employs a clip of a film in which Jeremy is dressed like Ben Franklin while in a voiceover porn director/historian Bill Margold notes that the Freeman decision ‚Äúgave a birth certificate to a bastard industry‚Äîit legitimized us.‚Äù  The juxtaposition thus posits Jeremy as a ‚Äúfounding father‚Äù of sorts, the most recognizable participant in an industry now going mainstream.   Gill, however, emphasizes the double-edged nature of Jeremy‚Äôs fame and the price of his display.  Immediately after the plaudits of the opening sequence, Gill includes clips from various Jeremy talk show appearances in which he is denounced as ‚Äúscum‚Äù and told ‚ÄúYou should go to jail just for all the things that you‚Äôve helped make worse in this country‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou should be shot.‚Äù  Gill also shows a clearly dazed Jeremy in close-up confessing, ‚ÄúI hate myself.  I want to find a knife and slit my wrists.‚Äù  Though Jeremy does not seem serious, this comment comes into better focus as the film unfolds.  Jeremy‚Äôs efforts to go ‚Äúlegit,‚Äù to break into mainstream film and leave his porn life behind, keep going off the tracks.  In the meantime, Jeremy must fulfill his obligations to his current profession, including getting a monthly HIV test.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôll be one good thing about eventually getting out of the porn business,‚Äù he confesses as Gill shows scenes of a clearly nervous Jeremy awaiting results in a clinic waiting room, ‚Äúto be able to stop taking these things every fucking month.‚Äù  Gill shows that the life so many others would love to have requires an abuse of the body that fans never see.  Jeremy is seeking to cast off that life, ‚Äúeither for nothingness, or in a trade for some other, better model.‚Äù  Behind this ‚Äúlegend‚Äù is unseen pain and longing.   Gill emphasizes the dichotomy between Jeremy (illegitimate) and ‚Äúcitizens‚Äù in his own designations.  Adam Rifkin, director of Detroit Rock City, in which Jeremy has a small part, and Troy Duffy, another Jeremy pal, are referred to as ‚Äúmainstream film directors.‚Äù  When Jeremy returns to his home in Queens to visit his father, Arnold Hyatt is designated ‚Äúphysicist.‚Äù  In fact, Jeremy‚Äôs father forbids his son from using the family name in his porn career.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want any confusion between myself and his line of work,‚Äù Hyatt confesses, ‚Äúbecause I‚Äôm retired.‚Äù  Denied his patronym, Jeremy is truly ‚Äúillegitimate.‚Äù  Despite his father‚Äôs understanding and support, Jeremy is on his own in the business he has chosen.   Jeremy‚Äôs reputation also gets in the way of his mainstream dreams.  ‚ÄúSometimes all this fame can hurt you,‚Äù Jeremy himself notes.  Rifkin admits that ‚ÄúPeople recognize Ron as a porn actor and immediately will ask me to remove him from the final cut.‚Äù  Duffy concurs that Jeremy‚Äôs porn career has made him a pariah for some mainstream producers: ‚ÄúStigma attached to him, and that‚Äôs all anybody‚Äôs ever gonna see.‚Äù  Jeremy‚Äôs visibility, the ‚Äústigma‚Äù that people have ‚Äúseen,‚Äù namely, his large penis and fat, hairy body, denies him the abstract personhood he needs to go ‚Äúlegitimate.‚Äù  Thus, whether through the concerted efforts of the Justice Department or the informal, personal angst of a producer fearing a backlash against a film, Jeremy, as a representative of an immoral industry, finds himself subject to regulation.  Indeed, as his ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù filmography indicates, Jeremy has been cut out of more than half the films he has appeared in.   The issue of ‚Äúvisibility‚Äù as the basis for regulation of hardcore pornography has its clearest articulation in Potter Stewart‚Äôs famous proclamation ‚ÄúI know it when I see it.‚Äù  But as Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong report in The Brethren, Stewart was not the only Justice who used visibility as a standard.  Byron White‚Äôs personal definition was ‚Äúno erect penises, no intercourse, no oral or anal sodomy‚Äù (193).  William Brennan, too, had what his clerks called ‚Äúthe limp dick standard‚Äù (194).  Erection, what Lehman has identified as the conveyance of the phallus, now became the point of departure for regulation, transferring, once again, the phallus to the ‚Äúlaw.‚Äù   When such governmental regulation failed First Amendment ratification, other forms of societal regulation kicked in.  The porn industry has accommodated itself to this regulation, as Faludi observes, in its emphasis on ‚Äúsoft‚Äù versions of product for distribution to ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù outlets like cable and hotels.  ‚ÄúThe version recut for TV would have to be entirely ‚Äòsoft,‚Äô‚Äù Faludi notes, ‚Äúwhich meant, among other things, no erect penises and no semen‚Äù (547).  The work of competent ‚Äúwoodsmen‚Äù like Jeremy now had to be made invisible to pass muster.  Thus, even the penis could be conveyed to the viewer, a ‚Äúfantasy penis,‚Äù as Katherine Frank has called it, that can be made to correlate to that viewer‚Äôs ‚Äúfantasized identity‚Äù of himself (133-4).   At the beginning of Porn Star, during the various homages paid to Jeremy, one fan draws a curious comparison: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs Elvis, and then there‚Äôs Ron.‚Äù  Elvis‚Äôs early career had certainly been plagued by criticism related to his bodily excess.  Musicologist Robert Fink has recently compared Presley‚Äôs July 2, 1956, recording of ‚ÄúHound Dog‚Äù to music for strip tease, suggesting that Elvis used such subtle variations to challenge the law that was constantly impinging on his performances: ‚ÄúThe Gray Lady was sensitive to the presence of quite traditional musical erotics‚Äîformal devices that cued the performer and audience to experience their bodies sexually‚Äîbut not quite hep enough to accept a male performer recycling these musical signifiers of sex back to a female audience‚Äù (99).   Eventually, though, Elvis stopped rebelling and sought respectability.  Writing to President Nixon on December 21, 1970, Presley offered his services to help combat what he perceived to be a growing cultural insurgency.  ‚ÄúThe drug culture, the hippie elements, the SDS, Black Panthers, etc., do not consider me as their enemy or as they call it, The Establishment,‚Äù Presley confided.  ‚ÄúI call it America and I love it‚Äù (Carroll 266).  In short, Elvis wanted to use his icon status to help reinstate law and order, in the process demonstrating his own patriotism, his value and worth as a citizen.   At the end of Porn Star, Jeremy, too, craves legitimacy.  Whereas Elvis appealed to Nixon, Jeremy concludes by appealing to Steven Spielberg.  Elvis received a badge from Nixon designating him as ‚Äúspecial assistant‚Äù for the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.  Presumably Jeremy invests his legitimacy in a SAG card.  Kenny Dollar, a Jeremy friend, unironically summarizes the final step the Hedgehog must take: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for Ron to go on and reach his full potential.  Let him retire his dick.‚Äù  That Jeremy must do the latter before having a chance for the former illustrates how ‚Äúsurplus embodiment‚Äù and ‚Äúcitizenship‚Äù remain inextricably entangled and mutually exclusive.

"2004","Pornographic Pedagogies?: The Risks of Teaching ‚ÄòDirrty‚Äô Popular Cultures","                     Uhh, dirrty Filthy Nasty (too dirrty to clean my act up If you ain‚Äôt dirrty .. you ain‚Äôt here to party)‚ÄîChristina Aguilera ‚ÄúDIRRTY‚Äù        The teacher engaged in a pedagogy which requires some articulation of knowledge forms and pleasures integral to students‚Äô daily life is walking a dangerous road.‚ÄîHenry Giroux and Roger Simon,  ‚ÄúSchooling, Popular Culture and a Pedagogy of Possibility‚Äù     Pornography and pedagogy have been positioned as mutually exclusive domains within educational discourses that seek to regulate the borders between rational knowledge and sexually lewd commercial imagery.   Yet these realms begin to overlap in productive ways when hypersexual popular cultures are integrated as meaningful social texts within the classroom.  As mainstream youth media increasingly play up the appeal of what Brian McNair calls ‚Äúporno-chic‚Äù cultural entertainment, teachers and students of cultural meanings are compelled to take seriously the pervasive power of soft porn influencing everyday desires and identifications.  McNair writes that ‚Äúporno-chic is not porn, then, but the representation of porn in non-pornographic art and culture, the pastiche and parody of, the homage to and investigation of porn; the postmodern transformation of porn into mainstream cultural artifact for a variety of purposes.‚Äù (61) The crossover of porn imagery into commercial advertising and entertainment industries is an extension of a problem that Sut Jhally refers to as the commodity-image system which frames sexy bodies within marketing strategies that encourage fast voyeuristic forms of consumption (252).  Yet complex questions about how youth engage with the intensification of their sexual fields of vision as part of their daily routines watching TV, playing video games, enjoying films and music videos as desiring subjects are often overlooked.    As young people grow up today within porno saturated visual cultures, they need to be given space to talk about their ideas, feelings and contradictory responses.  In this way, bringing porn into university curriculum is a necessary part of a critical and creative pedagogical practice.  I learned about the urgency and difficulty of such a practice when my students brought in Christina Aguilera‚Äôs video Dirrty to a class on consumer cultures and sexual representation.  Out of some wildly disparate and complex readings of this video developed by my students, we were able to explore ideas about body images, censorship, queerness, commodification and fantasy without foreclosing the ambivalence unleashed in the process of studying Dirrty pornographic styles.   In my introductory popular culture classes, I give permission to students to exchange stories about the sexualized pleasures of mediated youth cultures as a way to encourage awareness of the specific icons, textual details and patterns of representation that make up our viewing and listening experiences.  I use this as a take off point to consider how our popular conceptions of sexuality are constructed and contested by desiring and relational interpretations connecting hegemonic image fantasies with subjective investments.  Once students start conversing about what they notice and how they see and feel about sexually explicit images shown in class, the contested terrain of popular cultural porn becomes vividly animated.   The point is to demystify the topic of pornographic imagery as something fixed, taboo, banal, asocial, shameful or demeaning.  What students of media cultures do not expect is that their personal pleasures and longings will be socially situated and theorized as a dialogue about the politics of representation.  Student pleasures collide in unexpected ways.  I am always surprised by what appeals to their fantasy ideals, and the reasons they offer to explain why and how they seek out and utilize their desires as viewers.  To spur discussion, I bring in sex texts that range from Hollywood film clips to nightclub fliers to queer photography to internet homepages.  But while I have a rough idea of the conceptual course we will take, we usually end up following alternative paths, negotiating incommensurable psychic and social life-worlds.  What I find troubling, erotic or fascinating might not connect up with what my students notice or experience as seductive or meaningful.   Foregrounding the pleasures of sexual images in teaching popular culture is tricky because they are hard to predict or contain for analysis. Consensus is an impossibility from the start as sexual fears, denial and fantasies disrupt any possibility of rational unity.  Pornography leaks across disciplinary boundaries and blurs conventional distinctions between, private/public, subjective/social, work/play, school/leisure, sexual/intellectual realms of experience. Teaching pornography is risky business.   Turning theoretically back upon the popular fascinations of ‚Äúporno-chic‚Äù images also invites pleasure into the very process of academic learning that has traditionally scorned its worth and relevance. The interactions of teaching and learning become infused with affective longings and frustrations. Questions arise such as: What happens when sexualized pleasure as an experience lived through popular cultures is reenacted in the classroom?  Who is willing to risk exposure and vulnerability? What are the ethical and political limits of interrogating intimate pleasures?  How do I render this intimacy culturally meaningful? When personal pleasures are questioned as part of a public dialogue are they diminished? Intensified? Transformed?   I have spent many years theorizing sexuality and pleasure, trying to find a language that overcomes the one-sided institutional focus and conceptual detachment of ideological critiques without falling prey to empirical approaches that claims to pin down the authentic transparent truth of popular pleasures as fixed and isolated data.  What is needed is a process of reading experience as a social semiotic process capable of attending to textual representations and institutional power formations that organize popular pleasures, without foreclosing the nuances of the erotic subjective and collective engagements with culture that exceed and disturb hegemonic meanings.  Teresa de Lauretis‚Äô writings are useful toward interconnecting subjectivity and social/cultural worlds in terms of dynamic mediations between texts, contexts, psychic memories and sense perceptions. Drawing upon Charle‚Äôs Peirce‚Äôs notion of interpretants, de Lauretis theorizes a semiosis of experience that is actively engaged with and constituted through everyday signs, objects, relations and events.  A cultural sign such as a song or music video becomes mediated through intellectual, emotional and energetic interpretants, to comprise a ‚Äúhabit-change,‚Äù changes in consciousness and concrete action in the social world.  The experiential process here is open-ended and ongoing in its formation and includes rational will and reflection in reading signs along with affective, bodily responses and enactments (1984).  The realm of subjective experience and pleasure does not abstract or diminish the status of cultural texts and meanings but implicates them in a living practice.  De Lauretis uses this approach to think through the exchanges of ‚Äúperverse‚Äù desires that exceed heteronormative sex/gender relations between texts and spectators (1994). Acknowledging the normalization of ‚Äúperverse‚Äù desire enables a more dynamic understanding of the psychic and social movements of fantasy scenarios as a historical process.  I think it‚Äôs impossible to begin to embrace pornographic pleasure as pedagogically productive without such an elaboration of experience as always already appropriating, mediating, and transforming dominant social texts.  At the same time, what has become vividly apparent to me is that translating a theory of the semiosis of experience into practical strategies performed in the classroom is easier said than done.   Nothing complicates and impels thinking about pleasure more than a room filled with dozens of teenage students who are asked to speak openly about their feelings and thoughts about sexy pop music stars and performances ‚Äì especially when the topics and examples are chosen by, for and about students.  During a week of my pop culture class last year, several students giving presentations coincidentally brought in the same video to show and talk about: Christina Aguilera‚Äôs music video for her song Dirrty ‚Äì from the album Stripped.  The video features aggressive erotic scenes of young women taking the lead with young men watching and dancing in a darkly lit underground boxing club, including signs of Hip Hop street culture- graffiti, break dancing, and rap, intermixed with raunchy soft-porn images of women wrestling and showering together.  It is a massive party verging on sexual orgy compelling the audience to join in and get ‚Äúdirty, filthy, nasty, and if you ain‚Äôt dirty you ain‚Äôt here to party.‚Äù  This is an exemplary televised fantasy product designed shock and tease youth audiences with rebellious hip seductive visual forms and contents.   What is important for my purposes is not any single value or meaning of this video but the ways it elicited multiple engagements and interpretations from student presenters and classmates through their experiential pleasures and displeasures.  The first presenter analyzed Dirrty as an example of the corporate commodification of youth sexuality.  &gt;From this perspective the video sells packaged consumable fragments of sexy bodies as imaginary fetish ideals.  Drawing upon feminist analysis of pornography, the student argued that girls‚Äô bodies continue to be objectified in the guise of physical femme dominance, remaining on display for the dreamworlds of adolescent men.   What gets stressed are the ways sexual transgressions within mass media work in the service of maintaining inequalities, idolizing promiscuous feminine aggressors whose power is contained to feed fantasies of sexual submission that reinforce hierarchical control.  Eroticized grrrl power becomes a contest of popularity intensified through the polymorphous visual style of MTV.   Referring to Giroux‚Äôs critique of the hypersexual promotion and commercial branding of youth (1998), this student articulates her own desires for representations of youth sexuality focused on historically grounded and substantial relational qualities rather than normative beauty ideals.   In the first presentation ‚Äúporno-chic‚Äù entertainment pleasures are analyzed as something to be wary of, as cheap surface distractions and corporate manipulations.  The next presentation explored the cultural and emotional volatility of Dirrty‚Äôs visual spectacles.  This student identified herself as seeing something else, a glimpse of sexual openness, diversity and freedom.  Multi-racial/sexual groups of men and women, women with women and men moving together in playful scenarios through fluid urgent expression of desire, become framed here in terms of a productive excess.  This person glimpsed utopian possibilities through exaggerated sexed-up styles of commodification.  Postmodern theories of queer subjectivity are used in this presentation to challenge the binary categories structuring the first presentation.  Judith Butler‚Äôs theory of gender performativity is engaged with to help interpret possibilities for mobile gender identifications and sexual desires constituted within discursively organized frameworks (1990).  The contingency and improvisation of her reading as a queer student confronts the limits of the previous presentation‚Äôs focus on uniform hegemonic ideological powers.   The final presenter turned the class‚Äôs attention to the surrounding media commentary and context of Aguilera‚Äôs video.  In this argument, the public moral panic targeting Aguilera‚Äôs video Dirrty as obscene was contrasted with the acceptance and normalization of sexuality in videos by male artists such as Nelly‚Äôs Hot in Here where women move and strip in the background as decorations of male artists.  The controversy in the press surrounding the sexually explicit images in Dirrty, which were seen as going too far (provoking an advisory warning), becomes politically meaningful to this student who insists that young women artists are regulated by different standards, demonized as vulgar, slutty and dangerous.  This student affirmed the need for a broad range of images that affirm women taking sexual control, displaying creative sexual lust and publicly voicing desires as a way to confront conservative moral codes.  Here viewing pleasures become focused on media pluralization and critical debates that situate sexual representations in relation to diverse forms of reception as politically vital for those historically censored and marginalized.   Each of these presentations ends in dissonant readings of a specific set of images, rhythms and words, making use of a wide range of theoretical ideas combined with experiential reflection.  Tension fills the room as students realize their ideas and pleasures are contested, refused, challenged, and altered when in dialogue with others.  What is my role as an instructor at this point? Do I synthesize the scattered heterogeneity of experiences arising in relation to Dirrty by promoting a single issue, theory or concept? Do I emphasize a playful ‚Äúpornographication‚Äù of mainstream youth culture and encourage their guilty pleasures?  Do I assert my authority as professor and provide a critical reading that tops theirs as moral, rational and free of personal pleasure and bias?  Do I allow my class to become a free for all?   None of these options are pedagogically satisfying to me since I am interested in the very discomfort and questions provoked by the differences unleashed by this video. Perhaps it is precisely the wild loose ends of a questioning process that makes pornography a useful pedagogical tool.  Differences produced through porno-chic entertainment are about a shifting divergence of social experiences, media powers and embodied pleasures.  As a teacher I try to foster an ongoing dialogue about such differences by theorizing what gets privileged and left out of our purview without delimiting new ways of experiencing and interpreting their subjective and political significance.  I smile, turn off my power point presentation and allow for a space of silence in which no definitions are offered, no contradictions resolved, no conclusions are reached.  I try to convey the productive tensions between positions offered within this moment of radical ambivalence as part of a pedagogy engaged with popular sex cultures.  It is at such times of learning as a semiosis of experience engaged with the pornographic edges of media cultures, that possibilities emerge for understanding our vulnerable pleasures in relation to those of others.

By bringing to the forefront concepts of how subjectivity and sexuality are produced within the computer/internet apparatus, I hope to diversify the focus in cyberporn research away from social science approaches and pre-Foucauldian assumptions of the subject that obscure understandings of new media and cyberporn use. Through a summary of visual culture studies and reception studies of pornography, I argue that cyberporn must be understood as contingent within the encoding and decoding processes and discourses of sexuality in which it is produced and consumed. My focus here is the home office/terminal as the site of reception/cyberporn use. While there is potential for a great variety of critical cultural approaches to the study of new media, pornography, and sexuality, I end with specific suggestions for researching cyberporn reception.

Critical analysis identified three trends: corporate shunning; corporate curiosity and fear; corporate pursuit. Social representation, cultural norms, stereotypes and visibility were explored for each trend, revealing qualitative and quantitative inequality among social groups. Although all GLBTs experienced increased news coverage, gay men received twice the coverage of lesbians. Advertisers and the Times changed from stigmatizing and avoiding homosexuals to promoting stereotypes of gay affluence, creating ‚Äòcontroversial‚Äô ad campaigns with ‚Äòshock value‚Äô, commodifying social identity and establishing a gay market niche. Representations reflect homogenized understandings of sexuality, with bisexuals and trans-persons invisible. Case studies demonstrate the Times‚Äô contribution to norms, values and beliefs characterizing GLBTs, supporting research characterizing the media an active agent shaping cultural production of sexuality. Visibility is argued not to have granted social legitimation but to evidence social change in the status of homosexuality from deviant/stigmatized to selectively commodified and spectacularized.

Informing this examination are arguments that the newfound courting of the ‚Äògay community‚Äô by mainstream marketers represents a repositioning of gays and lesbians in commercial panoptic formations based on the perceived desirability of these populations as niche markets. This position is supported by the Janus-faced design of these online portals, which present themselves as inclusive communities to gay and lesbian consumers while simultaneously presenting themselves as surveilling entities to corporate clients. The marketing strategies deployed by these portals suggest that corporate actors believe that gays and lesbians can be enticed into self-surveillance by distancing solicitations for personal information from their economic aims and rearticulating them with images of community and romance.

The selling of sex tourism and sex tourist storytelling are structured in a manner where neither race, sexuality, gender, nor the market overdetermine the character of the discourse. Using a quantitative approach to usually qualitative concerns, this study employs a complementary combination of content analysis and network analysis to show how identity formation is based not on a dominant unitary identity but emanates through a number of strategic points of negotiation over the meaning of identification and difference. Increasingly, information and communication technologies, such as the internet, are playing a particularly significant role, not only in the promotion and packaging of sex tourism but also of a new type of global surveillance of bodies, race and desire.

Much LGBT [pre-queer] theorizing presupposed invisibility and rare stereotypic representations as a limiting and distorting condition of growing up. What do we say now about growing up with reasonably common news and entertainment presence and with the opportunities for exploration and contact offered by the Internet? One way is to deny the meaningfulness of identity and theorize the problem away.

"2010","Keeping it Real","/ Recently, some scholars have suggested that new media technologies are opening up spaces for the sexual emancipation of previously marginalized groups. These ‚ÄòDIY‚Äô web cultures would facilitate different, more authentic, representations of gender and sexuality than conventionally available in mainstream pornography. This study examines these propositions by analyzing a sample of 100 user-generated ‚Äòamateur‚Äô videos on YouPorn, an adult video-sharing website. It is demonstrated how an adherence to a masculine, heteronormative ‚Äòpornoscript‚Äô structures the possible ways in which sexual pleasure is enacted and visualized in these videos. Simultaneously, their alleged proximity to ‚Äòreal life‚Äô works to naturalize these representations, enabling the reification of their gender ideology through a denial of their imaginary dimension.

To provide original perspectives on digital work we emphasize the agency of the producers and freelancers working at the global outsourcing firm Samasource and the cable television network Current TV. Our analyses of these two cases reveal important questions regarding 1) the values and organizational culture of firm founders and executives and 2) the mobility of freelance workers within the networks of digital labor.

This paper describes some culturally situated discourses and practices that shape the development of online spaces in subtly gendered ways. It describes Pinterest, a popular social bookmarking site overwhelmingly populated by women, and its design features that largely do not rely on legacy knowledge for engaged member participation. This paper finds that, first, the culturally situated practices of technologists introduce hegemonic narratives through design features that marginalize some female users. Second, some descriptions of the gender gap are rhetorically constructed, relying on evidence of legacy knowledge rather than examining the outcomes of women's online practices. Third, narrowing the gender gap will require a re-seeing and re-thinking about how ‚Äòdigital literacy‚Äô is defined and measured. This paper offers insights into some of the barriers between women and digital fluency that are inadvertently constructed by the tacit knowledge of those who develop technologies ‚Äì knowledge that is often inaccessible to women. Digital literacy theorists, instructors, and technology professionals may engage this research to either alter their end products so that the operation of those products does not assume tacit, legacy knowledge, or, alternatively, they may find ways to make this tacit knowledge more visible so that end users may actively engage the hegemonic narratives encoded in the products rather than passively consume them.","",""

Apart from original book-length contributions by single authors (Campbell, 2004; Enteen, 2010; Fox, 2012; Gray, 2009; Kuntsman, 2009; Mowlabocus, 2010), a number of special journal issues (Alexander, 2002; Comella & Sender, 2013; Fotopoulou & O‚ÄôRiordan, 2014; Kuntsman & Al-Qasimi, 2012), and edited books (Berry, Martin, & Yue, 2003; O‚ÄôRiordan & Phillips, 2007; Pullen & Cooper, 2010) have all contributed to the advancement of our knowledge of this diversifying field.

"2014","Pornographers and Pirates: Intellectual Property and Netporn","This essay considers the viability of pornography marketed as resistant or revolutionary within hegemonic capitalist and heteronormative contexts. It focuses on three contemporary porn websites: Pornhub, Treasure Island Media, and TROUBLEfilms. In its current context, internet pornography represents a complex web of content owners, producers, distributors, licensees, users, uploaders, downloaders, actors, web hosts, and advertisers, and notions of intellectual property often come into play as porn companies try to make money in an environment in which customers do not want to pay. Using the Salish method of """"storying up"""" a phenomenon (Maracle 2007), I narrate the history of obscenity and intellectual property and discuss survival strategies employed by the three exemplary netporn sites. Beginning with copyright's and obscenity's legal foundations in the eighteenth century, the story of porn and intellectual property includes the use of easily-copied porn to create sexual publics in the twentieth century and technological and legal changes to porn's distribution in the twenty-first century. I examine three strategies netporn businesses use to stay afloat in the post-industrial economy. These strategies are the re-intermediation of the industry, management of the pornographer's """"author function,"""" and regulation of porn consumption through the sale of identity to viewers. As netporn businesses struggle for control over porn distribution and consumption, they facilitate their own survival by generating new sexual, social and economic norms. These norms mediate between the """"pirate"""" culture promised by technology and the culture industry's interest in legitimising and entrenching intellectual property rights.    Cet essai examine la viabilite de la pornographie commercialisee comme resistante ou revolutionnaire dans des contextes capitalistes et heteronormatifs hegemoniques. Il s‚Äôattarde sur trois sites Web pornographiques: Pornhub, Treasure Island Media et TROUBLEfilms. Dans son contexte actuel, la pornographie sur Internet represente une toile complexe de proprietaires de contenu, producteurs, distributeurs, titulaires de licence, utilisateurs, televerseurs et telechargeurs, acteurs, hebergeurs Web et publicitaires.

Some of the history of this movement is recounted in regard to the question of value in capital and, importantly, beyond capital. The issues of value that are raised in this perspective by posing questions of value in domestic labor against those in digital labor are not only the analogical and even the metonymical relations of domestic sphere production to digital labor and the critical discourse on it, but the historical and the foundational quality of the former to the latter, as well.

"2015","Sluts ‚Äòr‚Äô us: Intersections of gender, protocol and agency in the digital age","When it comes to examining the relationship between digital technologies and gender, our discourse has fallen into two pre-wired sets of responses: The first set approaches gender as something that is operationalised through the digital, thus producing the rhetoric of ICT4D and women‚Äôs empowerment through access to the digital. This also gives rise to the DIY cultures that makes women responsible for the safety of their bodies and selves, and puts the blame of sexual violence or abuse back onto the body of the woman. The second set approaches the digital as something that operates gender, examining the regulations and control that the digital technologies exercise on women‚Äôs bodies, gender and desires. This focuses on practices like revenge pornography, privacy, protection and security in the age of growing cyber-bullying and attacks on women. In both these discourses, there is always the imagination of one of the two sites as passive ‚Äî either the gendered body uses digital technologies for its intentions, or the digital technologies shape the gendered body following the protocols of algorithmic design. By looking at the figure of the digital slut, as it emerges in popular cultural practices and debates in regulation, that this separation of gendered intention from machine protocol fails to accommodate for the quotidian and varied engagements of bodies and technologies, and thus produces flawed regimes of regulation and law around digital gender. I propose two strategies to understand ‚Äòdigital gender‚Äô as a moment of configuration rather than a finite resolved category: The first is to combine the protocols of technology with the metaphors of the body, producing a metaphorocol, which enables us to move beyond the aporetic production of body and technology in contemporary discourse. The second is to relocate agency and question the body as actor/the body as acted upon paradigm that is invoked in thinking of body-technology relationships. Consequently, I argue I propose two different approaches that draw from material practices of gender and the architecture of physical computing, to offer new ways of reading the practices of policing and pathology of gender in the age of ubiquitous networking. I argue in my conclusion that ‚Äòdigital gender‚Äô as a concept helps us build upon earlier intersections of feminist thought and practice with other identity politics by opening up to other identities of regulation and control that emerge within data regimes of information societies.","",""

Both, I argue, are shaped by specific platform regulations as well as by broader social and political norms specific to and beyond trans* bodies. At stake in these distinctions are the extent to which trans* bodies are permitted to be defined as art and/or commodities, as well as the conditions under which backers are compelled (or not) to provide emotional, financial and political support for trans*-positive causes.

Despite their many differences, the platforms that have emerged over the last few years have one thing in common: a crowd of individual producers and capabilities is mobilised ‚Äì in the form of labour, accommodation or durable goods ‚Äì onto the market in cooperation and competition with firms from traditional industries. This study analyses the factors crowdworkers consider relevant in their work and the measures they view as helpful in improving their working relationship with platforms. It is apparent that, in the best tradition of the peer economy, this new type of worker still considers learning and fun important factors for his or her engagement. Despite these effectively intrinsic factors, workers are quite aware of their situation, which does not put them on equal terms with the platform‚Äôs algorithms and customer focus. This awareness of power disparities does not lead them, however, to reconsider their effectiveness when it comes to renegotiating terms with the platform: when specifically asked about the role of unions, the majority of crowdworkers did not expect help in self-organisation from these institutions. Considering the difficulties in regulating the market for platforms, (self-) organisation of crowdworkers, however, is an important prerequisite in rebalancing the power structure dominated by platform owners and their customers. Selforganisation is something digital natives are quite familiar with and we have to assume that crowdworkers are perhaps overconfident in their abilities. And due to the novelty of this industry, this confidence has not been shaken yet by labour disputes or even by growing dissatisfaction with platforms.","",""

The study offers a critical analysis of the legal, cultural, and political challenges to monitoring and regulating the traditional and digital means for distributing and consuming pornography, revealing the complex frameworks, transnational institutional mechanisms and regional responses involved in defining and regulating pornography in the new digital realities.","",""
"2016","Metaphors of free labor: a typology of unpaid work in the media sector"," Over the last decade, free labor has emerged as a key analytical tool for understanding new or semi-new forms of labor in the contemporary digital economy. This article critiques and develops this concept, with specific reference to work in the media industries, by presenting a historically grounded typology of free labor that also highlights some of the analytical problems with the current use of the concept. Our typology presents seven metaphors of free labor based on historical instances of roles people have taken on when performing unpaid labor: those of The Slave, The Carer, The Apprentice, The Prospector, The Hobbyist, The Volunteer, and The Patsy. A key conclusion is that free labor is performed by different actors at either end of increasingly complex and temporally stretched out value chains. This necessitates a more fine-grained and historicized use of the concept of free labor. ","",""
"2016","Pinning the feminine user: gender scripts in Pinterest‚Äôs sign-up interface"," Popular social media site Pinterest is known for its strong female user base, something often attributed to the links, images, and ideas available on it. We argue that Pinterest‚Äôs popularity with women can also be attributed to a kind of gendering that occurs during the sign-up process. We see the sign-up process as a ‚Äògender script‚Äô that inscribes specific gender performances into Pinterest itself by ‚Äòpre-scribing‚Äô adherence to a dualistic conception of gender and encouraging users to cooperate rather than to compete with each other, to curate content rather than to create it, and to interact affectively with images rather than with text. These behaviors have connections in the broader public imaginary to traditional performances of femininity, thus the kind of introduction and instruction the new user receives when signing up encourage a perception that Pinterest is for women, a perception that is then materialized in user behaviors. We close by arguing for the sign-up interface as an important site of study in new media scholarship and by discussing the ways in which gender scripts might be resisted. ","",""
"2016","Queering alienation in digital media","Marx‚Äôs concept of alienation, particularly as articulated in Dallas Smythe‚Äôs audience-commodity thesis, is central to critical studies of the political economy of digital media and its exploitation of user labour. However, in its application within critical studies of Internet economies, the concept often becomes limited to alienation from ‚Äòspecies-being‚Äô or autonomous self-actualisation. Drawing on mostly queer, but also some feminist, critiques this paper seeks to challenge this application of the alienation concept. It uses examples of the mediation of gay and queer sexualities through online hook-up apps to illustrate its position, concluding with some suggestions for how queering the subject of the alienation thesis may shape further analysis.","",""
"2016","Disturbing Hegemonic Discourse: Nonbinary Gender and Sexual Orientation Labeling on Tumblr"," In this article, I examine lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer/questioning, intersex, and asexual (LGBTQIA) Tumblr bloggers‚Äô bio boxes and ‚ÄúAbout Me‚Äù pages to show the ways gender and sexual orientation identities are constructed through community-regulated and community-generated labeling practices. Tumblr encourages counter-cultures (and labeling practices) to not only form but also to thrive due to its distinctive affordances including tagging and blog formatting. This article examines not only how these affordances shape usage and, subsequently, identity construction on Tumblr but also the ways in which Tumblr bloggers have embraced affordances to create community-accepted conventions of identity construction. Additionally, building upon online identity scholarship by Bargh, McKenna, and Fitzsimons and Tiidenberg, this article discusses true self and nonbinary gender and sexual orientation labeling as forms of identity construction that allows LGBTQIA identifying individuals a method for nuanced descriptions of feelings and desires. However, far from perfect, these labeling practices are also grounded in hegemonic female/male, feminine/masculine binary discourse. In a Foucauldian sense, bloggers construct discourse within existing power structures that ignore or erase LGBTQIA as sexual ‚Äúabnormalities.‚Äù Although it is nearly impossible to fully break away from the dominant discourse, these labeling practices can be a useful starting point for conversations about genders and sexualities that lie outside of the hegemonic binary.

"2016","Baking Gender Into Social Media Design: How Platforms Shape Categories for Users and Advertisers"," In recent years, several popular social media platforms have launched freeform custom gender fields. This decision reconstitutes gender categories beyond an oppressive binary only permitting ‚Äúmales‚Äù and ‚Äúfemales.‚Äù In this work, we uncover many different user-facing gender category design strategies within the social media ecosystem, ranging from custom gender options (on Facebook, Google+, and Pinterest) to the absence of gender fields entirely (on Twitter and LinkedIn). To explore how gender is baked into platform design, this article investigates the 10 most popular English-speaking social media platforms by performing recorded walkthroughs from two different subject positions: (1) a new user registering an account, and (2) a new advertiser creating an ad. We explore several different spaces in social media software where designers commonly program gender‚Äîsign-up pages, profile pages, and advertising portals‚Äîto consider (1) how gender is made durable through social media design, and (2) the shifting composition of the category of gender within the social media ecosystem more broadly. Through this investigation, we question how these categorizations attribute meaning to gender as they materialize in different software spaces, along with the recursive implications for society. Ultimately, our analysis reveals how social media platforms act as intermediaries within the larger ecosystem of advertising and web analytics companies. We argue that this intermediary role entrusts social media platforms with a considerable degree of control over the generation of broader categorization systems, which can be wielded to shape the perceived needs and desires of both users and advertising clients.

"2017","Facebook Captions: Kindness, or Inspiration Porn?","IntroductionIn 2017, both the disability community and popular culture are using the term ‚Äúinspiration porn‚Äù to describe one form of discrimination against people with disability. ABC‚Äôs Speechless, ‚Äúa sitcom about a family with a son who has a disability, (has) tackled why it‚Äôs often offensive to call people with disabilities ‚Äòinspirational‚Äô‚Äù (Wanshel). The reasons why inspiration porn is considered to be discriminatory have been widely articulated online by people with disability. Amongst them is Carly Findlay, a disabled writer, speaker, and appearance activist, who has written that:(inspiration porn) shows non-disabled people doing good deeds for disabled people‚Äîfeeding them chips at McDonald‚Äôs‚Äî‚Äôserving us all lessons in kindness‚Äô: or taking them to the high school dance. These stories usually always go viral. The person with disability probably never gave their permission for the photo or story to be used in a meme or told to the media (Findlay).The definition and dynamics of inspiration porn as illustrated in this quote will be expanded upon in this paper‚Äôs critical analysis of captions. Here, the term captions is used to describe both writing found on memes and on Facebook posts (created by a ‚Äúposter‚Äù), and the comments written below these posts (created by ‚Äúcommenters‚Äù). Facebook threads underneath posts about people with disability both ‚Äúreflect and create‚Äù (Barnes, Mercer and Shakespeare 202) current societal attitudes towards disability. That is, such threads not only illustrate negative societal attitudes towards disability, but can also perpetuate these attitudes by increasing people‚Äôs exposure to them. This paper will focus on a specific case study of inspiration porn on Facebook‚Äîthe crowning of a student with autism as prom king‚Äîand consider both the conflict of whether people‚Äôs kind words are patronising use of language, as well as the concerns of over-disclosure used in this thread.What Is Inspiration Porn?The genesis of the term inspiration porn is commonly attributed to the late Stella Young, a disabled woman who was an advocate for people with disability. However, the term has been traced to a blog post written in February 2012 (bear). Anecdotal evidence from Lisa Harris, a disability consultant and advocate with over 20 years‚Äô disability education experience, suggests that the term was blogged about as far back as 2006 on Rachel Cohen-Rottenberg‚Äôs Webpage Disability and Representation (Harris). However, it was Young who popularised the term with her 2012 article We‚Äôre Not Here for Your Inspiration and 2014 TED Talk I‚Äôm Not Your Inspiration, Thank You Very Much. Young defined inspiration porn as ‚Äúan image of a person with a disability, often a kid, doing something completely ordinary‚Äîlike playing, or talking, or running, or drawing a picture, or hitting a tennis ball‚Äîcarrying a caption like ‚Äòyour excuse is invalid‚Äô or ‚Äòbefore you quit, try‚Äô‚Äù.It is worth noting that the use of the word porn has been considered controversial in this context. Yet it can be argued that the perception of the person with disability having achieved something great gives the person without disability a hit of positive ‚Äúinspired‚Äù emotion. In this way, such inspiration could be termed as porn as it serves the purpose of fulfilling the ‚Äúpornographic‚Äù self-gratification of people without disability.The term inspiration porn has historically been used in disability studies in two ways. Firstly, it has been used to describe the ‚Äúableist gaze‚Äù (Davis), which is when a person with disability is ‚Äòseen‚Äô through the eyes of someone without disability. Indeed, just as the ‚Äúmale gaze‚Äù (Mulvey) is implicit in sexualised porn, so too the ‚Äúableist gaze‚Äù is implicit in inspiration porn. Secondly, it has been used to highlight the lack of power experienced by people with disability in cultural representation (Barnes, Mercer, and Shakespeare 201). This study is a good example of the latter‚Äîit is not uncommon for people with disability to be refuted when they speak out against the inherent discrimination found within captions of (intended) kindness on Facebook threads.Inspiration porn is also a form of ‚Äúobjectification‚Äù (Perry) of people with disability, and is based on stereotypes (Haller and Zhang 22) about disability held by people without disability. According to Dr. Paul Sinclair, a disability scholar with 15 years‚Äô experience in disability education, objectification and stereotyping are essential factors to understanding inspiration porn as discrimination:when a person with disability engages in their daily life, it is possible that a person without disability sees them as inspirational by superimposing his/her stereotypical perception of, or understanding about, people with disability onto the identity of the person, as a human being.Such objectification and stereotyping of people with disability is evident across various media captioning. This is particularly so in social media which often includes memes of images with ‚Äúinspiring‚Äù captions‚Äîsuch as the ones Young highlighted as clear examples of inspiration porn, which ‚Äúfeature the Hamilton quote (‚ÄòThe only disability in life is a bad attitude‚Äô)‚Äù. Another example of this kind of captioning is found in news items such as the 2015 article Disabled Teen Crowned Homecoming Queen in Awesome Way as featured in the article USA Today (Saggio). This article described how a student not identified as having a disability gave her homecoming queen crown to a student with a disability and captioned the YouTube clip of these students with, ‚ÄúHigh school senior [Name] was hoping she‚Äôd be crowned homecoming queen. She has cerebral palsy and has never felt like she fit in at school. What happened during the crowning ceremony will warm your heart‚Äù (Saggio). The fact that the young woman was pleased with getting the crown does not mitigate the objectifying dynamics of inspiration porn present within this example. Captioning such as this both creates and reflects some of the existing attitudes‚Äîincluding charity and its appeal to emotionality‚Äîthat perpetuate inspiration porn.Measuring Inspiration Porn with Sentiment AnalysisThe challenge for the researcher analysing Facebook threads is how to meaningfully interpret the captions‚Äô numerous contexts. The methodology of this research used a quantitative approach to gather numerical data about selected Facebook captions. This paper discusses data gained from a sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee; Thelwall et al.; Driscoll) of these captions within the contexts of my own and other researchers‚Äô analyses of inspiration porn, as well as the perspectives of people with disability.The sentiment analysis was conducted using SentiStrength, a software tool that extracts both positive and negative sentiment strengths ‚Äúfrom short informal electronic text‚Äù (Thelwall et al., 2545), and ranks it ‚Äúon a numerical scale‚Äù (Driscoll 3). Sentiment analysis and SentiStrength are useful, but not perfect, tools with which to analyse Facebook captions. For example, SentiStrength determines two scales: a positive emotion measurement scale ranging from +1 (neutral) to +5 (most positive), and a negative emotion measurement scale ranging from ‚Äì1 (neutral) to ‚Äì5 (most negative). It calculates the positive and negative scores concurrently rather than averaging them out in order to acknowledge that captions can and do express mixed emotion (Driscoll 5).News articles about people with disability attending proms and comparable events, such as the homecoming queen example described above, are often criticised by disability activists for perpetuating inspiration porn (Mort; Findlay; Brown). Based on this criticism, sentiment analysis was used in this research to measure the emotional strength of captions‚Äîparticularly their possible use of patronising language‚Äîusing the Autism Speaks Facebook post as a case study. The post featured an image of a high school student with autism who had been crowned prom king.The Autism Speaks Facebook page was set up to fund ‚Äúresearch into the causes, prevention, treatments and a cure for autism; increas(e) awareness of autism spectrum disorders; and advocat(e) for the needs of individuals with autism and their families‚Äù (Autism Speaks). The location of the prom was not specified; however, Autism Speaks is based in New York. This particular Facebook page was selected for this study based on criticism that Autism Speaks receives from disability advocates. One of the major critiques is that ‚Äú(its) advertising depends on offensive and outdated rhetoric of fear and pity, presenting the lives of autistic people as tragic burdens on our families and society‚Äù (Boycott Autism Speaks). Autism Speaks has also been described as a problematic example of an organisation that ‚Äúdictate(s) how disability should be perceived and dealt with. Often without input of disabled people either in the design or implementation of these organizations‚Äù (crippledscholar). This article goes on to state that ‚Äúcharities always frame what they do as positive and helpful even when the people who are the intended recipients disagree.‚ÄùThe prom king post included a photo of a young man with autism after he was crowned. He was standing beside a woman who wasn‚Äôt identified. The photo, posted by the young man‚Äôs aunt on the Autism Speaks Facebook page, included a status update that read:My autistic nephew won PROM KING today! Just so you all know, having a disability doesn‚Äôt hold you back if you don‚Äôt let it! GO [NAME]. #AutismAwareness (Autism Speaks)The following caption from the comment thread of the same Facebook post is useful as an example of how SentiStrength works. The caption read:Tears of Joy! Thank you for posting!!! Wow this gives me hope for his and my son‚Äôs and everyone‚Äôs special wonderful child nephew and niece! Way cool!However, because SentiStrength does not always accurately detect and measure sarcasm or idiomatic language usage, ‚ÄùTears‚Äù (the only negatively interpreted word in this caption) has been scored as ‚Äì4, while the overall positive sentiment was scored as 3. Therefore, the final SentiStrength score of this caption was 3, ‚Äì4, thereby demonstrating both the utility and limitations of SentiStrength as a sentiment analysis tool. This is useful to understand when analysing the data it produces.When analysing the entire thread, the sentiment analysis results across 238 captions, showed that 2 was the average strength of positive emotion, and that ‚Äì1.16 was the average strength of negative emotion. The following section will analyse how a specific caption chosen from the most positively-scored captions from these data indicates that inspiration porn is possibly evident within.Use of Language: Kind, or Patronising?This discussion analyses the use of language in one caption from this thread, focusing on the way it likely demonstrated the ableist gaze. The caption was the most positive one from these data as scored by SentiStrength (5, ‚Äì1) and read, ‚ÄùCONGRATULATIONS SWEETIE!!!‚Äù. While it is noted that basing this analysis primarily on one caption provides limited insight into the dynamics of inspiration porn, this analysis forms a basis from which to consider other ‚Äúinspirational‚Äù Facebook posts about people with disability. As well as this caption, this discussion will also draw upon other examples mentioned in this paper‚Äîfrom the homecoming queen article in USA Today to another caption on the Autism Speaks thread‚Äîto illustrate the dynamics of inspiration porn.On the surface, this congratulatory caption seems like a kind thing to post. However, inspiration porn has been identified in this analysis based on the caption‚Äôs effusive use of punctuation coupled with use of capital letters and the word ‚Äúsweetie‚Äù. The excitement depicted through use of multiple exclamation marks and capital letters implies that the commenter has a personal connection with the prom king, which is a possibility. However, this possibility becomes less feasible when the caption is considered within the context of other captions that display not dissimilar use of language, as well as some that also display intimate emojis, such as grin faces and love heart eyes. Further, when this use of language is used with any consistency across a thread and is not coupled with textual information that implies a personal connection between the commenter/s and the prom king, it could be interpreted as patronising, condescending and/or infantilising. In addition, ‚Äúsweetie‚Äù is a term of endearment commonly used in conversation with a romantic partner, child, or someone the speaker/writer knows intimately. While, again, it is possible that these commenters knew the prom king intimately, a more likely possibility is that he was being written to by strangers, yet using language that implied he was close to them‚Äîwhich would then have the same patronising connotations as above. It can therefore be argued that there is a strong possibility that this heightened use of intimate and emotional language was chosen based on his autism diagnosis.The conclusion drawn above is based in part on contextual similarities between the Autism Speaks post and its associated thread, and the aforementioned homecoming queen news article. In the former, it is likely that the young prom king was congratulated effusively because of his autism diagnosis. Similarly, in the latter article, the young woman was crowned not because she was named homecoming queen, but because the crown was given to her because of her diagnosis of cerebral palsy. As both gestures appear to have been based on others‚Äô perceptions of these individuals‚Äô disabilities rather than on their achievements, they are both likely to be patronising gestures.Over-DisclosureIn addition to use of language, another noteworthy issue in the captions thread on the Autism Speaks Facebook page was that many of them were from parents disclosing the diagnosis of their child. One example of this was a post from a mother that read (in part):I‚Äôll be over here worried &amp; concerned with the other 9,999 &amp; ¬Ω things to deal with, keeping up with new therapies, current therapy, we came in progress from any past therapies, meltdowns, dietary restrictions, educational requirements, The joy and difficulties of not just learning a new word but actually retaining that word, sleep, being hit, keeping him from hitting himself, tags on clothes etc. etc. [sic] (Autism Speaks)The above commenter listed a number of disability-specific issues that she experienced while raising her son who has autism. The context for her caption was a discussion, unrelated to the original post, that had sparked underneath a sub-thread regarding whether the use of person-first language (‚Äúperson with autism‚Äù) or identity-first language (‚ÄúAutistic person‚Äù) was best when referring to someone with autism. The relationship between inspiration porn and this intimately negative post about someone with disability is that both types of post are examples of the ‚Äúableist gaze‚Äù: inspiration porn demonstrates an exaggerated sense of positivity based on someone‚Äôs disability, and this post demonstrates disregard for the privacy of the person being posted about‚Äîperhaps due to his disability. The ease with which this negative comparison (over-disclosure) can be made between ‚Äòinspirational‚Äô and ‚Äònegative‚Äô posts illustrates in part why inspiration porn is a form of discrimination‚Äîintentional or otherwise.Furthermore, some of the children who were disclosed about on the main thread were too young to be asked consent, and it is unclear whether those who were old enough had the capacity to provide informed consent. Research has found that online over-disclosure in general is a matter of concern.The specific practice of online over-disclosure from parents about their children‚Äîwith or without disability‚Äîhas been raised by Leaver (151), ‚Äúwhat happens before young people have the agency, literacy or skills to take the reins of their own selves online? Parents, guardians, loved ones and others inevitably set the initial identity parameters for young people online.‚Äù Over-disclosure is therefore also an issue that concerns people with disability, and the people closest to them.There exists both anecdotal evidence and academic research regarding online over-disclosure about people with disability. The research states that when people with physical disability disclose online, they employ strategic approaches that involve the degree to which they disclose (Furr, Carreiro, and McArthur). This suggests that there are complex factors to consider around such disclosure. Also relevant is that the practice of over-disclosure about another person‚Äôs disability, regardless of whether that disclosure is made by a close family member, has been critiqued by people (Findlay; Stoltz) within the disability community: ‚Äúwould you publicly share this information about your other children, an aging parent, or yourself?‚Äù (Stoltz). Finally, the practice of disability over-disclosure by anyone other than the person themselves supports the understanding that inspiration porn is not about the ‚Äúobject‚Äù of inspiration; rather, it serves to give pleasure (and/or pain) to the objectifier.ConclusionInspiration porn via the ableist gaze is discriminatory because it focuses on a (societally) undesirable trait in a way that serves the ‚Äúgazer‚Äù at the expense of the ‚Äúgazed-at‚Äù. That is, people with disability are objectified and exploited in various ways that can initially appear to be positive to people without disability. For example, when someone with disability posts or is posted about on Facebook, a person without disability might then add a caption‚Äîpossibly with good intentions‚Äîthat serves as their ‚Äúinspired‚Äù response to what it ‚Äúmust‚Äù be like to have a disability. It can be argued that such captions, whether on news articles or when framing social media images, therefore either reflect or create existing social inequalities‚Äîand possibly do both.In continuing to use the term inspiration porn to describe one form of discrimination against people with disability, both the disability community and popular culture are contributing to an important narrative that scholarship needs to continue to address. Indeed, the power imbalance that is celebrated within inspiration porn is in some ways more insidious than malicious discrimination against people with disability, because it is easier to mistake as kindness. The research sample presented in this paper supports the countless expressions of anecdotal evidence given by people with disability that this ‚Äúkindness‚Äù is inspiration porn; a damaging expression of the ableist gaze.ReferencesAutism Speaks.

"2017","The Bisexual Seen: Countering Media Misrepresentation","IntroductionJohn Berger provides a compelling analysis in Ways of Seeing on how we‚Äôve been socialized through centuries of art to see women as objects and men as subjects. This way of seeing men and women is more than aesthetic choices but in fact shapes our ideologies of gender. As Berger asserts: ‚ÄúThe art of the past no longer exists as it once did‚Ä¶ In its place there is a language of images. What matters now is who uses that language for what purpose‚Äù (33).What happens when there are no historical images that represent your identity? How do others learn to see you? How do you learn to represent yourself? This article addresses the challenges that bisexuals face in constructing and contending with media representations of non-normative sexualities. As Berger suggests: ‚ÄúA people or class which is cut off from its own past is far less free to choose and to act as a people or class than one that has been able to situate itself in history‚Äù (33). This article seeks to apply Berger‚Äôs core concepts in Ways of Seeing studying representations of bisexuality in mainstream media. How bisexuality is represented, and therefore observed, shapes what can ultimately be culturally understood and recognized.This article explores how bisexuals use digital media to construct self-representations and brand a bisexual identity. Bisexual representations are particularly relevant to study as they are often rendered invisible by the cultural hegemony of monosexuality. Cultural norms ideologically shape the intelligibility of representation; bisexuality is often misinterpreted when read within the dominant binaries of heterosexuality and homosexuality in Western European culture. This work addresses how users adapt visual, textual, and hyperlinked information in online spaces to create representations that can be culturally recognized. Users want to be seen as bisexuals.¬†The research for this article examined online social spaces created by and for bisexuals between 2013-2015, as well as mainstream media addressing bisexuality or bisexual characters. The social spaces studied included national and regional websites for bisexual organizations, blogs dedicated to bisexual issues and topics, and public bisexual groups on Facebook and Tumblr. Participant observation and semiotic analysis was employed to analyze how bisexual representation was discussed and performed. ¬†Learning to See Bisexuality Bisexuality is often constructed within the domain of medical and psychological classification systems as a sexual identity situated between one polarity or the other: between desiring men or desiring women as sexual partners or between being gay or being straight in sexual orientation, as most widely put forth by Alfred Kinsey in the 1950s (Kinsey et al., 1948; e.g., Blumstein, 1977; Diamond, 1993; Weinberg, 1995). This popularly held conception has a particular history that serves to reinforce the normative categories of heterosexuality and monosexuality.This history does not reflect bisexual‚Äôs accounts of their own experiences of what it means to be bisexual. Bisexuals in the spaces I study express their sexuality as fluid both in terms of gender (objects of desire do not have to identify as only male or female) as well as in terms of the lifespan (desire based on sex or gender does not have remain consistent throughout one‚Äôs life). As one participant remarked: ‚ÄúI think of bisexual as a different orientation from both homosexuals (who orient exclusively towards same-sex romance/sexuality) and heterosexuals (who orient exclusively toward opposite-sex romance/sexuality). Bisexuals seem to think about the world in a different way: a world of ‚ÄòAND‚Äô rather than a world of ‚ÄòOR‚Äô.‚Äù Or as another participant noted: ‚ÄúI saw video a couple of months ago that described ‚Äòbi‚Äô as being attracted to ‚Äòsame and different sexed people.‚Äô I considered my internal debate settled at that point. Yes, it is binary, but only in the broadest sense.‚ÄùThis data from my research is congruent with data from much larger studies that examined longitudinal psycho-social development of bisexual identities (Klein, 1978; Barker, 2007; Diamond, 2008). Individuals‚Äô narratives of a more ‚Äúfluid‚Äù identity suggest an emphasis at the individual level less about fluctuating between ‚Äútwo‚Äù possible types of sexual partners than about a dynamic, complex desire within a coherent self. Nevertheless, popular constructions of bisexuality in media continue to emphasize it within hegemonic monosexual ideologies.Heterosexual relationships are overwhelmingly the most dominant relationship type portrayed in media, and the second most portrayed relationship is homosexuality, or a serial monogamy towards only one gender. This pairing is not only conveying the dominant hegemonic norms of heterosexuality (and most often paired with serial monogamy as well), but it is equally and powerfully reproducing the hegemonic ideal of monosexuality. Monosexuality is the romantic or sexual attraction to members of one sex or gender group only. A monosexual person may identify as either heterosexual or homosexual, the key element being that their sexual or romantic attraction remains consistently directed towards one sex or gender group. In this way, we have all been socialized since childhood to value not only monogamy but monosexuality as well. However, current research on sexuality suggests that self-identified bisexuals are the largest group among non-heterosexuals. In 2011, Dr. Gary Gates, Research Director of the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law, analyzed data collected from nine national health surveys from the USA, United Kindgdom, Canada, Australia and Norway to provide the most comprehensive statistics available to date on how many people self-identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender. While the population percentage of LGBT people varied by country, the ratio of lesbian, gay and bisexuals among LGBT people remained consistent, with self-identified bisexuals accounting for 40-60% of all LGBT populations regardless of country. This data is significant for challenging the popular assumption that bisexuals are a small minority among non-heterosexuals; indeed, this data indicates that non-monosexuals represent half of all non-heterosexuals. Yet we have learned to recognize monosexuality as dominant, normal and naturalized, even within LGBT representations. Conversely, we struggle to even recognize relationships that fall outside of this hegemonic norm. In essence, we lack ways of seeing bisexuals, pansexuals, omnisexuals, asexuals, and all queer-identified individuals who do not conform to monosexuality. We quite literally have not learned to see them, or‚Äîworse yet‚Äîlearned how to not see them.Bisexual representations are particularly relevant to study as they are often rendered invisible in cultures that practice monogamy paired with hegemonic monosexuality. Members of bisexual spaces desire to achieve recognition but struggle to overcome bisexual erasure in their daily lives.Misrepresention: The Triad in Popular MediaWhen bisexuality is portrayed in media it is most commonly portrayed in a disingenuous manner where the bisexual is portrayed as being torn between potential lovers, on a pathway from straight to gay, or as a serial liar and cheater who cannot remain monogamous due to overwhelming attractions. Representations of bisexuals in media are infrequent, but those that are available too often follow these inaccurate stereotypes. By far the most common convention for representing bisexuality in visual media is the use of the triad: three people convey the (mis)representation of bisexuality as a sexuality in the ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù of heterosexuality and homosexuality. For the purpose of this article, data analysis will be limited to print magazines for the sake of length and clarity.The 2014 New York Times Magazine article ‚ÄúThe Scientific Quest to Prove Bisexuality Exists‚Äù (Denizet-Lewis) addresses the controversial nature of bisexuality. The cover image depicts a close-up of a man‚Äôs face, separated into two halves: in one half, a woman is nuzzled up to the man‚Äôs cheek, and the other half a man is nuzzled up to his ear. Presumably the man is bisexual and therefore split into two parts: his heterosexual self and his homosexual self. This visual depiction of bisexuality reifies the notion that bisexuals are torn between two polar desires and experience equal and concurrent attraction to more than one partner simultaneously. Furthermore, the triad represented in this way suggests that the essential bisexual is having simultaneous liaisons with heterosexual and homosexual partners.Within the convention of the triad there is also a sub-genre closely connected with hypersexualization and the male gaze. In these cases, the triad is commonly presented in varying states of undress and/or in a bed. An article in The Guardian from 11 April 2014 with the headline: ‚ÄúMake up your mind! The science behind bisexuality‚Äù (Browne) includes an image with three attractive young people in bed together. A man is sitting up between two sleeping women and smoking a cigarette ‚Äì the cigarette connotes post-coital sexual activity, as does the smirk on his face. This may have been a suitable image if the article had been about having a threesome, but the headline‚Äîand the article‚Äîare attempting to explain the science behind bisexuality. Furthermore, while the image is intended to illustrate an article on bisexuality, the image is fundamentally misleading. The women in the image are asleep and to the side and the man is awake and in the middle. He is the central figure ‚Äì it is a picture of him. So who is the bisexual in the image? What is the image attempting to do? It seems that the goal is to titillate, to excite, and to satisfy a particularly heterosexual fantasy rather than to discuss bisexuality. This hypersexualization once again references the mistaken idea (or heterosexual male fantasy) that bisexuality is only expressed through simultaneous sex acts.Many of these examples are salacious but they occur with surprising regularity in the mainstream media. On 17 February 2016, the American Association of Retired Persons posted an article to the front page of their website titled ‚ÄúAm I Discovering I'm Bisexual?‚Äù (Schwartz, 2016). In the accompanying image at the top of the article, we see three people sitting on a park bench ‚Äì two men on either side of a woman. The image is taken from behind the bench so we see their backs and ostensibly they do not see us, the viewer. The man on the left is kissing the woman in the center while also holding hands behind the back of the bench with the man sitting on her other side. The man on the right is looking away from the couple kissing, suggesting he is not directly included in their intimate activity. Furthermore, the two men are holding hands behind the bench, which could also be code for behind the woman‚Äôs back, suggesting infidelity to the dyad and depicting some form of duplicity.¬† This triad reinforces the trope of the bisexual as promiscuous and untrustworthy.Images such as these are common and range from the more inoffensive to the salacious. The resulting implications are that bisexuals are torn between their internal hetero and homo desires, require simultaneous partners, and are untrustworthy partners. Notably, in all these images it is never clear exactly which individuals are bisexual. Are all three members of the triad bisexual? While this is a possible read, the dominant discourse leads us to believe that one of person in the triad is the bisexual while the others adhere to more dominant sexualities.Participants in my research were acutely aware of these media representations and expressed frequent negative reactions to the implications of the triad. Each article contained numerous online comments expressing frustration with the use of ‚Äúthreesomes.‚Äù As one commentator stated: ‚ÄúWithout a threesome, we‚Äôre invisible. It‚Äôs messed up. I always imagine a t-shirt with 3 couples stick figure like: girl + girl, girl + boy, and boy + boy. and it says ‚Äú6 bisexuals.‚Äù What is made clear in many user comments is that the mainstream social scripts used to portray bisexuality are clearly at odds with the ways in which bisexuals choose to describe or portray themselves.¬†Seeing through CapitalismOne of the significant conclusions of this research was the ways in which the misrepresentation of bisexuality results in many individuals feeling underrepresented or made invisible within mainstream media. The most salient themes to emerge from this research is participants‚Äô affective struggle with feeling """"invisible.‚Äù The frequency of discourse specific to invisibility is significant, as well as its expressed negatively associated experiences and feelings. The public sharing of those reactions among individuals, and the ensuing discourse that emerges from those interactions, include imagining what visibility ‚Äúlooks‚Äù like (its semiotic markers and what would make those markers ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù for visibility), and the articulation of ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù to counter perceived invisibility. Notably, participants often express the desire for visibility in terms of commodification. As one participant posted, ‚Äútheir [sic] is no style for bi, there is no voice tone, unless I'm wearing my shirt, how is anyone to know?‚Äù Another participant explicated, ‚ÄúI wish there was a look. I wish I could get up every day and put on the clothes and jewelry that identified me to the world when I stepped out of my apartment. I wish I was as visible on the street as I am on facebook.‚Äù This longing for a culturally recognizable bisexual identity is articulated as a desire for a market commodification of ‚Äúbisexual.‚Äù But a commodified identity may be a misguided desire. As Berger warns: ‚ÄúPublicity is not merely an assembly of competing messages: it is a language in itself which is always being used to make the same general purpose‚Ä¶ It proposes to each of us that we transform ourselves, or our lives, by buying something more‚Äù (131). Consumerism‚Äîand its bedfellow‚Äîmarketing, aim to sell the fantasy of a future self whereby the consumer transforms themselves through material objects, not transforming the culture to accept them. Berger further elicits that marketing essentially convinces us that we are not whole the way we are and sells us the idea of a wholeness achieved through consumerism (134). Following Berger‚Äôs argument, this desire for a commodified identity, while genuine, may fundamentally undermine the autonomy bisexuals currently have insomuch as without a corporate brand, bisexual representations are more culturally malleable and therefore potentially more inclusive to the real diversity of bisexual identified people.However, Berger also rightly noted that ‚Äúpublicity is the culture of the consumer society. It propagates through images that society‚Äôs belief in itself‚Äù (139). Without any publicity, bisexuals are not wrong to feel invisible in a consumer culture. And yet ‚Äúpublicity turns consumption into a substitute for democracy. The choice of what one eats (or wears or drives) takes the place of significant political choice‚Äù (149). A commodified identity will not likely usher in meaningful political change in a culture where bisexuals experience worse mental health and discrimination outcomes than lesbian and gay people (LGBT Advisory Committee, 2011).¬†Bisexuals Online: New Ways of SeeingThe Internet, which was touted early as a space of great potential for anonymity and exploration where visibility can be masked, here becomes the place where bisexuals try to make the perceived invisible ‚Äòvisible.‚Äô Digital technologies and spaces provide particularly useful environments for participants of online bisexual spaces to negotiate issues of invisibility as participants construct visible identities through daily posts, threads, videos, and discourse in which bisexuality is discursively and visually imagined, produced, articulated, defended, and desired. But most importantly these digital technologies provide bisexuals with opportunities to counter misrepresentations in mainstream media. In the frequent example of intimate partners in the physical world rendering a bisexual‚Äôs identity invisible, participants of these online communities grapple with the seeming paradox of one‚Äôs offline self as the avatar and one‚Äôs online self as more fully integrated, represented, and recognized. One participant expressed this experience, remarking:I feel I'm more out online that offline. That's because, in the offline world there's the whole ''social assumptions'' issue. My co-workers, friends, etc, know I have a boyfriend, wich [sic] equals ''straight'' for most ppl out there. So, I'll out myself when the occasion comes (talking abt smn I used to date, the LGBT youth group I used to belong to, or usually just abt some girl I find attractive) and usually ppl are not surprised. Whereas online, my pic at Facebook (and Orkut) is a Bisexual Pride icon. I follow Bi groups on Twitter. I'm a member of bi groups. So, online it's spelled out, while offline ppl usually think me having a bf means I'm straight.The I Am Visible (IAV) campaign is just one example of an organized response to the perceived erasure of bisexuals in mainstream culture. Launched in January 2011 by Adrienne McCue (nee Williams), the executive director of the Bi Social Network, a non-profit organization aimed at bringing awareness to representations of bisexuality in media. The campaign was hosted on bisocialnetwork.com, with the goal to ‚Äústop biphobia and bi-erasure in our community, media, news, and entertainment,‚Äù Prior to going live, IAV implemented a six-month lead-up advertising campaign across multiple online bisexual forums, making it the most publicized new venture during the period of my study. IAV hosted user-generated videos and posters that followed the vernacular of coming out and provided emotional support for listeners who may be struggling with their identity in a world largely hostile to bisexuality. Perceived invisibility was the central theme of IAV, which was the most salient theme for every bisexual group I studied online.Perhaps the most notable video and still image series to come out of IAV were those including Emmy nominated Scottish actor Alan Cumming. Cumming, a long-time Broadway thespian and acclaimed film actor, openly identifies as bisexual and has criticized ‚Äògaystream‚Äô outlets on more than one occasion for intentionally mislabeling him as ‚Äògay.‚Äô As such, Alan Cumming is one of the most prominently celebrated bisexual celebrities during the time of my study. While there are numerous famous out gays and lesbians in the media industry who have lent their celebrity status to endorse LGBT political messages‚Äîsuch as Ellen DeGeneres, Elton John, and Neil Patrick Harris, to name a few‚Äîthere have been notably fewer celebrities supporting bisexual specific causes. Therefore, Cummings involvement with IAV was significant for many bisexuals. His star status was perceived as contributing legitimacy to bisexuality and increasing cultural visibility for bisexuals.These campaigns to become more visible are based in the need to counteract the false media narrative, which is, in a sense, to educate the wider society as to what bisexuality is not. The campaigns are an attempt to repair the false messages which have been ‚Äúlearnt‚Äù and replace them with more accurate representations. ¬†¬†The Internet provides bisexual activists with a tool with which they can work to correct the skewed media image of themselves. Additionally, the Internet has also become a place where bisexuals can more easily represent themselves through a wide variety of semiotic markers in ways which would be difficult or unacceptable offline. In these ways, the Internet has become a key device in bisexual activism and while it is important not to uncritically praise the technology it plays an important role in enabling correct representation.¬†¬†ReferencesBarker, Meg.

If contemporary workers seem more willing to accept the burden of entrepreneurial risk or the hardships of underpaid undertakings, this is because they reinterpret value-producing tasks as aligned with their private goals.

This mixed-methods participatory research included a nationwide organizational survey with 231 respondents, 19 expert interviews, and a series of workshops with project partners and advisers. We found that despite scarce resources, many LGBTQ and Two-Spirit organizations have an intersectional analysis of linked systems of race, class, gender, sexual orientation, and other axes of identity and structural inequality. Many seek to do media work that develops the critical consciousness and leadership of their communities, create media in ways that are deeply accountable to their social base, use participatory approaches to media making, are strategic and cross-platform in their approach, and root their work in community action. We call this combination of characteristics transformative media organizing, and we believe it describes an emerging paradigm for social movement media practices in the current media landscape.

"2017","Digital Mediation, Soft Cabs, and Spatial Labour","Abstract Critics of digitally mediated labour platforms (often called the ‚Äúsharing‚Äù or ‚Äúgig economy‚Äù) have focused on the character and extent of the control exerted by these platforms over both workers and customers, and in particular on the precarizing impact on the workers on whose labor the services depend. Less attention has been paid to the specifically spatial character of the forms of work targeted by mobile digital platforms. The production and maintenance of urban social space has always been dependent, to a large degree, on work that involves the crossing of spatial boundaries - particularly between public and private spaces, but also crossing spaces segregated by class, race, and gender. Delivery workers, cabdrivers, day labourers, home care providers, and similar boundary-crossers all perform spatial work: the work of moving between and connecting spaces physically, experientially, and through representation. Spatial work contributes to the production and reproduction of social space; it is also productive of three specific, though interrelated, products: physical movement from one place to another; the experience of this movement; and the articulation of these places, experiences, and movements with visions of society and of the social. Significantly, it is precisely such spatial work, and its products, which mobile digital platforms seek most urgently to transform. Drawing on several recent studies of ‚Äúridesharing‚Äù (or soft cab) labour platforms, I interrogate the impact of digital mediation on the actual practices involved in spatial work. I argue that the roll-out of digital labour platforms needs to be understood in terms of a struggle over the production of social space.","",""
"2017","The labor of online product promotion: Barriers to collective action","Theorists have suggested that precarity ‚Äî an experience of risk and uncertainty ‚Äî increasingly describes the work experiences of many different kinds of contractual workers: from highly paid freelancers to those who pick up odd jobs. Theorists have further suggested that this common experience of precarity might serve as the basis for collective action. I contribute to this discussion by attempting to understand how individuals who work online promoting products experience precarity in different ways. Based on interviews with professional bloggers and members of a group that I refer to as the flexibly unemployed, I describe the characteristics and work practices of these groups, as well as their interactions. I argue that bloggers‚Äô exploitation of the flexibly unemployed, together with their ideologies toward labor, act as barriers to collective action. I conclude by suggesting that, rather than imagining that workers from different classes will find common ground, communication systems should be developed that allow workers to network and share information in ways that are isolated from members of other classes and outside of online work platforms that commoditize social relationships and interactions.","",""
"2017","The flow of digital labor"," Digital microwork is a type of labor that many‚Äîtypically poorly paid‚Äîworkers engage in. In our research, we focus on an experience-based model of digital labor and the nonmonetary benefits derived from such activities. Based on a survey of 701 workers at Amazon Mechanical Turk, we demonstrate that experiences during digital labor sequences generate flow-like states of immersion. We show that reaching flow-like states while performing microwork depends on certain work characteristics, such as the particular worker‚Äôs degree of autonomy, the extent to which a worker‚Äôs skills are utilized, and the apparent significance of and feedback derived from the task. The results both highlight the importance of flow-like immersion in explaining why individuals engage in digital labor projects and point to avenues that can lead to the design of better digital work experiences.

I argue that the gender binary has regulated Facebook‚Äôs design strategy while the co-existence of binary and non-binary affordances has enabled the company to serve both users and advertising clients simultaneously. Three findings are revealed: (1) an original programming decision to store three values for gender in Facebook‚Äôs database became an important fissure for non-binary possibilities, (2) gender became increasingly valuable over time, and (3) in the deep level of the database, non-binary users are reconfigured into a binary system.

Based on a review of 102 peer-reviewed CVPF articles, we argue that CVPF has as a whole trained computers to ‚Äúsee‚Äù a very specific, idealized form of pornography: pictures of lone, thin, naked women. The article supports this argument by closely reading the algorithms proposed in the CVPF literature and quantitatively analyzing the images included as illustrations of these algorithms. Drawing on pornography studies, we also compare the CVPF pornographic imagination with ‚Äúnoisy‚Äù pornography that exceeds computer vision. Ultimately, the article argues that this very narrow imagination of porn in CVPF reflects and reinforces larger gender and sexual inequalities in the technology industry as a whole. ","",""
"2018","‚ÄúWe‚Äôre All Born Naked and the Rest Is‚Äù Mediation: Drag as Automediality","This essay originates out of our shared interest in genres and media forms used for identity practices that do not cohere into a narrative or a fixed representation of who someone is. It takes the current heightened visibility of drag as a mode of performance that explicitly engages with identity as a product materialized‚Äîbut not completed‚Äîby the ongoing process of performance. We consider the new drag, which we define below, as a form of playing with identity that combines bodily practices (comportment and use of voice) and adornment (make-up, clothing, wigs, and accessories) with an array of media (photography, live performance, social media and television). Given the limited space available, we will not be engaging with the propositions made during earlier feminist and queer thinking that drag is not inherently subversive and may reinscribe gender and race norms through their hyperbolic recitation (Butler 230-37; hooks 145-56). While we think there is much to be gained from revisiting these critiques in light of the changes in conceptualisations of gender in queer subcultures, we are not interested in framing drag as subversive or resistant in relation to the norms of masculinity and femininity. Instead, we follow Eve Sedgwick‚Äôs interest in reparative practices adopted by queer-identified subjects who must learn to survive in a hostile culture (‚ÄúParanoid‚Äù) and trace two lines of analysis we identify in drag‚Äôs new found visibility that demonstrate the reparative potential of automedia.At time of writing, RuPaul‚Äôs Drag Race (RPDR) has truly hit the big time. Pop icon Christina Aguilera was a guest judge for the first episode of its tenth season (Daw ‚ÄúChristina‚Äù), and the latest episode of RuPaul‚Äôs All-Stars season three spin-off show was the most-watched of any show in its network‚Äôs history (Crowley). RuPaul Charles, the producer and star of RPDR, has just been honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, decades after he began his career as a drag performer (Daw ‚ÄúRuPaul‚Äù). Drag queens are finally becoming part of American mainstream media and drag as an art form and a cultural practice is on its way to becoming part of discourse about gender and identity around the world, via powerful systems of digital mediation and distribution. RPDR‚Äôs success is a good way to think about how drag, a long-standing performance art form, is having¬† a ‚Äúbreak out‚Äù moment in popular culture. We argue here that RPDR is doing this within an automedia framework.What does automedia mean in the context of drag on television and social media? We understand automedia to be about the mediation of identity when identity is both a product of representation and a process that is continually becoming, expressed in the double meaning of the word ‚Äúlife‚Äù as biography and as process (Poletti ‚ÄúQueer Collages‚Äù 362; Poletti and Rak 6-7). In this essay we build on our shared interest in developing a critical mode that can respond to forms of automedia that explore ‚Äúthe possibility of identity in the absence of narration‚Äù (Rak 172). What might artists who work with predominantly non-narrative forms such as drag performance show us about the ongoing interconnection between technologies and subjectivities as they represent and think through what ‚Äúlife‚Äù looks like, on stage and off?Automedia names life as a process and a product that has the potential to queer temporality and normative forms of identification, what Jack Halberstam has called ‚Äúqueer time‚Äù (1). We understand Halberstam‚Äôs evocation of queer time as suitable for being thought through automedia because of their characterisation of queer as ‚Äúa form of self-description in the past decade or so ‚Ä¶ [that] has the potential to open up new life narratives and alternative relations to time and space‚Äù (2). Queer time, Halberstam explains, comes from the collapse of the past and shaky relation to futurity gay men experienced during the height of the American AIDs crisis, but they also see queer time, significantly, as exceeding the terms of its arrival. Queer time could be about the ‚Äúpotentiality of a life unscripted by the conventions of family, inheritance, and child rearing‚Äù (2). Queer time, then, evokes the possibility of making a life narrative that does not have to follow a straight line or stay ‚Äúon script,‚Äù and does not have to feature conventional milestones or touchstones in its unfolding. If queer time can be thought alongside automedia, within drag performances that are not about straight lives, narrative histories and straight time can come into view.Much has been written about drag as a performance that creates a public, for example, as part of a queer world-building project that shoots unpredictably through spaces beyond performance locations (Berlant and Warner 558). Halberstam‚Äôs shift to thinking of queer time as an opening of new life narratives and a different relation to time has similar potential when considering the work of RPDR as automedia, because the shift of drag performance away from clubs, parades and other queer spaces to television and the internet is accompanied by a concern, manifested in the work of RuPaul himself, with drag history and the management of drag memory. We argue that a concern with the relationship between time and identity in RPDR is an attempt to open up, through digital networked media, a queer understanding of time that is in relation to drag of the past, but not always in a linear way. The performances of season nine winner Sasha Velour, and Velour‚Äôs own preoccupation with drag history in her performances and art projects, is an indicator of the importance of connecting the twin senses of ‚Äúlife‚Äù as process and product found in automedia to performance and narration.The current visibility of drag in popular culture is characterised by a shifting relationship between drag and media: what was once a location-based, temporally specific form of performance which occurred in bars, has been radically changed through the increased contact between the media forms of performance, television and social media. While local drag queens are often the celebrities (or ‚Äúsuperstars‚Äù) of their local subcultural scene, reality television (in the form of RPDR) and social media (particularly Instagram) have radically increased the visibility of some drag queens, turning them into international celebrities with hundreds of thousands of fans. These queens now speak to audiences far beyond their local communities, and to audiences who may not have any knowledge of the queer subcultures that have nurtured generations of drag performers. Under the auspices of RPDR, drag queens have gained a level of cultural visibility that produces fascinating, and complex, encounters between subcultural identity practices and mainstream media tropes. Amongst her many tasks‚Äîbeing fierce, flawless, hilarious, and able to turn out a consummate lip sync performance‚Äîthe newly visible drag queen is also a teacher. Enacting RuPaul‚Äôs theory of identity from his song title‚Äî‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all born naked and the rest is drag‚Äù (‚ÄúBorn‚Äù)‚Äîdrag queens who in some way embody or make use of RuPaul‚Äôs ideas have the potential to advance a queer perspective on identity as a process in keeping with Judith Butler‚Äôs influential theory of identity performativity (Butler 7-16). In so doing they can provide fresh insights into the social function of media platforms and their genres in the context of queer lives. They are what we call ‚Äúnew‚Äù drag queens, because of their access to technology and digital forms of image distribution. They can refer to classic drag queen performance culture, and they make use of classic drag performance as a genre, but their transnational media presence and access to more recent forms of identification to describe themselves, such as trans, genderqueer or nonbinary, mark their identity presentations and performance presences as a departure from other forms of drag.While there is clearly a lot to be said about drag‚Äôs ‚Äúbreak out,‚Äù in this essay we focus on two elements of the ‚Äúnew media‚Äù drag that we think speak directly, and productively, to the larger question of how cultural critics can understand the connection between identity and mediation as mutually emergent phenomena. As a particularly striking practitioner of automediality, the new drag queen draws our attention to the way that drag performance is an automedial practice that creates ‚Äúqueer time‚Äù (Halberstam), making use of the changing status of camp as a practice for constructing, and mediating identity. In what follows we examine the statements about drag and the autobiographical statements presented by RuPaul Charles and Sasha Velour (the winner of RPDR Season Nine) to demonstrate automediality as a powerful practice for queer world-making and living.No One Ever Wins Snatch Game: RuPaul and TimeAs we have observed at the opening of this essay, queer time is an oppositional practice, a refusal of those who belong to queer communities to fall into step with straight ideas about history, futurity, reproduction and the heteronormative idea of family, and a way to understand how communities mark occasions, conceptualize the history and traditions of subcultures. Queer time has the potential to rethink daily living and history differently and to tell accounts of lives in a different way, to ‚Äúopen up new life narratives,‚Äù as Halberstam says (2). RuPaul Charles‚Äôs own life story could be understood as a way to open up new life narratives literally by constructing what a queer life and career could mean in the aftermath of the AIDS epidemic in the United States. His 1995 memoir, Lettin It All Hang Out, details RuPaul‚Äôs early career in 1980s Atlanta, Georgia and in New York as an often-difficult search for what would make him a star. RuPaul did not at first conceptualize himself as a drag star, but as a punk musician in Atlanta and then as part of the New York Club Kid community, which developed when New York clubs were in danger of closing because of fear of the AIDS epidemic (Flynn). RuPaul became adept at self-promotion and image-building while he was part of these rebellious punk and dance club subcultures that refused gender and lifestyle norms (Lettin 62-5). It might seem to be an unusual beginning for a drag star, but as RuPaul writes, ‚ÄúI always knew I was going to be star [but] I never thought it was going to be as a drag queen‚Äù (Lettin 64). There was no narrative of mainstream success that RuPaul‚Äîa gay, gender non-binary African-American man from the American Midwest‚Äîcould follow.Since he was a drag performer too, RuPaul eventually ‚Äúhad an epiphany. Why couldn‚Äôt I [he] become a mainstream pop star in drag? Who said it couldn‚Äôt be done?‚Äù (Workin‚Äô It 159). And he decided that rather than look for a model of success to follow, he would queer the mainstream model for success. As he observes, ‚ÄúI looked around at my favorite stars and realized that they were drag queens too. In fact every celebrity is a drag queen‚Äù (Lettin 129). Proceeding from the idea that all people are in fact drag artists‚Äîthe source of RuPaul‚Äôs aformentioned catch-phrase and song title ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all born naked and the rest is drag‚Äù (‚ÄúBorn‚Äù), RuPaul moved the show business trajectory into queer time, making the ‚Äúformula‚Äù for success the labour required of drag queens to create personae, entertain, promote themselves and make a successful living (and a life) in dangerous work environments‚Äîa process presented in his song ‚ÄúSupermodel‚Äù and its widely-cited lyric ‚ÄúYou better work!‚Äù (‚ÄúSupermodel‚Äù). The video for ‚ÄúSupermodel‚Äù shows RuPaul in his persona as Supermodel of the World, ‚Äúworking‚Äù as a performer and a member of the public in New York to underscore the different kinds of labour that is involved, and that this labour is necessary for anyone to become successful (‚ÄúSupermodel‚Äù video).When RuPaul‚Äôs Drag Race began in 2010, RuPaul modelled the challenges in the show on his own career in an instance of automedia, where the non-narrative aspects of drag performance and contest challenges were connected to the performance of RuPaul‚Äôs own story. According to one of RuPaul‚Äôs friends who produces the show: ‚ÄúThe first season, all the challenges were ‚ÄòRu did this, so you did this.‚Äô It was Ru‚Äôs philosophy‚Äù (Snetiker). As someone who was without models for success, RuPaul intends for RPDR to provide a model for others to follow. The goal of the show is the replication of RuPaul‚Äôs own career trajectory: the winners of RPDR are each crowned ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Next Drag Superstar,‚Äù because they have successfully learned from RuPaul‚Äôs own experiences¬† so that they too can develop their careers as drag artists. This pattern has persisted on RPDR, where the contestants are often asked to participate in challenges that reflect RuPaul‚Äôs own struggles to become a star as a way to ‚Äútrain‚Äù them to develop their careers. Contestants have, like RuPaul himself,¬† starred in low-budget films, played in a punk band, marketed their own perfume, commemorated the work of the New York Club Kids, and even planned the design and marketing of their own memoirs.RPDR contestants are also expected to know popular culture of the past and present, and they are judged on how well they understand their own ‚Äúherstory‚Äù of the drag communities and queer culture. Snatch Game, a popular segment where contestants have to impersonate celebrities on a queer version of the Match Game series, is a double test. To succeed, contestants must understand how to impersonate celebrities past and present within a camp aesthetic. But the segment also tests how well drag queens understand the genre of game show television, a genre that no longer exists on television (except in the form of Wheel of Fortune or Jeopardy), and that many of the RPDR contestants are not old enough to have seen, performing witty taglines and off-the-cuff jokes they hope will land in a very tight time frame. Sasha Velour, the winner of season nine, won praise for her work in the Snatch Game segment in episode six because, acting on advice from RuPaul, she played Marlene Dietrich and not her first choice, queer theorist Judith Butler (RuPaul‚Äôs). Sasha Velour was able to make Dietrich, a queer icon known for her film work in the 1920-1940s, humorous in the game show context, showing that she understands queer history, and that she is a skilful impersonator who understands how to navigate a genre that is part of RuPaul‚Äôs own life story. The queer time of RuPaul‚Äôs narrative is transmitted to a skill set future drag stars need to use: a narrative of a life becomes part of performance. RPDR is, in this sense, automedia in action as queens make their personae ‚Äúlive,‚Äù perform part of RuPaul‚Äôs ‚Äúlife‚Äù story, and get to ‚Äúlive‚Äù on the show for another week if they are successful. The point of Snatch Game is how well a queen can perform, how good she is at entertaining and educating audiences, and how well she deals with an archaic genre, that of the television game show. No one ever ‚Äúwins‚Äù Snatch Game because that is not the point of it. But those who win the Snatch Game challenge often go on to win RPDR, because they have demonstrated improvisational skill, comic timing, knowledge of RuPaul‚Äôs own life narrative touchstones and entertained the audience.Performative Agency: The Drag Performance as Resource for Queer LivingVelour‚Äôs embodied performance in the Snatch Game of the love and knowledge of popular culture associated with camp, and its importance to the art of drag, highlights the multifaceted use of media as a resource for identity practices that characterizes drag as a form of automedia. Crucially, it exemplifies the complex way that media forms are heavily cited and replayed in new combinations in order to say something real about the ways of living of a specific artist or person. Sasha Velour‚Äôs impersonation of Dietrich is not one in which Velour‚Äôs persona disappears: indeed, she is highly commended by RuPaul, and fans, because her embodiment of Dietrich in the anachronous media environment of the Snatch Game works to further Velour‚Äôs unique persona and skill as a drag artist. Velour queers time with her Dietrich in order to demonstrate her unique sensibility and identity. Thus, reality TV, silent film, cabaret, improvisation and visual presentation are brought together in an embodied performance that advances Velour‚Äôs specific form of drag and is taken as a strong marker of who Sasha Velour is.But what exactly is Sasha Velour doing when she clarifies her identity by dressing as Marlene Dietrich and improvises the diva‚Äôs answers to questions on a game show? This element of drag is clearly connected to the aesthetics of camp that have a long tradition in gay and queer culture. Original theories of camp theorized it as a practice of taste and interpretation (Sontag)‚Äîcamp described a relationship to the objects of popular culture that was subversive because it celebrated the artificiality of aesthetic forms, and was therefore ironizing. However, this understanding of camp does not adequately describe its role in postmodern culture or how some queer subcultures cultivate the use media forms for identity practices (O‚ÄôNeill 21). In her re-casting of camp, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick argues:we need to [think of camp] not in terms of parody or even wit, but with more of an eye of its visceral, operatic power: the startling outcrops of overinvested erudition; the prodigal production of alternative histories; the ‚Äòover‚Äô-attachment to fragmentary, marginal, waste, lost, or leftover cultural products; the richness of affective variety; and the irrepressible, cathartic fascination with ventriloquist forms of relation. (Sedgwick The Weather¬†66)This reframing of camp emphasises affect, attachment and forms of relation as ongoing processes for the making of queer life (a process), rather than as elements of queer identity (a product). For Sedgwick camp is a practice or process that mediates queerness in the context of a hostile mainstream media culture that does not connect queer ways of living with flourishing or positive outcomes (Sedgwick ‚ÄúParanoid Reading‚Äù 28). In O‚ÄôNeill‚Äôs account, camp does not involve attachment to the diva as a fixed identity whose characteristics can be adopted in irony or impersonation in which the individual disappears (16). Rather, it is the diva‚Äôs labour‚Äîher way of marshalling her talent to produce compelling performances, which come to be the hallmark of her career and identity‚Äîthat is the site of queer identification. What RuPaul wittily refers to as a drag queen‚Äôs ‚Äúcharisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent‚Äù (the acronym is important), O‚ÄôNeill refers to as the diva‚Äôs ‚Äúperformative agency‚Äù‚Äîthe primary ‚Äúpower to perform‚Äù (16, emphasis in original). This is the positive power of camp as form of automediation for queer world making: media forms provide resources that queer subjects can draw on in assembling a performance of identity as modes of embodiment and ways of being that can be cited (the specific posture of Dietrich, for example, which Velour mimics) and in terms of the affect required to marshal the performance itself.When she was crowned the winner of season nine of RPDR, Sasha Velour emphasised the drag queen‚Äôs performative agency itself as a resource for queer identity practices. After being announced the winner, Velour said: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs change shit up. Let‚Äôs get all inspired by all this beauty, all this beauty, and change the motherfucking world‚Äù (Queentheban). This narrative of the world-changing power of the beauty of drag refers to the visibility of the new drag queens, who through television and social media now have thousands of fans across the world. Yet, this narrative of the collective potential of drag is accompanied by Velour presenting her own autobiographical narrative that posits drag as an automedial practice whose ‚Äúrichness of affective variety‚Äù has been central to her coming to terms with the death of her mother from cancer. In interviews and in her magazine about drag (Velour: The Drag Magazine) Velour narrates the evolution of her drag and her identity as a ‚Äúbald queen‚Äù whose signature look includes a clean-shaven head which is often unadorned or revealed in her performances as directly linked to her mother‚Äôs baldness brought on by treatment for cancer (WBUR).In an autobiographical photo-essay titled ‚ÄúGone‚Äù published in Velour, Velour poses in a series of eight photographs which are accompanied by handwritten text reflecting on the role of drag in Velour‚Äôs grieving for her mother. In the introduction, the viewer is told that the ‚Äúbooks and clothes‚Äù used in the photos belonged to Velour‚Äôs mother, Jane. The penultimate image shows Velour lying on grass in drag without a wig, looking up at the camera and is accompanied by nineteen statements elucidating what drag is, all of which are in keeping with Sedgwick‚Äôs reframing of camp practices as reparative strategies for queer lives: ‚ÄúDrag is for danger / Drag is for safety / Drag is for remembering / Drag is for recovering.‚Äù Affect, catharsis, and operatic power are narrated and visually rendered in the photo-essay, presenting drag as a highly personal form of automediation for Velour. The twentieth line defining drag appears on the final page, accompanied by a photograph of Velour from behind, her arms thrown back and tensile: ‚ÄúDrag is for dressing up / And this is my mother‚Äôs dress.‚ÄùTaken together, Velour‚Äôs generic and highly personal descriptions of drag as a process and product that empowers individual and collective queer lives define drag as a form of automedia in which identity and living are a constant process of creativity and invention ‚Äúwhere ideas about the self and what it means to live are tested, played with, rejected, and embraced‚Äù (Rak 177).Velour‚Äôs public statements and autobiographical works foreground how the power, investment, richness and catharsis encapsulated in drag performance offers an important antidote to the hostility to queer ways of being embodied by an assimilationist gay politics. In a recent interview, Velour commented on the increased visibility of her drag beyond her localised performances in ‚Äúdive bars‚Äù in New York:When Drag Race came on television I feel like the gay community in general was focussed on [‚Ä¶] dare I say, a kind of assimilation politics, showing straight people and the world at large that we are just like everyone else and I think drag offered a radical different saying [sic] and reminded people that there‚Äôs been this grand tradition of queer people and gay people saying ‚Äòactually we‚Äôre fabulously different and this is why.‚Äô (PopBuzz)Velour suggests that in its newly visible forms outside localised queer cultures, drag as a media spectacle offers an important alternative to the pressure for queer people to assimilate to dominant forms of living, those practices, forms of attachment and relation Halberstam associates with straight time.ConclusionThe queer time and performative agency enacted in drag provides a compelling example of non-narrative forms of identity work in which identity is continuously emerging through labour, innovation, and creativity (or‚Äîin RuPaul‚Äôs formulation‚Äîcharisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent). This creativity draws on popular culture as a resource and site of history for queer identities, an evocation of queer time. The queer time of drag as a performance genre has an increasing presence in media forms such as television, social media and print media, bringing autobiographical performances and narratives by drag artists into new venues. This multiple remediation of drag recasts queer cultural practices beyond localised subcultural contexts into the broader media cultures in order to amplify and celebrate queerness as a form of difference, and differing, as automediality.ReferencesBerlant, Lauren, and Michael Warner. ‚ÄúSex in Public.‚Äù Critical Inquiry 24.2 (Winter 1998): 547-566.Butler, Judith.

"2018","A New Women‚Äôs Work: Digital Interactions, Gender, and Social Network Sites","This research explores social network site interaction through digital and gendered labor. Due to enhanced interaction possibilities as well as mining and analytic techniques, all digital interaction is labor, at both the social and institutional level. Responses to a survey ( N  = 455) suggest that digital labor varies depending on the most-used social network site. In addition, women test higher in agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism, and contribute statistically more emotional labor online through liking and commenting. Women describe intricate processes of deciding whether they can or should socially interact, often fearing interpersonal conflict or being told they are stupid. Men, on the other hand, view social network sites as places for entertainment and base their emotional labor on some judged entertainment value. As such, this study illuminates how social network sites function as extensions of the home. Instead of being invited to contribute new cultural products, women are frequently led to support only those that already exist, arguably creating data that contain less use value and even  more  exchange and surplus value than other forms of digital labor.","",""
"2018","Crowdsourcing as a Platform for Digital Labor Unions","Global complex supply chains have made it difficult to know the realities in factories. This structure obfuscates the networks, channels, and flows of communication between employers, workers, nongovernmental organizations and other vested intermediaries, creating a lack of transparency. Factories operate far from the brands themselves, often in developing countries where labor is cheap and regulations are weak. However, the emergence of social media and mobile technology has drawn the world closer together. Specifically, crowdsourcing is being used in an innovative way to gather feedback from outsourced laborers with access to digital platforms. This article examines how crowdsourcing platforms are used for both gathering and sharing information to foster accountability. We critically assess how these tools enable dialogue between brands and factory workers, making workers part of the greater conversation. We argue that although there are challenges in designing and implementing these new monitoring systems, these platforms can pave the path for new forms of unionization and corporate social responsibility beyond just rebranding.","",""

"2018","Beyond privacy: bodily integrity as an alternative framework for understanding non-consensual pornography","ABSTRACT Activists and legal scholars seeking remedies to non-consensual pornography (known colloquially as ‚Äòrevenge porn‚Äô) have generally framed it as a violation of privacy; however, the concept of privacy a fraught history, linked to women‚Äôs exclusion from the public sphere, denial of their sexual expression, and impunity for abusers. I argue that the concept of body integrity better maps onto the experiences described by victims, who seldom distinguish between digital representations of their body and the body itself and who often liken non-consensual pornography to sexual assault. However, a feminist approach to bodily integrity (rather than one rooted in classical liberalism) is require in order to account for the disproportionately negative consequences non-consensual pornography has for women.","",""
"2018","A Crowded Future: Working against Abstraction on Turker Nation","This paper examines digital labor and community through an ethnography of a discussion board supporting short-term digital contract workers on the Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk). First, we give a thorough overview of mTurk, the crowdsourcing marketplace, and Turker Nation, a discussion board for workers on mTurk. We trace the experience of interacting with this infrastructure on mTurk as worker and employer. Following, we look at scholarship on software infrastructure and autonomous Marxist theorizations of contemporary work. We demonstrate how the labor of participating on the discussion board Turker Nation helps to counter the abstraction the infrastructure provides. We show how workers on Turker Nation use the platform to structure time, build socializing spaces at work and initiate collective organizing. In doing so, we argue that workers‚Äô labor belies conventional class classification, such as white-collar and blue-collar labor and instead lays the groundwork for how to structure future digital workplaces. We argue that this laboring resists the assumed logic of capitalism for digital labor that subsumes and takes over workers‚Äô lives and conclude by looking at the limitations of the community‚Äôs collective organizing in terms of agreeing on points to communicated to the public.","",""

Two trends within the online pornography industry came immediately to mind. The first is the aesthetic of ‚Äúwhite innocence‚Äù as sexual fantasy that reveals a cultural conversation between the mainstream gay pornography industry and white nationalism in the United States. The second is the emergence of affiliate networks that aim to curate content for ‚Äúunique male viewers‚Äù because the internet is, curiously, awash in ‚Äúfemale-focused‚Äù content. Both of these phenomena seem particularly relevant at a time when white fragility, toxic masculinity, ‚Äúmen‚Äôs rights,‚Äù and xenophobia have been given explicit approval by the newly elected U.S. President, Donald Trump. These forces have long defined the United States, but they also reveal the way in which this presidency is uniquely awful and dangerous.¬†¬†","",""
"2018","Locating Femme Theory Online","Paying close attention to the Internet has revelatory potential for femme theory. Femme, a queerly feminine sexual and gender identity, has so far been under theorized and is often treated as unimportant or even suspect in queer and feminist studies (Martin, 1996; Harris and Crocker, 1997; Maltry and Tucker, 2002; Dahl, 2017). Work on femme has proliferated in response to this (mis)treatment of femme (Volcano and Dahl, 2008; Rose and Camilleri, 2002; Harris and Crocker, 1997; Duggan and McHugh, 1996; Nestle, 1992b), and looking to the Internet reveals a rich tradition of femme theorizing. In this paper I argue that femme theory is often produced through cultural and community forms and emphasize the potential of blogs and social media as sites of this knowledge production. Femme theory found online challenges the masculinist standards of queerness and, I argue, the masculinist standard of inquiry. I rely on a range of feminist, cultural, and queer theorists who engage with theories of epistemology to shift our understanding of the concept ‚Äútheory‚Äù itself in order to make space for femme epistemology. In addition to challenging the superiority of masculinity, hegemonic femininity and patriarchal gender roles, and defying stereotypes about femmes, femme theory also complicates several aspects of formal knowledge production. Looking to the Internet is a crucial way to locate femme knowledge and attend to gaps in feminist and queer theory.","",""
"2018","What's queer about Internet studies now?","Queerness owes much to the past, a past we can see playing out again and again in physical and online spaces.

The proceedings for the Queer Internet Studies Symposium 2 (QIS2) in Philadelphia in 2017 and the papers inspired from that gathering make up the heart of this collection. We also include a recommended reading list of sources that have inspired us in QIS. We planned the symposium and special issue without a prediction of what participants would say or do, and we were (and remain) shocked and encouraged by the excitement for making and sharing a space with, for, and about queerness.

"2018","The Internet of Bawdies: Transmedial drag and the onlining of trans-feminist and queer performance archives, a workshop essay","Like the practices of drag itself, this workshop essay has been produced in and with community, geared towards many audiences and reliant on the expertise and creative intelligence of these communities and audiences. The Internet of Bawdies is the Internet of too much body. My working description of the Internet of Bawdies is, the (forced) digitization and onlining (publication, connectivity, searchability) of previously non-digital/not-onlined (Cowan &amp; Rault 2018) ephemera of trans- feminist and queer (TFQ) community-based expressive cultures, including but not limited to drag, burlesque, kink shows, porn and erotica across medium, spoken word, slam and other text-based performance forms, and cabaret, whether is explicitly sexual or not, as well as the internet of sex work and other modes of consentual, adult online embodiment that exceed, transgress, resist or transform heteronormative, monogamous, reproductive bodies. While there are many sexes, genders and orientations in the Internet of Bawdies, here I focus on the ethics of TFQ digitization in this context. ‚ÄúTransmedial drag‚Äù is what I have identified as a method of study, knowledge production and citational practice developed on/in/of/with the Internet of Bawdies in mind. Transmedial drag are the processes involved in moving across media/mediums (for example: from live performance, to video documentation, to digital archive to online platform), which creates a sort of pastiche of the ‚Äòoriginal,‚Äô denaturalizing its status as ‚Äòoriginary‚Äô and teaching us something new about the excesses and limitations of each media form. In particular, transmedial drag is a method for ethical engagements that researchers working with TFQ in the online environment, especially re-mediating materials to an online environment, might find they are already doing. There is a story in the moving across media, and transmedial drag is set of practices to tell those stories.","",""

Michelle was trained in ethnography as an anthropologist and Jasmine and TL were trained in humanities perspectives ‚Äî mostly through literature, performance studies and art history, though about five years ago they had begun to retrain in the fields of online archives, pedagogies and networks, which has led to a new collaborative research project on digital research ethics.

The logic of Didi and taxi drivers‚Äô labour and activism in the on-demand economy"," This article examines how taxi drivers adapt to, manipulate and fight against the rise of ride-hailing platforms like Didi Chuxing in China (which purchased Uber China). Chinese taxi drivers entered the on-demand labour platforms before private car drivers. Based on a nationwide data survey, the article argues that the technological power of Didi took shape by reinforcing inequalities facing informally employed taxi drivers prior to the emergence of ride-hailing apps. Drivers, far from being passive app users, have counteracted the changes in the work environment that resulted from platformisation in new and evolving ways, from strikes to algorithmic activism. This study suggests that online platforms are contested spaces where digital labour politics penetrate beyond the purported algorithmic power of the technology. The article enriches researches on on-demand labour by deconstructing the distinction between taxi drivers and private gig drivers and by pointing to the unfolding new grounds for digital labour activism.

This study explores the nascent field of social media work through an analysis of job recruitment ads‚Äîtexts, we contend, that provide insight into a key discursive site of imagining the ideal digital laborer. Drawing upon a qualitative textual analysis of 150 adverts, we show how employers construct workers through a patterned set of features, including sociability, deft emotional management, and flexibility. Such industrial imaginings incite workers to remain ever available, juggle various roles and responsibilities, and engage in persistent emotional labor‚Äîboth online and off. These expectations, we argue, allude to the increasingly feminized nature of social media employment, with its characteristic invisibility, lower pay, and marginal status within the technology field.

The dynamics of creative industry work and the case study of the editor in publishing"," The creative industries have gained the attention of neoliberal policymakers as providing future economic growth. However, these industries are often built on precarious working conditions as a compromise for flexible and more meaningful work. This article uses a mixed-methods approach to investigate the dynamics of flexible and precarious work in the creative industries through the lived experience of the editor. The data reveal a higher tolerance to precarity among freelance workers compared to full-time workers, paired with high satisfaction levels, particularly among women. Using the editor as a case study, this article seeks to criticise the global labour trend towards flexible employment, which relies more heavily on digital networked labour that is insecure and precarious by nature and to highlight the particular vulnerability of a female creative industry workers who appear to have a higher tolerance to job insecurity.

Using ethnographic and interview data, I show how these strategies undermine the economic theory that justifies the on-demand business model. The increased freedom and flexibility on offer to workers is countered by ‚Äúsofter‚Äù and less visible forms of workforce surveillance and control. These take hold through information asymmetries, which narrow workers‚Äô decision-making capacities and thus undercut arguments for workers‚Äô designation as independent contractors. However, I also show that these forms of control ultimately hinge on workers‚Äô willingness to conform to the calculative rationalities that companies project onto them, and that workers‚Äô motivations diverge from these company assumptions. I conclude by countering the notion of calculability with that of ‚Äúqualculation,‚Äù an affective style of reasoning that workers employ in response to algorithmic workforce management and which highlights how on-the-job decisions are made within a shifting moral economy of work.

"2018","Trusted strangers: Carework platforms‚Äô cultural entrepreneurship in the on-demand economy"," On-demand labor platforms offer many in-person services, from ride-hailing to childcare. However, scholars have focused on ride-hailing, leading to a model of ‚ÄúUberization‚Äù that entails the informalization of work. We argue that online carework platforms that match nannies and babysitters to families show the limits of this narrative. Based on a discourse analysis of carework platforms and interviews with workers using them, we illustrate that these platforms seek to formalize employment relationships through technologies that increase visibility. We argue that carework platforms are ‚Äúcultural entrepreneurs‚Äù that create and maintain cultural distinctions between populations of workers, and institutionalize those distinctions into platform features. Ultimately, the visibility created by platforms does not realize the formalization of employment relationships, but does serve the interests of platform companies and clients and exacerbate existing inequalities for workers. As one of the first analyses of carework platforms, this study also points to gendered bias in the scholarly literature about the on-demand economy. ","",""

Workers, mostly located in the Global South, can now directly obtain ‚Äògigs‚Äô through online labor platforms and microwork intermediaries such as Upwork and Onlinejobs.ph. Within the Philippine digital labor economy, we see an emerging category of digital labor intermediaries‚Äîlocally called peer mentors and coaches-- who are playing a significant role in the expansion and continued uptake of digital platform labor in the country. Building on and drawing connections between earlier works on the influencer economy (Abidin, 2015; Senft, 2013; and Marwick, 2013) and on labor migration brokerage literature (Shreshta &amp; Yeoh, 2018; Lin, Lindquist, Xiang, &amp; Yeoh, 2017), the paper conceptualizes digital labor brokerage arising within various ‚Äòspaces of (labor) intermediation.‚Äô Drawing from participant observation in online freelancing Facebook groups and interviews with these brokers and digital workers, we examine the transactional nature underlying the ‚Äòproducer-audience‚Äô relationship of digital labor brokerage, the activation of trust and influence through mediated encounters, and the power dynamic underlying the digitally mediated symbolic and material power taking place between them and their respective teams. The paper seeks to contribute to the digital labor literature in two ways: 1) by characterizing the emergence of digital labor brokers in a digital labor supplying country in the global South, the role they play in the digital platform labor economy and the interventions that they engage; and 2) analyzing the structural conditions that facilitate the emergence of digital labor brokerage.","",""
"2019","THE VISCERAL EMBODIMENT OF DIGITAL PLEASURES","This panel explores digital pleasures that arise through the entanglement of bodies and digital technologies. Focusing on the digital structures and affordances that facilitate seeking, receiving and giving pleasure we analyse the ways in which intimacy is not only interactive, but also profoundly embodied. Haraway‚Äôs work in particular highlights the importance of taking seriously the nexus of human bodies and technologies and attending to the ways in which technologies not only deliver and mediate pleasure, but potentially expand upon our capacity to experience it. This panel explores how mediated practices engage the body as a site of pleasure and embodied affective intensity. Within this frame, we suggest that digitally mediated pleasures, while widely consumed, still have a hint of the ‚Äòfringe‚Äô or ‚Äòsubversive‚Äô. As well as proposing a theoretical framework for understanding embodied digital pleasures, this panel also examines specific examples of digital pleasure from sex to drugs and sound. To date the research corpus has largely focused upon the micro-social interactions of digital intimacies. This emphasis on relational intimacy puts the body into the background of the digitally mediated encounter and limits the ways in which we can talk about embodiment, sex and pleasure online. Embodied pleasure is intrinsic to the human condition, and digital media is deeply embedded in contemporary life. How these intersect is a key piece of the puzzle of what it means to be human in contemporary society.","",""

The papers in this panel each explore the kinds of approaches suited to researching queer ‚Äúde/stabilizations‚Äù in and of digital culture; that is, to projects of tracing, mapping, and making, queerer worlds via digital cultural research. ‚ÄúTrustworthy‚Äù systems are, in one important sense, systems that are relatively stable, reliable, and that work somewhat predictably. But in algorithmic digital cultures ‚Äúreliability‚Äù and ‚Äúpredictability‚Äù are not always characteristics to be trusted: digital media scholars have examined how algorithmic systems ‚Äúbuild in‚Äù, intensify, and thus stabilize a-priori discriminatory practices, cultural associations, and stereotypical representational meanings, thus helping to cement social inequalities via increasingly ubiquitous practices of quantification, as Paper 4 explores in relation to digital extracted data on ‚Äúgay‚Äù genomics and faces. On a different register, ethnographic research on youth, social media, and gender and sexuality has also evidenced the kind of stabilizations of hetero-patriarchal dominant meanings of, for example, digitally shared images of bodies, as Papers 1 and 2 highlight. Important tensions arise in digital cultural research, particularly among scholars concerned with gender and sexuality, around desires to trace, and make manifest stable, strong, and more broadly and inclusively ‚Äútrustworthy‚Äù systems, communities, and meanings in digital cultures, and the associated risks of capture and exclusion pertinent to marginalized groups and bodies (Paper 3).

Clearly, it has garnered an international reputation as ‚Äúbeing culturally tolerant of gender variance‚Äù (p. 16), in particular, for transgendered women or ladyboys. However, they are still considered marginalized in Thai society and are not well-accepted for many Thais. Since the rise of networked technology, some Thai transgender women have lived online, formed likeminded-groups, and shared support. This paper argues that their blogs serve as counter-publics for the unheard voices to be publicly visible. At the intersection of technology, identity and online participation literatures, this research extends microcelebrity literature and borrows second-wave feminist value, ‚Äúpersonal is political‚Äù to examine transgender women beauty bloggers and their blogs and understand how (their) personal is political. For this project, I had in-depth interviews with seven transgender women beauty bloggers in Thailand, taken in 2-hour period each during December 2016 and February 2017. Findings show that, Thai transgender female beauty blogs serve as ‚Äúsocial-conscience-style activis[t]‚Äù (Vromen, 2006) who build their own bodies, friend their fans (regardless of how many followers they have accumulated), and become inspiring idols.

"2019","Computer-generated pornography and convergence: Animation and algorithms as new digital desire"," This article is one of the first to consider the digital phenomenon of computer-generated imagery (CGI) pornography, a highly significant site of convergence that combines the technologies, cultures and aesthetics of digital animation, video games and pornographic film. As much of this controversial new content is produced through the hacking of licensed video game franchises, CGI pornography typifies the democratic possibilities of the digital economy. However, this bizarre digital subculture exemplifies too the tension between ludic and labour-intensive digital practises: its production is embedded simultaneously in the anti-productive play of gaming, hacking and pornography, and in the intensive, neo-liberal labour practises associated with free labour and the video game industry. This article explores CGI porn as a specific site of convergence that fundamentally alters the aesthetics and function of digital pornography and relatedly the libidinal subject that is interpolated in this crucial aspect of digital culture. The filmic genre of pornography has a long tradition of producing affective engagement through vicarious access to the material body; its evocations of veracious materiality and presence are only amplified in a digital culture of virtuality and dematerialization. This article analyses how the technological construction of CGI porn is foregrounded in its images and films, highlighting the codes and patterns of the genre and blending them with a stark revelation of the restrictions and capabilities of CGI technology. The article explores how multiple instances of hypermediacy and hypersignification in CGI porn expose and affectively engage with the fact of convergence itself: that is, revealing technological capacities and limitations of digital animation and eroticizing its interpenetration with the films‚Äô diegeses, aesthetics and representations of movement become the central function of this new cultural output. The libidinal focus of this type of digital pornography fundamentally shifts, then, away from the human body and the attempt to gain vicarious imagistic access to it through digital technologies. Instead, the labour of the animator, and the coding and characters they borrow from video game designs, become the libidinal focus of computer-generated pornography. As this new digital phenomenon uncovers and eroticizes the workings of CGI, so it dismantles the veracity and materiality promised by ‚Äòreal body‚Äô digital pornography: CGI porn‚Äôs stark foregrounding of its technological constructedness clarifies the artificiality of its ‚Äòreal body‚Äô counterpart. This article posits, then, an important new site of convergence. Pornography is a central node in the culture, politics and economics of digital technology, and the ways in which its convergence with CGI practises and video game culture has produced not just an entirely new digital phenomenon, but has fundamentally altered digital pornography's conception of the desirous subject and the material body, are crucial.

Drawing on recent work by Matzner (2016) on the performative dimensions of Big Data, I argue that Big Data‚Äôs potential to perform and create Queerness (or its opposites) in the absence of embodiment and intentionality necessitates a rethinking of phenomenological or affective approaches to Queer ontology. Additionally, while Queerness is often theorized as an ongoing process of negotiations, (re)orientations, and iterative becomings, these perspectives presume elements of categorical mobility that Big Data precludes. This paper asks: what happens when our data performs Queerness without our permission or bodily complacency? And can a Queerness that insists on existing in the interstitial margins of categorization, or in the ‚Äúopen mesh of possibilities, gaps, and overlaps‚Äù (Sedgwick 1993: 8), endure amidst a climate of highly granular data analysis?","",""

Further, by performing identities that are highly visible, are constantly changing, and engage complex forms of authenticity through modes of camp and realness, drag queens disrupt many common understandings about the users and uses of popular technologies, assumptions of the integrity of data, and even approaches to ensuring privacy. In this way, drag offers both a culturally specific framework for conceptualizing queer and trans responses to surveillance and a potential toolkit for avoiding, thwarting, or mitigating digital observation.","",""

While Cassils primarily conceptualized PISSED/Fountain as a queering of binary, essentialist understandings of gendered embodiment, I draw on performance, queer, and critical ethnic studies to illustrate that these pieces simultaneously challenge other kinds of oppositional embodiments, particularly health versus disease and citizen versus alien and/or terrorist; conceptualizations the state frequently deploys to surveil and control marginalized populations. PISSED/Fountain offer audiences a new strategy for both exposing and contesting state violence: these pieces can be read as a politically strategic disidentification with the state's classification of certain bodies and their excretions as ``deviant'' and ``toxic'' in order to purposefully ``terrorize'' the state's bio- and necropolitical aims.","",""

This article examines the ensuing discussion to understand how this group of culture workers perceived their labor, and the value they sought not just from collective bargaining, but from doing so publicly. Gawker‚Äôs unionization was aimed not exclusively at Gawker, but spoke to a vision for the entire sector. Gawker staff were motivated to collective action by the precarity that besets digital media, while the publicness of the effort was aimed at their peer organizations.

Drawing on six interviews with gender-diverse migrants and building on the concept of disidentification, I update the concept to include increasingly digital societies and new gender practices, challenge the dichotomous thinking about digital gender diversity, and stress the importance of cultural and media contexts for understanding how new gender labels are being practiced in everyday life.","",""

We examine the workers‚Äô efforts to initiate a union in their workplace as a sociomaterial process of organizing. An analysis of unionization-related Facebook pages and interviews with union activists reveals how the activists leveraged the portable-visibility afforded by social media networks (Facebook and WhatsApp) and mobile devices (Smartphones) to create and express their collective voice, achieving both mobilization of workers and recognition by management. The analysis traces how the activists tactically leveraged the portable-visibility of the media they used, fine-tuning visibility and manipulating portability during the covert and overt phases of their campaign. In the conclusion, we unpack the challenges involved in utilizing these neoliberal platforms in workers unionization efforts within the organizational setting and discuss the implications of these tensions for the study of both organizational resistance and mass protest.","",""

Qualitative research among riders suggests the presence of ‚Äòtwo Edinburghs,‚Äô or a city divided not only by its physical geography but by the navigation of risks. Riders actively discuss the strategies they use to negotiate the city and stay safe while working, and the geolocalised digital data they produce reveal the ways in which such negotiations become collective navigations throughout the city. By exploring, visualising, and mapping these navigations, this article uses unique data to illustrate how on-demand food couriers create, modify, and reproduce social space in the city. We suggest that forms of urban platform hacking, when coupled with qualitative work, constitute a powerful instrument to challenge top-down urban narratives that foreground the integrated, optimised flow of resources and labour as a hegemonic vector in the city.","",""
"2020","The winners and the losers of the platform economy: who participates?","ABSTRACT The platform economy is rapidly transforming the dynamics of the labor market. Optimists argue platform work functions as a social equalizer, opening opportunities for additional earnings for those who need it most. Pessimists suggest that the platform economy widens earning disparities by providing additional income to people who already have good jobs. We contribute to this debate by examining who participates in the platform economy and their motivation for participation, using a US nationally representative sample. Our findings offer support for both perspectives. Those who participated in labor-exchange platforms were more likely to come from disadvantaged backgrounds. By contrast, those who participated in online selling platforms were more likely to come from more affluent backgrounds. When we further examined different types of platform work, we found that different types of platform work were performed by different demographic and social groups. In addition, participation in some platform work, such as rideshare driving and house/laundry cleaning, is motivated out of necessity, while other platform work, such as selling used goods and performing online tasks, is generally used to supplement incomes. Distinct occupations tend to benefit different social groups in different ways and, taken together, disadvantaged groups are less likely to perform types of platform work that would improve their economic position and reduce income disparities. This tends to offer more support for the pessimist‚Äôs perspective. We conclude that the platform economy is strongly segregated by occupation and it should be examined as a set of distinct occupations rather than a homogenous industry.","",""
"2020","Spatially shaped imaginaries of the digital economy","ABSTRACT This paper examines spatial imaginaries and their ability to circumscribe and legitimate economic practices mediated by digital technologies, specifically, the practices of digital entrepreneurship. The question is whether alternative imaginaries and typologies of digital entrepreneurship can be included in how we view digital entrepreneurship order to stimulate new practices and imagined futures. Our case studies of digital entrepreneurs in a number of African cities illustrate that popular and academic spatial imaginaries and discourses, for example those that cast the digital economy as borderless and accessible, do not correspond with the experience of many African entrepreneurs. Furthermore, enacting the metaphoric identities that coincide with these imaginaries and their discourses is a skillset that determines which (and how) actors can participate. They reflect the inherent coloniality of the digital, capitalist discourse. The tendency in the digital economy is to regard the entrepreneur persona, as realistic and global, rather than performative and particular to the Euro-American context in which these personas have originated. Our interviews of 186 digital entrepreneurs demonstrate that digital imaginaries and metaphors cannot be neutral and apolitical. In order to be inclusive, they should evoke a sense of multiplicity, heterogeneity and contingency.","",""
"2020","The injuries of platform logistics"," In order to understand the social impact of digital platforms, we need to examine the ways in which they reconfigure space ‚Äì not only through critique of that reconfiguring but also examination of the conditions within the spaces it forms. This article offers a typology of the injuries enacted by platform logistics, taking online retail as its focus and using Amazon as an exemplar. Cognitive Injury occurs when platforms act to conceal their operation from the awareness of users. Hidden Injury is enacted on the invisible labour that sustains platform functionality, a precarious workforce that labours under harsh conditions and within hostile spaces, somewhere below the cognisance of the user. Moral Injury speaks of the way that platform logistics, in concealing from awareness the conditions that sustain its operation, attacks the ability of users, or of a society at large, to act with responsibility. These injuries are shown to be at play in the processes that facilitate buying online and order fulfilment. It is argued that the speed of purchasing and delivery enacts an unconscious consumption, which dislocates users from the labour that delivers the goods, creating a kind of perceptual pollution that diminishes a sense of moral responsibility.

Doing so is the main contribution of this panel, which brings together cases that illustrate the effects these large-scale changes in digital and medical technologies have on masculinities today. Theoretically, the panel is based on the notion that society and everyday life are increasingly intertwined with and enrolled in both the logics of the health and pharmaceutical industry and in communication technology and media. Femininities have long been the subjects for the (bio)medicalizing, and conversely, up until the release of Viagra, privileged or hegemonic masculinities were left seemingly unaffected. At the same time, to understand masculinity today we must also consider how media technologies take part in the negotiation, practice, and affect of masculinities.

Given the multiple constraints underlying collective formation among digital workers, this panel explores the characteristics and dynamics of emerging forms of collective organisation among digital workers by reflecting on experiences from China, the Philippines, Brazil, and India. Examining experiences of digital labor organisation and challenges to build solidarity across national and even regional experience, the panel hopes to enrich the discussion in terms of the politics, cultural nuances, and local meanings useful for examining digital worker expressions of resistance and solidarity amidst continuing technological development and platform reforms. This close examination of diverse forms of collective organisation, as well as the relational infrastructures underlying them, aims demonstrate how workers challenge the dominant claims of global capitalism while steep in recognition of the opportunities that these offer.","",""

While digital photographs and social media certainly existed in the years Burlesquimeras was active, it was before the two were seamlessly integrated (at least in the Mexican context) through the ubiquity of smartphones and unlimited data. That is, an online search of Burlesquimeras does not yield a significant collection of photographs that can be potentially culled or scrapped from social media. Most of the digital photographs and other ephemera, have been stored by its members in the mess or clutter of the homes and hard drives of the community members. Moreover, I explain a concept I coined: ‚Äústor(y)ing‚Äù. It is influenced by theoretical structures and praxes that challenge and expand notions of evidence, sources and the possibilities of historic narratives, such as Hartman‚Äôs Critical Fabulation (2008, 2019), Cowan‚Äôs Cabaret Methods (Forthcoming) and Navarrete Linares‚Äô use of Mesoamerican myth and cosmohistoria (2011, 2018). I propose that the very act of caring for these materials by their queer creators, albeit in a messy way, and precisely because it is in a messy way, is already an act of story-telling. I refer to this practice as stor(y)ing: a storage of materials that itself articulates a story.","",""

Following the conference theme, this presentation will focus on the use of online methods for documenting subcultural life, and online subculture‚Äôs ability to make life more liveable for marginalized subjects. In this project, I define ‚Äúfemme‚Äù as a queer identity that is marked by a critical and political engagement with femininity that manifests through one‚Äôs style and values. I used Ulrika Dahl‚Äôs (2011) femme-inist ethnography methodology to conceptualize a study of ‚Äúone‚Äôs own community.‚Äù In this presentation, I will focus on key findings about femme memes and online femme networks. My research demonstrates that through a study of a subculture‚Äôs memes, we can come to learn much about the group‚Äôs values, norms, and boundaries. Memes allow individuals to see one‚Äôs self, identity, or experiences reflected, or be ‚Äúin on the joke.‚Äù Femmes recognize the experiences specific to femme subjectivity (ie. femme invisibility) communicated through memes and feel a sense of connection with one another. In addition, my research offers further evidence of the value of online communities for marginalized subjects. The femmes in my study used online connections to combat geographical isolation, create intergenerational bonds, and even find a reason to stay alive. My research shows that the technological affordances of Instagram continue to make online communities valuable. In addition, online methods are valuable tools to develop deeper insight into existing subcultures, especially those that are marginalized in more mainstream and/or public arenas.","",""

How is data cleaning related to digitization work and AI training in prisons? This panel suggests bringing these diverse ways of laboring in the digital economies together by considering these practices as infrastructural labor that takes the shape of shadow work (Illich, 1981) and ghost labor (Gray &amp; Suri, 2019). Work and labor in modern, capitalist society imply power, authority and possibility for resistance, and these dimensions are crucial for understanding why and how infrastructures are realized and how they work. Infrastructure labor is ambiguous. It is both visible and invisible depending on the specific tasks and their inherent power relations (Leigh Star &amp; Strauss, 1999). It includes both manual and cognitive labor. It is geared towards innovation as well as repair, maintenance and servitude. The panel aims to paint the contours of infrastructural labor at the margins of digital economies pointing towards forms of alienation and resistance that have for long been part of labor relations, but that are renegotiated in the context of emerging technologies within digital economies that need human labor to be sustained and further innovated.","",""

Academic discussions on digital gender diversity suggest that the new labels either resist or reproduce the dominant gender ideology. I contribute to these discussions by challenging the dichotomy of subversion versus hegemony and demonstrating a wide spectrum of digital practices of gender diversity. Drawing on six interviews with gender-diverse migrants and building on the concept of disidentification, I update the concept to the increasingly digital societies and emerging gender diversity, challenge the dichotomous thinking about digital gender diversity, and stress the importance of mediated and cultural contexts for understanding how new gender labels are being enacted in everyday life.","",""
"2020","Data for queer lives: How LGBTQ gender and sexuality identities challenge norms of demographics"," In this article, we argue that dominant norms of demographic data are insufficient for accounting for the complexities that characterize many lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ, or broadly ‚Äúqueer‚Äù) lives. Here, we draw from the responses of 178 people who identified as non-heterosexual or non-cisgender to demographic questions we developed regarding gender and sexual orientation. Demographic data commonly imagines identity as fixed, singular, and discrete. However, our findings suggest that, for LGBTQ people, gender and sexual identities are often multiple and in flux. An overwhelming majority of our respondents reported shifting in their understandings of their sexual identities over time. In addition, for many of our respondents, gender identity was made up of overlapping factors, including the relationship between gender and transgender identities. These findings challenge researchers to reconsider how identity is understood as and through data. Drawing from critical data studies, feminist and queer digital media studies, and social justice initiatives like Data for Black Lives, we call for a reimagining of identity-based data as ‚Äúqueer data‚Äù or ‚Äúdata for queer lives.‚Äù We offer also recommendations for researchers to develop more inclusive survey questions. At the same time, we address the ways that queer perspectives destabilize the underlying logics of data by resisting classification and ‚Äúcapture.‚Äù For marginalized people, the stakes of this work extend beyond academia, especially in the era of algorithms and big data when the issue of who is or is not ‚Äúcounted‚Äù profoundly affects visibility, access, and power in the digital realm.

This article examines how freelance media workers negotiate individualism and collectivism, producing a contradictory freelance class ideology. It is grounded in an exploratory critical political economy of communication and sociology of work approach. It is based on interviews with 21 freelance journalists and professional writers, considering how they discursively construct their work practices and coping strategies vis-√†-vis their uses of digital technology and the structural factors that shape media industries. Through discourse, these workers produce a contradictory ‚Äúe-lance‚Äù class ideology as both entrepreneurs who temporarily sell goods and services and activists who temporarily resist demands from clients that they give up their rights and pay.

"2020","Brick-and-Platform: Listing Labor in the Digital Vintage Economy"," Vintage goods are valued for their nostalgic association with pre-digital modes of production, but their contemporary trafficking is increasingly organized by processes of platformization. The central component of what we call ‚Äúlisting labor in the digital vintage economy‚Äù is the online display of collectible merchandise, but listing labor also entails promoting sellers‚Äô brands on social media and using sales platforms and other logistical media to manage inventory, process transactions, and handle shipments. Listing labor is performed by branded merchants and their employees alongside independent entrepreneurs. The digital vintage economy connects brick-and-mortar shops and resale supply chains organized around flea markets, thrift shops and charity bins, estate sales, and consigners, to online clearinghouses like eBay and Craigslist, and to social media and payment apps. In this article, we argue that listing labor in the digital vintage economy further develops the concept of ‚Äúplatform labor.‚Äù We focus on vintage clothes and vinyl records, dominated by women and men, respectively, to help us analyze divisions of listing labor organized by gender, race, age, and class. We draw upon 20 semi-structured interviews with shop owners and employees and on participant observation in independently owned clothing boutiques and record stores in several US cities. The digital vintage economy provides another angle for understanding how identity-based distinctions affect the opportunities associated with platform labor, and our account of listing labor highlights the need for studies of platformization that analyze its effects on specific local economies as well as on job markets and commercial sectors.

The article first problematizes labor marginality in the context of online freelance platform workers situated in the middle of competing narratives of precarity and opportunity. We then examine unique forms of solidarity emerging from social media groups formed by these geographically spread digital workers. Drawing from participant observation in online freelance Facebook groups, as well as interviews and focus groups with 31 online freelance workers located in the cities of Manila, Cebu, and Davao, we found that online Filipino freelancers maintain active social interaction and exchange that can be construed as ‚Äúentrepreneurial solidarities.‚Äù These solidarities are characterized by competing discourses of ambiguity, precarity, opportunity, and adaptation that are articulated and visualized through ambient socialities. While we argue that these entrepreneurial solidarities do not reflect a passive and simplistic acceptance of neoliberal discourses about digital labor by digital workers, the solidarities forged in these groups also work to undermine their resistive potential such that these tend to reinforce rather than impose pressure toward critical structural changes that can improve the viability of digital labor conditions.

In this research study, I examine this narrative‚Äôs role in transgender people‚Äôs emotional well-being throughout transition. A ‚Äúgetting better‚Äù narrative was pervasive in my qualitative analysis of 240 Tumblr transition blogs and 20 interviews with bloggers, signaling that it impacted people‚Äôs self-concept both as presented on social media and when talking about their experiences. This narrative causes undue emotional harm given contrast between one‚Äôs post-transition reality, which may involve distress (despite greater congruence between one‚Äôs body and identity), and a dominant cultural expectation of happiness. I argue that an intersectional approach to understanding trans people‚Äôs emotional well-being‚Äîby considering multiple salient identity facets and life transitions‚Äîmakes trans lives more livable by complicating the cultural imperative to feel better, and to present a unilaterally positive self-image online, post-transition. Even though trans people on average feel better after gender transition, everyday realities are often in contrast to the dominant narrative‚Äôs positioning of gender transition as a process with a single, simple goal of feeling better. Challenging the ‚Äúgetting better‚Äù narrative gives trans people the freedom to live and exist in their post-transition identities, whether or not they feel ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù ","",""

A growing body of literature is concerned with the experiences of rural LGBTQ people‚Äôs experiences and their use of information and communication technologies for supporting identity and community. However, there is opportunity to better understand relationships between various information sources and how information access itself lends to the creation of queer communities. Seeing the need for a more holistic understanding of the LGBTQ information landscape, this study builds on existing work with rural LGBTQ people, and asks how do rural LGBTQ people get access to information about sexual and gender identity and how is that information embedded through the practice of circulation? Drawing from ethnographic research in a rural region of the Midwestern United States, this study proposes the concept of queer information literacy: a process through which LGBTQ people find, recognize, share, and create information related to their sexual and gender identities. Using queer information literacy as a framework, the paper shows how disparate information access results in the formation of different, and often conflicting, LGBTQ experiences.","",""

Over the years, however, this expression has evolved into an umbrella term, used to describe a variety of practices and instances concerning the broader relationship between labour and digital technology ‚Äì including paid work ‚Äì often with little or no relation to the original theory.

The analysis consider following dimensions: productive processes and work         organization, technological challenges and building platforms, use of social media to         communicate with and organize workers, and the future of worker-owned experiences. The         initiatives had very different trajectories. In Spain, some cooperatives were born from         union struggles. In France, we saw a strong relationship with CoopCycle, a federation of         delivery co-ops that provides its own software based on the principles of digital commons.         And in Brazil, small collectives and co-ops that still depend on social media platforms to         execute their work are emerging. Despite different contexts, there are commonalities, such         as the low number of workers, the central role of social media for communicating and         organizing work, and the emergence of cooperation among cooperatives, which shows that scale         does not need to be a standard in platform economies.

Though many scholars have theorized on the centrality of authenticity and masculinity to the communication of Hip-Hop artists in digital spaces, little academic work has paid very little attention to artist perspective of how this relational labor and visibility strategy helps them cultivate viable careers as influencers.

This         project is interested in questions about gender, race, labor, and platforms and seeks to         examine how Etsy articulates new formations of raced and gendered labor directly tied to The         Great Recession. While scholars have analyzed Etsy‚Äôs relationship to historic craft         movements (Krugh 2014; Luckman 2013) and to fan handicrafting (Cherry 2016), there is still         relatively little published research on the platform.

Utilizing a cultural studies framing and critical discourse and         textual analysis, I identify three main threads: 1) White women on the platform have         co-opted Black vernacular to address how economic insecurity has pushed them into gig labor         2) These products romanticize precarity by positioning feminized grit and individualized         solutions to macro economic hurdles as female empowerment 3) The products discursively frame         entrepreneurship as aspirational, liberatory, and, most centrally, compatible with white,         domestic femininities. While hustling, and its new, white appearance, is celebrated on Etsy,         we must be mindful of how hustling is always raced, gendered, and precarious.","",""
"2021","Online Labour Index 2020: New ways to measure the world‚Äôs remote freelancing market"," The Online Labour Index (OLI) was launched in 2016 to measure the global utilisation of online freelance work at scale. Five years after its creation, the OLI has become a point of reference for scholars and policy experts investigating the online gig economy. As the market for online freelancing work matures, a high volume of data and new analytical tools allow us to revisit half a decade of online freelance monitoring and extend the index's scope to more dimensions of the global online freelancing market. While (still) measuring the utilisation of online labour across countries and occupations by tracking the number of projects and tasks posted on major English-language platforms, the new Online Labour Index 2020 (OLI 2020) also tracks Spanish- and Russian-language platforms, reveals changes over time in the geography of labour supply and estimates female participation in the online gig economy. The rising popularity of software and tech work and the concentration of freelancers on the Indian subcontinent are examples of the insights that the OLI 2020 provides. The OLI 2020 delivers a more detailed picture of the world of online freelancing via an interactive online visualisation updated daily. It provides easy access to downloadable open data for policymakers, labour market researchers, and the general public ( www.onlinelabourobservatory.org ). ","",""
"2021","Swapping Gender is a Snap(chat)","In May 2019 the photographic cellphone application Snapchat released two company-generated image filters that were officially dubbed ‚ÄúMy Twin‚Äù and ‚ÄúMy Other Twin,‚Äù though users and media labeled them as feminine and masculine, respectively. While touted in most commentary as a ‚Äúgender swap‚Äù feature, these digital imaginaries represent a unique opportunity to consider what features contribute to classification of faces into binary gender buckets. After all, the commonly considered ‚Äúmale‚Äù filter makes various modifications‚Äîincluding a broader jaw and addition of facial hair‚Äîto whichever face is selected in the photograph. It does not ask and cannot detect if that face belongs to a man or woman (cis- or transgender) or to a non-binary individual. Instead, the augmented reality that it offers is a preprogrammed algorithmic reinscription of reductive gendered norms. When interacting with a novel face, humans similarly implement algorithms to assign a gender to that face. The Snapchat ‚ÄúMy Twin‚Äù filters‚Äîwhich are not neutral, but rather human-designed‚Äîoffer an analyzable projection of one such binarization, which is otherwise rarely articulated or visually recreated. Here I pair an ethnographic exploration of twenty-eight transgender, non-binary, and/or gender diverse individuals‚Äô embodied experiences of facial gender legibility throughout life and with digital distortion, with a quantitative analysis of the ‚ÄúMy Twin‚Äù filter facial distortions, to better understand the role of technology in reimaginations of who and what we see in the mirror.","",""
"2021","Gender of the Interface","For many cosmopolitan urban Germans and Europeans in Berlin in the late 2000s, social media platforms were a site where gender and class were enacted through articulations of emergent nerd masculinity or hip, ironic femininity. But these platforms, such as Facebook or Pinterest, encoded normative assumptions about masculinity and femininity in their visual and interaction design, excluding women and acceptable femininity as subjects of technological expertise. Sites that presented themselves as neutral spaces for connection and interaction, like Twitter or Facebook, instantiated gendered understandings of technology that rendered public space implicitly masculine, white, and middle class. Visually based sites like Pinterest and Etsy, in contrast, were marked as domains of feminine domesticity, representing not only a shift to visual communication but to visual modes of interaction that structured gender online. Although many young people resisted hegemonic notions of gender, their social media practices stabilized their class status as aspiring urban cosmopolitans. In this article, I consider how gender and class stabilized temporarily through material-semiotic engagements with technology interfaces.","",""
"2021","Restricted modes: Social media, content classification and LGBTQ sexual citizenship"," In the context of recent controversies surrounding the censorship of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer online content, specifically on YouTube and Tumblr, we interrogate the relationship between normative understandings of sexual citizenship and the content classification regimes. We argue that these content classification systems and the platforms‚Äô responses to public criticism both operate as norm-producing technologies, in which the complexities of sexuality and desire are obscured in order to cultivate notions of a ‚Äògood‚Äô lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer sexual citizen. However, despite normative work of classification seeking to distinguish between sexuality and sex, we argue that the high-profile failures of these classification systems create the conditions for users to draw attention to, rather than firm, these messy boundaries.

"2021","How professional photographers engage with and resist digital platform work"," While there is emerging research on the motivations of workers who engage with specific digital platforms, scant attention has been afforded to the contours of the digital economy as they affect workers in occupational or professional contexts. Drawing on interviews with 51 Australian photographers, the authors examined the extent to which, and why, photographers engage with or resist digital platform work. The photographic profession is an ideal context in which to examine such questions due to the fragmentation of the workforce and the recent proliferation of platforms. The findings revealed that the level of worker engagement is explained by platform control over price, service and product quality, and relationship management. The experiences of self-employed, freelance workers complicate our understanding of work afforded by digital platforms. Engaging with the political economy surrounding freelance creative labour, the study enables a richer theorisation of the experiences of platform-generated work in this context. ","",""

Researchers have recently begun to apply the advertisement-based framework to a new context: user-generated social media photos. Despite findings that gender display appears prevalent in such images, deeper critical examinations of how the framework changes when applied across media contexts have not been meaningfully undertaken. Drawing from the interplay of Goffman‚Äôs concepts of hyper-ritualization and commercial realism, I argue that the manifestations and interpretive implications of gender display are contingent upon the standard of realism at play, proposing a standard of networked realism that differently modulates gender display in user-generated photography. Ultimately, I suggest that gender display must be more thoroughly contextualized in networked media research and provide a groundwork for future feminist studies of visual gender stereotyping.","",""

Such bans are biopolitically charged because they effectively regulate and erase queer sexualities and genders. Newer fan-created or moderated platforms such as Archive of Our Own (AO3) and Discord receive credit for rescuing queer fanworks and communities. These platforms are developed and used in direct response to content bans, and they therefore maintain a reputation for including queer people and their works. However, biopolitics continue to perpetuate marginalisation within newer fandom spaces because they ignore inequities that intersect with sexuality and gender. In particular, platforms like AO3 and Discord continue to perpetuate racism in fandom. Using data from interviews with queer fans and platforms‚Äô features and policy statements, this paper traces how platform deaths and rebirths both respond to and perpetuate biopolitics throughout queer fandoms online.","",""
"2022","Addressing gendered affordances of the platform economy: the case of UpWork",": This study investigates UpWork affordances and their implications for female freelancers experiencing different forms of cyberviolence. Building up on a theoretical framework to situate the concept of affordances, gendered affordances and cyberviolence within a platform economy context, I use UpWork as a relevant case study to assess how online platforms that intermediate labour transactions present gendered affordances contributing to cyberviolence against women. I analysed the discussions of female users and freelancers in UpWork in line with the digital methods approach, by conducting a qualitative digital ethnographic analysis. These discussions serve as a foundation for a subsequent critical analysis of UpWork terms of service, to gain a wider understanding of how the digital platform controls information flows and models interactions between different categories of users. The findings suggest that UpWork affordances are gendered affordances, as they allow male users different conducts, as opposed to female freelancers, entrepreneurs, or users. I conclude that, while UpWork core features are allegedly neutral, they enable gendered affordances widening the gender gap in digital market transactions by facilitating the occurrence of cyber violence against women.","",""
"2022","‚ÄòOwn your narrative‚Äô: teenagers as producers and consumers of porn in Netflix‚Äôs <i>Sex Education</i>","ABSTRACT Netflix‚Äôs Sex Education both represents sex education and educates viewers about sex. From the opening scene of the first episode, viewers are positioned to see this series as one that is not afraid to represent explicitly the details of a range of sexual experiences. The series‚Äô frank depiction of sexual relationships between characters, and its exploration of characters‚Äô hopes, fears, and choices regarding ways to express their sexual desire is, arguably, ground-breaking. This paper focuses upon the ways in which the series represents young people as producers and consumers of pornographic/erotic narratives, harnessing the communication options within their social settings to develop understandings of, and share, information that is often structured as ‚Äòinappropriate‚Äô for under-18 year-olds. Sex Education sits at the intersection of information (seeking), communication, and society, as young people explore issues of crucial interest and importance to them, which have been all but ignored in most of their school curriculum offerings. Challenging a dominant social perception of sexually-explicit materials as harmful to young people, and suggesting instead that such materials may be beneficial, the series demonstrates how young people may come together to learn about themselves and each other, even as they confront the double standards of a hypersexualised society that offers no legitimate speaking position to under-18s. In this environment, with adults absent from authentic discussion, young people co-construct their future adult selves through producing, consuming, and discussing sexual content (and activities) in conversation with other young people.","",""
"2022","Intrusive media and knowledge work: how knowledge workers negotiate digital media norms in the pursuit of focused work","ABSTRACT This article analyses how knowledge workers experience and reflect upon intrusions from digital media in the pursuit of focused work. As a multitude of digital media technologies have become integral to working life, scholars have observed a connectivity paradox in which these technologies are experienced as both helpful and hindering, as integral to but also intruding upon focus and concentration. To understand this important and widespread ambivalence in digital society, we analyze qualitative interviews with knowledge workers in a range of professions. With a theoretical framework drawing on domestication theory, sociology of work and critiques of digital modernity, we highlight how workers negotiate spatial, temporal, and technological conditions, and the conflicted norms that are activated in the process. Our findings indicate that negotiations about digital media technologies come to represent psychological, cultural and social dilemmas that go beyond the individual worker, but are nevertheless experienced as individual cross-pressures to be managed.","",""

Changing perceptions of gig workers on Twitter in the onset of COVID-19","ABSTRACT While ride-hailing ridership declined in 2020 due to COVID-19 induced restrictions like stay-at-home orders, food/grocery delivery services became quasi-essential. This study investigates if and how public perceptions of gig work related to platform-based ride-hailing and food/grocery delivery services changed during the early stages of the pandemic. We collected a sample of 23,845 Twitter posts (‚Äòtweets‚Äô) related to these platform-based services within two-week periods before and after the US COVID-19 emergency declaration. Sentiment analysis on tweets was conducted to investigate changes in public perception of gig work. Tweet content was analyzed by descriptively coding about 10% of the sample of tweets manually along ten different dimensions (e.g., personal experience, informative, and about driver); then we used thematic analysis to gain an understanding about the public‚Äôs views towards gig work/workers. We tested supervised machine learning methods to explore their potential to classify the rest of the sample along the ten descriptive dimensions. The number of tweets increased by approximately 150% after the emergency declaration and became more positive in sentiment. Qualitative results indicate that tweets about negative personal experiences with drivers/companies decreased during COVID-19, while tweets exhibiting a sense of community (e.g., sharing information) and concern towards gig workers increased. Findings can inform policy and workforce changes regarding platform-based service companies.","",""
"2022","Embedded reproduction in platform data work","ABSTRACT This paper focuses on the experiences of Latin American data workers who annotate data for machine learning algorithms through labor platforms. It introduces the notion of ‚Äòembedded reproduction‚Äô: the relationship between embeddedness, the degree to which non-economic institutions and their social environment constrain socioeconomic activity, and social reproduction, or the activities that nurture, maintain, and regenerate the workforce. The analysis of 38 interviews with platform workers suggests they are situated in a highly disembedded market due to the lack of regulations on the data production process, giving free rein to platforms to set rules to their detriment. This article explores how this disembeddedness shapes social reproduction by studying three forms of collective social support received by workers: from family members, neighbors and local communities, and online groups. The support of these networks is primarily local, depends on high levels of trust, and is gendered. These findings suggest that platform data work is unsustainable from an embedded reproductive perspective since platform intermediation leads workers and local communities to carry out the social and economic risks associated with this form of gig work. This research invites a dialogue between the embeddedness framework with social reproduction as well as a consideration of the importance of nature and natural resources in the study of social environments.","",""
"2022","Beyond algorithmic control: flexibility, intermediaries, and paradox in the on-demand economy","ABSTRACT The existing literature on labor control of on-demand platforms primarily concentrates on algorithmic management. Based on the case study of Didi Chuxing, China‚Äôs ride-hailing giant, this article introduces some additional complexities into the dominant storyline by bringing two managerial elements to the fore, namely, labor intermediaries and communication technologies. Although both have long been integral to the control of flexible labor forces in the post-Fordist era, they remain underexplored in the context of the on-demand economy. I argue that labor intermediaries emerge as quick solutions to the indeterminacy of labor mobility power, a critical problem inherent in the just-in-time labor strategies that challenge on-demand platform companies. Communication technologies are crucial for the functioning of this mediated relationship, formulating a virtual space where daily managerial practices take place. Ultimately, I stress that, while the labor process of on-demand platforms represents a shift towards fluid workspace, it does not mean the elimination of the organization-based control that usually occurs in a physical and formal workspace. This case study urges scholars to understand labor control of on-demand platforms as a regime of hybridity that features both continuity and renewal of the various forms of managerial strategies common to flexible production.","",""

Aided by fieldwork, interviews, and observations of online discussions among students, we constructed reliable composite variables for behavioral and attitudinal patterns of digital communication and found that (a) participation in online forum discussion enhances labor-rights knowledge and predicts more consumerist usage of WeChat, but it does not encourage more reflections on gaming or achieve more labor-related attitudes; (b) reflective attitudes does not increase labor knowledge, but it is positively correlated with work-related attitudes; (c) there is no significant relationship between consumerist usage on the one hand and labor knowledge or attitudes on the other; and (d) labor knowledge indeed helps enhance labor attitudes.

In this study, we interviewed 20 transgender social media users to examine transgender identity management across the social media ecosystem. We found that transgender social media users curate their social media experiences to fit their needs through creating accounts on different platforms, maintaining multiple accounts on individual platforms, and making active decisions about content they post, networks they are connected to, and content they interact with. In this way, transgender people‚Äôs social media curation is not limited to their own identity presentations, but also involves curating the content they see from others and whom they include in their networks.

In the Global South, these negotiations are overlaid on an already fraught relationship mediated by the dynamics of caste and culture, to the usual politics of difference. Urban Company (UC), an app-based, on-demand platform in India that connects service providers offering home-based services to potential customers, lists professionalised services that have hitherto been considered part of a ‚Äòculture of servitude‚Äô, performed by historically marginalised groups afforded little dignity of labour.

"2023","Ayo, Bisexual Check","Introduction A 2021 listicle pronouncing ‚Äú10 Things That Are Bisexual Culture‚Äù concludes that ‚Äúclaiming that random things are ‚Äòbi culture‚Äô is the most bi-culture thing of all‚Äù (Wilber n.p.). While posed as tongue-in-cheek, the assignment of status as a signifier of bisexuality to seemingly arbitrary actions and items reinforces the notion that bi people seek a distinct visual and cultural identity and struggle to make one. We consider how creators on the algorithmically driven social media platform TikTok responded to an open-ended 2019 prompt (‚Äúayo, bisexual check‚Äù) to show off styles and accessories that project a bisexual display, and how these videos, understood collectively, contribute to the cohesion of a prototype for a bisexual social uniform. By social uniform, we refer to informally standardised clothing that identifies members of a group but lacks the bureaucratic regulation of an institutional uniform (Joseph). This lens is productive for interpreting subcultural dress norms, including those of queer identities at various scopes¬† (e.g. Nelson, ‚ÄúHere‚Äù; Stines). The development of these social uniforms can allow for stronger group coherence and provide individuals with ‚Äúself-esteem through conformity‚Äù with one‚Äôs group and ‚Äúself-regard by conflict‚Äù with other groups (Joseph 74). There is added utility to this signalling for queer people as a means to seek community and partnership against a societal backdrop of stigmatisation (Brennan). Being able to identify who is like oneself at a glance lets one know when and where one is safe to outwardly present an authentic version of oneself (Huxley and Hayfield; Rostosky et al.; Wang and Feinstein). Bisexual communities notably lack such a uniform (Hayfield, Bisexual; Hayfield, ‚ÄúInvisibility‚Äù; Hayfield, ‚ÄúNever‚Äù; Hayfield and Wood; Huxley et al.). While bi people have expressed interest in having a distinct, coherent aesthetic or set of visual markers to express their bisexuality and recognise others as specifically bisexual, they have encountered obstacles towards the establishment of such a bi uniform (Madison, ‚ÄúRepresenting‚Äù; Nelson, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù). The conception of homosexuality and heterosexuality as a binary leaves little room for the notion of bisexuality at all (Nelson, ‚ÄúHere‚Äù). In instances when people do attempt to stake a claim to a specifically bisexual visual identity, the result tends to be read binaristically nonetheless (Daly et al.; Hartman; Hayfield, Bisexual; Morgan and Davis-Delano; Nelson, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù). Attempts to visually ‚Äúsplit the middle‚Äù of established gay and straight styles have thus historically failed, with onlookers (even bisexual onlookers) either assuming the bi person in question is gay or straight (Hartman). Rosie Nelson goes so far as to contend that ‚Äúthe body of the bisexual is incapable of declaring itself outwardly bisexual to a monosexist society‚Äù (‚ÄúHere‚Äù 87). In other words, Nelson argues that a distinctly bi visual identity‚Äîa bi social uniform‚Äîmay be impossible so long as bisexuality remains invisible in broader discourses of sexual orientation and that only improved or increased representations of bisexuality in media, law, research, and culture can foment the conditions for bisexual visibility in the most literal sense (‚ÄúHere‚Äù). TikTok‚Äôs Bisexual Displays Within this context of binary assumptions of gender and sexual orientation, Julie Hartman-Linck conceived the ‚Äúbisexual display‚Äù (Hartman 39). By analogy with gender display as theorised by Lorber and building on Goffman‚Äôs construction of identity performance, the bisexual display refers to attempts to project a bisexual identity ‚Äúusing the accoutrements of gender, as well as more direct visual and verbal cues‚Äù (Hartman 43). Bisexuality is discursively erased, and even seemingly straightforward attempts to make bi identities known are often misconstrued by observers, either through ignorance (e.g., unfamiliarity with the significance of the bi pride flag) or through willful disbelief (e.g., doubt in the authenticity of bisexuality / the bisexual; see Alarie and Gaudet). Therefore, analysis of bisexual display focusses on the intended effect of the performer rather than on the actual understandings of their audiences: bisexual display offers a productive theoretical lens through which to consider how a bisexual identity is intentionally fashioned, even if attempts to fashion the bisexual identity may be misunderstood or ignored. Emiel Maliepaard, in his research on bisexual geographies, argues that bisexual spaces are ‚Äútemporal, local and (often) unplanned‚Äù (47). We identified one such space on TikTok, an algorithmically driven video-centric social media platform. TikTok affords creators a great deal of power to respond to and remix other creators‚Äô content, most prominently with the ‚Äúuse this sound‚Äù function which lets creators incorporate audio either originating from or used in another video (colloquially a TikTok) into their own (Abidin and Kaye). The memetic process of (re)using a sound with some amount of variation generates a constituency of creators and other users whose participation in the video creation and engagement process aligns with what Zulli and Zulli theorised as TikTok‚Äôs imitation publics: ‚Äúa collection of people whose digital connectivity is constituted through the shared ritual of content imitation and replication‚Äù (1882). These imitation publics in turn may spawn these temporal, local, and unplanned spaces, including virtual bisexual spaces. Here, we conducted a content analysis of 50 short videos posted in 2019 with over 1,000 likes using the ‚Äúayo, bisexual check‚Äù (‚ÄúABC‚Äù) sound, which was first uploaded in late March 2019. The originator of the sound posted a video of themselves saying ‚Äúayo, bisexual check‚Äù and then showing off certain elements of clothing and reifying or countering certain stereotypes about bi identity. When other creators subsequently began to use the sound and associated format to do the same, they constituted the ‚ÄúABC‚Äù sound‚Äôs imitation public. While there are multiple possible ways creators might have understood the prompt of a ‚Äúbisexual check‚Äù (e.g., as encouraging them to dress in a way that projects their own bisexuality; to dress in a way that projects bisexuality most legibly to other bisexual or nonbisexual people; to dress in a way that feels most comfortable to them, as a bisexual; etc.), the intention behind these videos can be understood broadly to display some bisexual identity. The simple and direct nature of the prompt (‚Äúbisexual check‚Äù) generates the virtual ‚Äúbisexual space‚Äù, both ‚Äúhighly temporal and specific‚Äù (Maliepaard 59). This space both offers an open-ended venue for creators to engage with a culture of visual identity, and maximises the potential for audiences to read what transpires in the videos as demonstrative (if not constitutive) of bisexual identity. By creating these TikToks, users are not waiting for more or better bisexual representation on TikTok but instead are actively embodying it, responding to the need identified by Nelson. Elements of the Bisexual Check At the broadest level, creators in the 50 sampled videos primarily showcased discrete fashion elements or accessories, rather than entire outfits. The structure of ‚ÄúABC‚Äù TikToks allowed creators to draw attention to specific pieces of clothing, jewelry, haircuts and styles, makeup looks, and ways of fashioning clothes (see fig. 1 for an example). This mode of engaging with the ‚Äúbisexual check‚Äù challenge differs from the mode of engagement we saw in videos using the ‚ÄúABC‚Äù sound posted after 2019; while onscreen text, closed captions, and video descriptions in TikToks posted in 2019 were primarily in English, text in videos posted in 2020 and later was mostly in Tagalog. This suggested that 2019 and post-2019 TikToks emerged from distinct and separate cultural contexts; despite using the same ‚ÄúABC‚Äù sound, they represented different imitation publics. The post-2019 videos tended to show their creators posing for one or several shots without focussing on particular elements of their outfits, instead displaying their looks as a whole. The later videos offer a useful variation in memetic content and stance (Shifman), a contrast which permits us to understand the 2019 ‚ÄúABC‚Äù videos as attempts to display bisexuality chiefly through discrete visual markers (e.g., fashion elements).  Fig. 1: A screencap from the authors‚Äô mocked-up ‚ÄúABC‚Äù TikTok in which the creator uses a fingergun to showcase their cuffed jeans. Studies of bi people in the past two decades (almost all of which have been about bi women; see Clarke et al., though see Rogers for a recent exception) have identified several ways bi subjects attempt to make their bisexuality known in the face of overwhelming invisibility. Hayfield summarised research about bi women‚Äôs fashion, documenting styles that are ‚Äúfunky, flamboyant, or associated with alternative looks and looking (e.g., hippie, Goth, punk, and so on) including through piercings and tattoos‚Äù (‚ÄúInvisibility‚Äù 180). Hartman-Linck recorded bi women using bumper stickers, pride flags and pride flag iconography, pins, and jewelry using the pink-purple-blue bi pride flag design, as well as a general playfulness with specific gendered markers (Hartman). Madison likewise found bi people using the bi pride flag design and colours on clothes and jewelry, as well as bi-specific iconography like the biangles (overlapping pink and blue triangles that generate a smaller purple triangle between them), interlocking Mars and Venus signs (‚ö§), and pun-based symbols like the ‚Äúbisexuwhale‚Äù (‚ÄúRepresenting‚Äù 151‚Äì3). More recently, the Internet has been a fruitful venue for discussions among bisexuals about a visual culture (Madison, ‚ÄúBisexual‚Äù); discourse among bisexual people on social media sites like Twitter and Tumblr has generated some seemingly novel styles and fashions that have been highlighted as specifically bi looks. A 2017 tweet about jeans cuffed at the ankles (see fig. 1) and baggy shirts tucked in at the waist being ‚Äúbisexual culture‚Äù has been mentioned in numerous popular news articles and blogs (e.g., Cao; Wilber). A Tumblr post from around the same time with images of three fictional characters sporting neck-length hairstyles cut straight at the bottoms appears to have been the genesis of the ‚Äúbisexual bob‚Äù, a bob haircut worn by a bi person (usually a woman) that received similar coverage and discussion to the cuffed jeans and tucked-in shirts tweet (e.g., Locke; Vandervalk; Wilber). Other items identified in listicles as constituting ‚Äúbi culture‚Äù include: being unable to sit in chairs ‚Äúcorrectly‚Äù, dyed pink hair, puns, Converse brand shoes, plaid shirts, outer space, (excessive) use of the bi pride flag and colours, and anxiety disorders. Within our sample, we identified an uptake of these nascent bi fashions, with 62% of videos featuring clothing being cuffed (most frequently jeans), 36% of videos highlighting shirts tucked into pants, and 20% of videos demonstrating bi bobs. More explicit iconography like bi pride flags and colours (what Hartman-Linck referred to as ‚Äúsign equipment‚Äù in her conceptualisation of bisexual display) appeared in 16% of videos, compared to more general rainbow iconography, which showed up in 20% of them (Hartman). Button-down shirts appeared in 34% of videos, and both floral print shirts and Converse shoes appeared in 18% of the total corpus. Nose piercings actively contributed to the ‚Äúbisexual check‚Äù in 12% of sampled TikToks, while a full-body dress appeared in just one video (2%). We identified no instances of biangles, interlocking Mars and Venus signs, or punny sign equipment. Display Becoming Prototype, Prototype Becoming Uniform Interpreting ‚ÄúABC‚Äù videos as bisexual displays on the individual level and conceptualising the community of ‚ÄúABC‚Äù creators and engagers as an imitation public allows us to understand the process taking place as social identity work, ‚Äúthe construction of identities for groups of people‚Äù (Eschler and Menking 2). Eschler and Menking (drawing upon Donath as well as Schwalbe and Mason-Schrock) argued that for social identities (like bisexuality), certain memes can offer prototypes: ‚Äúa set of minimal social cues that a person can use to infer other information about an individual‚Äôs social world‚Äù (9). Similarly, Joseph argued that for any complex of sartorial meaning, there is a minimal symbol: ‚Äúthe least symbol necessary to suggest a uniform‚Äù (24). By their nature, prototypes (or minimal symbols) will be limited to the fewest key elements required to demarcate a social identity. TikTok creators have the capacity to share their own ‚Äúbisexual checks‚Äù with the ‚Äúuse this sound‚Äù feature or duet other creators‚Äô videos to mirror or counter elements of the original creators‚Äô checks in their own lives. Further, even if not posting their own ‚ÄúABC‚Äù content, users have the ability to share, comment on, and like TikToks to engage with a creator‚Äôs bisexual display. Each new ‚ÄúABC‚Äù video accomplishes what Rogers identified in his research on images of bi men on Instagram: they ‚Äúadd to a discourse and visual culture of bisexuality that both describes and prescribes the visual forms in which bisexuality appears‚Äù (366). Each contribution introduces a new, or more likely reifies an existing (if nascent) indicator of a bisexual identity. It is no surprise, then, that visual indicators that had already garnered some popular support within online bisexual spaces (bi bobs, cuffed jeans, tucked-in shirts) were among the most common in our sample. Still, a fashion choice having already entered the bisexual public consciousness does not solely explain why it recurred in our sample while other choices and items mentioned in listicles did not. The userbase of creators who tend to achieve virality on TikTok skews young, white, wealthy, and female (Boffone; Kennedy), so styles favoured by bi people who share at least some of these identities (e.g., white teen or twentysomething girls and women with personal or familial wealth) are likely to recur more frequently and receive increased engagement from the broader TikTok userbase, which also skews young and female (Cyca). Anecdotally, this demographic picture of TikTok mirrored our sample, suggesting that markers posited by creators and received by users were most likely to reflect the tastes and norms of young, white, and female creators. Indeed, one of the few nonwhite ‚ÄúABC‚Äù creators was the only person in our sample to use the sound to argue against the core premise of the videos, contending that all one needed to be bisexual was attraction to people of multiple genders rather than any of the specific visual markers posed by others in the sample. While a universal ‚Äúbisexual check‚Äù is suggested by the sparse wording of the challenge, the resulting videos nonetheless demonstrate a specific racially, temporally, and culturally positioned understanding of bi identity. Just because anyone has the capacity to contribute their own vision of the ‚Äúbisexual check‚Äù does not mean that all ‚ÄúABC‚Äù videos will land with equal frequency on users‚Äô For You Page feeds (TikTok‚Äôs ‚Äúhomepage‚Äù where videos are algorithmically delivered to users; see Simpson and Semaan), nor enjoy the same volume of attention from TikTok‚Äôs userbase. Eschler and Menking consider the prototype to be ‚Äúthe least common denominator‚Äù (9), meaning that users will take the few most common elements shared amongst the ‚ÄúABC‚Äù videos as symbols of a bisexual style. That the top ‚ÄúABC‚Äù videos (those we sampled) heavily skew young, white, and female means that a bi uniform emerges from elements favoured by users sharing those demographics. Our mode of investigating this sound‚Äôs videos (moving systematically through all the videos using the ‚ÄúABC‚Äù sound from most liked to less liked) does not contravene the affordances of TikTok‚Äôs platform but is somewhat outside of the app‚Äôs environment of expected use (Light et al.), which we understand to be either scrolling through the user‚Äôs For You Page or receiving and viewing TikToks messaged privately by friends. Still, users in these settings served two or more ‚ÄúABC‚Äù videos are likely to consciously or unconsciously begin to identify the prototypical elements of a bisexual look as being those shared across multiple videos: the most frequently recurring markers creators choose to share as part of their bisexual displays reify existing styles already identified as ‚Äúbi looks‚Äù or introduce new ones to the viewer. Through the continuous and repeated proposal of bisexual looks, the prototype emerges for a bisexual uniform. These accoutrements (cuffed sleeves and pantlegs, especially on jeans, bi bob haircuts, tucked-in shirts) point towards a bi uniform that is put-together and favours clothes like jeans and button-down shirts that are commonly worn across genders. That a bisexual uniform that may be comfortably worn by members of any gender follows logically from the necessity for a bi look that is both shaped by and liable to be worn by bisexuals, who may be of any gender. Further, this bi uniform emphasises alterations that may be undertaken on items commonly already held rather than distinct new pieces that must first be acquired. This may be one reason that creators favoured these styles, rather than more blatant sign equipment like pins or shirts with bi iconography on them: they were simply more likely to have jeans in their closet than a biangles T-shirt. The creators in our sample, regardless of the specific accoutrements displayed, answered Nelson‚Äôs call for increased and better bisexual representation, building one of many possible images for how bi people can fashion themselves (‚ÄúHere‚Äù). The ‚ÄúABC‚Äù imitation public‚Äôs collagic vision of a bisexual uniform may, in the future, be adapted, rejected, or serve as inspiration for others in the endlessly cyclical process of identity formation and reinforcement. Conclusion We have sought to understand what TikTok users have accomplished through the creation of and engagement with ‚ÄúABC‚Äù videos, both specifically (i.e., what are the predominant visual indicators across the most popular videos) and generally (i.e., what processes are taking place and how they contribute towards the establishment of a bisexual social uniform). Creators are unlikely to have set out with a larger project of developing a bi uniform in mind when posting their 15-second ‚Äúayo, bisexual check‚Äù videos, but as part of one of TikTok‚Äôs innumerable imitation publics, their personal bisexual displays nonetheless offer prototypes for what a bisexual uniform could be. Any single ‚ÄúABC‚Äù video is an example of a creator using TikTok‚Äôs affordances to respond individually to an open-ended prompt, but taken collectively, a consensus about the least common denominators for a bisexual uniform begins to emerge. Whether this online effort to cohere bisexual style results in bi people being able to identify one another (and/or be identified by nonbisexuals) remains to be seen, but we hope this article provides both a useful record of styles favoured by bisexuals on TikTok in 2019 and a productive explanation of the way individual posts in TikTok‚Äôs ecosystem of imitation publics may begin to constitute a social uniform for a community whose members have historically lacked one.

"2023","Participation inequality in the gig economy","ABSTRACT In theory, the gig economy facilitates flexible, digitally mediated employment arrangements. Why do some people wind up doing gig work while others do not? We focus on how online participation inequalities, and Internet use experiences and skills, shape the composition of online gig workers. Specifically, we analyze a unique survey data set from a national sample of 1512 U.S. adults that includes information about background attributes and behaviors, detailed measures of Internet experiences and skills, as well as questions about whether study participants had completed specific steps necessary to becoming a task worker on two prominent gig economy platforms: Amazon Mechanical Turk and TaskRabbit. We use Bayesian regression to compare four stages of gig economy participation. Workers who participate in the gig economy tend to be younger, more highly educated, and more skilled Internet users. This implies that the gig economy increases labor market stratification and that digital participation inequalities compound labor inequalities.","",""
"2023","Imaginaries of platform entrepreneurship in the creative industries: techno-optimism and subversion in Ghanaian filmmaking","ABSTRACT This article examines imaginaries of platform entrepreneurship in film industries in Ghana. To understand how these imaginaries are spatially shaped and locally defined, we carried out in-depth qualitative research with fifty filmmakers in four regions of Ghana. Digital and platform technologies have long been optimistically celebrated as a way for marginalized creative entrepreneurs, particularly in Africa, to break into global markets and reach unprecedented levels of business success. However, far from being universally adopted by African creative entrepreneurs, these global techno-optimistic imaginaries are continually reworked, contested and subverted in practice. In this article, we show how Ghanaian filmmakers mobilized, deployed and resisted imaginaries of platform entrepreneurship in their efforts to make sense of their situated entrepreneurial practices and to imagine the future of their creative businesses. We found that rather than na√Øvely adhering to techno-optimist imaginaries, through their practices, Ghanaian filmmaking entrepreneurs challenged the power geometry of the current platform ecosystem dominated by major Silicon Valley players. We contribute empirically rich data on how filmmaking entrepreneurs use and imagine platform technologies, as is necessary when African digital entrepreneurs are surrounded by hype but inadequate data. We also contribute to the literature about how individual platforms and platform types have unique affordances and how these affordances are shaped by the location and socio-economic position of the entrepreneur.","",""
"2023","Mediating Queer and Trans Pasts: The Homosaurus as Queer Information Activism","ABSTRACT Libraries and archives have long been rich sites of exploration for LGBTQ+ people in search of self-understanding, identification, shared experience, and community. Yet the information infrastructures that guide every quest for queer and trans information remain silently powerful mediators of our research processes. Through an extended discussion of the Homosaurus, an international LGBTQ linked data vocabulary that the authors helped to develop, this article explores how queer information activism can confront the impoverished tools available for describing queer and trans resources. By focusing on both ‚Äúcorrective‚Äù and ‚Äúanalytic‚Äù strategies, the authors argue that the Homosaurus must work to expand the queer and trans terminology available for subject description while still challenging the structure and process of classificatory systems as always in tension with our queer aspirations.","",""
"2023","Straight and cisgender actors playing queer and trans characters: the views of Australian screen stakeholders"," A concept of visibility frames much scholarship and public writing on LGBTQ+ representation in film and television, and underpins diversity reporting and inclusivity measurement. Although visibility is often depicted as a social good, there is a growing critical interest in asking if there are different kinds of visibility, and how these might be differentially valued. This paper reports insights gained from interviews with Australian stakeholders involved in the production of screen entertainment with LGBTQ+ content. The study found that stakeholders are motivated by to create texts that make LGBTQ+ stories and characters visible. The range of approaches to visibility was, however, nuanced and diverse: some understood any LGBTQ+ representation as valuable, while others discussed visibility in contexts of character depth, anti-stereotyping, and visibility tempered by concepts of human dignity. Although visibility is perceived diversely, it remains a significant lens by which creative artists involved in LGBTQ+ texts understand their work. ","",""

The ensuing battle over the Bill between on one hand, local and international human rights defenders including Northern development partners and transnational conservative and religious norm entrepreneurs in partnership with local religious and political elites, on the other; highlighted that domestic identity and sexual politics are no longer local affairs.  Through a qualitative directed content analysis, the study explore to what degree six established Ugandan LGBT+ organizations engage with international norm entrepreneurs‚Äô attempts to influence Ugandan social mores on non-heteronormative sexuality and non-conforming gender identities, in their self-controlled digital spaces - websites and Facebook- during January 2022.  With few exceptions, digital spaces displayed a conspicuous uniform human rights advocacy rhetoric, where same-sex desires and gender identities are presented in essentialist terms as in LGBT+ and universal sexual rights, as opposed to sexual desires and gender identities as embedded and realized in a unique social contexts, that at least in the Ugandan context historically has include significant pluralism and multi-positionality. LGBT+ organizations‚Äô did not discuss the impact of waves of international norm entrepreneurs‚Äô attempts to define and influence the struggle for equal rights, and subsequent potential re-colonialization of Ugandan understandings of sexual desires outside the heteronormative model and non-conforming gender identities.

"2023","DIGITAL LABOR AND RENTIER PLATFORM CAPITALISM: REFORM OR REVOLUTION?","Digital labor has become an umbrella term for describing a range of digitally mediated practices from paid work in the gig economy (Srnicek 2017) to cultivating a personal brand online (Scolere, Pruchniewska, and Duffy 2018). This wellspring of activities now referred to as labor has muddied the waters, making digital labor an ambiguous concept at best (Gandini 2021; Goodwin 2022). This framing of user activity as labor also has limitations, as it necessarily produces reformist, rather than revolutionary, political ends.  Following Sadowski (2020), this paper challenges the conceptual framework of digital labor by re-theorizing the user/platform relation as rentier capitalism. Engels (1970) explained how tenants confront landlords not as sellers of labor-power but buyers of a commodity, and we argue that typical social media users confront platforms in an analogous way. Platforms thus only circulate existing value rather than create it, and this distinction matters in understanding their role in economic crises.  Because the digital labor concept misidentifies the user/platform relationship and concedes the commoditization of communication, reformist demands emerge from this discourse, like ‚ÄúWages for Facebook‚Äù (Ptak 2014 as cited in Jung 2014) or data ownership as compensation (Chakravorti 2020). Capitalist data relations (Couldry and Mejias 2020) and the profit motive of corporate platforms cannot be addressed by renumerating users. As platforms attain infrastructural status (Plantin et al. 2018), our politics must reflect the need for their transformation into public utilities with democratic accountability, a revolutionary demand that has been displaced in the turn towards digital labor.","",""

At the same time, the Chinese-style market economy and state-led platformization have spawned a unique platform ecology, shaping Chinese digital creative industries and labor subjectivity in its own unique way.  This study contributes to digital entrepreneurship in a non-Western context by exploring the characteristics and risks of Chinese digital laborers amid state-led platformization. Through a qualitative analysis of 203 recruitment advertisements of major MCNs in China, the finding reveals that Chinese digital laborers are trapped in a state/capitalist duopoly. On the surface, recruitment advertisements posted by MCNs create a low-threshold, flexible working environment. But in essence, they reflect the precarious working conditions of contemporary digital laborers under MCNs‚Äô systematic business model. In a crude way, MCNs transformed digital entrepreneurs who previously relied on self-promotion into aesthetic laborers in front of the camera. At the same time, laborers behind the camera are a group of playful workaholics at great risk of being exploited for free. They are compelled to involuntarily internalize the pressures of hyper-productivity and undertake trivial emotional labor. Beyond the risks of the platformed digital economy, I argue that digital laborers of MCNs have become a form of state labor that is expected to contribute to national development agendas while embodying the national character that the state promotes.","",""

Unlike other forms of participation in the realm of society that happens on and via the Internet, participating as an independent contractor in an online labor market does not only depend on individual access to technology, knowledge, motivation, and skills, but also on the preferences and biases of both the hiring party and the mediating platform. We conduct a scoping review to examine how the existing body of literature has approached inequality, discrimination, and bias with regards to paid online labor. Conceptualizing online participation as a multistage process, we build a model of participation and success in the online labor market as a pipeline. Based on a comprehensive set of studies collected via five academic databases, we map prior literature across the pipeline‚Äôs stages of becoming an independent contractor and find that most of the prior literature focuses on later stages, such as having been hired.

"2024","Personalised Progressive Porno","Introduction The year 2018 saw drastic shifts in fan spaces where fan works, such as art, fiction, and videos, were once widely, openly shared, including those containing sexually explicit content, a.k.a. porno. Major catalysts were the highly contested United States legislations Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA) and Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA), which addressed the liability of host sites for content shared by users. Shortly after, similar legislation appeared around the world, including Australia‚Äôs Online Safety Act 2021. In response, Websites once popular with adolescents, which were well known for the proliferation of fan works, reconfigured their terms and conditions to exclude porno. This ousted previously thriving communities, especially lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other related communities (LGBTQ+), who feared overcorrections would be exclusionary of content about sexuality and gender, broadly. This begs the questions, what drives this kind of legislation and how might it impact LGBTQ+ adolescents who often have fewer spaces for identity exploration? Building upon work by other researchers, this article asserts that there may even be potential benefits to the types of personalised and progressive pornos shared in online fan spaces, related specifically to identity development, sex education, and representation.¬† Fandom and Porno Fan works make up a critical portion of the digital landscape that adolescents around the globe interact with every day. While not all fan works are pornos, sexually explicit material does exist on many platforms used by fans to share these transformative works (TW), including platforms which largely appeal to young people despite an overall mixed-age user base (McLelland 108‚Äì109). A fan work is considered transformative when it alters canonical events (what actually happened) in a franchise, or real life, in some meaningful way (Jenkins 47‚Äì48). TWs, unlike mainstream porno, have the benefit of being more personalisable, as they are created by fans, for fans, usually with some ability to interact with the material via embedded engagement features on the social media sites where works are hosted (McInroy and Craig, It‚Äôs Like 242‚Äì243). Also, unlike mainstream porno, fan-produced porno (FPP) has historically been created and shared by women, often utilising third-wave feminist critique to address sexual agency and shift away from the male gaze, thus creating more space for discussions about consent and sexual freedom (McLelland 111). FPP is additionally more likely to explore transformative elements that are more inclusive of LGBTQ+ content creators (McInroy et al. 632‚Äì633). While fan-produced TWs, including FPP, can be based on anything around which fandoms form, media properties most likely to inspire these works typically hold less connection to the real world, such as those based in fantasy, science fiction, and the supernatural (Hardin). This is because media properties already removed from reality more easily lend themselves to transformation. Further, the worldbuilding elements of these genres already address themes of body, agency, and belonging that women and LGBTQ+ fans are unlikely to find in other mainstream media, porno or otherwise. In spaces where adolescents are consuming FPP, they are not just passively being imprinted upon by sexually explicit material. Rather, adolescent fans contribute towards critical discussion and self-exploration via their own active production and distribution of porno through TWs (McLelland 103; McInroy and Craig, It‚Äôs Like 240). This differs from mainstream porno, which is produced by studios for adult-only audiences, often relying heavily on the male gaze and regressive tropes about sex, gender, and sexuality which do not explore agency, nor emotional or physical safety. This is not to lambast mainstream porno, simply to state that most of it is not produced with women or LGBTQ+ people‚Äôs specific wants and needs in mind. Mainstream porno, unlike fan works, is also not made with intent to heavily interact with its fans in the same way, in most cases. It certainly does not intend to interact with young fans, as that would clearly violate related legislation. There are porno conventions, just as there are pop-culture fan conventions, but fannish behaviour and critique is culturally distinct in both. FPP, by contrast, is both interactive and benefits from being about fictional characters, meaning it has the potential to subvert some, though not all, labour and obscenity laws (McLelland 109). Ostensibly, if the subjects of the work are not real, they cannot be exploited, creating a different ethical landscape from that of mainstream porno, including ethics related to consumption by minors. Fan-Produced Porno and Law Laws related to youth and porno are relatively new, showing up en masse in the 1970s and evolving based on contextual factors dictating the role of children in social life (McLelland 103‚Äì107). Legislation is also commonly intertwined with anti-porno social movements, with the dawn of laws against porno in the 1970s occurring, in part, through the split of anti-porno and pro-porno feminism (Bracewell). According to Lim et al., several academics have noted that ‚Äúsupporters of censorship of pornography historically have been more likely to be older, female, religious, sexually or politically conservative, more likely to show gender role stereotyping, and less likely to have ever seen pornography‚Äù (669). This is important because, as previously noted, fan works may be intended to directly challenge moralistic discourse in favour of third wave, pro-porno, feminist schools of thought, which tends to run counter to viewpoints of the above groups of people in every way except the overlap with higher interactivity of women. One of the first high-profile cases brought to court involved imagery fitting the definition of a TW. The image in question was a sexualised illustration of Rupert the Bear, a then-popular children‚Äôs character, published in Oz Magazine in an issue for young people by young people (McLelland 102‚Äì103). The artist, a fifteen-year-old boy, noted during the 1971 court case against the magazine‚Äôs editors that he drew it specifically as a countercultural statement designed to challenge the hypocrisy of the very adults it appeared to offend (McLelland 103). A major criticism of obscenity laws, in addition to being anti-feminist or anti-counterculture, is they are too contextual, and thus may over-reach without actually protecting youth at all (Al-Alosi 159), as was critiqued in the above case (McLelland). Consequently, recent attempts at legislation have focussed heavily on trafficking and other potential harms that are less politically divisive. The early 2000s and 2010s saw moral panics and Website-specific strikethroughs related to minors‚Äô online citizenship and FPP (Hunting, McLelland), but without sweeping, associated legislation until 2018. While new laws were implemented throughout the world, over several years, the beginning of the end for Websites hosting FPP, specifically, started in the US with SESTA/FOSTA. The original intent of both acts was said to be reduction in human rights violations, specifically human trafficking. In her review of the history and implementation of SESTA/FOSTA, Cotterill notes that proponents claim exorbitant decreases in trafficking as a result of the legislation, yet fail to look at the full picture, ignoring ways in which business simply moved from one site to the next (28). She also points out the reality that the biggest drop came when Backpage.com, a main focus of the legislation, was taken down, something that occurred before SESTA/FOSTA were passed, accomplished through existing legal actions that did not require additional legislation. Despite this, similar laws were enacted elsewhere, including Australia‚Äôs Online Safety Act 2021. One of the Websites impacted upon the most by anti-porno and trafficking legislation around the globe was Tumblr. In 2018, Tumblr was one of the most heavily utilised sites for fanworks and LGBTQ+ communities (Byron 338‚Äì347). The implementation of SESTA/FOSTA led to Tumblr overhauling their terms and conditions to ban FPP (Pilipets &amp; Paasonen 472). While Tumblr does still exist at the time of writing this article, it no longer occupies the same space in the cultural milieu of fandom communities, which now favour newer sites like Archive of Our Own (Ao3) and Discord, with features created to bypass legislation (Floegel 90). While these sites evolved to subvert government censorship, it is important to note that their design approaches do not always do well to protect adolescents against other potentially harmful biopolitics, such as racism (Floegel 92). More recent debate about laws impacting on FPP, especially in online spaces, centres on laws which target the use of fictional characters specifically. Given that TWs, by definition, utilise pre-existing characters and sometimes depictions of real people, it is difficult to detangle fan works from the intended target of many of these laws, which have largely arisen in response to anonymous deep-fakes, or other imagery created using artificial intelligence (Popova, Reading). Certainly, there are ethical dilemmas worthy of public and legal debate with regards to the likenesses of celebrities and other public figures, used without permission, in sexually explicit renderings. However, when overly restrictive laws are put into place, especially with regards to fictional characters, adults may, intentionally or unintentionally, limit the agency of young people and adults alike to engage in meaningful social commentary and discourse (McLelland 113‚Äì115). Retrospective analysis of existing laws also suggests that they are largely ineffective due to underutilisation, as well as legal loopholes that stop prosecutors from successfully charging social media and Internet sites (Cotterill 27‚Äì28). Further, sex workers‚Äô rights and advocacy groups assert that SESTA/FOSTA do more harm than good, taking down Websites these workers use to maintain social networks which can be leveraged to improve safety on the job (Cotterill 28). Legislation also does not appear to recognise, nor express interest in, the voices of young people in online content creation and dissemination, creating legislation based on dominant moral interests of adults as opposed to seeking evidentiary support of real harm (McLelland 107‚Äì114). Investigating Harms of Porno Perhaps one of the most important questions about porno, including FPP, is whether it actually causes harm, necessitating legislation. Attwood et al. note relatively little academic evidence that access to porno is universally harmful to young people, and identify ways anti-porno discourse misses opportunities to delve into responsible consumption as part of normative sexual development (3753). In a systematic review, Vertongen et al. found that ‚Äúresearch has functioned under highly homogenised presumptions about adolescent pornography use and its effects‚Äù, meaning results about the potential harms of porno are inconclusive at best (430). These authors discuss that what has been found suggests¬† that adolescent engagement with porno is variable across time, as well as interrelated with sexual and social maturation (433). They also note that, while some adolescents appear to use porno to inform real-life sex practices, this is not without the same speculation and critique used by adults who purport youth need to be protected from that which they do not yet understand (438). On the contrary, youth seem to understand the difference between porno and real-life sex just fine. Lastly, the authors note that when harm is present in the research, it is most often correlated with pre-existing comorbidities and dispositions in relation to violent behaviors (436). In other words, some young people probably shouldn‚Äôt consume violent porno, but risk is most prevalent for those who are already predisposed to enact violence for other reasons. There does appear to be some correlation between age of first sex and exposure to porno, though in a recent systematic analysis, Pathmendra et al. explain that most studies showing this contain substantial enough limitations, in both design and measurement, that causal inference cannot be made (5). It is also important to consider what young people themselves are saying about porno. In a synthesis of thirty qualitative studies on young people and porno, Peterson et al. found use of porno by young people was considered normative, with utilities related to ‚Äúpleasure, information, and instruction in the absence of sufficient sexuality education‚Äù (171). Distress caused by porno was specific to microaggressive, misogynistic, and violent content (195). Youth in the studies analysed reported a lack of spaces to discuss what they viewed with trusted adults, thus leaving little room for corrective experiences when harm did occur (195). To be clear, the issue here was not consumption of porno, but the inability to then discuss with trusted adults. According to Lim et al., in a survey of Australian youth, the majority do believe in some, reasonable legislation, and do recognise that pornography may be harmful to some, but not all, people (668). The majority of support for legislation in the study centred on reducing depictions of violence and increasing the visible use of safer sex practices (668). It should be noted that violence is sometimes a recurring theme in certain genres of FPP. However, in many cases, violence in these pornos is more contextualised (Popova, Dubcon) than it would be in mainstream porno, and can be largely avoided by utilising filters on newer host sites. With little evidence of universal harm caused by porno, one might ask a secondary question ‚Äì whether social media, through which FPP is shared, are harmful. Despite popular discourse suggesting they are, research findings are nuanced. According to Valkenburg et al., there is some consensus that active social media use (e.g., engagement) may have benefits over passive social media use (e.g., scrolling), with passive social media use being more apt to cause harm (530‚Äì531). Similar to studies about the harms of pornography, however, these authors note that studies about social media use are theoretically flawed and fail to capture the full scope and diversity of use (544). In a qualitative investigation of social media use by young people in Australia, Cooper et al. note scholarly work recognising that ‚Äúadolescents and young adults develop their identities, aspirations, social supports, and autonomy via online social networks, and nurture intimate peer relationships‚Äù (536). These authors also note that online and offline relationships appear interrelated (549‚Äì551). All this suggests that social media, like porno, may be playing a normative role in the lives of adolescents, which adults should seek to better understand as opposed to broadly legislating against. Investigating Benefits of Fan Produced Porno One potential benefit of FPP is its utility as an educational tool, especially among LGBTQ+ young people. Delmonaco and Haimson found that youth already rely on online spaces, such as those containing FPP, to obtain accurate information about sexual health (832). Gameson et al. investigated the roles of online sex self-education by teens through use of porno vs. classroom education, and found that while straight participants were more likely to search for information on pleasure and entertainment, LGBTQ+ teens were more likely to search for information related to identity discovery, confirmation, and affirmation, things not necessarily covered by school curriculum on sex education (461). Importantly, teens in this study also explored material within both spheres in dynamic ways which built off one another (481‚Äì484). This suggests a role for FPP as a dynamic tool, rather than an obstacle to formal education. McInroy et al. found additional evidence that LGBTQ+ youth utilise online fandoms to more safely explore identities, as well as challenge/transform popular narratives about identities, both through social media discourse and TWs such as FPP. McInroy and Craig found LGBTQ+ youth who participate in fandom also reach identity milestones earlier and quicker and use a broader variety of sexual and gender identity labels (Online 187‚Äì191). Further, due to widespread challenges to healthcare access for LGBTQ+ youth, social networks like these appear to be important in circumventing geopolitics in order to receive necessary health care (Edenfield et al.). Dym et al. found that online fanfic spaces also self-organise in a way that supports trauma recovery through the construction of shared narratives, thus additionally offering a structure for informal mental health support (5). Through qualitative analysis of 3,665 survey respondents, McInroy et al. discovered that, while imperfect, those engaged in online fandom communities found they offered more realistic depictions of queer life and sex than mainstream media (637‚Äì638). Using the same data set, McInroy and Craig found that fandom specifically offered LGBTQ+ people safe, customisable experiences which greatly benefit this marginalised population (It‚Äôs Like 239‚Äì240). These authors noted, even for those who reported fandom did not contribute to LGBTQ+ identity development, fandom participation was seen as valuable (242). Transgender and gender-diverse people specifically appear, through fandom communities and TWs, to explore beyond the ‚Äúwrong body narrative‚Äù to more holistically explore body politics and transgressive experiences of bodies not otherwise represented broadly in media or the classroom (Duggan &amp; Fasekas). This ability to safely explore has real-world implications that translate into medical and mental health interventions, which often rely on an individual‚Äôs ability to explore gender and body in order to make informed medical decisions. There also appears to be a broader societal benefit to FPP. Enriquez and Lippert argue FPP is worthy of both study and archiving, especially given the role of women and gender-diverse people in producing content which presents important dialogues about sexuality and gender, and unquestionably contributes to the proliferation of genres like science fiction in popular media. They specifically cite how once-banned pornographies in the US are now considered commodities among book archivists, arguing that FPP has similar cross-cultural value as an artifact (193). Like others, they note ways in which fandoms increase diverse representation through the production of fan works, something Cook and Joseph note can translate into real-world fan activism that results in changes to mainstream media (56‚Äì57). Conclusion With little evidence of widespread harm caused by porno broadly, and emerging evidence of the importance of FPP in normative development, education, and representation in the digital age, especially for LGBTQ+ youth, legislators and researchers alike should consider who the rule of law in anti-porno legislation is really protecting. We encourage more reasonable legislation and other safeguards based on evidence, not emotions, drawing on needs expressed by young people themselves, who should be seen as both active consumers and producers of FPP. To accomplish this, better research is needed which considers nuances of porno use, the role of TWs, and the collective perspectives of adolescents who engage with porno. With this, safe consumption of porno, including FPPs, could be incorporated into classrooms and other dialogues with trusted adults, offering a nonpunitive option that may be more effective than legislation which has largely failed.

"2024","Scenes of life's work: Migrant platform workers‚Äô struggles over social reproduction in the context of welfare state bordering in Finland"," Platformised services allow affluent others to socially reproduce themselves while reinforcing the barriers to reproduction for migrant workers. Drawing on participant observation and interviews with male migrant food couriers attempting to make a living in Helsinki, the article examines how the social reproduction of migrant platform workers‚Äô labour power is shaped in the interstices between food delivery platforms and bordering processes. Through the notion of life's work, the article analyses how the couriers construct their lives around gig work, highlighting their agency in handling their life, labour and legal status. The argument put forth is that migrant platform workers‚Äô social reproduction is not merely barred but reshaped in the intersection between, on the one hand, being subjected to the labour platform and welfare state bordering and, on the other, the subjective efforts through which migrants manage their life-making practices, revealing a mutual but contentious interdependence between labour platforms and migrant workers. The article enhances current understanding of the structural factors impacting migrant workers beyond just the platform itself, around which struggles emerge and which enable the extractive operations of platform capital.

This article examines all 22 collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) of one such union, the Writers Guild of America, East (WGAE), which were ratified between April 2015 and June 2022, with an eye toward better understanding employee digital job and life satisfaction. Bringing together critical political economy of media, industrial relations, and labor research, the article argues that the collective bargaining agreement is a communicative means through which digital newsworker unions express employee resistance to particular labor issues. It is also a legal mechanism articulating solutions to these issues that could provide the basis for employee life satisfaction. Grounded in a content analysis, this article finds that the WGAE CBAs incorporate language on workplace rights, newsworkers‚Äô benefits, and limits on management rights, revealing the relative weight of different union solutions to newsworkers‚Äô digital-era grievances. The CBAs also communicatively constitute the conditions for digital newsworkers‚Äô happiness and subjective well-being. By proposing a relational model of digital newsworkers‚Äô CBAs, researchers and practitioners could better understand the language that is needed to communicatively constitute and facilitate happiness in newsrooms, supporting digital job and life satisfaction among newsworkers.

"2024","Deeply embedded wages: Navigating digital payments in data work"," Many workers worldwide rely on digital platforms for their income. In Venezuela, a nation grappling with extreme inflation and where most of the workforce is self-employed, data production platforms for machine learning have emerged as a viable opportunity for many to earn an income in US dollars. Data workers are deeply interconnected within a vast network of entities that act as intermediaries for wage payments in digital currencies. Past research on embeddedness has noted that being intertwined in multi-tiered socioeconomic networks of companies and individuals can offer significant rewards to social participants, while also connoting a particular set of limitations. This paper provides qualitative evidence regarding how this ‚Äúdeep embeddedness‚Äù impacts data workers in Venezuela. Given the backdrop of a national crisis and rampant hyperinflation, the perks of receiving wages through financial platforms include accessing more stable currencies and investment outside the national financial system. However, relying on numerous intermediaries often diminishes income due to transaction fees. Moreover, this introduces heightened financial risks, particularly due to the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrencies as an investment. This paper evaluates the effects of the platformization of wages and its effect on working conditions. The over-reliance on external financial platforms erodes worker autonomy through power dynamics that lean in favor of the platforms that set the transaction rules and prices. These findings present a multifaceted perspective on deep embeddedness in platform labor, highlighting how the rewards of financial intermediation often come at a substantial cost for the workers in precarious situations.

"2024","Designing for justice in freelancing: Testing platform interventions to minimise discrimination in online labour markets"," Online labour markets (OLMs) are a vital source of income for globally diverse and dispersed freelancers. Despite their promise of neutrality, OLMs are known to perpetuate hiring discrimination, vested in how OLMs are designed and what kinds of interactions they enable between freelancers and hirers. In this study, we go beyond understanding mechanisms of hiring discrimination in OLMs, to identifying platform design features that can minimise hiring discrimination. To do so, we draw on a methodology guided by the design justice ethos. Drawing on a survey on UK-based freelancers and interviews with a purposefully drawn sub-sample, we collaboratively identify five platform design interventions to minimise hiring discrimination in OLMs: community composition, identity-signalling flairs, text only reviews, union membership, and an antidiscrimination prompt. The core of our study is an innovative experiment conducted on a purpose-built, mock OLM, Mock-Freelancer.com. On this mock OLM, we experimentally test mechanisms of discrimination, including how these mechanisms fare under the five altered platform design interventions through a discrete-choice experiment. We find that both community and flairs were important in encouraging the hiring of women and non-White freelancers. We also establish that anonymity universally disadvantages freelancers. We conclude with recommendations to design OLMs that minimise labour market discrimination. ","",""
"2024","Delivery riders‚Äô cultural production in Spain: A thematic analysis of their self-representation on YouTube"," This study analyses YouTube videos about delivery riders in Spain as well as the channels in which the videos were uploaded. The aim is to understand the ways that riders are represented in the videos and determine the labour imaginaries that emerge in the context of platformization, which includes work that depends on platforms that use computer architecture and automation systems to arrange exchanges between people, goods, and corporations, such as the work of delivery riders. This article shows how platformization of labour intersects with cultural production because delivery riders‚Äô work has become a video theme in the YouTube platform. Moreover, in some cases riders (or aspiring ones) use YouTube and other social media to interact, share knowledge and organize their job. Based on a thematic analysis of delivery riders' YouTube videos ( n = 40) from 26 channels mined with YouTube Data Tools, this study presents a typology of channels in which riders appear. It also categorizes the main representations of riders as well as the imaginaries that emerge about this type of labour in YouTube videos. The analysis indicates that delivery riders‚Äô work has a transitory nature, which is expressed in the analysed videos. Moreover, the study demonstrates that immigrants are the people who tend to do this type of work in Spain, and shows how being an immigrant plays a particular role in the way riders are represented or gain their social conceptions and aspirations about this kind of work.

Ride-hailing drivers‚Äô use of humour and memes on Facebook groups"," In this article, we focused on data drawn from two Brazilian Facebook groups that discuss on-demand driving (Uber and 99Pop). We focus particularly on the use of humour in the stories that on-demand drivers (ride-hailing) share, as it was identified that humour is widely used within these groups. This article has three objectives: (1) to detect the types of stories shared by on-demand drivers in the Facebook groups; (2) to determine the relationships these stories have with the work of on-demand driving; and (3) to understand the dimensions of professional identity and negotiation of platform labour conditions. Therefore, three dimensions of the stories shared by on-demand drivers were identified: the relationships they establish with their clients, their relationships with the platforms (the affordances and limitations the platforms provide and represent), and the everyday work relationships among the drivers developed by establishing Facebook as a digital workspace. These dimensions lead to the formation and negotiation of their professional identity and reveal how they deal with precarity through humour. ","",""
"2024","Cooperative solidarity among crowdworkers? Social learning practices on a crowdtesting social media platform"," The paper analyzes social interactions among crowdworkers on Discord. The explored crowdtesting platform uses this social media platform to offer their crowdworkers various opportunities for work-related and private communication and to host events that encourage learning practices. The paper investigates to what extent the interactions on Discord can be analyzed as social learning practices and can be understood as a specific form of solidarity among crowdworkers. In an explorative online ethnographic study, two learning related channels of the platform company‚Äôs Discord server were observed: the question channel in which testers can ask for help, and the quiz channel in which a testing related quiz event takes place. Additionally, interviews with moderators and crowdtesters were conducted. The observation of learning practices on Discord makes clear that the social media tool is mostly used by testers for situational and functional information exchange like helping each other with bug classifications or solving technical problems. Testers mostly provide each other with brief information that can directly be applied in the work context. Further information are mainly shared by moderators that offer supplementary explanations as a possibility to self-help. The study highlights that a form of weak cooperative solidarity emerges among testers as they support each other via Discord to fulfill individual work tasks. This differs from resistant solidarity in other contexts of platform work, because in the observed case, platform workers‚Äô solidarity is not directed against the platform company. ","",""
"2024","Exposing the mess in the online kitchen:<i>Bon Appetit</i>and digital continuities in legacy media‚Äôs workplace exploitations","Traditional media‚Äôs convergence with online media platforms intensifies the already unpaid and unrecognized affective, immaterial and emotional labor expected of women of color and other historically marginalized media workers. This article uses the example of Bon Appetit (BA) and the downfall of their popular YouTube channel to argue that understanding this intensification is critical to envisioning possibilities for media workers to address exploitative working conditions. In the wake of Black Lives Matter uprisings in the summer of 2020, Black and Brown women food writers took to social media to point out that while BA profited from portraying a diverse workforce on their YouTube channel, the reality was very different. At the time, popular press and social media discourse largely attributed these issues to entrenched histories of racialized and gendered discrimination in legacy media. However, recent research on online platforms has engaged feminist studies, Black studies, and critical STS epistemologies to demonstrate that intersectional oppressions based on race, gender, class, and sexuality are reinscribed in the labor and technical infrastructures of platforms. Together, theorizations of the racialized and gendered aspects of unpaid and unrecognized labor alongside research on the biases reinscribed into algorithmic and internet platform infrastructures inform my analysis of a variety of texts related to the BA YouTube channel: BA YouTube channel metadata and videos, advertising trades coverage of Conde Nast‚Äôs digital media efforts, popular press coverage of the racial reckoning at Conde Nast and BA, and disclosures about BA and Conde Nast workplace cultures shared in public interviews by BA workers. By analyzing these texts together, I argue that the downfall of the BA YouTube channel demonstrates how media convergence and the platformization of legacy media intensifies racialized and gendered inequalities for media workers, but opportunities to publicly disclose these discriminatory workplace dynamics also galvanize worker organizing.","",""
"2024","Partners or workers? Mexican app deliverers on YouTube and TikTok"," This article seeks to understand how app delivery workers construct their collective identity through the digital platforms of YouTube and TikTok. Said identity construction occurs in the context of the social controversy surrounding their status as workers without labor rights or as independent partners of digital platforms. To this end, we collected 977 videos and their metadata and analyzed them via cross-platform digital methods. The findings reveal that app delivery workers construct their collective identity through the interplay of two factors. The first is the identity narratives created by delivery workers as video bloggers. The second is the recognition narratives created by different associated actors, such as accountants, media, universities and research centers, and content creators. Through these interactions, the narrative of delivery workers as independent partners acquires more algorithmic strength and visibility than those that discuss their status as employees and their lack of labor rights. Audiovisual technology also works as an instrument to reach individual agency and face the precariousness of daily life. ","",""
"2024","Delivery workers‚Äô visibility struggles: Weapons of the gig, (extra)ordinary social media, and strikes"," How do we interpret the extraordinary visibility and ordinariness of social media as delivery workers resist their precarious working lives? Drawing on fieldwork, interviews, photo elicitation, and digital data collection in Turkey with a focus on delivery workers‚Äô strikes in early 2022, we argue that understanding the delivery workers‚Äô movement requires not only considering spectacular strikes and social media protests but also workers‚Äô everyday forms of resistance and their ordinary uses of social media as part of what we call weapons of the gig. Although not as visible as spectacular street action and social media campaigns, these weapons (motorcycle drivers‚Äô solidarity, algorithmic resistance, and social media use for information sharing, as well as production of humor and resentment) enable the subtle formation of a movement. Our contribution lies in reframing social media use as both an ordinary and extraordinary weapon of delivery workers and approaching workers‚Äô solidarity as a question of continuum. Enabling us to look beyond the antagonisms in the labor process and locate affective tensions in the everyday, this approach allows for seeing workers not only as economic but also as political and affective subjects demanding freedom and searching for meaningful connection in their lives.

"2024","Gig workers, critical visuality and humour in a digital context: The graphic representation of riders as a form of social criticism"," This article studies social perceptions of gig work and its conditions through the lenses of visual humour created and shared in digital environments. Food delivery services have thrived in cities, and riders ‚Äì gig workers associated with such services ‚Äì have become popular urban figures, easily recognisable through light means of transport and backpacks. These iconic elements have spread to forms of visual humour like memes and cartoons in social media. We aim to analyse the depiction of food delivery services and riders through graphic humour in digital environments, and its role as critical stances of gig work conditions. We draw from the literature on gig work, as well as critical humour in the workplace, approaching the phenomenon from the perspective of critical visualities and the memetic qualities of digital visual humour. Thus, we have conducted an analysis of rider memes, and carried out a focus group with Spanish cartoonists to better understand each form. From our analysis, we have observed that a) memes showcase less explicit critical stances but reflect a shared understanding of the hurdles associated to rider work; b) cartoons place riders in a contextualised, wider critique of platform economy and capitalism; c) while most graphic humour on riders takes an external, observational position, there is also an ‚Äòinner look‚Äô to the rider work, emphasising the promises and deceptions associated with the gig economy.

"2024","Social media and platform work: Stories, practices, and workers‚Äô organisation"," This article introduces the special issue, ‚ÄòSocial Media and Platform Work: Stories, Practices, and Workers‚Äô Organisation‚Äô. In recent years, platform labour studies have increasingly focused on how the growing platformisation of labour has changed work activities, labour processes, work organising, identities, and collectivities. The literature has highlighted the role of media, communication, and social media in platform labour, but more research is needed on these interrelationships. Precisely, the analysis of platform work is necessary due to its complexity and interest in political, economic, social, cultural, and health terms. Throughout the special issue, different contributions are presented that analyse how the emergence of these new jobs brings a set of inequalities that complexify the notion of ‚Äòwork‚Äô and dilute workers‚Äô rights, leading to a precarious situation. The use of social media plays a crucial role in the platformisation of labour as it enables the creation of social relationships between workers but also opens the door to communicating, disseminating their work, and even learning informally and about their work. However, the use of social media can also lead to a precarious combination of platform work and content creation ‚Äì or cultural production. In this regard, it is worth noting to analyse and approach the relationship between platform work and social networks precisely by addressing both perspectives, considering possible vulnerabilities derived from these situations and situations of precariousness.

"2024","An application of the ASOA framework in gig worker social media usage","The Attraction-Selection-Attrition (ASA) model, a major current model for organizational culture, has not been examined empirically for fit against the currently flourishing gig economy, an organizational style used by growing companies such as Uber and Lyft, which rely on app technology to pair consumers with organizational contractors to provide a service. Recent theoretical research suggests that an additional stage, organizing, is present within the ASA model for gig economy workers, thereby resulting in the AS(O)A model. Organizing is where contractors attempt to organize amongst themselves to improve working conditions to be able to stay in gig work rather than have attrition occur. A gap exists in the literature in examining empirically the nature of this step and how it plays out in gig work. In the present study, qualitative data were collected from six major online social media sites including Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Tiktok to examine how gig workers discuss their work. A criterion sample of128 posts were collected, of which 60 were relevant to the AS(O)A model. The data were coded for themes. The data suggests support for the organizing step in the ASA model for gig work as being meaningful in how gig workers discuss their work, especially through Instagram and Twitter. Results and implications for developing the ASA model into the AS(O)A model suggest that organizations need to understand that gig workers are organizing with each other and that such actions may lead to worker collective action or attrition from a particular gig site.","",""
"2024","Who relates to whom and according to which rationale? Visibility and advocacy in the Ugandan LGBT+ Twittersphere"," An increase in international funding for LGBT+ rights advocacy in Uganda has resulted in not only a mushrooming of organizations but also intra-community competition for visibility, attention, and limited resources. Against this backdrop, we set out to study how organizations relate to each other in the Ugandan LGBT+ Twittersphere. Following an analytical framework around rationalities of mediated participation, we study with whom Ugandan LGBT+ organizations relate through mapping retweets and @mentions emanating from selected Twitter accounts. The resulting network maps reveal a dividing line between more well-funded and internationally connected organizations and lesser established organizations. By supplementing the network analysis with qualitative readings of key accounts and semi-structured interviews, we conclude that access to international funds and negotiating visibility explains the network structures. The article thus reveals interesting Twitter practices, showing LGBT+ organizations use the platform as a means for negotiating and claiming space inside the Ugandan LGBT+ community. ","",""
"2024","Immaterial intimacy: The neoliberal entanglement of digital technologies in social movement volunteer work"," Outside of visible moments of mass mobilization, ongoing latent work, such as direct service and mutual aid, is a long-standing tradition in social movements.

To name hotline volunteers‚Äô digital care labor, I offer the term immaterial intimacy to describe its ubiquitous, ephemeral, and intimate nature.

"2024","Supermarket ‚Äòdark jobs‚Äô and rapid grocery delivery: Transformations in labour, technology and logistics"," As demand for rapid grocery delivery surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, Australia‚Äôs supermarket duopoly set about transforming relations of labour, technology and logistics to secure dominance in the growing sector. I consider the rise of ‚Äòdark jobs‚Äô of the supermarket and what this means for affected workers. My research encompasses in-depth interviews with 17 supermarket workers, including personal shoppers and dark store workers. I also draw upon corporate documents and media statements released during the pandemic, as well as insights gleaned through my work within Australia‚Äôs union movement. I argue that the transformations underway result in three major developments. First, the intensification of supermarket work to adhere to the temporal logics of the on-demand economy, enabled by the increasing use of digital devices. Second, the absorption of precarious workers via digital labour platforms into the traditional firm which may undermine existing job security. Third, a blurring distinction between retail and logistical spaces with consequences for union representation that may erode workplace conditions. Taken together, the supermarket becomes a powerful testing ground in which the logics of on-demand platforms are transforming conventional employment settings and practices. ","",""
"2024","A queer kind of dwelling: Digital throwness and existential security among sexual minorities in Russia"," This article asks what it means to habituate a queer orientation in a world permeated by digital connectivity. In doing so, it takes media phenomenology away from the mundane towards the momentous, drawing on queer phenomenology, and existential media studies. Using life-narrative interviews with sexual minorities in Russia, the article sheds light on the ‚Äúwork of queer habituation‚Äù in a straight world, and the contemporary significance of digital media technologies within this process. Digital media‚Äôs ability to multiply space is defined a key feature which offers sites to ‚Äústay with‚Äù the disorienting experience of queer dispositions. Through longer periods of discrete ‚Äúqueer digital dwelling,‚Äù individuals who have been associating their queer desires with ontological threats are able to find space for existence and existential security. By locating others in close proximity, some are also allowed to appropriate local territory in ways that make it more livable. ","",""
"2024","Curative platforms: Disability, access, and food delivery work in Singapore"," In the recent years, food delivery platforms in Southeast Asia have accepted people with disabilities as delivery workers, framing it as economic empowerment. This article examines this ambivalent bargain of economic rehabilitation in Singapore where Grab is headquartered. Drawing from historical records, it first traces the relations of ‚Äúplatform‚Äù to ‚Äúaccess,‚Äù demonstrating how the framework of curative intermediaries had historically shaped expectations around work. Access in the 1980s was envisioned as intermediating infrastructural connections that could provide disabled people with resources, transforming them from liabilities to productive personhoods. The second portion draws from interviews with disabled delivery workers to highlight the problems that constitute this investment in intermediaries and cure. Although accommodative platforms provide some degree of economic inclusion, these accommodations are often partial, resulting in precarity, attrition, and injury. ‚ÄúCurative platforms,‚Äù therefore, signals the investment and twinning of cure and violence that subject the disabled to a compromised existence.

"2024","Beyond Precarity: Forced Labor in China‚Äôs Ride-Hailing Industry"," Scholarly discussions of the consequences of the on-demand economy on work mainly focus on precarity. Using a case study of Didi Chuxing, this article moves beyond this conventional approach to highlight coercion as a striking feature of labor relations in China‚Äôs ride-hailing industry. Drawing upon the conceptual tool of neo-bondage, this article foregrounds the central role played by forced labor in securing a cheap and docile work force during Didi‚Äôs rapid market expansion. This article advances the existing literature in two ways. First, it highlights the need for a more robust analysis of the productive forces in the on-demand economy. Second, it argues that the on-demand economy not only represents an intensification of the ongoing trend toward precarity, but also an extension of forced labor regimes from electronic assembly lines to the service industry.

"2024","Professionals, purpose-seekers, and passers-through: How microworkers reconcile alienation and platform commitment through identity work"," Digital microwork consists of remote and highly decontextualized labor that is increasingly governed by algorithms. The anonymity and granularity of such work is likely to cause alienation among workers. To date, we know little about how workers reconcile such potential feelings of alienation with their simultaneous commitment to the platform. Based on a longitudinal survey of 460 workers on a large microworking platform and a combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses, we show that (1) alienation is present in digital microwork. However, our study also finds that (2) workers‚Äô commitment to the platform over time may alter their subjective perceptions of alienation. Drawing from qualitative statements, we show (3) how workers perform identity work that might help reconcile feelings of alienation with simultaneous platform commitment. Our findings contribute to solving the paradox of worker commitment to precarious platform labor, which is an issue frequently raised in the digital labor literature. ","",""
"2024","‚ÄúSure, I saw sales, but it consumed me‚Äù from resilience to erosion in the digital hustle economy"," With increasing socioeconomic precarity and ecological threat, resilience has become the individual responsibility and moral obligation of the neoliberal subject. Digital labor platforms are a clear expression and beneficiary of this development, offering hustling as a way to gain resilience as a micro-entrepreneur. However, we present evidence to the contrary, demonstrating how hustling in the digital economy erodes resilience on a systemic level. For this purpose, we draw on an in-depth, ecological ethnography about Poshmark, a social commerce platform for predominantly female hustlers to sell clothes. We tell the story of a pattern set in motion by the rapid scaling of the platform, which requires hustlers to do more and more click-work to yield smaller and smaller sales. As a result, they are caught up in a runaway dynamic that erodes the resilience of the ecology as a whole. ","",""
"2024","Digital togetherness as everyday resistance: The use of new media in addressing work exploitation in rural areas"," The literature on spatial-temporal barriers shows that temporary migrant workers are vulnerable to exploitation and has concentrated on how they utilize new media to address underpayment and exploitation. These studies, however, have left unexplored the agency, temporality, and spatial considerations that underpin why workers prefer to activate ‚Äúinformal‚Äù mechanisms of complaint rather than accessing ‚Äúformal‚Äù channels of redress, such as the Fair Work Ombudsman or labor unions. Using Working Holiday Makers in Australia as an example, this article focuses on digital togetherness generated through new media. I argue that digital interactions on new media platforms not only change the spatial-temporal limit of temporary migrant workers, but also create digital togetherness and connect workers with different imagined others (customers, arriving migrant workers, and workers who are facing exploitation). This connection can become an everyday resistance strategy, a remedy to space‚Äìtime limits, and potentially challenge asymmetrical power relations between workers and employers. ","",""
"2024","Affording worker solidarity in motion: Theorising the intersection between social media and agential practices in the platform economy"," Worker solidarity is a recurring theme in the digital labour debate. While recent studies of the on-demand platforms contribute to highlighting digital affordances in fostering solidarity among gig workers, few have explored how this works in depth and offered a theoretically informed evaluation of this potential. This study of Didi drivers in China fills this gap by looking at how agential practices amplify or constrain the effects of digital communication. We contribute to constructing a mediated framework of affordances for association, for discourse and for mobilisation to examine the process of fostering worker solidarity. Increasingly under structural constraints of platform control and state surveillance on labour activism, this article discloses the theoretical puzzle of ‚Äòsolidarity in question‚Äô by rooting the agential practices firmly in the analysis of workers‚Äô gender, migratory status, work experience and critical media literacy, and how they intersect with the tactical appropriation of social media to create potential.

However, limited attention has been paid to the relationships between socioeconomic differences and digital self-entrepreneurship among youths. Using an extended Bourdieusian framework, this article critically reassesses vloggers‚Äô digital creative labour, conditions and decisions by conceptualising them as various outcomes of position-taking in the emerging field of digital cultural production, tied to socioeconomic differences. Based on interviews with YouTubers in Hong Kong, this study examines how class background shapes young vloggers‚Äô career paths and future aspirations. The findings reveal their divergent class-inflected orientations towards the common tensions between (1) platform productivity and creative autonomy, (2) elite evaluation and mass rating and (3) career planning and an uncertain vlogging future. Shifting the focus to the nexus between class inequality and the platform creative economy, this article provides a nuanced account of digital creative work amid platform precarity and uncertainty.

It aims to better understand how creators within one peripheral region in Northern England express their labor experiences as both practices of domination and e-resistance. The article contributes an original typology of the relationships between practices of creator domination and forms of individual or collective e-resistance, encompassing varying levels of visibility, targets, sources, and underlying motives. It develops a novel creator workers‚Äô inquiry methodology to establish this multifaceted typology of creator e-resistance. The findings suggest that creator e-resistance should consider the relationships among practices of material, status, and ideological domination, and forms of non-resistance, individual hidden e-resistance, collective hidden e-resistance, and collective public e-resistance.

Using a content analysis of their videos and textual analysis of fan comments and social media engagement, I argue that RDCWorld‚Äôs performance as Black nerds subverts traditional notions of identity, play, and space by resisting notions of the stereotypical cool Black aesthetic, integrating transnational media with Blackness to create new modes of self-representation, challenging hegemonic constructions of public play, and by normalizing spaces of free Black expression through their anime and gaming convention, DreamCon.","",""

However, literature shows that in South Africa there are more people migrating internally than those migrating into South Africa from other countries. In this article, I draw on 15 interviews with BlackQueers who moved from rural to urban areas in South Africa to explain their Queer-centric motivations for migrating internally, which enabled them to ‚Äúconfront what it means to be Queer‚Äù through physical and digital interactions. The digital world is important because it surpasses fixed geographies. Digital spaces offer a refuge that may not be available in offline spaces even when there are legal protections that state that this should not be the case. This article provokes transnational scholarship to pay equal attention to movements within countries and digital spaces as it does to cross-country flows.","",""

Affinity groups, including those designed to support LGBTQ employees, have become a regular feature of most Fortune 500 companies. These groups seek to represent the interests of particular employee audiences, while also helping the company to advance its profit-driven goals.

"2024","Transnational queer cultures and digital media: an introduction","Abstract                Queer cultures have long been transnational and in times of rapid technological advancements, large migration flows, and intense cross-cultural exchanges, queer connections are evolving in new forms and meanings. These developments occur at the intersection of various intertwined geopolitical scales: urban, regional, national, continental, and global, as well as physical and digital. This introduction synthesizes various theoretical and methodological discussions to highlight the ambivalences of contemporary queer cultures, focusing on their intrinsic transnational and digital conditions. The authors contributing to this issue demonstrate that understanding queer cultures in the digital age requires examining the roles of various actors, including big tech employees, online platform volunteers, queer influencers, audiences, and migrants. They also highlight how queer digital cultures transcend national borders and challenge oppositional binaries, such as local vs. global and the West vs. the Rest, all while maintaining a critical perspective on the ambivalences of digitality.","",""

UKVTW features participants from different countries competing to be ‚ÄúQueen of the Mother-Tucking World.‚Äù We examine the intersection of queerness and whiteness, exploring the tension between national identity, racialization, and drag performance. Building on scholarship about reality TV and authenticity, we argue the series queers conventional notions of authenticity in reality TV by privileging fluid gender identities. Developing the notion of ‚Äústrategic Westernness‚Äù we examine how the series presents a postracial imaginary that obfuscates race by foregrounding nationality: seemingly progressive representations of gender ultimately privilege white and Western participants.","",""
"2024","Glitchy transnationalism: When queer migrants meet the state online","Abstract                Drawing on ethnographic research I conducted between May 2022 and January 2024 with queer migrants in Athens, Greece, I offer the conceptualization of ‚Äúglitchy transnationalism‚Äù as a corrective to the transnational promise of queer digital media‚Äîthe notion that these platforms can seamlessly facilitate connections across national boundaries among queer individuals (e.g., Grindr). I explore how this promise falters for two queer migrant individuals, Ziri and Tilila‚Äîboth of whom I interpret as encountering two glitches. I argue that understanding these perceived transnational ‚Äúfailures‚Äù as glitches showcases the interplay of factors such as legal status, migrancy, race, sexuality, and gender identity in shaping the lived realities of queer migrants within transnational digital spaces. Ultimately, this research underscores the relationship between state dynamics and digital media in the lives of queer migrants, urging scholars to adopt a lens that recognizes glitches as diagnostic of power dynamics within queer digital realms.","",""

Practices of gender representation within a transnational online community","Abstract                The continuing digitization and datafication that our society is undergoing are having a significant impact on our daily lives, giving rise to new possibilities but also entailing significant risks for people who are discriminated against or marginalized. Queer communities are particularly affected by these processes; therefore, it is crucially relevant to research transnational digital projects that involve them. In the Wikidata Gender Diversity (WiGeDi) project, we are looking at practices of gender representation in the Wikidata knowledge base, a collaborative online project managed by a worldwide community. Working from the idea that gender is a complex social construct, we investigate how the Wikidata community has approached the complex issue of modeling and populating gender data, progressing from a very narrow interpretation of gender as a binary to a representation that is more inclusive of a multiplicity of gender identities.","",""

While this dominant theorization of aspirational labor is sometimes helpful for explaining the precarity of digital media labor in countries of the Global South, its uncritical application could also be severely limiting. I undertake a close textual analysis of select web shows created by the entertainment brand and YouTube content creators The Viral Fever (TVF) to demonstrate how it would be imprecise to see them as just victims of an exploitative economy. My article shows how TVF web shows consistently imagine elaborate cinematic narratives that valorize and embody the neoliberal values of aspiration and individual growth that in turn is complicit in the machinations of platform economy‚Äôs extractive affordances.","",""

In this brief exploration, I navigate through the realms of queer African studies, African digital humanities, and African literary studies, using them as my guiding framework to uncover the digital emergence of an African transgender refugee diaspora. I suggest that this diaspora is producing content explicitly aimed back at the African continent to shape and deploy the reality of what it means to be transgender and African. In so doing, they are actively authoring themselves into existence.","",""
