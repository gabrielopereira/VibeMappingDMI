"2000","The use of focus groups in the design and development of a national labor exchange system","This paper reports on the use of focus groups in the design and development of America's Talent Bank. America's Talent Bank was designed with support from the U.S. Department of Labor as a nation-wide labor exchange system to be used on the Internet. The use of focus groups significantly enhanced the design and development of this system. The authors believe that this case is reflective of the successful use of focus groups in the development of an Internet system designed for national use.","",""

"2005","Conference report","The following report summarizing the activities of the International Conference “Meetings with well-known scientists – the practical dimension of science”, organized by The Office of the Marshal of the Mazowieckie Voivodeship in Warsaw. The Conference was held in Hotel Lord in Warsaw on 15–16 October 2013. The aim of the Conference was to create a platform for exchange of experience and knowledge in regarding to the processes of commercialization of research results, technology transfer and innovation support. The Conference was addressed to the representatives of the three groups most involved in the activities on the border of R&D and business: the scientists (as potential creators of new business solutions), the innovative entrepreneurs (as potential recipients of these solutions) and staff of institutions supporting the commercialization of research results, who through their work, try to remove the many barriers which still separate the world of science from the world of business. The Conference was opened by the speech of Adam Struzik, Marshal of the Mazowieckie Voivodeship, who stressed the need for cooperation in the “knowledge triangle”, especially between science and business. The first day of the Conference was devoted to issues related to the effective commercialization and transfer of research results to the business world. In the plenary session “Supporting science and innovation” were discussed both past experience related to the management and implementation of programs aimed at supporting innovation in R&D sector, as well as the opportunities for researchers in new programming period. The plenary session was performed by representatives of various institutions oriented to support innovative projects in R&D sector in Poland. Dr. Andrzej Kurkiewicz (representative of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education) presented the achievements in reform of sector of science and higher education in Poland, as well as guidelines for policy on supporting this sector in the next perspective 2014–2020. Izabela Erecińska (Deputy Director of the European Funds Department in the National Information Processing Institute) shared her experience regarding the implementation of research projects.

"2007","Standardization of Work: Co-constructed Practice","There is strong pressure to achieve greater uniformity, standardization and application of best practices in the service professions, a sector that is growing in presence and importance. At the same time, there is a conflicting demand for the delivery of high-quality (or high-priced or “knowledge-intensive”) specialized or localized services. Our article analyzes information systems-enabled standardizing of service work through an in-depth interpretative study of an ongoing standardization initiative within the field of nursing. Nursing provides a graphic illustration of the dilemmas involved in the standardization of service work. In nursing, standardization is commonly a feature of projects to improve both efficiency and quality in health care. In contrast to the dominant conception of standardization as a largely top-down, imposed process, we offer a view of standardization as incomplete, co-constructed with users, and with significant unintended consequences. The article contributes by (a) developing a theoretical perspective for the standardization of information-system-embedded service work and (2) providing operational and practical implications for system design and health care management.","",""

"2008","The Emergence of a Knowledge-Based View of Clusters and Its Implications for Cluster Governance","This article examines the knowledge component in cluster literature from its origins to the present. A chronological perspective is deployed in order to shed light on how the concept of clusters has evolved. Given the increasing interest in clusters as knowledge repositories, and the apparent conviction among policymakers of the manageability of clusters, lessons learned from knowledge management (KM) practices in organizations might well be applied to the many policy efforts aimed at governing clusters. We argue that introducing KM initiatives on a regional level should be accompanied by an understanding of the possible downfalls that are associated with KM failures.","",""

"2010","Learning to do Action Research for Social Change","Action research provides an alternative approach to bringing about changes in knowledge, policy, and practice. But to be effective and inclusive, taking into account complex dynamics of power and participation, action research requires capable facilitators with particular skills—such as the ability to give attention to personal and collective processes of reflection and action. This article explores the challenges of learning to do this kind of action research that are faced by practitioners and activists working for social change in diverse contexts around the world. The article reviews these challenges, offering insights and lessons from an innovative new master’s degree program called the MA in Participation, Power and Social Change, which uses action research and reflective practice as the basis of its approach to learning. Conventional views of policymaking usually see “research” as a specialized activity which makes objective data and analysis available to rational decision-makers, with the assumption that good knowledge will lead to better policies, and from there, to improved practices and outcomes. Action research, broadly defined, starts with a very different view of what knowledge is, where it comes from, and how it contributes to change. Most action research approaches involve a range of actors throughout the inquiry process—shaping the questions to be asked, gathering and analyzing different kinds of “data,” reflecting on experiences and assumptions, and experimenting with new kinds of action. Knowledge, policy, and practice are co-created through an emergent process of action and learning, often including some form of critical reflection and reappraisal of the norms, values, and assumptions by which we make sense of things, as well as an understanding of how these are shaped by power. In a world in which the challenges we face are increasingly complex and inter-related, and where universal solutions appear to have reached their limits, action research can lead to more context-sensitive, adaptive, and innovative understandings and responses. Action research provides a way of representing the perspectives and subjectivities of diverse actors (including those leading the research process) in all their complexity. It can highlight differences, commonalities, and underlying assumptions, rather than assuming that there is a singular, “objective” version of things. Those who facilitate action research try to take dynamics of power into account to ensure that the concerns and forms of knowledge held by less powerful people are not excluded—and that these people can mobilize their knowledge to effect change.","",""

In most activity theory-based scholarship, systemic contradictions are collapsed into a singular, generic construct, and the generative force of the different levels of contradictions in socio-organizational relations is overlooked. In contrast, we explicate when, how and why four distinct layers of contradiction precipitate one another, provoke distinct epistemic actions from different sets of organizational actors, and catalyze the development of organizing processes.","",""
