"2000","Impact Aesthetics: Back to the Future in Digital Cinema?"," This article engages recent debates about the future of cinema in the digital age. Firstly, it seeks to broaden the rather narrow terms in which the transition to digital cinema is often understood in film theory. Secondly, it tries to assess claims about the 'demise of narrative' frequently associated with the digital threshold. On one level, it is argued that a dialectical understanding of the relation between terms such as 'narrative' and 'spectacle' is needed to advance current debates. On another level, it is suggested that digital technology should not be wholly defined by the current dominance of 'blockbuster' films. In place of technological determinism, an understanding based on the politics of spectacle and distracted spectatorship is advanced. ","",""
"2000","Cooling Hot","Computer-mediated technologies (CMT) have created many opportunities for the arts. Some of those opportunities have been about re-purposing or re-mediating existing practices. Elsewhere, emergent practices, which are significantly different to what have gone before, are evident. A growing body of CMT works contest traditional practices in that there is no single unique or master copy; in the way the roles of maker and consumer are reapportioned; in the ways digital media themselves, physically and extra-linguistically, differ from previous display technologies; and in the user’s knowledge of what is missed or skipped.3 A particular feature of CMT art practices is ’new media’ interactivity: sequences of textual, visual and aural display guided by human actions of varying complexity which create new variations or instances of the work which are unique to the occasion and result from the reflexive selection of the user. Widening cultural and economic access to fast, reliable and responsive, local and networked systems means that such interactivity is now an increasingly important site of cultural activities.","",""
"2000","Studio movies","This essay proposes digital video (DV) as a new centre of gravity for the design/production process of architecture and its kindred arts. DV's capacity to work with synthesised and captured images, that can be modelled and reverse engineered, offers a powerful mode of exploration, iterative development and communication for information-rich projects that depend on a complex mobilisation of team skills and technical resources. The promise of DV is that it taps into the great fund of visual/operational knowledge held in the culture at large, and that it can enable the design/production process to become more responsive and more open to a wider group of interested parties. The essay argues that the fulfilment of this promise becomes increasingly urgent as our moving-image-saturated environment melts the boundaries of place and time, and dissolves the distinctions that separates the permanence of architecture from the transience of events.","",""
"2000","From the times of the first scribes: innovation and technology within graphic design","The authors use their different work and training background as perspectives for discussing the changing world of graphical design. In this digital world, expert knowledge of the technology is essential, but the authors argue that a consequence of prioritising technical expertise in the new interdisciplinary IT- design studies may be a loss of quality in design. To improve the depth in design the authors introduce a psychological framework for design work and on this basis they suggest a systematic method. The method is a 4-step conceptual model: reason, function, emotion and senses, and technology. The model interacts with all phases of the design, and functions as a generating-creating and execution-evaluation system. The authors emphasise that evaluation is embedded throughout the design process. They suggest that a systematic method becomes the guiding tool in interdisciplinary design education, an essential part of the students design qualifications as well as an essential tool in design work.","",""
"2000","Boxing architecture","The use of computer-aided design packages have led to the development of object libraries and greater modularisation in design. This paper argues that architects are now moving away from this paradigm and are able to use computer systems to handle greater complexity of form. It discusses the possible advantages and disadvantages of this, with particular reference to architect-client relations.","",""
"2000","Vibrating tectonics: gestural trajectories, energy mappings and self-conditioning design strategies","The transposition from painting to architecture from two-dimensional entity to a spatial structure, became the core idea of a project designed for the students of architecture to encourage them to examine the possibilities of abstract expression in the conceptualisation of architectural ideas and strategies. A series of tasks were created to enable them to identify full expression and physical presence of movement in an abstract painting as transferable into architecture. There were then other tasks oriented towards discovering, investigating and recording various types of spatial conditions as potentially architectural. Fundamental issues related to Jackson Pollock's philosophy of painting are now finding a new dimension in the digital domain of 3D modelling techniques, supplying them with the tool capable of not only projecting the release of pure energy in virtual space but also of recording endless sequences of free gestures in time and space. These can then be rewritten in the form of a computer program as well as being controlled on a higher level of architectural design.","",""
"2000","The design and evaluation of an interactive calculator for children","The aim of the research project reported here was to investigate the potential use of multimedia systems in teaching primary mathematics to pupils with learning difficulties. A multimedia interactive calculator (MIC), that combines learning materials with a calculator interface, has been designed as a result of classroom-based studies together with iterative prototype evaluation. The visual styling and operation of the MIC is the consequence of design decisions made in response to a user-need analysis carried out as part of this research. The MIC mediates between the concrete stage of learning number and the manipulations of symbolic arithmetical representations, particularly as they are used in the standard calculator, a transition which is difficult for many pupils to make. The work shows that multimedia systems can be helpful to children in making this transition. However, the authors agree that the careful use of an information design approach is needed to produce successful software. The MIC has been shown to be useful in teaching the concepts of number and the routines of addition and subtraction. Its interactive multiplication tables have helped pupils to discover number patterns and to improve their recall of number facts.","",""
"2000","The Sadeian interface: computers and catharsis","This paper explores the limitations of contemporary interface design and offers the potential of more profound forms of interaction by drawing on the rich and much older heritage of interactive art. Whilst HCI design is preoccupied with making the computer more simple to use, installation work, kinetic sculpture, and interactive multimedia art forms have generally been more concerned with the predicament of human/technological negotiation, whilst remaining a salient form of human communication. HCI activity sets out to make the complex systems of computing easy to understand and use, whilst interactive art often uses simple technology to make complex, inspiring and esoteric statements and experiences. In many ways the more simple and 'low resolution' the technology the more immersive, acute and intimate the experience. 'Low resolution' examples such as telephone-sex-lines are explored alongside more immersive systems, such as biofeedback interfaces, and other interactive experiments drawn from the 'technic' strand of art history.","",""
"2000","The integration of theory and practice in teaching designing for the screen","Future typographic and graphic designers will need to be able to design for a range of media, both to secure their role and to provide the necessary design expertise in technological environments. This paper proposes an approach to teaching which introduces theoretical issues within a practical design project to encourage the development of general concepts that can be transferred to different technologies. A specific project on designing for the screen is described, which is taught as part of a BA degree in Typography & Graphic Communication. In the context of this project, reasons for introducing theory are proposed, examples of the nature of the theory are given, and the methods used to introduce material are illustrated. A detailed account of one student's implementation of this project is used to demonstrate how theoretical issues can provide direction in a design task. However, careful consideration needs to be given to how theory and practice are integrated to encourage students to look beyond the short-term benefits of specific training to the development of more general knowledge.","",""

This paper describes an EU ACTS project called RESOLV which develops an integrated system to capture real 3D environments using laser and video. Current research on motion tracking, statistical behaviour modelling and simulation is presented, and possible applications, both for visual augmentation and audio generation, are discussed. The projects presented were not originally designed in the domain of theatre and performance, however their results and output seem to be well suited to be applied in this area.","",""
"2001","Deeper Conversations with Interactive Art","computer-based interactive art being produced, spurred on by the advent of the internet and World Wide Web. Hundreds of experimental works are being created as artists struggle to understand the computer as a new medium for art, which in turn is fueling the establishment of dozens of ’new media’ departments, institutes, festivals, museums and web sites to serve and showcase the work. As I navigate this wildly diverse, sometimes confusing landscape of computer-based art, I find myself searching for works that truly take advantage of the capabilities that, from my experience as a designer and programmer of interactive virtual characters, I know the computer can offer.","",""

The effects of computing on the architectural design process can hardly be overstated. Yet, to date, its effects on the design product seem limited to novelties of computer modelling, and manufacturer-driven security/building operation systems. These merely substitute previous techniques with new technologies much as CAD displaced conventional drafting and rendering.","",""

"2001","Exchange Fields: Embodied Positioning as Interface Strategy","The work Exchange Fields was commissioned by the exhibition Vision Ruhr, held in Dortmund, Germany, in 2000. The work was a collaboration between the Dutch dancer/choreographer Regina Van Berkel, myself and the programmer Gideon May. The central question dealt with the generation of a new kind of interface how might an embodied experience of interface be layered into the content of an interactive media/dance comprised of video, text, a sculptural installation and music? Exchange Fields sought to develop a novel interface strategy by eliciting culturally determined environmental ’behaviour in relation to objects’ as a grammar of gesture that could be used as input to the reacting system. The physical interface system functioned as an embodied intuition. The work sought to tap into prelinguistic environmental knowledge related to the use of particular varieties of objects. A series of furniture/sculptures were developed. Each furniture/sculpture was designed with a unique implied ’suggestion’ of how the body might be positioned in relation to that","",""
"2001","Traces"," Traces is an artwork for the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) that uses a novel machine vision system to enable unencumbered full body interaction with a range of semi-autonomous agents without the imposition of any sort of textual, iconic or encoded gestural interfaces and without physically restrictive wiring, pointing devices, or headgear. Furthermore, Traces does not consist of a 'world' which is 'navigated'; instead, the movement of the user through the space leaves volumetric and spatial-acoustic residues of user movement that slowly decay. This project was motivated by a desire to explore and critique four central issues in contemporary human-computer interface (HCI): (a) embodied interaction with computational systems; (b) rapid and transparent learning of interfaces by untrained users (the autopedagogic interface); (c) immersive bodily interaction with software agents, (d) extension and elaboration of the general conception of 'interactivity' itself. To explore these issues, we built an infrared (IR) multi-camera machine vision system that constructs a volumetric model of the whole of the user's body in real time. We have also developed custom thee-dimensional vision tools, graphical techniques and a range of techniques for generating and managing semi-autonomous agents in immersive environments. ","",""
"2001","The Form of Change","Programmable Realtime architecture has the ambition to produce data flow in realtime, architecture to shape the flow of three-dimensional movements of the users in realtime, to organise the flow of matter in realtime, to engineer the communication from product to product, product to user, and user to user in realtime. Active programmable architecture based on realtime calculation techniques is the immediate future of the profession of architecture and of the building industry. Matter and products become aware of themselves and their users, developing into a full interactive communication process.","",""
"2001","Building on diversity: crafting a paradigm for digital design environments","Advanced computer systems for 3D design and modelling are widely used in many areas of design and manufacturing. However, although they offer undoubted benefits, there is growing awareness of their inadequacy to meet the range of capabilities required by designers. Limited types of design representations can be created in the virtual environment. The precise, detailed geometric modelling techniques are unsuited to the earlier stages of design, and emphasise the creation and visualisation of three-dimensional form, rather than the more dynamic and functional aspects of working with materials. There is a discrepancy between the highly sophisticated three-dimensional models, and current ‘two-dimensional’ ways of interacting with them via mouse and screen. In most systems, a complex user interface requires extensive experience before it can be used transparently. Ways of interacting intuitively and expressively in three dimensions are now highly desirable. Rapid advances in digital technologies, such as haptic and gesture interfaces, 3D imaging, and more intuitive modelling techniques, offer us a means of moving away from the ‘desk-top box’ scenario to more fluid and flexible human-centred ‘digital design environments’. The potential of such technologies to allow a less constrained, more naturalistic interaction with virtual models has increased the drive towards computer support for the whole design process, in particular for conceptual design. To take full advantage of these developments, we must understand how the types of interaction they enable are, or could be, used in the design process. Existing systems have developed around the ‘design-by-drawing’ paradigm, but this does not adequately reflect the complexity, diversity and individuality of designers’ processes. To truly move forward, a radical re-evaluation is required.","",""
"2001","Mapping the image","This research project, based in the School of Communications at the Royal College of Art, has involved an examination of the influence of significant developments in video technology and electronic imaging techniques on British and American video art and these influences on my own fine art practice, in order to provide a detailed background and context for three new video installations; Mind’s Eye (1997), Mothlight (1998–99) and Merging/Emerging (1999). The overall purpose of this aspect of my research has been to examine the influences of a range of representative works of American and British video art that have been significant to the development of my own practice (either by direct influence, or because of their position within the cultural context in which I was working) and to gain insight into the context of my recent work through an understanding of the complex interrelationships between developing electronic imaging technology and cultural form. This historical and contextual research forms the background to the production and exhibition of the three installations that form the core of my project.","",""
"2001","Making it new: transformations in the grammar and identity of digital printmaking","Notions of skill and sensitivity in fine art printmaking have been transformed by the new action and knowledge environments brought about by digital technologies. However, the off-the-shelf programs used in these environments are still influenced by an ideology that promotes the simulation of traditional techniques, which in turn prevent a move away from conventional forms of depiction. The ideological stance that drives these programs is problematic because it re-enforces out-dated artistic paradigms. In order to move beyond these paradigms, artists who work with digital technologies will need to be more critical of attempts merely to import techniques analogous to those used in traditional practice (e.g. processing applications that only provide a virtual equivalent to traditional painting, drawing, montage, and photographic methods) and will have to face down the tendency to mimic existing paint and print media. What we need for computer printmaking is the sort of interdependence and autonomy gained by an all-digital approach.","",""

"2001","A preliminary poetics for interactive drama and games","Interactive drama has been discussed for a number of years as a new AI-based interactive experience. While there has been substantial technical progress in building believable agents and some technical progress in interactive plot, no work has yet been completed that combines plot and character into a full-fledged dramatic experience. Part of the difficulty in achieving interactive drama is due to the lack of a theoretical framework guiding the exploration of the technological and design issues surrounding it. This paper proposes a theory of interactive drama integrating Laurel's Aristotelian structural model with Murray's concept of agency. The resulting theory illuminates the general conditions under which a user will experience agency in any interactive experience and provides design and technology guidance for the particular case of building interactive dramatic worlds.","",""
"2001","Origination and exploitation of high-quality digital materials for courseware development: a student-centred approach","This research project seeks to identify the points in the new materials/pedagogic production and application at which a student's perception and expectation of pedagogic interface design, navigation and learning activities are judged/mapped against their real-world experience. It asks whether, on the basis of this observation, new approaches to teaching and learning material design should be adopted, and what these new approaches should be if the materials produced are to satisfy expectations while enhancing the students' generic and transferable skills base. This paper describes the author's involvement as a developer with the Higher Education Funding Councils' initiative into computers and learning. It outlines some of our attempts to investigate a genuinely student-centred approach to the production of an exemplar for computer-assisted musical courseware in the HEI. It asks two main questions: 1. what range of approaches to music-based courseware design might be employed; 2. how do we chart student perceptions, expectations and evaluation of instructional courseware and the computer as an interface? The paper provides a brief overview of the project in practical terms, it considers pedagogic and cultural implications, and it outlines the methodological enquiry and application, including examples of visual data and commentary. It concludes with an interpretation of the interim findings, and identifies directions for further research.","",""

The research proposal charted the characteristics of digital art, which were based on apparent physical conditions (ex. nonmateriality) as well as on conditions related to the artist’s gesture and intention (ex. immediate reversibility).

"2001","Beyond the icon: the role of the image in human computer interface (HCI) design","If we examine communication we see the origins of some of the most fundamental systems of reconciling experience. Primarily, it is our systems of classification and categorisation that allow us to objectify the world and assign names to ‘collections’ of experience. Such ordering has resulted in the isolation and establishment of a basic unit of communication, the sign. However, the sign can never be the original, as communication inherently involves taking aspects of experience and converting them into a different form that merely re-presents the original. Pierce describes the different association of a sign to ‘its object’ as either an icon, index or symbol (Figure 1). An icon refers to a sign that resembles its object in some way, such as a picture of a fire. An index is related to its object by an existential connection, in the way smoke is associated with a fire and finally the word ‘fire’ itself is a symbol, as we have learned to understand it through convention.","",""

This paper records the development of the conceptual design of the gallery. It tells the story, not of the design process, but of the key design decisions, and the theoretical and practical considerations behind them, that transformed the initial concept into the reality of a final product. The project looked at the potential of new technology to approximate presentation and display, and one of the driving issues in the design was the primacy and authenticity of the object. By focussing on the issues relating to museums and museum display theory the project arrived at a solution that was shaped by these issues, rather than being driven by the technology. The final design represents a synergy between the salient features of a museum and gallery visit, an academic print publication, and a museum catalogue.","",""

In its inherently ergodic nature, that discourse exists as particular instances which may never be shared. In its inevitable narrativity, in its construction of meaning through fleeting fragments juxtaposed in time, and in its unique instance determined by selection and selection histories, this discourse is unlike that of other media and represents a distinct and different way of storying the world. Reference is made to several contemporary interactive artworks and the text concludes with a short but detailed critique using the ideas mapped out in the preceding text.","",""
"2002","The Synthetic Image","                            Author's Note: The Theme of the Loop: Image, Exhibition and Networkability             In his contribution to the anthology, The Digital Dialectic, George P. Landow inventories a set of characteristics that define digital media. These defining traits result from a hybrid mixture of ideas relating hypertext writing to the visual language of collage. Included in this list is the quality of """"networkability"""".1 It is through reading into this particular element that I will focus on the character of the digital image itself as multi-dimensional and how, by extension, this enmeshes notions of the image within a wider network of relations; of image to the imaginary, of vision to visuality, and of artwork to exhibition. Underpinning this text will be my curatorial """"projection""""2—using the term as it is articulated by Ron Burnett as an active, interpenetration of the processes of vision, representation, technology and the imagination—of the digital image culminating in the exhibition, The Synthetic Image.3 The exhibition presents the work of thirteen artists working within the vectors that define imaging practices informed by new technologies. Exploring the relationship between the real and the virtual, the selected artists and artworks exemplify the crossover between a variety of digital and interactive media informed by other artistic traditions and individual positions on the role of the image in representing, simulating or creating realities.            The perspective of this project views the relationship between digital technologies and the image as a synthetic one. Recognizing the ability to double and fold in the malleability of the material from which the digital image is composed, the dichotomy of inside and outside collapses. Instead of conceiving, visualizing pixels as a solid, impenetrable grid, I've tried, rather, to recognize in this resulting surface the qualities of a fabric, as a mesh of interpenetrating, weaving fibres. Instead of the content of the image being contained in the """"solid"""" pixels, it is implied in the """"threads"""" of the screen holding together the field of relationships, looping like a closed electrical or magnetic circuit. The vectors of relationship bound the """"empty"""" image; fastening, holding together and forming the picture.             In many ways my approach to this topic (as artist, curator and, in this immediate guise, as author) finds expression in the term """"synthesis"""" defined as a """"rhythmic coexistence of radically heterogenous and temporally dispersed elements"""".4 The virtuality of this thing called an """"exhibition"""" is approached as a narrative space; a fluid, complex epistemological environment. The curatorial role makes evident the subtext of diverse strands connecting respective works and artists and collects them in the space of the gallery in an attempt to draw them into the """"loop.""""            The exhibition/ installation operates by gathering together disparate components into what is as much a """"context"""" as a physical and spatial realization. The choice and arrangement of artworks, displayed as printed images or encountered as fleeting emanations of light, creates channels of communication where meaning is more than implied, and can be likened to the type of referentiality associated with that of the image produced by projection and the apparatus of the projector itself. Considered in this way, even static images, fixed into pigment on paper, operate luminously, acting like beacons which together form a constellation of points creating lines of force, motion, influence and meaning; the exhibition itself is a loop structure which enfolds and encircles its incorporated range of (inter, hyper, meta and para) textual components.             The writing also parallels a similarly conceived and structured trajectory towards the metaphor of the loop. At its inception, I developed a graphic visualization of the textual content of this text, meditating upon the interrelationships of the synthetic qualities of the image fused with a mapping of theoretical positionings and the example provided through the exhibition itself. This diagram of sorts resulted in a narrative structure which collects the various themes (mesh, weave, wire frame, map, moire and screen) within the text's centrifugal sweep, overlapping with the artists' works comprising the exhibition, and made possible by the navigation structure realized by Leon Meyer. In exploring the formal possibilities offered by hypertext, multiple vantage points and intersections result from the folding and overlapping of image and text. As with crumpling the written page into a ball,5 synthetic qualities are realized.             Enter """"The Synthetic Image"""".

"2002","Beyond """"Couch Potatoes"""": From Consumers to Designers and Active Contributors"," The fundamental challenge for computational media is to contribute to the invention and design of cultures in which humans can express themselves and engage in personally meaningful activities. Cultures are substantially defined by their media and tools for thinking, working, learning, and collaborating. New media change (1) the structure and contents of our interests; (2) the nature of our cognitive and collaborative tools; and, (3) the social environment in which thoughts originate and evolve, and mindsets develop.  Unfortunately, a large number of new media are designed from the perspective of seeing and treating humans primarily as consumers.

Two areas that seem especially promising for near future (evaluation of user-building interaction and visualisation of environmental factors) are mentioned and some proposals are presented for the future use of dynamic simulations in virtual environments.","",""

It is the core around which the conceptual and intellectual development of our student’s learning takes place. SeeingDrawing, a three-year project funded by the Teaching and Learning Technology Programme (TLTP) in the UK, aims to develop the student’s awareness of the significance of drawing. The outcome is a set of interactive multi-media DVDs which aim to enrich and enhance the student's experience of learning in art and design. The package includes images to stimulate thought, basic training guides for computer applications such as 3D graphics, and projects which students can use to practice and develop their drawing abilities. Though it encourages the use of the computer for drawing, the focus of the materials remains on traditional drawing tools. However it promotes the new approaches to drawing which are made possible by the use of technology, through the ability to utilise software applications for three-dimensional modelling and to enhance the teaching of formal drawing systems such as projection and perspective.

This paper presents early two-dimensional visualisations of the performer tracking data and discusses their influence on systems development. A few possible extensions to the visualisation techniques given here are also discussed.","",""

Different academic traditions have their perspective and their vocabulary through which the topic is conceptualised and understood, Practitioners have other concerns and their specific tools and techniques with which they produce the visuals and the communication embedded within. Though the technological developments have lead to new interdisciplinary approaches, these developments have yet to develop a truly interdisciplinary foundation. Because the field is still new, we each draw, sensible enough, on what we already know and master, when we approach a new area.","",""

Ozlab facilitates manual simulations of the interactivity of proposed user interfaces, thereby simplifying testing and making the development of ideas during test runs possible. Even non-programmers can perform these activities. The paper reports on a pilot study within the efforts currently taking place concerning educationalists focusing on language disabilities, where the clients could benefit from graphical support in interactive teaching aids. Ozlab extends the traditional, linguistically- based Wizard-of-Oz technique for manual prototyping to graphical interaction. The pilot study indicates that a refined Ozlab could be used by inexperienced designers for testing their own ideas. The fact that requirements of interactivity thus can be visualised by laymen will have implications for the design of requirements specification for multimedia products.","",""

The criteria used in the design and selection of the film image are discussed and a novel view of film as a pragmatic and highly economical form of picture making is proposed. The difficulties are highlighted of simply transferring such imagery to an interactive context, but it is argued that the same guiding principles can be applied in the newer medium. It is suggested that the demands of visual interaction are leading to the development of new pictorial modes, but that much work remains to be done. In particular it is proposed that the mature expressivity of traditional film is a goal to which designers of pictorial interactive media should aspire.","",""

This essay charts the nature of the digital revolution in relation to digital colour grading. Faced with the new digital devices, filmmakers are casting about for appropriate, respectable functions. The paper examines how the first two mainstream Hollywood releases to feature digital colour designs, Gary Ross's Pleasantville (1998), and Joel and Ethan Coen's O Brother Where Art Thou (2000), work as aesthetic prototypes. It argues that digital colour may not so much entail a revolution as careful and considered integration, and one role of the early digitally graded film has been to set out concrete methods for reining the technology to craft norms. Close formal analysis of colour design in these films also illustrates how the aesthetic problems of the digital age replay the dynamics of stylistic development from the classical era. ","",""

Today with digital effects, we are seeing an unprecedented degree of technological advances that allow the breaking up, recombining, and reconfiguring of actors' abilities as multiple forms of input. This essay examines the history behind the technological construction of performance, the elements which performances have been divided into, and some of the ways in these divisions redefine what we have traditionally thought of as constituting a performance, which has become in many ways a more collaborative effort instead of the work of an individual 'star' performer.

Both cognitive psychology and communication theory offer great insight into the evolution of human cognisance and provide pointers to models with which the activity of musical improvisation could be interpreted. In the course of this paper I have tried to relate academic concepts and theories to material gleaned from improvising musicians, giving credence to their opinions and drawing inference from their experiences.","",""

The web has facilitated an incredible, often overwhelming amount of information that is multidimensional and multi-contextual, offering artists global connections. A new dialectic however, is emerging as artists approach their work from positions of both manual creators and digital selves. The dialectic raises issues and questions such as: How does the hands-on engagement with artists’ materials interchange with digital manipulation capabilities facilitated by a computer mouse? What do the artists have to say about an art practice that straddles real and virtual contexts? Using conversations with six visual artists of varying age and career levels, this paper begins to explore how digital technologies and cyberspace are affecting hand-made art processes, while highlighting the artists’ perceptions of how these new contexts are enveloping their practices. Issues of researching ideas on the web, integrating digital processes with hand drawn images and the seduction of digital manipulation programs and computer capabilities frame the artists’ conversations.","",""

The word ‘web jamming’ refers to playing music together over the Internet. This kind of musical collaboration over networks has been around for a while and has already been implemented in a number of applications. Even though much of the recent development in this field is very impressive and provides the players with all sorts of customisation for sound and graphics, I still feel some very important things are lacking. Most of all I would like to see personality reflected throughout the system, and by providing a framework suitable for connecting musicians together rather than a fixed set of musical instruments for them to use, I think this can be achieved. So, by handing over the complete design of the virtual instruments, what parameters to control, how they will sound, what they will look like etc., to the players themselves, I wish to open up web jamming for individual and creative use to all kinds of musicians. If the players can express their ‘sound’ more freely, this can compensate somewhat for delayed reactions, lack of eye contact, gestures and atmospheres lost due to physical displacement and technological limitations.","",""

Instead it is argued that design methods are needed that enable us to deal with particular situations, i.e., that enable particular users in a particular context get the best out of the resources at their disposal. After presenting a framework for understanding user selection of communication resources, a method that yields design/redesign recommendations through interpretation of the reasons for the user’s selection of a particular communication medium for a particular purpose from among competitive communication media, is described. It is shown how such analysis results in hypothesised communication needs that serve as a basis for design/ redesign recommendations. Finally, it is argued that the hypothesised communication needs derived from particular situations should become the focus of hypothesis testing research.","",""

The company’s organising metaphors refer to the distributed performance practices of cyberformance, a form of virtual theatre, in an attempt to encapsulate a phenomenon whose ontological, aesthetic and epistemological condition is contentious, and the hybrid offspring of at least two disciplines: the performing arts and computer technology. The author—a member of the company—locates this undisciplined subject within what Roland Barthes has termed an ‘epistemological slide’, as an emergent performance form. Attention focuses on the process and outcomes of the cyberscript, Screen save her, performed in May 2002 at the 12-12 Time Based Festival, Cardiff School of Arts, and at Riverside Studios, London. Comparison is made between avatar, cyborg and character enactments within the context of distributed performance practices. The primary conceptual framework for this production draws on the work of Murray Gell-Mann and complex adaptive theory. Analysis of spectator feedback from Screen save her ascribes key areas where spectator competencies were misjudged and where spectator expectations remediated the performance event. Additionally, the author speculates about the necessary conditions for developing new performance languages and wonders if a theatre stage is a malleable enough context for such endeavours.","",""

This issue has its origins in a workshop organised by Ron Wakkary, Thecla Schiphorst and Jim Budd (2004), titled ‘Cross-dressing and border crossing: exploring experience methods across disciplines’, held as part of the ACM SIGCHI 2004 conference in Vienna, Austria. The workshop was to all appearances among the strangest gatherings at SIGCHI 2004. Blindfolded researchers were spied wandering the fluorescent-lit lower concourse of the Austria Center in Vienna, or dashing from table to food-court table in a tag-like game whose rules remained obscure. But the playful, seemingly aimless movement of the participants belied a serious purpose. The practice of designing interactive objects, environments and systems has outgrown its roots in Human Computer Interaction (HCI), with its residual load of cognitive science. We engage in interactive experiences out of choice, in search of the pleasures of the mind and senses we have hitherto found in performance, art or our experience of architectural spaces. For the workshop organisers and participants, a provocation is required: hence, cross-dressing, the opportunity to try on new roles and experience design methods coming from art and design— disciplines often marginalised by the research community. The workshop received an overwhelming response and unfortunately only about fifteen percent of the position papers submitted were accepted.

The goal is to provide a platform that supports discourse in environments where ‘keeping comfortable distance’ between oneself and others is the norm. The system framework developed for this project can be applied for use in computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL), and collaborative design activities in the tradition of computer supported collaborative work (CSCW). The current domain explored in the Constructed Narratives project is computer systems designed to enable shared experience through play, or computer supported collaborative play (CSCP). This paper examines the learner-centred design methodologies used for the development of the physical artifacts and underlying software and hardware system architecture for the Constructed Narratives project. The design methodology demonstrates how an interdisciplinary team of artists, designers, and technologists can exploit the opportunities inherent in this ‘symmetry of ignorance’ to find solutions for multiple wicked design problems that can arise during the development of an integrated software and hardware system.","",""

It provides an opportunity to see a wide range of recent original, limited edition, artists’ prints, which at some stage in their production have involved the use of computers to generate and/or to manipulate their imagery. It includes work by forty one selected and invited digital artist/printmakers from all over the world; artists from six countries, from Australia to Russia and including Slovakia and India. The work in the exhibition covers a vast spectrum of styles and a whole range of new printing technologies. This exhibition was linked to the CADE’03, Computers in Art and Design Education Conference held at the Hull School of Art and Design, the focus of which was ‘(which) end of the line(s)?’ Three days of events focusing on the impact that new technologies have on our working practices and changing role within our institutions.

The theme of the 2004 Conference was ‘Building Bridges’—to build bridges between different cultures and approaches and to enhance dialogue, interaction and mutual learning. The following pages of Artist Space feature eight international artists who were included in the exhibition. The use of digital imaging makes this an exciting, challenging, and innovative time to be an artist/printmaker. It also encourages a major revaluation of printmaking processes in general; raising the issues of authenticity and ownership and blurring the distinction between ‘original’ and ‘reproduction’. Since I have been curating the ArCade exhibitions, questions such as the longevity and the light-fast properties of the inks have now broadly been resolved, and digital prints are now entering museum collections. In addition, the cost of high-resolution printers has been dramatically reduced, making this form of printing available to students and artists alike. Furthermore, the new generation of printers allow for a wide range of substrates to be used, from hand made paper through to plastics. I hope the Arcade IV exhibition demonstrates how digital fi ne art prints offer the possibility of generating ‘radically new’ physical; aesthetic and conceptual frameworks. ArCade IV","",""
"2004","Digital mnemonics","Architectural design involves a process of iteration and testing which is closely akin to practice-based research and lends itself naturally to this approach in the University environment. Academic research into the relationship between mnemonics and spatial theory reveals the significant part architecture can play in developing the design of memorable virtual environments. The art of memory, which has largely been forgotten in the 21st century, may provide a theoretical context for this research. As we increasingly rely on mechanised forms of memory storage and recall on computer screens, these synthetic memories become ever more complex, and the creation of new methods of representing them becomes pressing. To this end traditional ‘Memory Arts’, based in physical architecture and spatial orientation, are a fruitful source of inspiration. The concept of ‘architectural mnemonics’, which grows from the memory arts, requires a multidisciplinary approach for it to be fully understood. The virtual environments produced using such a theory also require input from different disciplines to allow them to be fully analysed and tested. The interdisciplinary nature of the work reflects the many sided approaches of architecture, which always include both scientific and artistic elements. Through carrying out such practice-based experimental work, both the practice and theory of architecture are advanced and extended.","",""

In this context designers are more like architects than authors, constructing a database of narrative possibilities that exist within the framework of a conceptual environment. By linking the elements of this database, the user can discover and co-author the narrative, generating a unique work that subverts the passive, voyeuristic role in which audiences experience traditional time-based narrative media and reshaping the relationship between the designer and user. In forming this relationship designers must link narrative and spatial considerations with design functionality that is grounded in the subjective elements of the user experience rather than simple usability goals.","",""

Their use of video interaction analysis showed that when a model was a physical object students ‘touched, pointed at, manipulated and gestured’ with the object. In contrast immersive technology nearly became the subject of the design review ‘due to the undesirable usability problems of the ImmersaDesk’. In retrospect the attempt to make the virtual act as a substitute for the physical was bound to raise issues. But in pushing beyond the hype of new technology Bucolo and Brereton developed an understanding of the role that the virtual object could play as a vehicle for abstract thought. In contrast Sundholm, Ramberg, and Artman’s Learning conceptual design followed ‘students during the conceptual design phase’ within a technologically mediated ‘co-located collaborative workspace’. However by dwelling on the reticence of users to ‘publicly’ expose aspects of their work, primarily their ability to draw, the success of this work was understated. In marked contrast to the problems that Bucolo and Brereton encountered, the problems discovered here were due to the fact communication was facilitated. In fact students solved this problem through the fl exibility of the system, appropriating images from the web and creating their own symbols to represent what they would have drawn. As a part of the system the Tipple service allowed students to use their own laptops as a part of the workspace.

Particularly rare are design projects that integrate the space and existing artifacts as a resource. We report on the development of an interactive learning environment in support of students of architecture and interaction design. Based on ethnographic fieldwork we specified a set of qualities of the learning environment, which guided the development of physical interfaces (using tags, sensors, video tracking, physical and digital infrastructures). To investigate how students would integrate technologies in their work settings we have organized field trials with open prototypes. These showed the value and some means of mixing evolving artifacts with digital media. In interactive installations students used the space as a stage to experience and explore aspects of places and situations.","",""

Understanding the object as composed of both spatial and temporal form, we can use materials to design a ‘surface’ for experience that extends beyond the three-dimensional object. Presenting both theoretical considerations and design examples, we discuss the potentials of a new perspective on form as a basis for design research and education.","",""
"2005","<i>Commedia Virtuale</i>: from theatre to avatars","Abstract We are investigating face, hand and body expressions to be applied to avatars of a virtual environment to improve their communication capabilities and enrich and facilitate their perception by users of the environment. We report on our work based on obtaining inspiration from the world of theatre. In this perspective Commedia dell'Arte and Noh theatre have been the focus of our attention. We explore key features of Commedia dell'Arte, namely improvisation, exaggerated gestures and expressive postures, and investigate how their adoption in the design of avatars can be useful for collaborative virtual environments. With the same objectives we look at another theatre style, the Noh theatre. We investigate the variety of masks and the choreography. The outcome is a visual language for avatars made up of postures, gestures and appearances. We have concluded this investigation with the production of an experimental theatre play involving real and virtual actors.","",""
"2005","Reviews","Visualising research illustrates practice-based approaches to research for higher degrees in Art and Design. In its structured approach, clear language and style it addresses the new postgraduate student, guiding them in their development and delivery of a research project at either masters or doctoral level. This is a book that also targets educators and could form part of taught programme in research methods, drawing heavily on the reflective practitioner approaches from Schön and Kolb as well as the authors experience in largely craft-based domains. The book is dependent on the use of metaphor—being structured around notions of research as a ‘journey of exploration’ translating as chapters on ‘planning the journey’, ‘mapping the terrain’, ‘locating your position’, ‘crossing the terrain’, ‘interpreting the map’ and ‘recounting the journey’. The use of this colourful, metaphoric language— and this book is full of it, may be a useful pedagogic tool but by linking research to notions of the journey in this way the book perhaps denies some of the complexity and richness of approaches to researchers ‘wanderings’ (at the risk of extending the metaphor a step further) that might be more open, even meandering, fluid, unstructured or otherwise non-linear—the notion of the strictly sequential journey is problematic here. Although a pluralistic approach is advocated, critical thinking in this book equates it seems to creativity techniques, to brainstorms and mindmaps; to Buzan’s arboreal thinking: the arborescant rather than the rhizomatic. The more performative methodologies at work in the practice-based work of the practitioners in my experience, drawing on the post-structural, the playful or the game-like as research methodologies, or perhaps from the history of practices stemming from fluxus or the situationists, are largely absent. Readers drawn to this title expecting a critique of visual research methodologies, visual analysis or techniques for visualising complex data, will find something else— despite the authors’ clear interest in the information visualisation work of Edward Tufte there is none of that here. The use of metaphoric visualisation appears to have been the focus and what accompanying visuals are included, although useful, are sometimes disappointing in terms of their reproduction quality. The book’s website companion is also something of a let-down in this respect: colour PDFs of the books content and little by way of visual or experiential extension. The resource section on the website companion is perhaps the most useful addition, but this could have been more extensive, particularly after the wide ranging references that are included within the book itself. Given the pluralistic stance and actionbased frame of the text, it would have been far more beneficial had the authors provided an expanded links section taking the reader re v ie w s","",""
"2006","Jam2jam","&#x0D;         &#x0D; &#x0D;  Introduction   Generative algorithms have been used for many years by computer musicians like Iannis Xenakis (Xenakis) and David Cope (Cope) to make complex electronic music composition. Advances in computer technology have made it possible to design music algorithms based upon specific pitch, timbre and rhythmic qualities that can be manipulated in real time with a simple interface that a child can control.jam2jam (Brown, Sorensen, &amp; Dillon) is a shareware program developed in java that uses these ideas and involves what we have called Networked Improvisation, which ‘can be broadly described as collaborative music making over a computer network’ (Dillon &amp; Brown).     Fig. 1: jam2jam interface (download a shareware version at http://www.explodingart.com/.)   Jamming Online   With this software users manipulate sliders and dials to influence changes in music in real time. This enables the opportunity for participants to interact with the sound possibilities of a chosen musical style as a focused musical environment. Essentially by moving a slider or dial the user can change the intensity of the musical activity across musical elements such as rhythm, harmony, timbre and volume and the changes they make will respond within the framework of the musical style parameters, updating and recomposing within the timeframe of a quaver/eighth note. This enables the users to play within the style and to hear and influence the shape and structure of the sound. Whilst real time performance using a computer is not new, what is different about this software is that through a network users can create virtual ensembles, which are simultaneously collaborative and interactive.    jam2jam was developed using philosophical design principals based on an understanding of ‘meaning’ gained by musicians drawn from both software, live music experiences (Dillon, Student as Maker) and research about how professional composers engage with technology in creative production (Brown, Music Composition). New music technologies have for centuries provided expressive possibilities and an environment where humans can be playful. With jam2jam users can play with complex or simple musical ideas, interact with the musical elements, and hear the changes immediately. When networked they can have these musical experiences collaboratively in a virtual ensemble.    Background   The initial development of jam2jam began with a survey of the musical tastes of a group of children between the ages of 8-14 in a multi racial community in Delaware, Ohio in the USA as part of the Delaware Children’s Music Festival in 2002. These surveys of ‘the music they liked’ resulted in the researchers purchasing Compact Discs and completing a rule based analysis of the styles. This analysis was then converted into numerical values and algorithms were constructed and used as a structure for the software. The algorithms propose the intensity of range of each style. For example, in the Grunge style the snare drum at low intensity plays a cross stick rim timbre on the second and fourth beat and at high intensity the sound becomes a gated snare sound and plays rhythmic quaver/eighth note triplets. In between these are characteristic rhythmic materials that are less complex than the extreme (triplets). This procedure is replicated across five instruments; drums, percussion, bass, guitar and keyboard. The melodic instruments have algorithms for pitch organisation within the possibilities of the style. These algorithms are the recipes or lesson plans for interactive music making where the student’s gestures control the intensity of the music as it composes in real time. A simple interface was designed (see fig. 1) with a page for each instrument and the mixer.  The interface primarily uses dials and sliders for interaction, with radio buttons for timbrel/instrument selection.     Once the software was built and installed students were observed using it by videotaping their interaction and interviewing both children and teachers. Observations, which fed into the developmental design, were drawn on a daily basis with the interface and sound engine being regularly updated to accommodate students and teacher requirements. The principals of observation and analysis were based upon a theory of meaningful engagement (Brown, “Modes”, Music Composition; Dillon, “Modelling”, Student as Maker). These adjustments were applied to the software, the curriculum design and to the facilitators’ organisational processes and interactions with the students. The concept of meaningful engagement, which has been applied to this software development process, has provided an effective tool for identifying the location of meaning and describing modes of creative engagement experienced through networked jamming. It also provided a framework for dynamic evaluation and feedback which influences the design with each successive iteration.   Defining a Contemporary Musicianship   Networked improvisational experiences develop a contemporary musicianship, in which the computer is embraced as an instrument that can be used skillfully in live performance with both acoustic/electric instruments and other network users. The network itself becomes a site for a virtual ensemble where users can experience interaction between ‘players’ in real time. With networked improvisation, cyberspace becomes a venue. Observations have also included performances between two distant locations and ones where computers on the network simultaneously ‘jammed’ with ‘live’ acoustic performers.    The Future   The future of networked jamming is exciting. There is potential for these environments to replicate complex musical systems and engage participants in musical understandings, linking gesture and sound with concepts of musical knowledge that are constructed within the algorithm and the interface. The dynamic development of Networked Jamming applications involve designs which apply philosophical and pedagogical principles that encourage and sustain meaningful engagement with music making. These are sufficiently complex to allow the revisiting of musical experiences and knowledge at increasingly deeper levels.    Conclusion   jam2jam is a proof of concept model for networked jamming environments, where people and machines play music in collaborative ensembles. Network jamming requires a contemporary musicianship, which embraces the computer as an instrument, the network as an ensemble and cyberspace as venue for performance.  These concepts facilitate access to the ensemble performance of complex musical structures through simple interfaces. It provides the opportunity for users to be creatively immersed in the simultaneous act of listening and performance. jam2jam represents an opportunity for music-makers to have interactive experiences with musical knowledge in a way not otherwise previously available. It enables children, adults and the disabled to enter into a collaborative community where technology mediates a live ensemble performance. The experience could be an ostinato pumping out hip-hop or techno grooves, a Xenakis chaos algorithm, or a minimal ambient soundscape. With the development of new algorithms, a sample engine and creative interface design we believe this concept has amazing possibilities. The real potential of this concept lies in the access that the users have to meaningful engagement with ensemble performance in the production of music, in real time, even with limited previous experience or dexterity.

"2006","Code Jamming","&#x0D;         &#x0D; &#x0D;  Jamming culture has become associated with digital manipulation and reuse of materials. As well, the term jamming has long been used by musicians (and other performers) to mean improvisation, especially in collaborative situations. A practice that gets to the heart of both these meanings is live coding; where digital content (music and/or visuals predominantly) is created through computer programming as a performance. During live coding performances digital content is created and presented in real time. Normally the code from the performers screen is displayed via data projection so that the audience can see the unfolding process as well as see or hear the artistic outcome. This article will focus on live coding of music, but the issues it raises for jamming culture apply to other mediums also.   Live coding of music uses the computer as an instrument, which is “played” by the direct construction and manipulation of sonic and musical processes. Gestural control involves typing at the computer keyboard but, unlike traditional “keyboard” instruments, these key gestures are usually indirect in their effect on the sonic result because they result in programming language text which is then interpreted by the computer. Some live coding performers, notably Amy Alexander, have played on the duality of the keyboard as direct and indirect input source by using it as both a text entry device, audio trigger, and performance prop. In most cases, keyboard typing produces notational description during live coding performances as an indirect music making, related to what may previously have been called composing or conducting; where sound generation is controlled rather than triggered. The computer system becomes performer and the degree of interpretive autonomy allocated to the computer can vary widely, but is typically limited to probabilistic choices, structural processes and use of pre-established sound generators.   In live coding practices, the code is a medium of expression through which creative ideas are articulated. The code acts as a notational representation of computational processes. It not only leads to the sonic outcome but also is available for reflection, reuse and modification. The aspects of music described by the code are open to some variation, especially in relation to choices about music or sonic granularity. This granularity continuum ranges from a focus on sound synthesis at one end of the scale to the structural organisation of musical events or sections at the other end. Regardless of the level of content granularity being controlled, when jamming with code the time constraints of the live performance environment force the performer to develop succinct and parsimonious expressions and to create processes that sustain activity (often using repetition, iteration and evolution) in order to maintain a coherent and developing musical structure during the performance. As a result, live coding requires not only new performance skills but also new ways of describing the structures of and processes that create music.   Jamming activities are additionally complex when they are collaborative. Live Coding performances can often be collaborative, either between several musicians and/or between music and visual live coders. Issues that arise in collaborative settings are both creative and technical. When collaborating between performers in the same output medium (e.g., two musicians) the roles of each performer need to be defined. When a pianist and a vocalist improvise the harmonic and melodic roles are relatively obvious, but two laptop performers are more like a guitar duo where each can take any lead, supportive, rhythmic, harmonic, melodic, textual or other function. Prior organisation and sensitivity to the needs of the unfolding performance are required, as they have always been in musical improvisations. At the technical level it may be necessary for computers to be networked so that timing information, at least, is shared. Various network protocols, most commonly Open Sound Control (OSC), are used for this purpose. Another collaboration takes place in live coding, the one between the performer and the computer; especially where the computational processes are generative (as is often the case). This real-time interaction between musician and algorithmic process has been termed Hyperimprovisation by Roger Dean.    Jamming cultures that focus on remixing often value the sharing of resources, especially through the movement and treatment of content artefacts such as audio samples and digital images. In live coding circles there is a similarly strong culture of resource sharing, but live coders are mostly concerned with sharing techniques, processes and tools. In recognition of this, it is quite common that when distributing works live coding artists will include descriptions of the processes used to create work and even share the code. This practice is also common in the broader computational arts community, as evident in the sharing of flash code on sites such as Levitated by Jared Tarbell, in the Processing site (Reas &amp; Fry), or in publications such as Flash Maths Creativity (Peters et al.). Also underscoring this culture of sharing, is a prioritising of reputation above (or prior to) profit. As a result of these social factors most live coding tools are freely distributed.   Live Coding tools have become more common in the past few years. There are a number of personalised systems that utilise various different programming languages and environments. Some of the more polished programs, that can be used widely, include SuperCollider (McCartney), Chuck (Wang &amp; Cook) and Impromptu (Sorensen). While these environments all use different languages and varying ways of dealing with sound structure granularity, they do share some common aspects that reveal the priorities and requirements of live coding. Firstly, they are dynamic environments where the musical/sonic processes are not interrupted by modifications to the code; changes can be made on the fly and code is modifiable at runtime. Secondly, they are text-based and quite general programming environments, which means that the full leverage of abstract coding structures can be applied during live coding performances. Thirdly, they all prioritise time, both at architectural and syntactic levels. They are designed for real-time performance where events need to occur reliably. The text-based nature of these tools means that using them in live performance is barely distinguishable from any other computer task, such as writing an email, and thus the practice of projecting the environment to reveal the live process has become standard in the live coding community as a way of communicating with an audience (Collins).   It is interesting to reflect on how audiences respond to the projection of code as part of live coding performances. In the author’s experience as both an audience member and live coding performer, the reception has varied widely.  Most people seem to find it curious and comforting. Even if they cannot follow the code, they understand or are reassured that the performance is being generated by the code. Those who understand the code often report a sense of increased anticipation as they see structures emerge, and sometimes opportunities missed. Some people dislike the projection of the code, and see it as a distasteful display of virtuosity or as a distraction to their listening experience. The live coding practitioners tend to see the projection of code as a way of revealing the underlying generative and gestural nature of their performance. For some, such as Julian Rohrhuber, code projection is a way of revealing ideas and their development during the performance. “The incremental process of livecoding really is what makes it an act of public reasoning” (Rohrhuber). For both audience and performer, live coding is an explicitly risky venture and this element of public risk taking has long been central to the appreciation of the performing arts (not to mention sport and other cultural activities).   The place of live coding in the broader cultural setting is still being established. It certainly is a form of jamming, or improvisation, it also involves the generation of digital content and the remixing of cultural ideas and materials. In some ways it is also connected to instrument building. Live coding practices prioritise process and therefore have a link with conceptual visual art and serial music composition movements from the 20th century. Much of the music produced by live coding has aesthetic links, naturally enough, to electronic music genres including musique concrète, electronic dance music, glitch music, noise art and minimalism. A grouping that is not overly coherent besides a shared concern for processes and systems. Live coding is receiving greater popular and academic attention as evident in recent articles in Wired (Andrews), ABC Online (Martin) and media culture blogs including The Teeming Void (Whitelaw 2006).   Whatever its future profile in the boarder cultural sector the live coding community continues to grow and flourish amongst enthusiasts. The TOPLAP site is a hub of live coding activities and links prominent practitioners including, Alex McLean, Nick Collins, Adrian Ward, Julian Rohrhuber, Amy Alexander, Frederick Olofsson, Ge Wang, and Andrew Sorensen. These people and many others are exploring live coding as a form of jamming in digital media and as a way of creating new cultural practices and works.

"2006","Posthuman Collaboration: Multimedia, Improvisation, and Computer Mediation","            Artistic collaboration involves a certain loss of self, because it arises out of the merging of participants.  In this sense collaboration questions the notion of the creative individual and the myth of the isolated artistic genius. As such, artistic collaborations can be subversive interventions into the concept of authorship and the ideologies  that surround it (Smith 189-194).    Collaborations also often simultaneously superimpose many different approaches to the collaborative process.  Collaboration is therefore a multiplicitous  activity in which different kinds of interactivity are interlinked; this process may also be facilitated by improvisation which allows for continuous modification of the interactions (Smith and Dean, Improvisation). Even when we are writing individually, we are always collaborating with prior texts and employing ideas from others, advice and editing suggestions. This eclectic aspect of creative work has led some to argue that collaboration is the dominant mode, while individual creativity is an illusion (Stillinger; Bennett 94-107).   One of the reasons why collaboration tends to be multiplicitous is that contemporary creative endeavour sometimes involves collaboration across different media and with computers. Artworks are created by an ‘assemblage’ of different expertises, media, and machines in which the computer may be a ‘participant’. In this respect contemporary collaboration is what Katherine Hayles calls posthuman:  for Hayles ‘the posthuman subject is an amalgam, a collection of heterogeneous components,  a material-informational  entity whose boundaries undergo continuous construction and reconstruction (Hayles 3). Particularly important here is her argument about the conceptual shifts that information systems are creating.  She suggests that the binary of presence and absence is being progressively replaced in cultural and literary thought by the binary of pattern and randomness created by information systems and computer mediation (Hayles 25-49).  In other words, we used to be primarily concerned with human interactions, even if sometimes it was the lack of them, as in Roland Barthes concept of ‘the death of the author’.  However, this has shifted to our concern with computer systems as methods of organisation.  Nevertheless, Hayles argues, computers can never totally replace embodied human subjects,  rather we need to continually negotiate between presence and pattern, absence and randomness (Hayles 25-49). This very negotiation is central to many computer-mediated collaborations.    Our own collaborative practice—Roger is primarily a musician and Hazel primarily a writer but we both have interdisciplinary performance and technological expertise—spans 15 years and has resulted in approximately 18 collaborative works. They are all cross-media:  initially these brought together word and sound; now they sometimes also include image. They all involve multiple forms of collaboration, improvised and unfixed elements, and computer interfaces. Here we want to outline some of the stages in the making of our recent collaboration, Time, the Magician, and its ‘posthuman’ engagement with computerised processes.   Time, the Magician is a collaborative performance and sound-video piece. It combines words, sound and image, and involves composed and improvised elements as well as computer mediation. It was conceived largely by us, but the first performance, at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music in 2005 also involved collaboration with Greg White (sound processing) and Sandy Evans (saxophone). The piece begins with a poem by Hazel, initially performed solo, and then juxtaposed with live and improvised sound. This sound involves some real-time and pre-recorded sampling and processing of the voice: this—together with other sonic materials—creates a ‘voicescape’ in which the rhythm, pitch, and timbre of the voice are manipulated and the voice is also spatialised in the performance space (Smith and Dean, “Voicescapes”). The performance of the poem is followed (slightly overlapping) by screened text created in the real-time image-processing program Jitter, and this is also juxtaposed with sound and voice samples.  One of the important aspects of the piece is its variability: the video-manipulated text and images change both in order and appearance each time, and the sampling and manipulation of the voice is different too. The example here shows short extracts from the longer performance of the work at the Sydney 2005 event.                    (This is a Quicktime 7 compressed video of excerpts from the first performance of Time, the Magician by Hazel Smith and Roger Dean. The performance was given by austraLYSIS (Roger Dean, computer sound and image; Sandy Evans, saxophone; Hazel Smith, speaker; Greg White, computer sound and sound projection) at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, October 2005. The piece in its entirety lasts about 11 minutes, while these excerpts last about four minutes, and are not cross-faded, but simply juxtaposed. The piece itself will later be released elsewhere as a Web video/sound piece, made directly from the sound and the Jitter-processed images which accompany it. This Quicktime 7 performance video uses AAC audio compression (44kHz stereo), H.264 video compression (320x230), and has c. 15fps and 200kbits/sec.; it is prepared for HTTP fast-start streaming.  It requires the Quicktime 7 plugin, and on Macintosh works best with Safari or Firefox  Explorer is no longer supported for Macintosh. The total file size is c. 6MB. You can also access the file directly through this link.)   All of our collaborations have involved different working processes. Sometimes we start with a particular topic or process in mind, but the process is always explorative and the eventual outcome unpredictable. Usually periods of working individually—often successively rather than simultaneously—alternate with discussion.  We will now each describe our different roles in this particular collaboration, and the points of intersection between them.    Hazel   In creating Time, the Magician we made an initial decision that Roger—who would be responsible for the programming and sound component of the piece—would work with Jitter, which we had successfully used for a previous collaboration.  I would write the words, and I decided early on that I would like our collaboration to circle around ideas—which interested both Roger and me—about evolution, movement, emergence, and time. We decided that I would first write some text that would then be used as the basis of the piece, but I had no idea at this stage what form the text would take, and whether I would produce one continuous text or a number of textual fragments.  In the early stages I read and ‘collaborated with’ a number of different texts, particularly Elizabeth Grosz’s book The Nick of Time. I was interested in the way Grosz sees Darwin’s work as a treatise on difference—she argues that for Darwin there are no clear-cut distinctions between different species and no absolute origin of the species. I was also stimulated by her idea that political resistance is always potential, if latent, in the repressive regimes or social structures of the past.    As I was reading and absorbing the material, I opened a file on my computer and—using a ‘bottom-up’ approach—started to write fragments, sometimes working with the Grosz text as direct trigger. A poem evolved which was a continuous whole but also discontinuous in essence:  it consisted of many small fragments that, when glued together and transformed in relation to each other, reverberated though association.  This was appropriate, because as the writing process developed I had decided that I would write a poem, but then also disassemble it for the screened version. This way Roger could turn each segment into a module in Jitter, and program the sequence so that the texts would appear in a different order each time.    After I had written the poem we decided on a putative structure for the work: the poem would be performed first, the musical element would start about halfway through, and the screened version—with the fragmented texts—would follow. Roger said that he would video some background material to go behind the texts, but he also suggested that I design the texts as visual objects with coloured letters, different fonts, and free spatial arrangements, as I had in some previous multimedia pieces.  So I turned the texts into visual designs: this often resulted in my pulling apart sentences, phrases and words and rearranging them.  I then converted the texts files into jpg files and gave them to Roger to work on.    Roger   When Hazel gave me her 32 text images, I turned these into a QuickTime video with 10 seconds per image/frame. I also shot a 5 minute ‘background’ video of vegetation and ground, often moving the camera quickly over blurred objects or zooming in very close to them. The video was then edited as a continually moving sequence with an oscillation between clearly defined and abstracted objects, and between artificial and natural ones. The Jitter interface is constructed largely as a sequence of three processing modules. One of these involves continuously changing the way in which two layers (in this case text and background) are mixed; the second, rotation and feedback of segments from one or both layers; and the third a kind of dripping across the image, with feedback, of segments from one or both layers. The interface is performable, in that the timing and sequence can be altered as the piece progresses, and within any one module most of the parameters are available for performer control—this is the essence of what we call ‘hyperimprovisation’ (Dean).  Both text and image layers are ‘granulated’: after a randomly variable length of time—between 2 and 20 seconds or so—there is a jump to a randomly chosen new position in the video, and these jumps occur independently for the two layers.     Having established this approach to the image generation, and the overall shape of the piece (as defined above), the remaining aspects were left to the creative choices of the performers. In the Sydney performance both Greg White and I exploited real-time processing of the spoken text by means of the live feed and pre-recorded material.  In addition we used long buffers (which contained the present performance of the text) to access the spoken text after Hazel had finished her performed opening segment. I worked on the sound and speech components with some granulation and feedback techniques, throughout, while Greg used a range of other techniques, as well as focusing on the spatial movement of the sound around four loudspeakers surrounding the performance and listening space.  Sandy Evans (saxophone)—who was familiar with the overall timeline—improvised freely while viewing the video and listening to our soundscape.    In this first performance, while I drove the sound, the computer ‘posthumanly’ (that is without intervention) drove the image. I worked largely with MSP (Max Signal Processing), a part of the MAX/MSP/Jitter suite of platforms for midi, sound and image, to complement sonically the Jitter-mediated video. So processes of granulation, feedback, spatial rotation (of image) or redistribution (of sound)—as well as re-emergence of objects which had been retained in the memory of the computer—were common to both the sound and image manipulation. There was therefore a degree of algorithmic synaesthesia—that is shared algorithms between image and sound (Dean, Whitelaw, Smith, and Worrall).    The collaborative process involved a range of stimuli: not only with regard to those of process, as discussed,  but also in relation to the ideas in the text Hazel provided.  The concepts of evolution, movement, and emergence which were important to her writing also informed and influenced the choice of biological and artificial objects in the background video, and the nature and juxtaposition of the processing modules for both sound and image.    Conclusion   If we return to the issues raised at the beginning of this article, we can see how our collaboration does involve the merging of participants and the destabilising of the concept of authorship.  The poem was not complete after Hazel had written it—or even after she had dislocated it—but is continually reassembled by the Jitter interface that Roger has constructed. The visual images were also produced first by Hazel, then fused with Roger’s video in continuously changing formations through the Jitter interface. The performance may involve collaboration by several people who were not involved in the original conception of the work, indicating how collaboration can become an extended and accumulative process.     The collaboration also simultaneously superimposes several different kinds of collaborative process, including the intertextual encounter with the Grosz text; the intermedia fusion of text, image and sound; the participation of a number of different people with differentiated roles and varying degrees of input; and collaboration with the computer.  It is an assemblage in the terms mentioned earlier: a continuously modulating conjunction of different expertises, media, and machines.    Finally, the collaboration is simultaneously both human and posthuman.  It negotiates—in the way Hayles suggests—between pattern, presence, randomness, and absence.  On the one hand, it involves human intervention (the writing of the poem, the live music-making, the shooting of the video, the discussion between participants) though sometimes those interventions are hidden, merged, or subsumed.  On the other hand, the Jitter interface allows for both tight programming and elements of variability and unpredictability.  In this way the collaboration displaces the autonomous subject with what Hayles calls a ‘distributed system’ (Hayles 290).  The consequence is that the collaborative process never reaches an endpoint: the computer interface will construct the piece differently each time, we may choose to interact with it in performance, and the sound performance will always contain many improvised and unpredictable elements.  The collaborative process, like the work it produces, is ongoing, emergent, and mutating.     References    Bennett, Andrew. The Author. London: Routledge, 2005. Dean, Roger T.

"2006","Jammed in an Unknown Device","&#x0D;         &#x0D; &#x0D;  In 2005, in response to student interest and at the request of Cathy Lane, at that time course director of Sound Arts and Design at the London College of Communication, I began to run courses in improvisation for 2nd year undergraduates. The workshops are a core option for the BA, alongside other courses such as environmental sound recording, studio production and Max/MSP.   In 2004 I had been awarded a three year practice based research fellowship by the AHRC (Arts and Humanities Research Council); my project was entitled Sound Body, an investigation into the impact of digital technology on improvised music performance and other forms of sonic art. For this reason, and because only a minority of Sound Arts and Design students perform on conventional musical instruments, the course was called Digital Improvisation. In practice, however, the sound sources used were a rich and sometimes comical mix of laptop computers, turntables, homemade analogue electronic devices, power drills, electronic keyboards and sampling devices, and even an acoustic violin, though this was processed through another student’s equipment. Responding to the unpredictability of the mix, I called the group Unknown Devices, though within the college it is known more generically as the Laptop Orchestra.   The digital improvisation workshop has three main aims:    To encourage an awareness and understanding of musical, interpersonal and technical issues involved in sonic improvisation. To nurture confidence and sensitivity in the playing of improvised music. To develop a practical and professional approach to performing group improvisation.   The sessions are held over six consecutive weeks and each may last from 90 minutes to 3 hours. Punctuality is stressed, partly to prepare those students who are unfamiliar with the practicalities of public performance, and partly to minimise the period of setting up that begins each class.    The first session is devoted to a discussion in which students give their views on improvised music: what is it, how does it work, how does it relate to other forms of improvisation in the arts, and how might it connect with the improvisation of daily life? Many students begin with very limited ideas about improvisation. Some think of it as an excuse for ‘jamming’, which may seem an easy option for a Monday afternoon. For most of them this has connotations, either positive or negative depending on the student, of a self-indulgent free-for-all, an emotional outlet with little discipline and few boundaries. In order to refine these ideas, we begin to explore some of the hidden rules of improvisation, such as the necessity for restraint, collective discipline, self-control, self-criticism, close listening, dynamic group analysis, and a willingness to balance personal aims, desires and skills (or the lack of them) with the needs of the group.    Though discussed from the outset, the concept of jamming remains as a grey eminence throughout. For some students it is hard to dislodge this approach, and equally hard for me, as the director of each session, to open up a path through which they can interact in more specific and considered ways. What is jamming, the question is asked, and the answer is that jamming is associated predominantly with a known form, the participants play in order to exercise their skill, even to the point of competitiveness, but also for the pleasure of interaction without the need for perfection. Perhaps this is why recorded jam sessions can be disappointing. Two examples from my own record collection – Charlie Christian experimenting with the new bebop at Minton’s Playhouse, and John McLaughlin with Jimi Hendrix – are both interesting as historic documents but pale beside the more finished work of all these artists.   Improvisation demands a closer awareness of the group. During the first session, we consider some of the qualities that are needed to create improvisations that are satisfying both for the participant and for the listener. Students are given a worksheet, drawn from my own experience as an improviser, which lists examples of these qualities. From a list of 38, this is a selection:     The urge to play. An aptitude for reacting quickly to unexpected, sometimes unwelcome developments.  Being able to produce ideas and techniques that allow a variety of responses, both to individuals, and to the overall group sound. A sense of form. An acute awareness of time. The ability to identify the nature of a sound and produce an engaging response (this means being able to work with pitch relationships, rhythmic elements, or the complexity of individual sounds). Silence and stillness. A knowledge of your instrument, and confidence in using it. Patience. The ability to think and act at microscopic and macroscopic levels simultaneously. Experience in scanning and evaluating complex situations from moment to moment, yet maintaining personal focus. Tolerance. The strength to fight for space. The ability to turn any of the above qualities on their head. The strength to be quiet.   Exercises in playing, listening, and mutual criticism are used to develop these qualities during the course of the six weeks. The class may be divided into two sections. One group performs an exercise; the other group listens and then gives a critique of the performance based on its success in achieving its aims. The worksheet includes observations which are analysed either in specific points of development during a class, or applied throughout the six sessions. From a list of 32, here are 6 examples:    Learn to maintain intensity, concentration, and relaxation simultaneously. Consider the layout and appearance of whatever you’re playing. Is it set up so that you’re going to trip over a cable, or so that you can’t reach something quickly? Does it look like a pile of junk to the audience? Is that the effect you want to achieve? Are you invisible to the audience? Do you want that?  Learn how to change a situation when it’s stuck. Learn how to be supportive, and how to be disruptive. Don’t try to be liked: don’t go out of your way to be disliked. Don’t be afraid to stay in one spot; don’t be afraid to move on.   Some students have professional experience of performing and highly developed instrumental abilities. Others may have no experience of making live music or using any kind of instrument. Conflicts can arise in situations in which one person’s confidence may be excessive, their self-absorption effectively preventing them from listening or responding to the group, whereas another person may be so timid that their ability to participate is seriously impaired. Musical and aesthetic tastes and theories are also an issue, and clashes between incompatible styles are common. Such tensions may tap into conflicts and alliances that already exist at an interpersonal level, so a part of the development of the group will inevitably require a willingness to compromise and negotiate, and to find ways of resolving conflict through musical cooperation.     I give them practical exercises during each class and certain of these exercises will be revisited over the 6 week period as a measure of progress. Four examples from the worksheet are given below:   STILL: The group sits very quietly, listening to the sound of the room, identifying each component of the sound and placing it within the space. Each player is allowed one short contribution, which can be made after the stillness and the room sound has affected their ideas about what they might play. After making the one contribution, the player then sits quietly again. The piece ends when everybody has made their contribution.   COMMUNITIES: The large group splits into three or four smaller groups. One group begins an improvisation; after five minutes, the second group joins in. The first group stops playing after a minute of overlap. Then the third group joins in after another five minutes, and the second group stops after a minute’s overlap.    COMMUNITIES II: In a second version of this strategy, the groups decide when to make their own entries and exits. All groups may play at the same time, or stop at the same time, but they must stay aware of their role as a group within a group. Each group must find ways of starting together, and finishing together, without any verbal communication.   CRESCENDO: beginning by listening closely to the room, the group moves from silence to loud noise at a similar pace, taking a few minutes to do so and adjusting volume to match volume levels as closely as possible. Everybody attempts to stop at the same time.   DIMINUENDO: the group moves from loud noise down to silence over a three minute period, trying to match volume levels as closely as possible.    At the end of the 6 week period, the group gives a public performance. This impending exposure to an audience is an important goal – a test of how far they have come and an incentive to resolve technical problems, focus on learning during each session, set aside conflicts, and even begin to self-organise. At the beginning of the course they are highly critical of their own capacity to work together as a group, and in some cases sceptical of the whole idea of improvisation. In all examples of the Orchestra giving a public performance, although individuals have expressed disappointment that certain pieces could have been played better, the overall feeling is a sense of pleasurable surprise that such a disparate group of people can avoid chaos or collapse to produce a sustained performance which gives them personal satisfaction, both as a participatory and listening experience.    &#x0D;         &#x0D;           Citation reference for this article&#x0D; &#x0D;           MLA Style&#x0D;           Toop, David.

Designers have much at stake in the use of their software, while users are greatly influenced by the design of the software that they use. In this article, I explore the complex relationships built up between the designers and users of human anatomy simulations, including processes of cooperation and conflict. I develop and apply a three-step process for studying the design and use of a software product in its social context. First, it is important to focus on the social worlds of designers and users that influence the development of the technology. Next, the emphasis shifts to the technology itself, which can be viewed as a boundary object emerging from the intersection of the contributing social worlds. Finally, the technology exhibits agency by reshaping the relationships and interactions among the contributing social worlds.","",""

"2006","Beyond binary choices: Understanding and exploiting trade-offs to enhance creativity","Many research approaches are conceptualized as binary choices, representing endpoints of a spectrum (each of them providing important perspectives within their own discourses). Design and creativity are often conceptualized as being focused on one of these binary choices, thereby overlooking other possibilities. To better stimulate, enhance, and support creativity, our research has explored the middle ground between the endpoints defined by binary choices to identify “sweet spots” based on a careful trade–off analysis of specific goals, objectives, stakeholders, and socio–technical environments.  This paper illustrates some of the major trade–offs related to design and creativity that we have explored in our research over the last ten years, including prescriptive and permissive environments, individual and social creativity, communities of practice and communities of interest, and consumer and active contributor cultures. It briefly describes some of the socio–technical environments that we have developed to enhance creativity in specific contexts.","",""
"2006","Spatial dialectics: montage and spatially organised narrative in stories without human leads","Abstract This article analyses and formulates mechanisms for creating meaningful and engaging narrativity in interactive movies not based on character, where the dialectic relationship between architectural space and the rules that govern montage shape the narrative structure. Formalist analysis of Dziga Vertov's film Man with the Movie Camera (USSR, 1929) highlights two significant terms which play a centralrolein the formulation of the rhetoricalargument of the moving image. ‘Punctus-contra-punctum mon-tage’(‘counterpoint montage’) describes a technique that exploits analogies in form or content between adjacent clips, to produce meaningful thematic sequences; while Lev Kuleshov's ‘artificial landscapes’—the imaginary, creative geographies constructed of moving images that exist only on the screen—offer a way of arranging media spatially. A proof-of-concept, prototype production, Cambridge City Symphony (Alifragkis & Penz 2006), where these approaches are instantiated as rule-sets, and handled by the computer, illustrates how these produce engaging interactive narrativity.","",""
"2006","Back to the future: interactivity and associational narrativity at the Bauhaus","Abstract This paper contextualises the themes of interactivity and associational narrativity within a wider historicaltrajectory, by examining projects conducted at the Bauhaus during the 1920s. Bauhaus artists such as László Moholy-Nagy and Oskar Schlemmer developed models and theories for cinema, theatre and installation art, which sought to surrender authorial control and engage the audience as a creative force. As contemporary artists continue to debate how to transform interactivity into an aesthetically compelling rather than participatory activity, Bauhaus projects, with their focus on associational narratives and awareness of embodied cognition, offer inspiration for current practice.","",""
"2006","Computational and spatially-organised narrativity","In the first quarter of the 21 century, there is no sign of conventional linear storytelling disappearing or losing its expressive power; but at the same time, new genres of non-linear games, television, music, drama and cinema, supported by the computer, have become a reality—rather than a theoretical possibility. On the one hand, these rely on the heritage of conventional storytelling genres; on the other, they draw on—and sometimes generate—new, contemporary, interactive-media technologies and approaches. In these emerging art-forms, developed in what Murray terms a ‘processcentred medium’ (Murray 1997, p.182), linear narrative thinking is expanded to include—or inhabit—the space of narrative potentials. The spatial organisation of narrative has become a shared ground for many kinds of creativity, enabling a range of conceptualisations and interaction-frameworks, designed to activate these potentials as new kinds of narrative experience that are engaging and immersive. “Of the three types of immersion”, claims Ryan, “the spatial variety has the most to gain from the built-in spatiality of pictures” (Ryan 2001, p.263)—and visualising storyspace is as important as structuring the story itself. With the inclusion of the computer, the borders between screen-space and participatory space, action and participation, shift and re-form to compelling dramatic effect. At the symposium Computational and Spatially Organised Narrative held at Media Centre LUME, Helsinki, April 26–29 2006, a representative sample of practical and theoretical work in the field was brought together for discussion; and from that process emerged all the articles in this special issue of Digital Creativity. In this context, computational narrative and spatial organisation appear as already well-established phenomena, of which the historical roots deserve attention. The light of historical discovery is shed by Alifragkis and Penz, who revisit, for example, Vertov’s work and Kuleshov’s ‘artificial landscapes’, mining them for metadata categories to create new portraits of the city using interactive digital media. Prager, who reviews the work of Moholy-Nagy, Schlemmer and other Bauhaus artists, finds models for the computational treatment of visual cinematic narrativity today, while Tikka, Vuori and Kaipainen revive Eisenstein’s ‘montage machine’ for the algorithmic generation of narrative flow. Spatial organisation is discussed in two senses in this issue: the ontological space of content, and the physical space of installation—which interact and relate to each other in various fertile ways. Artopoulos and Condorcet elaborate an idea for parametrically generative physical viewing-space as the matrix for generative video narrative, which embodies the practice of gamelike ‘what if? ...’ storytelling. In a similar spirit, Sussner, Thomas and Richens formulate the topography of cinematic narrative as architectural construction, refashioning Kevin Lynch’s urban categories (Lynch 1960, p.6) and Christian Norberg-Schulz’s concept of place (Norberg-Schulz 1986, p.29) as design ontology for both 3D-environment and cinematic narrative structure. This approach has strong similarities with the work of Tikka, Vuori and Kaipainen, who propose a formal definition of virtual narrative space in terms of ontological dimensions—that is, multidimensional characterisations of the content which constitutes the nature and existence of a particular storyworld, and carry meaning when associated with storylines that cross its space. In these conceptualisations, ontological dimensions constitute the co-ordinate system in which the building-blocks of the story reside, and which allows the fixing of waypoints for navigating the space, and generating narrative sequences algorithmically. The narrative spaces of several works presented in the current issue can, in principle, be analysed as such ontological space—Obsession (Tikka, Vuori and Kaipainen), Gormenghast Explore (Sussner and Thomas), House of Affects e d it o ri a l","",""

Within every system, a variety of issues dealing with the concept of ‘representation’ are addressed in an interdisciplinary manner. It is a compulsory course lasting three semesters, in the second and third year of a five-year architectural program. It has been offered since the academic year 1999/2000.","",""

Literacy is about the use of particular tools to satisfy well-defined tasks while fluency is a deeper form of knowledge that allows people to adapt to the uncertainties of computing and keep up with new, technological trends. Computational flexibility suggests the further capacity toinvent software when existing applications fail to solve new problems.

The technique involves locally heating the work piece by traversing it under a laser beam. Positioning tables with a minimum of x and y axes are used as the means of moving the metal. Control of the laser path is via the table movement and requires programs written in G-Code machine language. This can present problems for the designer but complimented by today's modern computing methods, there can be some relief from arduous number crunching and it can be possible that an old programming language, comparatively new software and an understanding of three-dimensional space, thermodynamics and design, can be combined for creating designed objects.","",""

By triangulating data from computer ‘save-as’ files, transcription of the verbal protocol, semistructured interviews and verification sessions with the composer, it was possible to examine aspects of creative problem-solving and moments of insight in such activity. Mapping of the emerging structure was also possible and this, combined with analysis of procedures and strategies outlines in the verbal protocol, allowed a view into the compositional ‘flow’, and a resultant hypothetical model of composition process to be presented. Practical issues around the use of verbal protocol methodology are discussed.","",""

Computer vision software has been developed that can recognise and distinguish between different flashlight beams and these can be used to activate digital media including audio, video or special effects. The technology appears to ’magically bring to life’ objects and areas of the environment merely by shining a torch on them and has been used successfully to enhance visitor attractions such as museum exhibits and displays. This paper considers the potential for using this technology in special needs education, providing a means for children to explore their immediate environment and discover something new. Potential applications for supporting learning are proposed and a feasibility study is presented. Three case examples were conducted to assess the practicalities of configuring interactive learning experiences within the schoolenvironment and pupil’s responses to the technology.","",""

The feedback stimuli is directly linked to the child's gesticulations for a sense of associated control to be available for recognition. Non-intrusive sourcing of gesture is through camera data mapped to computer vision algorithms. Intervention strategies from staff and helpers within such user-centred environments are questioned. Results point to the positive benefits for these children such as increased eye-to-hand coordination, concentration duration, andimproved communication.

This paper examines the nature of their dissatisfaction and proposes solutions. A comprehensive observational study of industrial designers' existing CAD and physical modelling activities is reported, from which an evidence base for the specification of improved digital industrial design tools is derived. Theories on design modelling, sketching, human cognitive development and CAD evolution are used to underpin the major conclusion that a conceptual shift in digital design tools must take place if industrial design is to be properly supported. The shift is discussed and illustrated through the presentation of plausible new HCI systems classed as ‘virtual workshops’ and ‘intelligent environments’.","",""
"2007","Editorial: ArtAbilitation","The inaugural international conference ArtAbilitation was hosted at the Utzondesigned Centre for the Performing Arts, Musikhuset Esbjerg, Denmark in September 2006. It supported the renowned International Conference for Disability, Virtual Reality and Associated Technologies (ICDVRAT) which celebrated a decade of biennial conferences. Thus a claim was made for the hosting of ‘The conference of the decade’! ‘ArtAbilitation’, as an open conceptual entity, carries—through its mission statement—manifold interpretations. The concept has emerged out of a new evolving platform for interdisciplinary research, knowledge exchange and product development entitled SoundScapes. The SoundScapes concept involves the use of sensor technologies that are not worn on the body and involve human data capture from movement within an invisible volumetric information space. This data is mapped to personalised multimedia which is experienced as a virtual environment. This capture technique and mapping strategy empowers intuitive and natural control through gesture for motivated engagement with the virtual environment. The personalisation of the interactive environment enables utility as a new therapeutic supplement for practitioners. SoundScapes was featured in an article in Digital Creativity, vol. 16, no. 1, pp. 43–53 and is the subject of a book that is currently being written. Scientific reports on alternative realities such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR) and artificial reality are as welcome in ArtAbilitation as are the most basic of assistive devices like a single switcher. Hardware and software, digital and analogue, positivism and hermeneutic are all amongst targeted topics. Too diverse? Possibly but let me explain a little more... Some may refer to the term ‘ArtAbilitation’ from a linguistic perspective and interpret it as in ‘Art (Reh)abilitation’ and thus directed at art therapists who use art forms such as painting, music, dance, theatre and movement in practises that give benefit from within rehabilitation to the community of, for example, those with a disability or damage. There are also other groups for whom an alternative interpretation has been suggested. These are groups closely linked to therapy but differ in that they are categorised as not capable of rehabilitation but, rather, undergo abilitation. In other words, due to the severity of their dysfunction they are classified as regressive. This group is addressed so as to give whatever quality of life is possible with whatever functional ability they have and according to the human resources available. Addressing optimally requires passionate meaning and conviction, as in art. However, as Davies (2005) states, this group is often excluded from research or healthcare funding due to their inherent complexities or diverse characteristics. Despite being a rich resource from within which to explore unchartered avenues of human research, this exclusion from funding possibly brings it even closer to art! Consider for a moment when a person loses a sense and is categorized as disabled, often it is witnessed that a compensatory sense becomes strengthened. A blind man’s nuances of profile, feeling of space or auditory perception all grow into a heightened state. This arbitrary sensory nuance is fertile ground for the development of future art, artist and audience. Yet, many steer clear of the blind man tap, tap, tapping across the street, not realising his listening to the echo of his cane sounding against the targeted sidewalk or pavement is giving him distance feedback. With current predicted demographic trends the balance of people with disability versus those without is changing towards an unprecedented predicament for society. Eurostats (ec. europa.eu/eurostat) inform of an increased aged population, decreased workforce and extended life expectancies. The aged population is where disability figures predominate. e d it o ri a l","",""

We first give an overview of the CELL project where the performative approach led to a significant change in the way that scientist Neil Theise investigated stem cells. The success of this project directly led to the work which is the main focus of this paper: the design of Net Work, an interactive artwork that consists of a grid of autonomous buoys that emit different coloured light in response to the environment and the state of neighbouring buoys. We describe our performative approach to building the Net Work prototype and outline in detail its control system which is based on Ashby's homeostat model. The paper concludes with a short discussion of some of the benefits and pitfalls of an interdisciplinary collaborative approach to problem solving.","",""
"2007","<i>e-skin</i>: research into wearable interfaces, cross-modal perception and communication for the visually impaired on the mediated stage","Abstract Today our cultural events are dominated by visual information based on sight and sound, but hardly at all on the combined senses of touch and sound. Very little theatre, dance or art events exist in which visually impaired people can participate. While compensated audio-description or talking books are standard products that these people can buy to imagine feature film stories or decide what is happening on the stage, computer interfaces are not often designed which promote communication between impaired actors. Nor are they designed to allow them to navigate and control audio-visual information on the digital stage or present cultural events to sighted audiences. Our research group is interested to address these problems by constructing ergonomic human computer interfaces (HCI) that can explore the above problems including research into orientation, cognitive mapping and external audio-visual device control. Furthermore, the unique cross-modal potentials of human sensory perception could be augmented by electronic devices, which in turn might communicate with sighted audiences. Consequently, we are implementing our discoveries in artificial systems that can interact intelligently with people on the real digitally mediated stage.","",""

In this paper we discuss an affective computing architecture for the dynamic modification of music with a view to predictablyaffectinginducedmusicalemotions. Extending previous work on the modification of perceived emotions in music, our system architecture aims to provide reliable control of both perceived and induced musical emotions: its emotionality. A rule-based system is used to modify a subset of musical features at two processing levels, namely score and performance. The interactive model leverages sensed listener affect by adapting the emotionality of the music modifications in real-time to assist the listener in reaching a desired emotional state.","",""

Works discussed include music videos, design-oriented short films, and motion graphics by directors Michel Gondry, Virgil Widrich, Mike Nourse, Barbara Lattanzi, Rico Gatson, and design firms Logan, Ramon & Pedro, and H5. These works are considered in relation to the historical  – particularly the Structural film movement of the 1960s and 70s – and analyzed as responses to a range of cultural concerns specific to the  age. The analysis identifies movement toward two terminal points: first, a mode of remix-based montage inspired by   programming communities and peer-to-peer networks; and second, the emergence of a mode of imaging termed the   which foregrounds the material basis of  production. Aporias of the Digital Avant-Garde This article maps two divergent trajectories within a narrowly defined sphere of short-form, time-based,  media – specifically: music videos, design-oriented short films and motion graphics – created during the past ten years. Despite the fact that the work under consideration here has rapidly proliferated and resonated with many of the key theoretical issues in cinema and visual  studies of the past three decades, it has been largely neglected by theorists and critics of  culture.[1] Part of the reason for this neglect is practical. The works themselves are often ephemeral or difficult to access and they tend to occupy a liminal position between what is called experimental or avant-garde film and video, and the equally broadly defined field of practice termed new  These works therefore do not fit into any consistent curricular or publishing niche, are rarely a part of mainstream culture, do not receive theatrical distribution or broadcasting, and are often regarded with suspicion as proper objects of study within an academic context.[2] Nonetheless, I will argue that much of this work may be productively understood as a processing ground for some of the most compelling issues in  culture, as seen across the broad spectrum of contemporary media. I am particularly interested in considering this work’s potential for understanding emergent approaches to the perception and construction of space, time, and bodies; the status of narrative; and relations between technology and material culture. As a point of entry, I propose to ask whether this work may be meaningfully understood in relation to the historical  particularly the Euro-American Structural film movement of the 1960s and 70s, and to explore resonances with a range of cultural concerns of relevance to the  age. I do not, however, wish to spend much time justifying my use of the term “avant-garde,” which admittedly carries specific historical connotations which are not all applicable to the present discussion.[3] I will argue that these questions guide us toward two primary terminal points. The first is the movement toward a kind of open source video authoring modeled after the combined practices of   programming communities and peer-to-peer file sharing networks – two practices that have significance for the future of  media across a wide range of production and distribution practices. The second is the emergence of what I call the   a mode that foregrounds material aspects of production seemingly in defiance of the conventional wisdom that  media are characterized by dematerialization and disconnection from the physical world. Because the title of this essay features the rather glaring oxymoron  avant-garde, it may be useful to I will argue that these questions guide us toward two primary terminal points. The first is the movement toward a kind of open source video authoring modeled after the combined practices of   programming communities and peer-to-peer file sharing networks – two practices that have significance for the future of  media across a wide range of production and distribution practices. The second is the emergence of what I call the   a mode that foregrounds material aspects of production seemingly in defiance of the conventional wisdom that  media are characterized by dematerialization and disconnection from the physical world. transvergence.anderson.digitalavantgards.01 define these two terms in isolation in order to frame the use I hope to make of them in juxtaposition. First, the term digital rarely denotes a set of cohesive practices. Digital media are notoriously hybrid, often bringing together images, sounds, and objects that are computer-generated or mediated with others that originate in the analogue, photochemical, or textual worlds. There is, however, a certain utility to digital as a historicizing term, particularly as it implies its own eventual obsolescence. I am less interested, therefore, in defining  culture in terms of technology, than in attempting to identify the social practices and preoccupations that are particular to the  age. One of the things at stake within the consumer  that surrounds  media is the growing invisibility of its underpinning technology. This is of particular relevance given the current movement toward ubiquitous computing and wireless networks; even flat panel monitors and microprocessors that are embedded in everyday objects seem to negate the physical infrastructure of the computer and by implication, its socio-industrial base. Within visual culture,  imaging has come to signify a parallel ontological shift away from the indexical trace of the photograph. Where photochemical imaging could lay claim to a direct relation to the physical world, both conventional wisdom and our own experience tell us that  images are differently disconnected from the world they purport to represent. Although the problematic of representing reality long predates the appearance of  technology, the early 1990s marked a point-ofno-return for the representational capacity of images. In his 1991 book Representing Reality, documentary film theorist Bill Nichols offered this almost sheepish disclaimer: [through  sampling] The image becomes a series of bits, a pattern of yes/no choices registered within a computer’s memory [...] There is no original negative [...] against which all prints can be compared for accuracy and authenticity. There may not even be an external referent. The implications of all this are only beginning to be grasped. They clearly set a historical framework around the discussion presented in this book, which continues to emphasize the qualities and properties of the photographic","",""
"2008","OK COMPUTER: Mobility, software and the laptop musician","In this article I address some images, categories and open-ended trajectories of the laptop in music production. The aim is to explore the laptop's increasing presence in the sites of music, from cyberspace to live venues, as well as the relationship between music and mobile computerized space. Implicit in the article is the claim that the laptop is a neglected device, but that close attention to its position in cultural networks and everyday settings is one way of examining some possible ways into the complex entanglements and layerings of mobile space. The first part of the article explores the laptop as the archetypal nomadic machine of the digital age, inserted into mobile networks, hubs and flows. The laptop mediates mobility and by doing so not only serves macro-processes of social and economic change, but also opens up creative possibilities for the musician beyond the studio and the home. The second part of the article examines the role of software in activating the laptop's capabilities. The growth of music software and Virtual Studio Technology in the early 2000s, it will be argued, represents a major transformation in music production. A case study is made of a single application, Ableton Live, to show that new forms of music software encourage norms of creativity and play that take it beyond emulations of hardware studios. A residual distrust of the laptop's automative capabilities, however, reprises an anxiety in the history of popular music around questions of creativity and musicianship. The final part explores this anxiety and argues that the laptop is a place-holder for conflicting meanings about what belongs in music: productivity and creation, reality and virtuality, play and work, the cybernetic and the organic. It thereby reveals socio-technical imbroglios in action, where digitized music and software code meet the material properties of technologies and the practices of users in complex, networked societies.","",""

The rationale of what elements are chosen and where they are placed is based on tacit knowledge gained over a number of years of experience. The aesthetics associated with the overall finished design are often based on a style. Important elements of style are complexity and aesthetic value. In this paper I explore how various mathematical aesthetic functions can use complexity as an arousal enhancing or limiting mechanism in the application of layout designs.","",""

Thanks to an original interactive process analysing people's vocal input to create 3D graphics, a tangible correspondence between speech and visuals opens new possibilities of interaction. This cross-modal interaction not only supports our artistic messages, but also aims at providing anyone with a pleasant and stimulating feedback from her/his speech activity. As the feedback we have received when presenting Flying Cities was very positive, our objective is now to cross the bridge between art and a potential application. We believe that it could become a new medium for creativity and a way to visually perceive a vocal performance in the context of the rehabilitation of people with reduced mobility or language impairments.","",""

It is a critical design approach introducing alternative design proposals in three steps. In the first step we define myths and delusions of digital products restricting interaction and awareness. In the second step we introduce critical myth exposures reading, exposing, reviewing and demystifying the myths. In the third step we design ‘transformers to explore design alternatives, i.e. we transform the myths by changing the design and the way the product is being presented in use. The aim is to question what counts as normal and intuitive with respect to all those everyday computational products we are getting more and more used to. Defining and questioning digital myths is here seen as one form of design critique.","",""
"2008","Creativity and evolution: a metadesign perspective","Abstract In a world that is not predictable, improvisation and evolution are more than a luxury: they are a necessity. The challenge of design is not a matter of getting rid of the emergent, but rather of making it an opportunity for more creative and more sustainable solutions. User-centered and participatory design approaches have focused primarily on activities taking place at design time. These approaches have not given enough emphasis and they have provided few mechanisms to support systems as living entities that can evolve over time. Metadesign is a unique design approach concerned with opening up solution spaces rather than complete solutions (hence the prefix meta-), and aimed at creating social and technical infrastructures in which new forms of collaborative design can take place. This approach extends the traditional notion of design beyond the original development of a system to include co-adaptive processes between users and systems that enable the users to act as designers in personally meaningful activities and be creative.","",""
"2008","Using music and motion analysis to construct 3D animations and visualisations","Abstract This paper presents a study into music analysis, motion analysis and the integration of music and motion to form creative natural human motion in a virtual environment. Motion capture data is extracted to generate a motion library, this places the digital motion model at a fixed posture. The first step in this process is to configure the motion path curve for the database and calculate the possibility that two motions were sequential through the use of a computational algorithm. Every motion is then analysed for the next possible smooth movement to connect to, and at the same time, an interpolation method is used to create the transitions between motions to enable the digital motion models to move fluently. Lastly, a searching algorithm sifts for possible successive motions from the motion path curve according to the music tempo. It was concluded that the higher ratio of rescaling a transition, the lower the degree of natural motion.","",""
"2008","Embodied interfaces: dancing with digital sprites","Abstract This paper focuses on the research project, Projecting Performance, in which off-stage technical operators take on the role of performer through the live manipulation of digital ‘sprites’ in a theatrical environment. The sprites are projected onto gauzes in the stage space and operators control them with graphics tablets and pens to perform with on-stage dancers. Operators have frequently described experiences of dislocation or translocation during the experience of operating and this paper investigates the reasons for such reports. It presents the tripartite models of Zich and Castronova from the fields of theatre studies and human-computer interaction respectively, cross-referencing them to analyse the relationship between performer-operator and sprite. Merleau-Ponty's phenomenological theories are then employed through the writings of Crowther and Fraleigh to explore the experience of the performer-operator. The paper proposes an understanding of the digital interface in Projecting Performance as embodied and experienced both visually and kinaesthetically by the performer-operator.","",""

An audiovisual immersive interactive environment was developed to encourage creative interaction and expression from the participants. The feedback was via a microphone attached to a sound processor to capture any vocal utterances or speech, additionally the child's gestures were captured through a digital camera and mapped to computer vision algorithms to create a ‘moving painting’, and then further to a MIDI sound source that responded to the movements of the child. Results indicated increased engagement spans whilst in the environment, atypical communicative responses in the case of the ASD child; highly expressive gestural movements that vividly illustrated aspects of the theory of movement as postulated by Laban (1963) and Laban and Lawrence (1974); and increased vocal utterances.","",""

A new stage of computing technology at the beginning of the 21st Century links the personal and the pervasive through mobile wearables. The convergence between the miniaturisation of microchips (nanotechnology), intelligent textile or interfacial materials production, advances in biotechnology and the growth of wireless, ubiquitous computing emphasises not only mobility but integration into clothing or the human body. In artistic contexts one expects such integrated wearable devices to have the two-way function of interface instruments (e.g. sensor data acquisition and exchange) worn for particular purposes, either for communication with the environment or various aesthetic and compositional expressions. ‘Wearable performance’ briefly surveys the context for wearables in the performance arts and distinguishes display and performative/interfacial garments. It then focuses on the authors' experiments with ‘design in motion’ and digital performance, examining prototyping at the DAP-Lab which involves transdisciplinary convergences between fashion and dance, interactive system architecture, electronic textiles, wearable technologies and digital animation. The concept of an ‘evolving’ garment design that is materialised (mobilised) in live performance between partners originates from DAP Lab's work with telepresence and distributed media addressing the ‘connective tissues’ and ‘wearabilities’ of projected bodies through a study of shared embodiment and perception/proprioception in the wearer (tactile sensory processing). Such notions of wearability are applied both to the immediate sensory processing on the performer's body and to the processing of the responsive, animate environment.","",""

"2009","Hyper-twist","In this paper, we introduce ‘hyper-twist’, a distortion technique for the production of abstract artistic forms (see Figure 1). It is developed via exploiting the theoretical feature of deforming an infinite space filled with a hyper-elastic media. Any object placed within this space can change its shape as a result of the distortion of the space. Based on this developed theoretic insight, we have produced a computer program where point sources are used to control the form and extent of distortion. These sources perform a similar function to forces exerting on a soft body. By qualifying them with a distortion tensor, they define the patterns of the resultant distortions. Linking this representation with time, temporal effects can be produced. Our work, incorporating physics into a digital creation, presents a new form of algorithmic art.","",""

ISBN 978-0816634026","Before considering the arguments of this intriguing and ambitious volume, some background history is in order. Baroque is a historical term used to describe the art of the seventeenth century. Art at that time was not called Baroque. Baroque art, however, has a connection to the Catholic Church and is usually traced back to the Council of Trent, where, between 1545 and 1563, a doctrine on sacred images was developed (Council of Trent 1848). Part of the doctrine that developed in these meetings had a significant impact on art and music. It is usually remarked that the Trent decrees served as a propagandistic mechanism created by the church for the control of religious images, and hence the control of subjects. At the dawn of the printmaking era, the church wanted restrictions on the use of holy images and the representation of sacred figures in popular media. Paintings, prints, relics, and other art works were valued as objects containing information and identified for instruction and the “habit of remembering” (ibid.). In a time of low literacy, the Catholic Church understood the power of image-based media to a largely illiterate population. The church also understood how images function in signification as referents to prototypes and that control over visual signs was critical to centralizing power and discouraging paganism, the worship of idols, or other beliefs that would undermine the church’s authority. The decrees stated:","",""
"2010","Becoming materials: material forms and forms of practice","As a result of development toward ‘smart’ materials, materials now enable an expanding range of aesthetic expressions and user experiences. These materials are fundamentally temporal in their capacity to assume multiple, discrete states of expression that can be repeatedly and minutely controlled. These materials come to be, or become, only over time and in context—they are becoming materials. Thus, in the development and application of such materials, we must engage more extensively with the experience of materials in practices of design and of use. This paper introduces and discusses the concept of becoming materials—as well as the implications for practice—through a series of examples from our own practice-led research within art, design and architecture. Coming to terms with the implications for material practices of design and of use, we suggest, requires the development of new concepts and methods for doing and studying the design of becoming materials.","",""
"2010","The art of interaction","Interactive art has become much more common as a result of the many ways in which the computer and the Internet have facilitated it. Issues relating to human–computer interaction (HCI) are as important to interactive art making as issues relating to the colours of paint are to painting. It is not that HCI and art necessarily share goals. It is just that much of the knowledge of HCI and its methods can contribute to interactive art making. This paper reviews recent work that looks at these issues in the art context. In interactive digital art, the artist is concerned with how the artwork behaves, how the audience interacts with it and, ultimately, in participant experience and their degree of engagement. The paper looks at these issues and brings together a collection of research results and art practice experiences that together help to illuminate this significant new and expanding area. In particular, it is suggested that this work points towards a much needed critical language that can be used to describe, compare and discuss interactive digital art.","",""

Our research is based on empirical findings arising from the use of Inspiration Card Workshops, which are collaborative design events in which domain and technology insight are combined to create design concepts. In addition to the systematically introduced sources of inspiration that form part of the workshop format, a number of spontaneous sources of inspiration emerged during these workshops.","",""

This trend has been labelled the ‘good enough’ revolution and has highlighted contemporary parameters for technological development. The present article presents this trend as a design movement that is characterised by introducing a new functionalism and challenging common perceptions that have emerged as a result of the twentieth-century design story about ‘high quality’ and ‘added value’ in product development. In addition, the article introduces the concept of aesthetics as the basis for a discussion about user experiences in contemporary digital artefacts, and argues that the good enough movement calls for a new understanding of aesthetics that springs from the role of digital artefacts in the user's social life and plays a role in relation to technologically oriented design development.","",""

What is rigorous and relevant interaction design research and how do we recognise and evaluate it? Most current attempts at dealing with these issues tend to be on loan from other disciplines, and may overlook, conceal, or knowingly exclude some of what makes interaction design research such a unique field. Our primary contribution is that what may be perceived as three different design research activities—design practice, design exploration and design studies—have their own purposes, intended outcomes, and internal logic. Each approach must be examined in its own right and the notions of rigour and relevance have to be based on a firm understanding of the particular purpose of each approach.","",""

Next, the paper draws upon critical concepts drawn from multimodal discourse analysis, media theory and sociology to analyse Brainstorm in terms of the interplay of software structure and design agency.

It is the ability of an artwork to respond to and ‘dialogue’ with its audience—to ‘look back’ and ‘talk back’—that is the key factor in making it an engaging and believable social partner.

Drawing on a social semiotics approach, contemporary choreographic research is studied where digital tools are used to generate, explicate and communicate interactive movement. I argue that by drawing on the particularities and potentials of the moving body as interface such as those explored through choreographic practice, we may avoid imitating existing exchanges with technology and create novel interactions.","",""

In order to develop an object-oriented exploration of these works, and our day-to-day interactions with technology in a broader sense, I explore digital interaction as a process that involves the transductive relationships set up between objects and the milieu in which these objects find themselves. Central to this argument is setting all objects, including human users, technology and artifacts, on the same ontological footing.","",""

In this article I examine three projects that utilise NURBS modelling as a means for which a musical system's inherent spatiality is visualised. There are numerous precedents for which architectural form is a derivation of a musical system, or a musical system is proportionally informed by architectonic gesture. I propose in this article three NURBS modelling methodologies: for the spatial analysis of Karlheinz Stockhausen's sound projection geometries in Pole für 2; for a spatial realisation of John Cage's indeterminate work Variations III; and for the generation of a surface manifold informed by musically derived soundscape data from the Japanese garden Kyu Furukawa Teien. Rather than seeking to translate music into inhabitable architecture, or architectonic form into music, I highlight an approach that produces an interstitial territory between discourses on architecture and music analysis.","",""
"2011","Note sequence morphing algorithms for performance of electronic dance music","This paper describes algorithms that can musically augment the realtime performance of electronic dance music by generating new musical material by morphing. Note sequence morphing involves the algorithmic generation of music that smoothly transitions between two existing musical segments. The potential of musical morphing in electronic dance music is outlined and previous research is summarised; including discussions of relevant music theoretic and algorithmic concepts. An outline and explanation is provided of a novel Markov morphing process that uses similarity measures to construct transition matrices. The paper reports on a ‘focus-concert’ study used to evaluate this morphing algorithm and to compare its output with performances from a professional DJ. Discussions of this trial include reflections on some of the aesthetic characteristics of note sequence morphing. The research suggests that the proposed morphing technique could be effectively used in some electronic dance music contexts.","",""
"2011","Art Space","HotPlate ‘HotPlate’ was an international exhibition of printmaking held in Brighton, UK, from 3 July to 15 August 2010, in digital and traditional media. This was a project that was initiated in 2009, during the VI Novosibirsk Graphic Art Biennial, which was held at the Novosibirsk State Art Museum. Novosibirsk, Russia. As the artistic curator of the project, I invited curators from nine countries, to select printed works from some of the most innovative contemporary printmakers in the field. HotPlate focused on installation and unframed work, seeking to position prints as objects and site-specific pieces, as well as wall-based works on paper. By approaching contemporary printmaking in the widest possible way, HotPlate sparked a lively conversation about process, technique and technology within a continuously evolving area of the visual arts. Here the emphasis was on testing the perceived boundaries of the medium, breaking out of the literal and metaphorical ‘frame’ and exploring new formats which actively engage with the gallery space. It also opened up the possibilities for prints to move beyond the gallery walls and engage with modern street culture. Drawing upon a broad cultural and geographical demographic, the exhibition brought together a range of influences. The prints address a vast spectrum of conceptual, figurative and illustrative themes, touching upon current events and politics, contemporary urban landscapes, portraiture, interior worlds and abstraction. The pieces range from traditional etching, lithography, relief and screen-printing to more contemporary digital imaging, and are printed onto a variety of substrates, including cloth, synthetic paper, metal and plasterboard. Some prints appear as light projections and others arise out of experiments with heat-sensitive inks, vegetable juices and bacteria. An artist’s book, surrounded by veils of printed fabric, and relief prints on three-dimensional forms move the medium into the physical space of the viewer. HotPlate is a unique project offering visitors the opportunity to experience the vibrant and continually evolving world of contemporary printmaking first hand. The printmakers that have been selected to be included in this art space have all used computer technology to engage with their artistic process. http://www.phoenixarts.org/site-archive/123international-printmaking.html Koichi Kiyono, (Japan)—‘Cultivation’ Digital Creativity 2011, Vol. 22, No. 2, pp. 115–126","",""

We somewhat agree, arguing that 3D printing holds great socioeconomic implications, but also that more sustained attention should be paid to the ways in which 3D printing is entering into our creative environments. Our focus in this article is on the use of rapid prototyping by creatives such as architects, designers, and DIY advocates, since it is within these contexts where the popular themes of 3D printing are currently most concrete. To this end, in section one we provide some background for desktop digital fabrication, contextualizing 3D printing within industrial processes and Maker subcultures. In section two, we summarize our environmental scan of relevant popular and academic literature, using this to identify key trends in this area. We supplement this discussion in section three using our analysis of a ‘critical making’ session that took participants through a process of designing and printing simple objects as well as follow–up interviews with these participants. In the concluding section, we target four areas in need of future research.","",""
"2012","Artful surfaces: an ethnographic study exploring the use of space in design studios","A largely overlooked aspect of creative design practices is how physical space in design studios plays a role in supporting designers' everyday work. In particular, studio surfaces such as designers' desks, office walls, notice boards, clipboards and drawing boards are full of informative, inspirational and creative artefacts such as, sketches, drawings, posters, story-boards and Post-it notes. Studio surfaces are not just the carriers of information but importantly they are sites of methodic design practices, i.e. they indicate, to an extent, how design is being carried out. This article describes the results of an ethnographic study on the use of workplace surfaces in design studios, from two academic design departments. Using the field study results, the article introduces an idea of ‘artful surfaces’. Artful surfaces emphasise how artfully designers integrate these surfaces into their everyday work and how the organisation of these surfaces comes about helping designers in accomplishing their creative and innovative design practices. Using examples from the field study, the article shows that artful surfaces have both functional and inspirational characteristics. From the field study, three types of artful surfaces are identified: personal; shared; and project-specific. The article suggests that a greater insight into how these artful surfaces are created and used could lead to better design of novel display technologies to support designers' everyday work.","",""

Accordingly, it is very important to study the immersion that encourages the participation of the audience. In this paper, we analyse the expressive characteristics of material-focused Modernist paintings as immersive elements for which the characteristics of the material itself are highlighted. This includes how behavioural elements are introduced to paintings, how such a seemingly consequential abstract visual exists in the context of Formalism, and how these characteristics are shown in the combined action of physical phenomena of nature. That is, the expressive characteristics that occur as the result of interaction between behaviour of artist, gravity and materials are analysed as the sense of presence, the facilitation of immediate feedback, and the immersive elements of visual beauty. Accordingly, it is suggested this type of analysis can be utilized in interactive art.","",""

Given a sufficiently refined interface, the users will likely increase their trust in the people responsible (p. 17); trusting users may be more willing to persevere when something has gone wrong (p. 18).

This paper reports on the role of a digital music jamming tool in providing access to creative practice by people with intellectual disabilities. The tool contributed to the development of a spatio-temporal zone to enable aesthetic agency within and beyond the contexts of deinstitutionalized care. The research identifies the interactions between tools, individuals and groups that facilitated participants’ agency in shaping the form of musical practice. Furthermore, we document the properties of emergent interaction − supported by a tool oriented to enabling music improvisation − as potentially resisting assumptions regarding normalization. ","",""

However, prior knowledge of GUI design often leads the students to create cliché and impractical designs for gestural interaction. To solve the problem, our study aims to explore feedback as an alternative education method, enhanced by an exercise we call ‘gestural shadow mapping’, which is based on the art of mime, within the concept of creative drama. Using a basic setup for shadow representation, a group of design students practised expressing prepared visual compositions as gestural shadow maps for an audience of their peers. After several observations, feedback showed that the method based on gestural shadow mapping does afford students a better understanding of gestural interaction, free from the inhibitions of their prior experiences of GUIs and the limitations of current commercial examples.","",""
"2013","Understanding performative behaviour within content-rich Digital Live Art","Abstract Research into human–computer interaction (HCI) has traditionally been concerned with users' abilities to complete tasks at desk-bound computers. However, recent research into Digital Live Art (Sheridan 2006) and audiences' engagement with interactive art focuses on ‘non task-based uses of computing’ (Sheridan, Bryan-Kinns, and Bayliss 2007, 13), such as the user experience. As computing becomes more mobile, wireless and tangible, there is a shift to understand the needs of ‘users as performers’ (ibid.). As a result, research has begun to draw on the methods and theories in the performing arts to better understand these needs. However, much of this research into interactive art focuses on playful or physical experiences of users, and fails to address work with social content and themes to be communicated. This is a critical analysis of Sheridan's framework for understanding performative behaviour with technologically mediated interactive art (Sheridan 2006; Sheridan, Bryan-Kinns, and Bayliss 2007). By applying the framework to works with rich thematic content, our findings indicate that the framework needs refining in order to better understand the ways in which users engage with interactive artworks of this kind.","",""
"2013","Performance art and digital media","Interaction depends on some form of activity and it is important to realise that the procedural power is not limited to the computational side in this activity. It is shared between human and bit machine. That is why interactive text has been described as the result of the continuous operation of a ‘textual machine’ which depends on the engagement of both (Aarseth 1997). We can look at the pre-conditions for these processes—the design for a digital piece or its interface; we can look at the effects—the emergence of social networks and digital products; but at the heart of the matter remains the activity itself. This dependency on the process formed the initial motivation for this collection. Much like interaction, performance is about doing. Performing cannot be reduced to an artistic interpretation of a given text but it has constitutive powers. We can study the pre-conditions—the structure of an underlying dramatic text like a play or an event score; we can look at the effects—the historical frame, response and social impact; but at the heart of the matter remains the activity itself. This core parallel was part of the formation of this special issue of Digital Creativity on performance art and digital media. But from this shared core, the themes rapidly fanned out into related but distinct questions from the role of the body in the activity to that of the technological counterpart. Thankfully, these debates can connect to respected scholars with established work in the field. This collection aims to support already existing work such as Dixon (2007), Benford and Giannachi (2011), or Jacucci (2004), but it uses the format of the journal to allow a more open assembly and meeting place for differing perspectives. While Dixon provides a much needed historical view and Benford and Giannachi and Jacucci offer more HCI-based positions, the contributions in this collection enter the discussion from multiple directions while standing next to each other. Their respective domains include performance studies, video games, HCI and digital arts, among others. Such a wide net of disciplines poses a challenge. If performance studies is already defying disciplinary boundaries and interaction design reaches the last corners of human activity in ubiquitous computing, then an interrogation of one through the other is bound to be messy. And, indeed, the contributions collected here overlap, and at times conflict with each other. But it never was the intention to solve this conundrum or to provide a single theory. It would be a disservice to both disciplines to attempt such a unified theory across so many domains. It might be precisely because of the diversity of the connections that performance is ‘trending’ in interaction. Notable work has been done in related fields such as theatre and interaction design (Laurel 1991) that investigated structural connections between the performing arts and the computational ones, but both fields have evolved over the past decades and have grown more complex.

How is the fictional character of such work conceptualised and produced? What kinds of speculation are involved? The article considers the value of one particular approach and argues that speculative design serves two distinct purposes: first, to enable us to think about the future; second, to critique current practice. Methods are described through case studies, either of the author's own projects or projects completed by graduates of the design interactions course at the Royal College of Art. A key concept is the ‘perceptual bridge’—the means by which designs engage their audience. The article argues that a vital factor in the success of a Speculative Design proposal is the careful management of the speculation, specifically what informs the use of technology, aesthetics, behaviour, interaction and function of the designed artefact.","",""

We then single out one of these strands, digitally augmented autobiographical performance, for further examination. Digitally augmented autobiographical performance draws on both autobiographical performance, which we see as rooted in performance and performance art, and media sharing, a field of research within HCI. Drawing on our experiences of designing a digital system for autobiographical performance, we offer a series of proposals for HCI research and applications of performative experience design.","",""

The second study encouraged participants to reflect on their habits and rituals and to view these through fresh eyes.

We compare five brainstorming modalities: traditional brainstorming—graphical interaction, reverse brainstorming, brainwriting and brainsketching—adopted by six delocalised teams working through a cloud computing environment. We analyse: co-authoring production; the ratio of ideas production according to task-goal; and the variation of brainstorming modalities. Our results show that designers work on brainstorming modalities according to the task-goal assigned, and we see that task content and the verbal and graphical communicative modes are supported by the proposed computational environment; as well as all brainstorming modalities. Because co-authoring or collective sketching are hardly possible without verbal communication support in graphical production, we propose the use of these new cloud computing functionalities to enhance the distributed design work.","",""

To gain insight into this phenomenon, we propose the concept ‘decisive constraints’ based on a review of current, but dispersed, studies into creativity constraints. We build decisive constraints on two definitional conditions related to radical decision-making and creative turning points. To test our concept analytically and ensure its relevance to creative practice, we apply the two definitional conditions to three media façade installation projects in which our interaction design research lab has been involved. In accord with insights from these case analyses, we argue that decisive constraints may inform current research into design processes and act as a creative resource for practitioners, not only in interaction design but, we assume, also across related creative domains and disciplines.","",""

This area of research is positioned at the intersection of sound and music computing, auditory displays and interaction design. The key issue the designer is asked to tackle is to create meaningful sound for objects and interactions that are often new. To date, there are no set design methodologies, but a variety of approaches available to the designer. Knowledge and understanding of how humans listen and interpret sound is the first step toward being able to create such sounds. This article discusses two original approaches that borrow techniques from film sound and theatre. Cinematic sound highlights how our interpretation of sound depends on listening modes and context, while theatre settings allow us to explore sonic interactions from the different perspectives of the interacting subject, the observer and the designer.","",""
"2014","An analytical framework for facilitating interactivity between participants and interactive artwork: case studies in MRT stations","This article presents a heuristic approach for analysing computer-based interactive art by the extent to which it produces an interaction, and by whether participants are able to gain a meaningful experience from the interaction. Interactive installations responding to participants' physical input have been increasingly displayed in public spaces outside conventional art domains. Nevertheless, people in such public spaces are often unaccustomed to engaging with art intellectually. Thus, although the interactive artwork with responsive multimedia effects are, to some extent, more capable of prompting physical engagements, it is not always clear whether participants are able to develop meaningful experiences from such interactive encounters. Here, an analytical framework for reviewing such experiences has been developed from examinations of interactive experiences on site, along with interviews with advisors, professionals in the field and the originating artists. Examples of the frameworks' application to three interactive artworks are demonstrated in this article.","",""
"2014","Snapshots of complexity: using motion capture and principal component analysis to reconceptualise dance","This article brings together the disparate worlds of dance practice, motion capture and statistical analysis. Digital technologies such as motion capture offer dance artists new processes for recording and studying dance movement. Statistical analysis of these data can reveal hidden patterns in movement in ways that are semantically ‘blind’, and are hence able to challenge accepted culturo-physical ‘grammars’ of dance creation. The potential benefit to dance artists is to open up new ways of understanding choreographic movement. However, quantitative analysis does not allow for the uncertainty inherent in emergent, artistic practices such as dance. This article uses motion capture and principal component analysis (PCA), a common statistical technique in human movement recognition studies, to examine contemporary dance movement, and explores how this analysis might be interpreted in an artistic context to generate a new way of looking at the nature and role of movement patterning in dance creation.","",""

Most projection mapping experiences and events are non-interactive, partly because of the many inherent design problems in designing for interaction is such situations. This article explores one approach to this tricky issue by analysing a group of four interactive mixed reality experiences that combine projection mapping with camera-based interaction techniques. The approaches used are described, and their deployment in a variety of situations is analysed using engagement and play theories. The works suggest that some projection mapping techniques can be used in the service of creating engaging interactive exhibits and installations, but that the effectiveness of the approach relies on it placing the experience and interactions clearly in our own physical world, rather than behind a screen or in an artificial image space.","",""
"2015","From Her (2013) To Viv The Global Brain","Abstract                 This paper reflects upon the methodological questions entailed by what digital media materiality could be, and how one could analytically approach it via theories of experience such as radical empiricism and process philosophy. I argue that for digital media, becoming material means to ‘enter into experience’. However, this notion of ‘experience’ is not defined in relation to the phenomenological, distinctly-human subject. I offer instead an expanded notion of experience that resides in non-human objects, networks and other physical entities like mobile phones and computers. Operating system (OS) and intelligent assistants such as Samantha in Spike Jonze’s Her (2013) and the next-generation Siri in development, Viv the Global Brain, can be seen as representations of what such a non-human experience could be like, as digital objects communicate with one another. William James, father of radical empiricism, argues that the definition of matter as something that lies behind physical phenomena is merely a postulate of thought. In his philosophy, the world is made up of only one primal material - that of experience. While James could not have anticipated our era of digital technologies at the time of writing in 1890, radical empiricism offers an interesting angle in approaching what digital materiality could be. Mark Hansen’s latest monograph, Feed Forward: On the Future of Twenty-First-Century Media (2015), turns to Alfred North Whitehead in an attempt to understand how 21st-century media operations feature in a world of objects where humans are implicated in, but not central to digital networks. Referring to Whitehead, he analyses how media operations (like those superalgorithms computing in OS systems) reconfigure the notion of perception in experience. In a similar theoretical move, I turn to William James’s radical empiricism to analyse how the digital may be material/ised in a world of beyond-human experience.","",""
"2015","Signs O’ The Times","Abstract                This paper addresses the question of software preservation by approaching this field from a philologic perspective. Philology here is not understood as hermeneutic operation of interpretation, but rather as practice of preserving material objects: critically providing them as basis for future investigation. Software’s status as a material object could not be more uncertain, since it merges - as a source code - a textual dimension and - as a programme - a processual dimension. It is only within the logic of this operativity that software as an object of digital materiality becomes fully conceivable. Since a philology of software would have to consider the phenomenon’s dual mode of existence as static text and/or time-critical process to enable research within both dimensions, old questions about what to preserve and how to preserve it rise anew. The paper will therefore take up a few basic notions of traditional scholarly editing, the software of philology. It explores to what extent they can be applied to objects of digital materiality in order to outline an initial idea of a philology of software.","",""

This article investigates the effects of location-based setups on collaborative writing in the context of information seeking. These investigations are done using a laboratory study and an experimental system for collaboratively seeking and synthesizing information. A total of 30 pairs (60 subjects) were randomly assigned to one of the three experimental conditions: (1) on a single shared workstation; (2) in the same room with individual computers; and, (3) remotely located with text chat. By analyzing the way the collaborative pairs constructed their reports, it was found that those remotely located spent less effort per edit than those in the same room. Separate location discouraged social interactions and boosted the writing efficiency. These differences in various measures across different configurations, as discovered through exploratory analysis — both qualitative and quantitative — provide useful guidelines for developing collaborative systems, specifically presenting trade-offs among communication efforts, social interactions, and productivity. The work reported in this paper is a first known attempt to investigate impacts of spatial configuration on collaborative writing in the context of information seeking. In doing so, it brings together, and benefits to, scholarly inquiries from computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) and library and information science (LIS) fields.","",""

As new cost-effective digital recording technologies are introduced to the marketplace, this becomes a salient issue to understand for producers and production teams. In order to define cameras’ image quality capacities, three almost identical short fiction film sequences were tested on a young audience in a comparative blind test. Surprisingly, the result unambiguously showed that most viewers preferred the film recorded on an iPhone. Based on Barbara Maria Stafford's theoretical framework on the cognitive work of images and theories that concern ecological moving image theory, the analysis of this article aims to explain the reception study's result by illuminating the sublime and ambiguous figure–ground constellation of the iPhone video and its cognitive ramifications.","",""

The introduction of code-based design practices in the design studio has altered this balance, introducing new models of joint authorship and new ways for individuals to contribute to co-authored projects. This paper presents a case study describing four design studios in a higher education setting that used code as a tool for generating architectural geometry. The format of the studios encouraged the students to reflect critically on their role as authors and to creatively address the multiple opportunities for shared authorship available with code-based production. The research question addressed in this study involved the role of code-based practices in altering the model of architectural education in the design studio, in particular the role of visual representations of a code-based design process in the production of shared knowledge.","",""

The approaches to two compositions that combine instruments with live electronics and pre-composed soundscapes – Cold Wood (bass trombone) and Arcando (alto saxophone) – are considered. These pieces create unique live performance scenarios in order to investigate how acoustic instruments might be positioned within, and reframed by, soundscape composition practice. Potential pitfalls inherent in mixed media works are explored, proposing technological solutions through sound processing and use of microphones, whilst ensuring that 'liveness' remains more aesthetic than procedural. Aspects of field recording practice influence the behaviour of the instruments, and improvisation is encouraged in both pieces to ensure unpredictability. Consequently, it is also proposed that the process of listening to, capturing, and processing the sound of the instrument in a live performance scenario is analogous to the practice of field recording, in which there is little control over the sound events.","",""
"2015","MR<sup>x</sup>and the aesthetics of locative writing","Abstract From a media studies perspective MRx is a form of writing, and specifically a form of inscription, a writing in space or on places. A key quality that distinguishes MRx from MR is an attention to the aesthetics of the experience. To examine the aesthetic dimension of writing is to ask: what it “feels like” to read and write according to an accepted set of practices. MR applications are tactile and proprioceptive, and MRx experiences further explore and make us aware of this multi-sensory engagement. MRx experiences are in this sense polyaesthetic, and as such they exhibit the qualities: seriality, weakened narrative and altered trace. The polyaesthetics of MRx experiences is explored in a series of example of digital art and public display, such as Blast Theory's Rider Spoke and the projection on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris to mark the finish of the 2013 Tour de France.","",""

In this paper, we specifically focus on technical and design issues related to large-scale participatory performances, exploring (a) what technical designs provide robust support; (b) what interfaces and mappings can be effective and (c) what strategies can effectively focus and guide participation. We first briefly address previous work in audience participation in live performance, then describe massMobile's system design and implementation with a focus on new functionality to support robust use at scale. Finally, we discuss two sets of events using massMobile in large-scale performance contexts: with an athletic band at sporting events and with a jazz combo in traditional concert venues.","",""

It will explain how this system enables videos to be different every time they are accessed, thus providing users with an enhanced viewing experience and creators with a new tool for video composition. As the advancement of online technology influences habits of media consumers, user uptake of new technologies suggests that a transition away from video's prevalent mode of presentation, as a linear sequence of shots, is entirely possible. Factors such as viewer engagement and usability drive the need for ongoing exploration in the use of video for entertainment, information and advertisement. The production of a music video with generative methods is described in this article as a semi-automated process. Human tasks are not replaced by computational execution, but are shifted to become increasingly conceptual.","",""

But what vision of social interaction is sought and advanced through Mixed Reality environments? In this paper, I identify two dominant ways that social interaction is envisioned in MRx designs, broadly construed as material and political, and illustrated through a series of examples. I further draw on them to highlight the potentials, boundaries, and limitations of each with regards to the kinds of social interactions that are sought and cultivated through the integration of digital media on physical space. I suggest that as MR becomes mainstream, it is important to go beyond these visions to consider whether and how MRx environments might connect with the economic, social, and cultural specificity of local sites to meaningfully serve the always evolving social needs and purposes of their communities.","",""
"2015","Ambient interaction and situational influence: case studies in public sites","Abstract An audience's direct physical intervention is widely believed to be instrumental in the field of interactive art. However, this long established expectation faces new challenges through the increasing accessibility of a growing diversity of interactive technologies and ubiquitous smart media. Such innovations are often fully integrated components of interactive public artworks, many of which do not directly involve audiences or individuals as key agents in the functional or aesthetic realisation of the work. Based on three case studies of interactive artworks in public places, this article identifies an important characteristic of interactivity in interactive art, through the largely unexplored concept of “Ambient Interaction” in which artworks are embodied and enacted through environmental conditions and situational influences rather than exclusively through people's intentional and direct physical engagement.","",""

"2016","Musical Bodies: Corporeality, Emergent Subjectivity, and Improvisational Spaces","IntroductionInteractive improvisational musical spaces (which is to say, nearly all musical spaces) involve affective relations among bodies: between the bodies of human performers, between performers and active listeners, between the sonic """"bodies"""" that comprise the multiple overlapping events that constitute a musical performance’s unfolding. Music scholarship tends to focus on either music’s sonic materialities (the sensible; what can be heard) or the cultural resonances that locate in and through music (the political or hermeneutic; how meaning is inscribed in and for a listening subject).An embodied turn, however, has recently been manifesting, bringing music scholarship into communication with feminist theory, queer theory, and approaches that foreground subjectivity and embodiment. Exemplary in this area are works by Naomi Cumming (who asks a critical question, “does the self form the sound, or the sound the self?;” Cumming 7), Suzanne Cusick, Marion Guck, Fred Maus, and Susan McClary. All of these scholars, in various ways, thematise the performative—what it feels like to make or experience music, and what effect that making or experiencing has on subject-formation.All of these authors strive to foreground the role of the performer and performativity in the context of the extended Western art music tradition. While each makes persuasive, significant points, my contention in this paper is that improvised music is a more fruitful starting place for thinking about embodiment and the co-constitutive relationship between performer and sound. That is, while (nearly) all music is improvised to a greater or lesser degree, the more radical contexts, in which paths are being selected and large-scale shapes drawn in the “heat of the moment,” can bring these issues into stark relief and serve as more productive entry points for thinking through crucial questions of embodiment, perspective, identity, and emergent meaning.Music-Improvisational ContextsA musical improvisational space is a “context,” in Lawrence Grossberg’s sense of the term (26), where acts of territorialisation unfold an ongoing process of meaning-constitution. Territorialisation refers to an always-ongoing process of mapping out a space within which subjects and objects are constituted (Deleuze and Guattari 314). I posit that musical acts of territorialising are performed by two kinds of bodies in mutually constitutive relationships: interacting corporeal performing bodies, with individual pasts, tendencies, wills, and affective attunements (Massumi, Semblance), and what I term musical-objects-as-bodies. This second category represents a way of considering music’s sonic materiality from an affective perspective—relational, internally differentiating, temporal. On the one hand musical-objects-as-bodies refer to the materiality of the now-ongoing music itself: from the speeds and slownesses of air molecules that are received by the ear and interpreted as sound in the brain, to notes and rhythms and musical gestures; to the various ways in which abstract forms are actively shaped by performers and interpreted by listeners, with their own individuated constellations of histories, tendencies, wants, attunements, and corporeal perspectives. On the other hand, musical-objects-as-bodies can refer to the histories, genres, dislocations, and nomadic movements that partially condition how sonic materialities are produced and perceived. These last two concepts should be read both in terms of how histories and genres become dislocated from themselves through the actions of practitioners, and as a priori principles—that is, not as aberrations that disrupt a norm, but as norms themselves.This involves two levels of abstraction: ascribing body-status to sound-complexes, and then doing the same for historical trajectories, cultural conditionings, and dislocations. Elizabeth Grosz asks us to theorise the body as “the threshold or borderline concept that hovers perilously and undecidably at the pivotal joint of binary pairs” (Grosz, Volatile 23); one such binary that is problematised is that of production and perception, which within the context of an improvising music ensemble are really two perspectives on the same phenomenon. The producers are also the perceivers, in other words. This is true of listeners too: acts of perception are themselves productive in the sense that they create contexts in which meanings emerge.In Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari’s language (46–54), an emerging context represents a plurality of milieux that are brought together in acts of territorialisation (and deterritorialisation; see below). The term “milieu” refers to the notion that acts of territorialisation always take place in the middle—they are always already bound up in ongoing processes of context-building. Nothing ever emerges from whole cloth; everything modifies by differential degree the contexts upon which it draws. In musical contexts, we might consider four types of milieux. External milieux are articulated by such factors as syntactic norms (what makes a piece of music sound like it belongs within a genre) and cultural conditionings. Internal milieux refer to what gives the elements of a piece of music a sense of belonging together, including formal designs, motivic structures, and melodic or harmonic singularities. An intermediary milieu involves the way gestures acquire sign-status in a context, thereby becoming meaningful. Annexed milieux are locations where new materials are absorbed and incorporated from without.Bodies ImprovisingA small example should put these points into focus. Four jazz musicians are on stage, performing a version of the well-known (in that community) song “Stella by Starlight.” External milieux here include the conventions of the genre: syntactic expectations, prescribed roles for different instruments, certain perspectives on historical performance practices. Internal milieux include the defining features of this song: its melody, harmonic progression, formal design. The performers’ affective attunements to the history of the song’s complex life so far form an intermediary milieu; note that that history is in a process of modification by the very act of the now-ongoing performance. Annexed milieux might include flights into the unexpected, fracturings of stylistic norms, or incorporations of other contexts into this one. The act of territorialisation is how these (and more) milieux are drawn together as forces in this performance, this time. Each performer is an agent, articulating sounds that represent the now-emerging object, this “Stella by Starlight.” Those articulated sounds, as musical-objects-as-bodies, conjoin with each other, and with performers, in ongoing processes of subject-formation.A double movement is at play in this characterisation. The first is strategic: thinking of musical forces as bodies in order to consider how relationships unfold between them in embodied terms—in terms of affect. But simultaneous with this is a reverse move that begins with affective forces and from there constructs those very bodies—human performing bodies as well as musical-objects-as-bodies. In other words, in order to draw lines between bodies that suggest contextual co-determinations where each exists in a continual process of engendering the other, we can turn to a consideration of the encounters between, and impingements of, affective forces through which bodies are constructed and actions are mobilised. This double movement is a paradox that requires three presuppositions. First, that bodies are indeed constituted through encounters of affective forces—this is Deleuze’s Spinozist claim (Deleuze, Spinoza 49–50). Second, that identity is performative within the context of a discourse. This is Judith Butler’s position, which I modify slightly to consider the potential of non- (or pre-) linguistic discourse, such as what can stem from drastic (active, experiential) music-syntactic spaces (Abbate). And third, that concepts like agency and passivity involve force-relations between human actors (with embodied perspectives, agencies, histories, tendencies, and diverse ranges of affective attunements), and the musical utterances expressed by and between them. Therefore, there is value in considering both actor and utterance as unfolding along the same plane, each participating in the other’s constitution.What is at stake when we conceive of sonic materiality in bodily terms in this way? The sounds produced in interactive music-improvisational settings are products of human agency. But there is a passive element to human musical-sound production. There is a degree of passivity that owes to learned behaviors, habits, and the singularities of one’s own history—this is the passive nature of Deleuze’s first synthesis of time (Deleuze, Difference 71–79), where past experiences and activities are drawn into a now-present action, partially conditioning it. Even overtly active selection in the living present is founded on this passivity, since one can only draw upon one’s own history and experience, which provides a limiting force on technique, which in turn directs expressive possibilities. In music-improvisation pedagogy, this might be phrased as “you can only play what you can hear.” Another way to say this is that passive synthesis conditions active selection.One way to overcome the foreclosure of possibility that necessarily falls out of passive synthesis is through interaction and engagement with the affective forces at play in interactive encounters. Through encounters, conditions for new possibilities emerge. The limiting concept “you can only play what you hear” is mitigated by an encounter with newly received stimuli: a heard gesture that invites further excavation of a motivic idea or that sparks a “line of flight” into a thus-far unthought-of next action. The way a newly received stimulus inspires new action is an affective encounter, and it re-conditions—it deterritorialises—the ongoing process of subject-formation. The encounter is a direct line drawn between the two types of bodies—that is, between the situated body of a producing and perceiving subject and the sonic materiality of a musical-object-as-body. While there are other kinds of encounters that unfold in the course of interactive musical performance (visual cues, for example, or tactile nearnesses), the events of heard sounds are the primary locations where bodies are constituted or subjects are formed. This is made transparent in a recent study by Schober and Spiro, where jazz musicians improvised together with no visual or tactile connection, relying solely on sound for their points of interactive contact. This suggested that jazz musicians are able to communicate effectively with only sonic data exchanged. That many improvisers play with their eyes closed, or with their backs to one another, only reinforces this.There are three aspects of sound that I wish to offer as support for a reading of musical objects as bodies. First is that sounds are temporally articulated and perceived. The materiality of sound is bound up with its temporality in ways that are more directly perceivable than many other worldly materialities. The obviousness of its temporally bound nature is one reason that music is used so often as an entry point for thinking through the ontological nature of time and process; viz. Husserl’s utilisation of musical melodies to explicate his phenomenology of internal time-consciousness, and Deleuze and Guattari’s location of acts of territorialisation in the (musical) refrain. Of course the distinction between sonic and other materialities is only a matter of degree: all matter, including bodies, is “continually subjected to transformation, to becoming, to unfolding over time” (Grosz, Time 79), but music foregrounds temporality in ways that many philosophers have found vivid and constructive.Second, musical sounds acquire meaning through their relationships with other sounds in contexts, both in the immediate context of the now-ongoing performance and in extended contexts of genre, syntax, and so on. Those relationships are with histories of past sounds, now-ongoing sounds, and future sounds expressed as results of accumulations of meaning-complexes. A gesture is played, and it acquires meaning through the ways it is “picked up” by differently attuned performers and listeners.In this sense, third, the line is blurred between action and agent; the distinction between the gesture and the execution of the gesture is effectively erased. From the performer’s perspective, how a gesture is “picked up” is made somewhat evident by the sonic materiality of the next gesture. This next gesture is a sign that represents the singularity of the performer’s affective attunement, or an expression of a stage (or, better, some now-ongoing aspect) of what Whitehead would call her “eventful” subjectivity (166–167). What is expressed is the way the performer is (actively or passively) attuning to the constellations of meanings that resonate in the event of the encounter with the musical-object-as-body, as that musical-object-as-body in turn expresses the history of past encounters that (actively or passively) engendered it. The present action as most-contracted expression of the past is Deleuze’s second synthesis of time, while the eventful way an action cuts into the future marks the time of his third synthesis (Deleuze, Difference 80–91).What is at stake in a turn to corporeality in music analysis? Nietzsche admonishes us to turn from the “facts” that the senses take in, process, and evaluate and re-begin our inquiry by questioning the body (272). This means, for music analysis, turning away from certain quantifiable aspects of sonic materiality (pitches, chords, rhythms, formal designs), towards the ways in which sounds are articulated by bodies in interactive contexts. This has been attempted from various perspectives in recent music scholarship, but again the reading of musical bodies I am pursuing foregrounds affective forces, eventful subject-formation, and performativity as identity, on the ground of improvised interaction. Improvising bodies engage in spaces where “all kinds of affects play their game” (Nietzsche 264), and they exist in constant states of change as they are impinged on by events (and as they impinge on events), those events also forming conduits to other bodies. Subjects are not just impinged on by events; they are events, processes, accumulations, and distributions of affective forces. As Grosz puts it, “the body codes the meanings projected onto it” (Volatile 18). In musical improvisation, performers are always in the process of becoming a subject, conditioned by the ways in which they are impinged upon by affective forces and the creative ways those impingements are taken up.Musical-objects-as-bodies, likewise, unfold as ongoing processes, their identity emerging through accumulations and distributions of relationships with other musical-objects-as-bodies. A musical gesture acquires meaning through the emerging context in which it participates, just as a performer acquires a sense of identity through acts of production and perception in, and that help create, a context. Moreover, an affective consideration of performer (as corporeal body) and musical gesture (as sonic utterance) involves “the torsion of one into the other, the passage, vector, or uncontrollable drift of the inside into the outside and the outside into the inside” (Grosz, Volatile xii). Grosz is describing the essential irreducibility of body and mind, but her language is compelling for thinking through the relationships between bodies and musical-objects-as-bodies as an ongoing co-constitutive, boundary-dissolving process.Bodies and/as AffectAffect begins in the in-between, in the productive space of the event in which bodies encounter one another. This is not, however, a pure in-between. Bodies are constructed by the ways in which affective forces impinge on them, but affective forces also stem from bodies. Bodies affect and are affected by one another, as Deleuze is fond of repeating (Spinoza 49). No affect, no bodies, but also no bodies, no affect. What does this mean? The in-between does not subvert corporeality, perspective, intention, or subjectivity, nor is there a hierarchical relation between them (that is, bodies do not emerge because of affective relations, nor the reverse). If we think of bodies as emergent subjectivities—as processes of subject-formation irreducibly connected to the ecological conditions in which they are acting—then the ways in which their identities come to be constructed are intricately connected to the performative utterances they are making and the variable ways they are taking up those utterances and folding them into their emergent processes of becoming. Here, the utterer–utterance distinction begins to break down. Judith Butler (24-25) argues that the ways in which bodies are defined emerge from performative acts, and that every such act constitutes a political action that contributes to the constitution of identity. As Butler writes, “that the gendered body is performative suggests that it has no ontological status apart from the various acts which constitute its reality” (136). Gender is a status that emerges through one’s actions in contexts—we perform gender, and by performing it we undergo a process of inscribing it on ourselves. This is one of many key points where music scholarship can learn from feminist theory. Like gender, musical identity is performed—we inscribe upon ourselves an emergent musical subjectivity through acts of performance and perception (which is itself a performance too, as an interaction with a musical-object-as-body).Performative acts, therefore, are not simply enacted by bodies; if identity is performed, then the acts themselves are what define the very bodies performing them. Again, the hierarchy breaks down: rather than beginning with a body (a subject) that acts, actions comprise what a body is, as an emergent subject, as the product of its actions. For Deleuze and Guattari, performed acts involve masks; masks do not disguise expression or identity but rather are expressions through which identity is drawn. “The mask does not hide the face, it is the face” (115); “the mask assures the […] construction of the face, the facialization of the head and the body: the mask is now the face itself, the abstraction or operation of the face. […] Never does the face assume a prior signifier or subject” (Deleuze and Guattari 181). In Butler’s terms, the performance does not presuppose the performer; the performer is the performance.Affect corresponds, then, not only to the pre-linguistic (Deleuze’s “dark precursor;” Difference 119–121) but also to the super-discursive: to the multiple embedded meaning-trajectories implicit in any discursive utterance; to the creative ways in which those meaning-trajectories can be taken up variably within the performance space; to the micro-political implications of both utterance and taking-up. Bergson writes: “[m]y body is […] in the aggregate of the material world […] receiving and giving back movement, with, perhaps, this difference only, that my body appears to choose, within certain limits, the manner in which it shall restore what it receives” (Bergson 4–5; also cited in Grosz, The Nick 165). This is exactly Grossberg’s “context,” by the way. The “manner in which it shall restore what it receives” refers, in the case of musically performing (corporeal) bodies, to how a gesture is taken up in a next performed action. In the case of musical-objects-as-bodies, conversely, it refers to how a next gesture contributes to the ongoing sense of meaning-accumulation in response to the ongoing flux of musical-objects-as-bodies within which it locates.In music-improvisational spaces, not only does the utterer–utterance, agent–action, or performer–­performed gesture distinction break down, but the distinction between performed and received gesture likewise blurs, in two senses: because of the nature of eventful subject-formation (whereby a musical gesture’s meaning is being drawn within its emergent context), and because the events of individual musical gestures are subsumed into larger composite events. This problematises the utterer-utterance breakdown by blurring the threshold between individual performed events, inviting a consideration of a paradoxical, but productive, excluded middle where musical-objects-as-bodies are both expressions of corporeal performative acts (engendering contextual subject-formations) and constituent elements of an emergent musical subjectivity (“the performance.” See Massumi (Parables) for more on productive engagements with the excluded middle). While beyond the scope of this paper, we might consider the radical co-constitution of different kinds of bodies in this way as a system, following Gregory Seigworth’s description: “the transitive effect undergone by a body (human or otherwise) in a system—a mobile and open system—composed of the various, innumerable forces of existing and the relations between those forces” (161).Performing Bodies and the Emergent WorkThis, ultimately, is my thesis: how to think about musical performance beginning with performing bodies rather than with a reified notion of musical materiality. Performing bodies are situated within the emerging context of improvised, interactive music-making. Musical utterances are enacted by those bodies, which are also taking up the utterances made by other bodies—as musical-objects-as-bodies. The context that is being built through this process of affective exchange is the performance (the this performance, this time of the jazz example above). Christopher Hasty writes,to perform, from per-formare is to really, actually (fully) form or shape. The ‘-ance’ of performance connotes action and process. The thing performed apart from or outside the forming is problematic. Is it a fixed, ideal form above or beyond (transcending), or beneath or behind (founding) the actual doing, a thing that can be known quite apart from the situated knowing itself? (200)The work–performance dichotomy that animates Hasty’s question (as well as those of Abbate, Goehr, and others) is not my question, since I suggest that using improvised music as an entry point into musical inquiry makes a turn to performance axiomatic. The improvised work is necessarily an active, emergent process, its particularities, boundaries, and meanings being drawn through its performed actions. Perhaps the question that underlies my query is, instead, how do we think about the processes of subject-formation that unfold through interactive music-making; how are performing and performed bodies being inscribed through what kinds of relationships with musical materialities?Is there, in the end, simply a musical body that subsumes both utterer and utterance, both subjectively-forming body and material sonic gesture? I do not wish to go quite that far, but I do wish to continue to problematise where one body stops and the next begins. To paraphrase one of themes of this special issue, where do the boundaries, thresholds, and intersections of musical bodies lie? Deleuze, following Spinoza, tells us frequently that we do not yet know what a body is capable of. This must be at least in part because we know not what a body is at any given point—the body, like the subject which we might now think of as no more than a sign, is in a process of becoming; there is no is (ontology), there is only and (conjunction). And there is no body, there are only bodies, for a body only exists in a complex and emergent ecological relationship with other bodies (see Grosz, Volatile 19). To conceive of porous thresholds between performing bodies and musical-objects-as-bodies is to foreground the performative aspects of improvised music-making and to break down the hierarchy, and possibly even the distinction, between agent, action, and the content of that action. Bodies of all types inscribe one another in ongoing acts of meaning-constitution: this is the properly drastic starting place for inquiry into the nature of musical process.ReferencesAbbate, Carolyn. “Music—Drastic or Gnostic?” Critical Inquiry 30.3 (2004): 505–536.Bergson, Henri.

"2016","The future of three-dimensional printing: Intellectual property or intellectual confinement?"," For the first 25 years, three-dimensional printing was the domain of industrial manufacturing and engineering. Through the open-source movement and peer production, this disruptive technology has become more widely available. This article considers how the future development and use of three-dimensional printing may be facilitated or inhibited through intellectual property law and practice. Using a combination of technical, legal, and policy analysis, we conclude that the potential for patent infringement is a primary issue in the continued development of three-dimensional printing technology. When it comes to the printed objects themselves, copyright issues will be the main focus of this debate. As these issues become more pervasive, some copyright holders will find technology-based solutions to enforce copyright laws and restrict printing activities. A common recourse is digital rights management as a means for protecting intellectual property, but its use has the potential for imposing unnecessarily stringent limitations on the use of three-dimensional printing.

"2016","Making things in Fab Labs: a case study on sustainability and co-creation","ABSTRACT Digital fabrication laboratories (such as Fab Labs) are a global initiative of workshops that offer open access to technologies to produce objects from beginning idea to final production. Fab Labs encourage open and free knowledge-sharing among ‘experts’ and the general public. Claims are being made about community-based digital fabrication workshops transforming practices of design, innovation, production and consumption, while describing positive impacts on the environment and social goals. Research that examines such claims is sparse. This paper explores realities of using digital fabrication technologies within a Fab Lab. It draws on a case study that describes practical outcomes of a design workshop in which a multidisciplinary team engaged in issues of sustainable design and processes of co-creation to design and fabricate a prototype. This experience provides insight into the impact of digital fabrication technologies within a sustainable and co-creational design context and critical reflections are presented.","",""
"2016","Animistic design: how to reimagine digital interaction between the human and the nonhuman","ABSTRACT This article puts forward the notion of animistic design as an uncertainty-driven strategy to reimagine human–machine interaction as a milieu of human and nonhuman. Animistic design is suggested as capable of fostering affects, sensibilities and thoughts that capitalize on the uncertain, the unpredictable and the nonlinear, and their capacity to trigger creative pathways. Informed by post-human philosophies, theories of mediation and materiality, as well as by affect, agency and aesthesia, animistic design eschews the anthropomorphic and the cute playfulness often associated with animism. Instead, it proposes a practical–theoretical framework to articulate the nexus of digital innovation, interaction design practices, technical materialities and affective responses already emerging in the digital cohabitation of the human and the nonhuman. Using a ‘research through making’ approach, the article describes in detail a series of animistic design experiments and prototyping methods that explore ways of rethinking interaction as an open-ended and creative enterprise. Animistic design offers an investigative strategy that exploits degrees of collaboratively curated uncertainty and unpredictability to imagine forms of digital interaction, and to engender creative human–nonhuman relationships within a given digital milieu.","",""
"2016","Epistemologies of prototyping: knowing in artistic research","ABSTRACT Increasingly material artefacts are attributed a key role in research in the arts and design. Issues of dissemination and legitimacy of knowledge are however heavily disputed, often through redefinitions of the concept of knowledge itself. This article contributes to these debates by focusing on artistic prototypes, identified here as one of the prevailing outcomes in technologically engaged art research projects. In contrast with a common conceptualisation of knowledge emerging from inside the world of artistic research as subjective, ineffable and emotional, I discuss four examples to highlight how artistic prototypes can support transferable and generative contributions to knowledge, grounded in ad hoc but innovative methodologies. Furthermore, the examples offer insightful considerations that help to identify artistic research when conducted outside official institutions, as opposed to simply process-oriented art practices.","",""
"2016","A certain breakthrough","From the call for papers on ‘speculative hardware’ we have selected two long articles that might begin to articulate a philosophy of the speculative for hardware and design. As part of the research I also conducted an interview with David Cuartielles (part of the founding collective initiating the Arduino platform) and held an interview and workshop with the artist Martin Howse, these will be published online as a companion to this special section of Digital Creativity. In the two selected articles, relations between matter and media (information, the digital, analogue electronics, physical computing and infrastructure) are foregrounded as a significant concern for media theory and in their proximity to new materialisms. We might extend these concerns to what Jussi Parrika names the ‘real but weird materialities’ of media (2012). Cultural concern with such weird materialities was, perhaps, prompted by the materialist methodologies of media theorist Friedrich Kittler. We used Kittler’s essay ‘There is no Software’ (1992) to structure our call for contributions. This essay was referenced explicitly in our call so that from the outset we could make clear the position that electronic media are speculative and grounded in the material (the body, the earth and in conductive substances). It is from this position that this introductory text discusses the essays included in this special section of Digital Creativity and approaches its subject of a speculative hardware. But what is a speculative hardware? In this introduction I want to explore this question by opening up a tension between the materiality and immateriality of speculative hardware by following the inclusion of work by Howse in the first article by Spencer Roberts, ‘Scratching Your Own Itch’ (Roberts 2016) and by taking a lead from the author of the second article, Jamie Brassett, in the speculative moment of thinking about design, through design and as design. When I say ‘following’ I rather mean to use these two leads as points of departure. The vector I want to trace out of these points, by way of introducing some of the themes in the articles included in this issue, begins with Howse’s (2006) translation of Kittler’s essay ‘Pynchon and Electromysticism’. Thomas Pynchon’s metafiction as well as his sense of electromysticism might be said to permeate Kittler’s own ‘speculative’ hardware—his ‘sheer hardware’. Kittler’s sheer hardware, as I feel Whitelaw (2013) correctly intuits it, is an imaginary media ‘no-software’ material computer (Whitelaw 2013). This is what might be called a thought experiment in matter, one that serves to reveal Parrika’s real but weird media. In this combination of the weird with media, there is an encounter with the strangeness of media materialities, ephemeral energetic fields and temporalities that ‘simply make you feel strange’; and a precipitous sheerness, like standing on the edge of chaos—perhaps this is the sense of the speculative that is implied in Roberts’ reference to coercive powers of the technical object and enabled in Brassett’s opening up of the speculative machine to the thought of Isabelle Stengers—the notion that there might be a new ‘normal’, that what is considered ‘normal’ now, in fact, is simply the chronoclastic and morphological material of speculative becomings—we will have further recourse to this before concluding, suffice to list for now: the powers of a shimmering and energetic field, a glamour; the Digital Creativity, 2016 Vol. 27, No. 2, 132–142, http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14626268.2015.1119551","",""
"2016","Speculative machines and technical mentalities: a philosophical approach to designing the future","Abstract ‘Beyond their instrumental functions', writes Rivka Oxman in an article about design, creativity and innovation (2013), ‘advanced digital and computational environments are also becoming tools for thinking design’. At the leading edge of creativity and innovation design does not only speculate the plausible, possible or potential, but pragmatically inserts such futures into the present (as Whitehead says any ‘immediate existence’ (1962) must). Using concepts mainly from Deleuze, Guattari, Spinoza and Simondon, I will position such design speculation as pragmatic, divergent, complex and emergent. That is, as manifesting the technical mentalities (Simondon) that provide the milieu in which we can show what we ‘might be capable of’ (Stengers).","",""
"2016","Sonic boundary objects: negotiating disability, technology and simulation","ABSTRACT In this article, we present the concept of sonic boundary objects by discussing the case of binaural sound recordings as a tool, which helps to negotiate between blind and sighted experiences of an urban soundscape. We begin with developing the theoretical underpinning of the concept of a sonic boundary object by briefly elaborating on the relevance of the concept of the boundary object in the context of disability and technology; we then explain the special properties of binaural recordings and revisit the musicological concept of the sound object, whose relationship with technology partly inspired the work in this article. After introducing these concepts and related practices we proceed by proposing the term of a sonic boundary object. We discuss the relationship of the sonic boundary object with the concept of simulation in the context of disability studies and we then elaborate on its potential impact as a complementary practice to blind ethnography and to participatory design approaches. We will demonstrate its ethnographic potential with an account of the authors’ experience using binaural recordings to exchange on what blind navigation is like in Montreal. The article concludes with a first-person reflection on this experience and possible fields of application.","",""

It provides analyses of how such collaborations among outliers—from health research, pain medicine, art, design, music, computer science and engineering—arose, and how these collaborators found support in usual and unlikely places, and created a small but vibrant and growing community of researchers. Specifically, this account focuses on artists and designers in this collaborative context; what was required of them, their roles in changing the very conditions of research, how their relationships to their originating (or ‘legacy’) discipline changed, and how their commitments profoundly redefined their very notions of what art can mean.","",""

It does this by drawing upon the domestication literature that concerns itself with how people use, adapt and reject technologies and integrate them into their life. The paper examines the significance of the interactions between people and technologies in FabLabs and offers concluding reflections on the role of these relationships within broader social and environmental changes.","",""

The motivation for this art piece was to enrich the usual static format of a stone sculpture with a dynamic dimension. The dynamic dimension is attained with virtual water droplets running over the stone surface which behave as real water droplets. The 3-D surface of a specially carved stone sculpture is during an exhibition continuously captured by the Kinect sensor. Each water drop out of many thousands, which are introduced into the installation as evenly distributed rain drops, falling over the sculpture, are simulated individually to run over the stone surface following the largest slope. These simulated water drops are projected with a video projector as light points on the surface of the sculpture. An observer can enjoy simultaneously the haptic experience of touching the stone and observing a digitally generated but physically grounded animation.","",""

Using the development of Blue Space as a self-reflective case study, we examine the role of gestures in interactive audiovisual works and identify new modes of performance.","",""
"2017","Automated Pattern Analysis in Gesture Research : Similarity Measuring in 3D Motion Capture Models of Communicative Action","The question of how to model similarity between gestures plays an important role in current studies in the domain of human communication. Most research into recurrent patterns in co-verbal gestures – manual communicative movements emerging spontaneously during conversation – is driven by qualitative analyses relying on observational comparisons between gestures. Due to the fact that these kinds of gestures are not bound to well-formedness conditions, however, we propose a quantitative approach consisting of a distance-based similarity model for gestures recorded and represented in motion capture data streams. To this end, we model gestures by flexible feature representations, namely gesture signatures, which are then compared via signature-based distance functions such as the Earth Mover's Distance and the Signature Quadratic Form Distance. Experiments on real conversational motion capture data evidence the appropriateness of the proposed approaches in terms of their accuracy and efficiency. Our contribution to gesture similarity research and gesture data analysis allows for new quantitative methods of identifying patterns of gestural movements in human face-to-face interaction, i.e., in complex multimodal data sets.","",""

"2018","The mouse, the screen and the Holocaust witness: Interface aesthetics and moral response"," How do the aesthetic attributes of digital interfaces affect users’ ability to respond morally to the witnessing of suffering? Focusing on mainstream Graphical User Interfaces (GUI), this article proposes a phenomenology of user experience centred on the moral obligations of attending to, engaging with and acting upon digitized Holocaust survivor testimonies. The GUI, it argues, produces a regimen of eye–hand–screen relations that oscillates between ‘operative’ and ‘hermeneutic’ modes of embodied attention, creating a default condition of bodily restlessness that threatens prolonged, empathetic encounters with depicted others. Nevertheless, interface attributes of real-time screen interaction, haptic sensuousness and user-indexicality enable moral engagement with the witness-survivor, while translating information-sharing into the moral action of co-witnessing. These attributes enable an ‘ethics of kinaesthetics’ that converts sensorimotor responsiveness into moral responsibility. Digital interfaces have established a historically novel situation, where moral response to distant suffering depends on the smallest movements of our fingers and eyes. ","",""

It takes the form of a detailed interview and analysis of the musical performance of one musician with the system, framed according to theoretical issues of the analysis and perception of agency, and the notion of how we approach different systems in the world according to Dennett's notion of ‘stances’ and principles of embodied cognition. The results of this study further support the idea that musicians maintain an ambiguous stance towards improvising software systems that do include concepts of autonomy, but do not depend on comparisons to human behaviour.","",""

Expanding my previous reflections on kairotic coding [Cocker, Emma. (2014). “Live Notation: Reflections on a Kairotic Practice.” In Performance Research Journal, on Writing and Digital Media, edited by Jerome Fletcher and Ric Allsopp, 18 (5), 69–76.

(2017). “Weaving Codes/Coding Weaves: Penelopean Mêtis and the Weaver-Coder’s Kairos.” Textile 15 (2): 124–141], in this article, I address the kairotic liveness within live coding’s improvisational performance by identifying two seemingly contradictory tendencies within this burgeoning genre. On the one hand, there is a call for improved media technologies enabling greater immediacy of semantic feedback supporting a faster, more fluid—perhaps even virtuoso—approach to improvisation. Alongside, there remains interest within the live coding community for a mode of improvisational performativity that harnesses the unpredictable, the unexpected or as-yet-unknown. Rather than regard these two tendencies in antagonistic relation, my intent is to invite further debate on how the development of intelligent machines might better facilitate improvisatory flow, without eradicating the critical intervals and in-between spaces necessary for creative invention and intervention, without smoothing away the points of technical resistance and intransigence which arguably form a part of live coding’s performative texture.","",""
"2018","Improvising through the senses: a performance approach with the indirect use of technology","ABSTRACT This article explores and proposes new ways of performing in a technology-mediated environment. We present a case study that examines feedback loop relationships between a dancer and a pianist. Rather than using data from sensor technologies to directly control and affect musical parameters, we captured data from a dancer’s arm movements and mapped them onto a bespoke device that stimulates the pianist’s tactile sense through vibrations. The pianist identifies and interprets the tactile sensory experience, with his improvised performance responding to the changes in haptic information received. Our system presents a new way of technology-mediated performer interaction through tactile feedback channels, enabling the user to establish new creative pathways. We present a classification of vibrotactile interaction as means of communication, and we conclude how users experience multi-point vibrotactile feedback as one holistic experience rather than a collection of discrete feedback points.","",""

"2018","Simple mappings, expressive movement: a qualitative investigation into the end-user mapping design of experienced mid-air musicians","ABSTRACT In a New Interface for Musical Expression (NIME), the design of the relationship between a musician’s actions and the instrument’s sound response is critical in creating instruments that facilitate expressive music performance. A growing body of NIMEs expose this design task to the end performer themselves, leading to the possibility of new insights into NIME mapping design: what can be learned from the mapping design strategies of practicing musicians? This research contributes a qualitative study of four highly experienced users of an end-user mapping instrument to examine their mapping practice. The study reveals that the musicians focus on designing simple, robust mappings that minimize errors, embellishing these control gestures with theatrical ancillary gestures that express metaphors. However, musical expression is hindered by the unintentional triggering of musical events. From these findings, a series of heuristics are presented that can be applied in the future development of NIMEs.","",""

To analyse the cognitive role of digital design tools, we carried out a protocol analysis of conventional design sketching and a 3D sculpture tool. Cognitive evaluation was a differentiating factor when considering the contextual role of the 3D sculpture tool in subsequent evaluations, non-sequential evaluations for conversion, and passive approaches within the design process. Cognitive evaluation played the following roles: validation, extension, navigation, exploration, and confirmation. The navigation, exploration, and extension roles played by non-sequential evaluation were mainly related to inductive design thinking. Finally, the types of cognitive evaluation and their roles when using the 3D sculpture tool were different, according to the design thinking type. This study explored the multidimensional roles of cognitive evaluation using a 3D sculpture tool and its relationship with design thinking types.","",""

Inspired by these recent developments, an original body-worn sound system was designed, implemented and acoustically optimized aiming to effectively integrate performers’ movements and amplified sounds on stage. An innovative acoustic measurement method was used in connection with tests and interviews with practitioners to assess various sonic and artistic features of the implemented sound vest prototype. Audience questionnaires were employed to assess the perceived acoustic performance of the system in a medium size dance studio. Survey results showed that the perceived acoustic performance of the sound vest is highly dependent on the types of sound materials radiated by the system, as well as on the position of the performer in a room. Future work will consider the implementation and assessment of an extended hybrid spatial system consisting of several mobile sound sources synchronized with a fixed multi-channel sound reproduction system.","",""

The practice-based investigation presented in this article charts the development of an original musical work, Intangible Spaces, which gives form to the invisible aspects of voice and movement through gestural control, physical modelling synthesis and visual feedback. I draw on embodied and performative autoethnographic methods to capture the felt sensations and sound-movement associations that arise during the composition process. I also explore the performance approaches of key practitioners in the area to gain a broader understanding of the ways in which musicians leverage existing performance skills to uncover novel connections between movement and voice in gestural performance.","",""

The framework for analysis draws upon the concepts of distributed creativity, its intersection with a listening-centric approach to meaning creation and an embodied cognitive stance on the development of semantic identifiers in music/movement practice. In the described project, tensions are negotiated between acoustic and electronic sources, and between bottom-up structured improvisation and top-down guidance via Soundpainting conducting. These continuums are amplified and explored through another layer of shared articulation, as machine learning has been applied to recognition of the composer/conductors gestures as well as to continuous mapping of conductor movement to sound transformations. These techniques allow for an intersubjective engagement between all members of the ensemble, wherein sound and movement gestures are co-constructed.","",""

Gotz produced a series of works inspired by what he perceived to be television's potential to initiate a new form of """"kinetic electronic painting"""" (Gotz, 1961: 14). His corresponding production of the Rasterbilder (Raster Pictures) and the film Density 10:2:2:1 were mapped on the technical and formal possibilities of analogue electronics in general, and of television in particular; however, these works were made without any direct use of the new medium, to which Gotz had failed to gain access. This article argues that the concept of """"imagined affordance"""" (Nagy and Neff, 2015) enables a critical reassessment of Gotz's elusive relation to television. Rather than focusing on the lack (of cognition or access) that this concept implies, I argue that """"television"""" functioned as a flexible paradigm through which the artist was able to combine Modernism with the emergent field of information aesthetics. Inspired by the discretized aesthetic of the electronically-produced image, the Raster Pictures and Density 10:2:2:1 predate - albeit in an analogue manner - the first works of computer-generated art by several years.   ","",""

Additionally, this paper details how ‘Speculative Pasts’ offer a critique of the narrowness and problematic futurism of ‘speculative futures.’ Altogether, the authors offer this course and its primary project as a model for making history essential, rather than supplementary, to design and for leveraging practice-based production as a valued mode of historical inquiry.","",""
"2019","What design education tells us about design theory: a pedagogical genealogy","ABSTRACT In design theory, we often come across scholarly efforts that seek to define design as a unique discipline and to characterize it as a distinct category of practice, with its own epistemology in that it differs from sciences, arts and humanities (Cross, N. 2011. Design Thinking: Understanding How Designers Think and Work. Oxford: Berg.; Dorst, K. 2015. Frame innovation: Create New Thinking by Design. Cambridge: The MIT Press. Nelson, H. G., and E. Stolterman. 2012. The Design Way: Intentional Change in an Unpredictable World. The MIT Press.; Redström, J. 2017. Making Design Theory. MIT Press.). Although such efforts are helpful in teasing forward the nature of design epistemologies and practices, we question them by critically engaging with epistemic paradigms informing design education, its structural forms, origins and purposes, historically, while suggesting the time has come to reevaluate design’s relationships with other epistemological traditions, including the sciences and humanities. We unpack history of design education, in order to problematize what we have come to view as overly schematized epistemological distinctions, most notably the asserted opposition between (what Schön calls) technical rationality and an alternative epistemology broadly linked to pragmatism and/or phenomenology. We do so by offering a genealogy of design education showing that since the nineteenth century, design programmes have continuously, if diversely, taught novice designers, methods, crafts, and attitudes that reflect diverse epistemological traditions. Theorists and educators of design have a shared interest in balancing the needs to appreciate and help develop that which is distinctive of design and also to build upon design’s rich epistemological connections to the sciences and humanities. Whereas the former helps the field improve its abilities to contribute to society, the latter provides many of the theoretical, methodological, and pedagogical resources that make such contributions possible.","",""

The discussion is contextualized within technological developments at the turn of the twentieth century—specifically, European railways—that changed our perception of time. The foundational ideas of duration are introduced as a response to these developments. The contemporary technological concept of ‘real-time computing’ is presented to contrast with duration and set up an in-depth explanation of the delays inherent to the 3D printing process. These delays are discussed within the discourse of 3D printing and technological innovation, in general. Current maker-3D printer interactions are then critiqued. Finally, an alternative method of 3D printing concrete that is founded on working with its inherent delays is introduced, along with its implications for digital making and the act of making time.","",""

Based on the influence of design tools in ideation, we compared the problem-solving styles of WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer) and VRE (Virtual Reality Environment) for an apartment flat design task. Function-Behaviour-Structure ontology analysis revealed that WIMP was problem-driven with clear divisions between problem analysis and solution building, while VRE was predominantly solution-driven with frequent modifications of solutions. Such procedural characteristics led to uneven outcomes wherein spatial efficiency was better in WIMP while arrangement was more diversified in VRE. When the key factor was high manipulability of user interface in VRE, the result suggests that higher usability does not always produce desired outcomes. Time for problem analysis and a match between the tool and given problem must be taken into account.","",""

In this paper, I work with the aesthetic experiences of one audience group to consider the psychological impact of living in a culture where digital devices are deliberately designed to influence behaviour. I argue that aesthetic encounters can help with understanding the impact of the interplay between visual stimulus, affect and digital culture, in ways that may support situated understandings of mental distress in a digital age. I show how audiences respond to the artist-led research project Are We All Addicts Now? arguing that they generate ideas connected to submersion and being overwhelmed as a means of reporting on their own personal experiences of living in a digital culture that seeks to influence behaviour. The findings may have value for designers, curators and artists invested in understanding the experiential impact of digital devices.","",""
"2019","FCJ-224 Design Thinking, Design Activism, Design Study","In the history of altruistic efforts to correct the ills of the social body, Design Thinking is today enjoying its time in the limelight. While many designers have relegated it to a passing phase in the history of design, it continues to gain purchase in the broader public sphere, where it is increasingly celebrated as a natural evolution of design’s diverse trajectories and the realisation of its moral potentials. This article offers a brief analysis of the contemporary status of the Design Thinking brand and, specifically, its popular deployment toward the solution of social problems. As a peculiar form of immaterial labour, Design Thinking is increasingly reliant on the elaboration of a debt to design, as a way of mitigating the problem of the potentially non-productive privatisation of the commons. Drawing on the work of Stefano Harney and Fred Moten, I consider the implications of this for its supposed beneficiaries. I argue that, to the extent that design is recruited toward Design Thinking, figured as a model of solving social problems, it risks reproducing the dominant debt/credit logic and denying histories of unpayable debt. What I call design study, by contrast, makes ‘bad debt’ a principle of elaboration, thus opening the way for different ways of experiencing our mutual indebtedness. doi: 10.15307/fcj.30.224.2019","",""

"2020","BETWEEN LIVE AND LIFE: EXPLORING THE ONLINE PRESENCE OF PERFORMANCE   ARTISTS","In the last decade, the use of social media in the theatre scene has fueled debates on the possibility to redefine the performer-audience relationship on a wide scale. Scarce attention, however, has been paid on empirically studying how performance artists balance their use of social media between the need to promote their work and the ambition to experiment creatively on the medium affordances. This paper explores the use of social media by Italian contemporary theatre artists and companies. The study aims to explore the relational labour (Baym 2018) of performance artists in tracing the boundaries between online/offline performativity and between personal self-narration and artistic promotion. Through a combination of profile analysis and in-depth interviews, we want to understand how this artistic scene - that always experimented on intermedial and participatory possibilities - is making sense of social media. Preliminary results show how social media interaction and content production is becoming an integrated part of companies working routines. Companies position their social media activity outside a purely promotional logic. This anti-promotional ethos translates to a lack of efficacy in terms of strategic communication. However, it also lays the basis for the use of social media to expand performative practices. Although the interviewed companies do not exclude such a possibility, they lament their current inability in making such an attempt. Lacking resources is the most quoted explanation of this failure, followed by the refusal to compromise with the constraints of online languages, and the distrust of social media to reach wider audiences.","",""
"2020","Technoperformances: using metaphors from the performance arts for a postphenomenology and posthermeneutics of technology use","AbstractPostphenomenology and posthermeneutics as initiated by Ihde have made important contributions to conceptualizing understanding human–technology relations. However, their focus on individual perception, artifacts, and static embodiment has its limitations when it comes to understanding the embodied use of technology as (1) involving bodily movement, (2) social, and (3) taking place within, and configuring, a temporal horizon. To account for these dimensions of experience, action, and existence with technology, this paper proposes to use a conceptual framework based on performance metaphors. Drawing on metaphors from three performance arts—dance, theatre, and music—and giving examples from social media and other technologies, it is shown that we can helpfully describe technology use and experience as performance involving movement, sociality, and temporality. Moreover, it is argued that these metaphors can also be used to reformulate the idea that in such uses and experiences, now understood as “technoperformances”, technology is not merely a tool but also takes on a stronger, often non-intended role: not so much as “mediator” but as choreographer, director, and conductor of what we experience and do. Performance metaphors thus allow us to recast the phenomenology and hermeneutics of technology use as moving, social, and temporal—indeed historical—affair in which technologies take on the role of organizer and structurer of our performances, and in which humans are not necessarily the ones who are fully in control of the meanings, experiences, and actions that emerge from our engagement with the world, with technology, and with each other. This promises to give us a more comprehensive view of what it means to live with technology and how our lives are increasingly organized by technology—especially by smart technologies. Finally, it is argued that this has normative implications for an ethics and politics of technology, now understood as an ethics and politics of technoperformances.","",""

There is increasing interest in utilizing living media in the context of interaction design influenced by recent advancements in biological sciences that make new forms of responsive living media possible. We establish a definition of LMIs appropriate for HCI’s interdisciplinary domain. We provide an overview of the current design space and identify open research questions from four different perspectives: Biological, Ethical, Artistic, and HCI. For each perspective, we use a series of LMI exemplars to illustrate and ground themes and arguments. We conclude with a series of implications for design, including a discussion of LMIs’ ability to engage human users through being alive, their potential to symbolize and embody dynamic information, and the practical and ethical questions that designers need to consider when working with them.","",""
"2020","Compositional interaction design—changes in design practice and its implications for teaching and research","ABSTRACT In this article, we focus on compositional interaction design as an emergent professional practice in interaction design. We propose that compositional interaction design practice can be defined as a practice of knowing, mapping configuring, customizing and connecting elements to form larger compositional wholes. We demonstrate how this practice demands new compositional skills, new methods and a changed division of labours. We suggest that this contemporary practice can be understood in terms of how different computational components are integrated to form interactive products and services. We illustrate this new practice with two concrete examples. Our first example illustrates compositional interaction design at a small scale, whereas our second example illustrates compositional design at a larger scale. We also discuss how this emergent practice relates to other streams of development (e.g. craft-oriented HCI and human-centred design) and we discuss what implications this shift may have to interaction design educational programs aimed at preparing students for this emerging professional practice.","",""

We propose a three-body framework of spatial typologies in the realm of collaborative room-centered immersive systems that governs the relationship between the immersants, the hardware system of the environment, and the presented virtual environment. Through the lens of this framework, we present several use cases in the Collaborative-Research Augmented Immersive Virtual Environment Laboratory (CRAIVE-Lab) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Through the narratives of these use cases, it is argued that the proposed framework not only affords the design of interaction systems in room-centered virtual environments with spatial awareness, but also engenders new approaches to envision system design and its integration to the built environment. This framework intends to emphasize the significance of spatial thinking in expanding the creative potentials of body-driven interactive immersive systems.","",""

This article presents three of their projects, all based on the metaphor of the thinking space: ‘Semantic Map’, ‘Media Flow’ and ‘Energy Passages’ illustrate strategies of interactivity using artificial intelligence to ‘reinforce human intelligence’.

A 3D water curtain, water drop generation and control program, fog screen and computer program for recognizing visitors were developed for this work. The water curtain, implemented using an array of solenoid valves, creates ephemeral sculptures in real time; the continuous evolution of shapes and images is used as a metaphor of Eternal Recurrence. We developed a method of controlling the solenoid valves that avoids problematic vertical shape distortion caused by gravity and noisy satellite water droplets around the main water drops. The motion of the falling water drops at the centre of the installation is mirrored by the motion of baby-like shapes projected on to the floor and ceiling of the space in which this work is installed. This gives the impression of a full or completed circle. Visitors enter the exhibition through a fog screen, which acts as an entrance port to this immersive experience. ‘Eternal Recurrence’ is a convergence of digital images (3D shape projections) with natural phenomena (falling water drops), which are carefully blended and controlled. As an example of systems art, the installation embodies a process in which all of the separate elements are seamlessly blended through a mechanical–electrical–computer system. The creation and experience of this harmonious system help us to reconsider our existence and networked relations in contemporary society.","",""

"2021","“What's the Brief?”","“What's the brief?” is an everyday question within the graphic design process. Moreover, the concept and importance of a design brief is overtly understood well beyond design practice itself—especially among stakeholders who work with designers and clients who commission design services. Indeed, a design brief is often an assumed and expected physical or metaphoric artefact for guiding the creative process. When a brief is lacking, incomplete or unclear, it can render an already ambiguous graphic design process and discipline even more fraught with misinterpretation. Nevertheless, even in wider design discourse, there appears to be little research on design briefs and the briefing process (Jones and Askland; Paton and Dorst). It seems astonishing that, even in Peter Phillips’s 2014 edition of Creating the Perfect Design Brief, he feels compelled to comment that “there are still no books available about design briefs” and that the topic is only “vaguely” covered within design education (21). While Phillips’s assertion is debatable if one draws purely from online vernacular sources or professional guides, it is supported by the lack of scholarly attention paid to the design brief. Graphic design briefs are often mentioned within design books, journals, and online sources. However, this article argues that the format, function and use of such briefs are largely assumed and rarely identified and studied. Even within the broader field of design research, the tendency appears to be to default to “the design brief” as an assumed shorthand, supporting Phillips’s argument about the nebulous nature of the topic. As this article contextualises, this is further problematised by insufficient attention cast on graphic design itself as a specific discipline. This article emerges from a wider, multi-stage creative practice study into graphic design practice, that used experimental performative design research methods to investigate graphic designers’ professional relationships with stakeholders (Meron, Strangely). The article engages with specific outcomes from that study that relate to the design brief. The article also explores existing literature and research and argues for academics, the design industry, and educationalists, to focus closer attention on the design brief. It concludes by suggesting that experimental and collaborative design methods offers potential for future research into the design brief. Contextualising the Design Brief  It is critical to differentiate the graphic design brief from the operational briefs of architectural design (Blyth and Worthington; Khan) or those used in technical practices such as software development or IT systems design, which have extensive industry-formalised briefing practices and models such as the waterfall system (Petersen et al.) or more modern processes such as Agile (Martin). Software development and other technical design briefs are necessarily more formulaically structured than graphic design briefs. Their requirements are generally empirically and mechanistically located, and often mission-critical. In contrast, the conceptual nature of creative briefs in graphic design creates the potential for them to be arbitrarily interpreted. Even in wider design discourse, there appears to be little consistency about the form that a brief takes. Some sources indicate that a brief only requires one page (Elebute; Nov and Jones) or even a single line of text (Jones and Askland). At other times briefs are described as complex, high-level documents embedded within processes which designers respond to with the aim of producing end products to satisfy clients’ requirements (Ambrose; Patterson and Saville). Ashby and Johnson (40) refer to the design brief as a “solution neutral” statement, the aim being to avoid preconceptions or the narrowing of the creative possibilities of a project. Others describe a consultative (Walsh), collaborative and stakeholder-inclusive process (Phillips). The Scholarly Brief Within scholarly design research, briefs inevitably manifest as an assumed artefact or process within each project; but the reason for their use or antecedents for chosen formats are rarely addressed. For example, in “Creativity in the Design Process” (Dorst and Cross) some elements of the design brief are described. The authors also describe at what stage of the investigation the brief is introduced and present a partial example of the brief. However, there is no explanation of the form of the brief or the reasons behind it. They simply describe it as being typical for the design medium, adding that its use was considered a critical part of addressing the design problem. In a separate study within advertising (Johar et al.), researchers even admit that the omission of crucial elements from the brief—normally present in professional practice—had a detrimental effect on their results. Such examples indicate the importance of briefs for the design process, yet further illustrating the omission of direct engagement with the brief within the research design, methodology, and methods. One exception comes from a study amongst business students (Sadowska and Laffy) that used the design brief as a pedagogical tool and indicates that interaction with, and changes to, elements of a design brief impact the overall learning process of participants, with the brief functioning as a trigger for that process. Such acknowledgement of the agency of a design brief affirms its importance for professional designers (Koslow et al.; Phillips). This use of a brief as a research device informed my use of it as a reflective and motivational conduit when studying graphic designers’ perceptions of stakeholders, and this will be discussed shortly. The Professional Brief Professionally, the brief is a key method of communication between designers and stakeholders, serving numerous functions including: outlining creative requirements, audience, and project scope; confirming project requirements; and assigning and documenting roles, procedures, methods, and approval processes. The format of design briefs varies from complex multi-page procedural documents (Patterson and Saville; Ambrose) produced by marketing departments and sent to graphic design agencies, to simple statements (Jones and Askland; Elebute) from small to medium-sized businesses. These can be described as the initial proposition of the design brief, with the following interactions comprising the ongoing briefing process. However, research points to many concerns about the lack of adequate briefing information (Koslow, Sasser and Riordan). It has been noted (Murray) that, despite its centrality to graphic design, the briefing process rarely lives up to designers’ expectations or requirements, with the approach itself often haphazard. This reinforces the necessarily adaptive, flexible, and compromise-requiring nature of professional graphic design practice, referred to by design researchers (Cross; Paton and Dorst). However, rather than lauding these adaptive and flexible designer abilities as design attributes, such traits are often perceived by professional practitioners as unequal (Benson and Dresdow), having evolved by the imposition by stakeholders, rather than being embraced by graphic designers as positive designer skill-sets. The Indeterminate Brief With insufficient attention cast on graphic design as a specific scholarly discipline (Walker; Jacobs; Heller, Education), there is even less research on the briefing process within graphic design practice (Cumming). Literature from professional practice on the creation and function of graphic design briefs is often formulaic (Phillips) and fractured. It spans professional design bodies, to templates from mass-market printers (Kwik Kopy), to marketing-driven and brand-development approaches, in-house style guides, and instructional YouTube videos (David). A particularly clear summary comes from Britain’s Design Council. This example describes the importance of a good design brief, its requirements, and carries a broad checklist that includes the company background, project aims, and target audience. It even includes stylistic tips such as “don’t be afraid to use emotive language in a brief if you think it will generate a shared passion about the project” (Design Council). From a subjective perspective, these sources appear to contain sensible professional advice. However, with little scholarly research on the topic, how can we know that, for example, using emotive language best informs the design process? Why might this be helpful and desirable (or otherwise) for designers? These varied approaches highlight the indeterminate treatment of the design brief. Nevertheless, the very existence of such diverse methods communicates a pattern of acknowledgement of the criticality of the brief, as well as the desire, by professional bodies, commentators, and suppliers, to ensure that both designers and stakeholders engage effectively with the briefing process. Thus, with such a pedagogic gap in graphic design discourse, scholarly research into the design brief has the potential to inform vernacular and formal educational resources. Researching the Design Brief  The research study from which this article emerges (Meron, Strangely) yielded outcomes from face-to-face interviews with eleven (deidentified) graphic designers about their perceptions of design practice, with particular regard to their professional relationships with other creative stakeholders. The study also surveyed online discussions from graphic design forums and blog posts. This first stage of research uncovered feelings of lacking organisational gravitas, creative ownership, professional confidence, and design legitimacy among the designers in relation to stakeholders. A significant causal factor pointed to practitioners’ perceptions of lacking direct access to and involvement with key sources of creative inspiration and information; one specific area being the design brief. It was a discovery that was reproduced thematically during the second stage of the research. This stage repurposed performative design research methods to intervene in graphic designers’ resistance to research (Roberts, et al), with the goal of bypassing practitioners’ tendency to portray their everyday practices using formulaic professionalised answers (Dorland, View). In aiming to understand graphic designers’ underlying motivations, this method replaced the graphic designer participants with trained actors, who re-performed narratives from the online discussions and designer interviews during a series of performance workshops. Performative methodologies were used as design thinking methods to defamiliarise the graphic design process, thereby enabling previously unacknowledged aspects of the design process to be unveiled, identified and analysed. Such defamiliarisation repurposes methods used in creative practice, including design thinking (Bell, Blythe, and Sengers), with performative elements drawing on ethnography (Eisner) and experimental design (Seago and Dunne). Binding these two stages of research study together was a Performative Design Brief—a physical document combining narratives from the online discussions and the designer interviews. For the second stage, this brief was given to a professional theatre director to use as material for a “script” to motivate the actors. In addition to identifying unequal access to the creative process as a potential point of friction, this study yielded outcomes suggesting that designers were especially frustrated when the design brief was unclear, insufficiently detailed, or even missing completely. The performative methodology enabled a refractive approach, using performative metaphor and theatre to defamiliarise graphic design practice, portraying the process through a third-party theatrical prism. This intervened in graphic designers’ habitual communication patterns (Dorland, The View). Thus, combining traditional design research methods with experimental interdisciplinary ones, enabled outcomes that might not otherwise have emerged. It is an example of engaging with the fluid, hybrid (Heller, Teaching), and often elusive practices (van der Waarde) of graphic design. Format, Function, and Use A study (Paton and Dorst) among professional graphic designers attempts to dissect practitioners’ perceptions of different aspects of briefing as a process of ‘framing’. Building on the broader theories of design researchers such as Nigel Cross, Bryan Lawson, and Donald Schön, Paton and Dorst suggest that most of the designers preferred a collaborative briefing process where both they and client stakeholders were directly involved, without intermediaries. This concurs with the desire, from many graphic designers that I interviewed, for unobstructed engagement with the brief. Moreover, narratives from the online discussions that I investigated suggest that the lack of clear frameworks for graphic design briefs is a hotly debated topic, as are perceptions of stakeholder belligerence or misunderstanding. For example, in a discussion from Graphic Design Forums designer experiences range from only ever receiving informal verbal instructions—“basically, we’ve been handed design work and they tell us ‘We need this by EOD’” (VFernandes)—to feeling obliged to pressure stakeholders to provide a brief—“put the burden on them to flesh out the details of a real brief and provide comprehensive material input” (HotButton) —to resignation to an apparent futility of gaining adequate design briefs from stakeholders because— “they will most likely never change” (KitchWitch). Such negative assumptions support Koslow et al.’s assertion that the absence of a comprehensive brief is the most “terrifying” thing for practitioners (9). Thus, practitioners’ frustrations with stakeholders can become unproductive when there is an inadequate design brief, or if the creative requirements of a brief are otherwise removed from the direct orbit of graphic designers. This further informs a narrative of graphic designers perceiving some stakeholders as gatekeepers of the design brief. For example, one interviewed designer believed that stakeholders ‘don’t really understand the process’ (Patricia). Another interviewee suggested that disorganised briefs could be avoided by involving designers early in the process, ensuring that practitioners had direct access to the client as a creative source, rather than having to circumnavigate stakeholders (Marcus). Such perceptions appeared to reinforce beliefs among these practitioners that they lack design capital within the creative process. These perceptions of gatekeeping of the design brief support suggestions of designers responding negatively when stakeholders approach the design process from a different perspective (Wall and Callister), if stakeholders assume a managerial position (Jacobs) and, in particular, if stakeholders are inexperienced in working with designers (Banks et al.; Holzmann and Golan). With such little clarity in the design briefing process, future research may consider comparisons with industries with more formalised briefing processes, established professional statuses, or more linear histories. Indeed, the uneven historical development of graphic design (Frascara; Julier and Narotzky) may influence the inconsistency of its briefing process. Inconsistency as Research Opportunity The inconsistent state of the graphic design brief is reflective of the broader profession that it resides within. Graphic design as a profession remains fluid and inconsistent (Dorland, Tell Me; Jacobs), with even its own practitioners unable to agree on its parameters or even what to call the practice (Meron, Terminology). Pedagogically, graphic design is still emerging as an independent discipline (Cabianca; Davis), struggling to gain capital outside of existing and broader creative practices (Poynor; Triggs). The inherent interdisciplinarity (Harland) and intangibility of graphic design also impact the difficulty of engaging with the briefing process. Indeed, graphic design’s practices have been described as “somewhere between science and superstition (or fact and anecdote)” (Heller, Teaching par. 3). With such obstacles rendering the discipline fractured (Ambrose et al.), it is understandable that stakeholders might find engaging productively with graphic design briefs challenging. This can become problematic, with inadequate stakeholder affinity or understanding of design issues potentially leading to creative discord (Banks et al.; Holzmann and Golan). Identifying potentially problematic and haphazard aspects of the design brief and process also presents opportunities to add value to research into broader relationships between graphic designers and stakeholders. It suggests a practical area of study with which scholarly research on collaborative design approaches might intersect with professional graphic design practice. Indeed, recent research suggests that collaborative approaches offer both process and educational advantages, particularly in the area of persona development, having the ability to discover the “real” brief (Taffe 394). Thus, framing the brief as a collaborative, educative, and negotiative process may allow creative professionals to elucidate and manage the disparate parts of a design process, such as timeframes, stakeholders, and task responsibilities, as well as the cost implications of stakeholder actions such as unscheduled amendments. It can encourage the formalisation of incomplete vernacular briefs, as well as allow for the influence of diverse briefing methods, such as the one-page creative brief of advertising agencies, or more formal project management practices while allowing for some of the fluidity of more agile approaches: acknowledging that changes may be required while keeping all parties informed and involved. In turn, collaborative approaches may contribute towards enabling the value of contributions from both graphic designers and stakeholders and it seems beneficial to look towards design research methodologies that promote collaborative pathways. Mark Steen, for example, argues for co-design as a form of design thinking for enabling stakeholders to combine knowledge with negotiation to implement change (27). Collaborative design methods have also been advocated for use between designers and users, with stakeholders on shared projects, and with external collaborators (Binder and Brandt). Others have argued that co-design methods facilitate stakeholder collaboration “across and within institutional structures” while challenging existing power relations, albeit leaving structural changes largely unaffected (Farr 637). The challenge for collaborative design research is to seek opportunities and methodologies to conduct design brief research within a graphic design process that often appears amorphous, while also manifesting complex designer–stakeholder dynamics. Doubly so, when the research focus—the graphic design brief—often appears as nebulous an entity as the practice it emerges from. Conclusion  The research discussed in this article suggests that graphic designers distrust a creative process that itself symbolises an inconsistent, reactive, and often accidental historical development of their profession and pedagogy. Reflecting this, the graphic design brief emerges almost as a metaphor for this process. The lack of overt discussion about the format, scope, and process of the brief feeds into the wider framework of graphic design’s struggle to become an independent scholarly discipline. This, in turn, potentially undermines the professional authority of graphic design practice that some of its practitioners believe is deficient. Ultimately, the brief and its processes must become research-informed parts of graphic design pedagogy. Embracing the brief as a pedagogical, generative, and inseparable part of the design process can inform the discourse within education, adding scholarly value to practice and potentially resulting in increased agency for practitioners. The chameleon-like nature of graphic design’s constant adaptation to ever-changing industry requirements makes research into the role and influences of its briefing process challenging. Thus, it also follows that the graphic design brief is unlikely to quickly become as formalised a document or process as those from other disciplines. But these are challenges that scholars and professionals must surely embrace if pedagogy is to gain the research evidence to influence practice. As this article argues, the often obfuscated practices and inherent interdisciplinarity of graphic design benefit from experimental research methods, while graphic designers appear responsive to inclusive approaches. Thus, performative methods appear effective as tools of discovery and collaborative methodologies offer hope for organisational intervention. References Ambrose, Gavin.

"2021","Design","Conventional definitions of design rarely capture its reach into our everyday lives. The Design Council, for example, estimates that more than 2.5 million people use design-related skills, principles, and practices on a daily basis in UK workplaces (Design Council 5, 8). Further, they calculate that these workers contribute £209 billion to the economy annually (8). The terrain of design professions extends from the graphic design of online environments, the business models that make them economically viable, and the algorithms that enable them to function, through to the devices we use, the clothes we wear, the furniture we sit on and the spaces where we live and work. Yet paradoxically a search of online dictionaries reiterates the connection of design primarily to drawing and making plans for buildings. As we witness the adoption of practices of “design thinking” in non-traditional design disciplines, it is interesting to note that the Italian renaissance term disegno, referred to both drawing and aspects of thinking. Giorgio Vasari claimed that design was “the animating principle of all creative processes” (Sorabello). Buckminster Fuller was just as florid and even more expansive when he argued that “the opposite of design is chaos” (Papanek 2). The Oxford English Dictionary captures a broad sense of design as “a plan or scheme conceived in the mind and intended for subsequent execution” (OED Online). This issue of M/C Journal offered contributors the opportunity to consider “design” in its broadest sense. The articles in this issue cast a wide net over design in both practice and theory, and emerge from varied disciplinary bases including material culture, graphic design, media studies, and architecture. The authors critique diverse design practices and pedagogy as well as the social reach of design and its political potential. Design Canons and the Economy While design histories begin with the earliest accounts of toolmaking (Margolin), the Industrial Revolution reinforced the more abstract intellectual dimensions of the discipline. Changing methods of production distinguished making from thinking and led to the emergence of the design profession (Spark). During the twentieth century, New York’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) was instrumental in not only raising awareness of design, but its exhibitions and acquisitions endorsed and canonised the styles and figures associated with “good design”. From its promotion of modern architecture in 1932, to the Good Design exhibition in 1950, MoMA’s advocacy reinforced a selective (and exclusive) canon for modernist design, educating the design-conscious consumer and reaching out to public taste, even advising of local stockists. Design became a means to mediate the art of the past with contemporary furnishings, that they accurately predicted would become the art of the future (MoMA 1). Drawing from this context, in this issue, Curt Lund’s essay interrogates a porcelain toy tea set from 1968 through the lens of material culture analysis to confirm its role in mediating relationships, transmitting values, and embodying social practices, tastes, and beliefs.  MoMA was not unique in recognising both the artistic merit and commercial potential of design. Few design activities are inseparable from the market economy and the language of design has infiltrated business more broadly. Design processes are used in seemingly novel ways across businesses and governments seeking to improve their digital and real-world services. A 2018 report by the UK’s Design Council recognised the expanding reach of design and the competitive advantage of design-based economies:  the skills, principles and practices of design are now widely used from banking to retail. Designers, too, have always drawn on a range of different skills, tools and technologies to deliver new ideas, goods and services. This is what makes design unique, and is how it makes products, services and systems more useful, usable and desirable in advanced economies around the world. (Design Council 5)  Underpinned by design, the global gaming market, for example, is an expanding multi-billion-dollar industry. In this issue, Heather Blakey explores connections made in the digital world. Her article asks, how the design of interactions between characters in the game world can align the player experience with the designer's objectives? The reality of working within the design economy is also addressed by Yaron Meron, whose article in this issue examines the frequent absence of the brief in the graphic design context. Meron highlights problems that arise due to a recurring failure to define the scope of the brief and its significance to a formal collaborative framework between designers and their clientele. Recognition of the design economy’s value has translated to the educational sector. With the expansion of design practice beyond its traditional twentieth century silos, higher education managers are seeking to harness design as a source of innovation, driven by the perceptions of value in disparate industries. This desire for interdisciplinarity raises significant questions about pedagogy and the future of the design studio, which has anchored design tuition since the late nineteenth century. Mark Sawyer’s and Philip Goldswain’s article proposes the employment of concepts from open design literature, “meta-design”, and design “frames” to inform a toolkit to enable shared meaning in an architectural studio setting. Design for a Better World  The American industrial designer George Nelson described design as “an attempt to make a contribution through change” (Packard 69), echoing the perception that progress represents improvement in a teleological sense. Many designers have long pursued social agendas and explored solutions to inequities. What loosely unites the disparate design disciplines is a shared sense that design improves the world we live in. But even with the best intentions, design does not inevitably lead to a better world. Accounts of design frequently recognise its shortcomings. These might include narratives that document or delight in famous design failures, such as the complex circumstances that led to the famed demolition of the Pruitt Igoe housing complex in the 1970s (Bristol). We also regularly encounter design flaws in the digital environment—whether an encryption algorithm open to compromise or online forms that do not recognise apostrophes or umlauts. Although on one level this leads to frustration, it also leads to other types of exclusion. Lisa Hackett’s article on 1950s-style fashion shows how the failure of the fashion industry to accommodate varying body shapes has led some women to seek solutions with vintage-style fashion choices. Hackett’s article brings to mind the serious concerns that occur when the standards that define the normative fail to account for large parts of the population. Overlooking gender and race can have a cumulative and significant impact on the everyday lives of women and minorities (Criado-Perez). The global pandemic has emphasised the dangers arising from PPE ill-designed for racial and gender diversity (Porterfield). The idea that design was a means of progressive improvement began to be prominently debunked in the 1960s with the discussion of the design life of machines, objects, and buildings. Planned obsolescence—or designed obsolescence as it was also known—came to attention in the early 1960s when Vance Packard’s The Waste Makers called into question the ethics of post-war consumerism. Packard’s work drew attention to the ethical responsibilities of designers, by revealing their complicity in the phenomenon of planned obsolescence. Packard’s critique linked the problem of “growthmanship” with issues of saturation and disposal (Packard 5). Large digital libraries replace physical objects but introduce new types of clutter. The anxieties produced by alerts that one’s device is “out of memory” may be easily dismissed as “first world problems”, but the carbon footprint of digital communication and storage is a global concern (Tsukayama; Chan). Digital clutter is explored in Ananya’s article “Minimalist Design in the Age of Archive Fever” in this issue. Ananya contrasts minimalist aesthetics, and Marie Kondo-style decluttering, with our burgeoning prosthetic memory, and its attendant digital footprint. In the late 1960s, Victor Papanek considered the ethics of design choices, and in particular, the nexus between design and consumerism, acknowledging Thorstein Veblen’s coruscating critique of conspicuous consumption. But Papanek also drew attention to contemporary environmental crises. He railed against industrial designers, architects, and planners, attributing blame for the profligate consumerism and environmental degradation arguing that “in all pollution, designers are implicated, at least partially"""" (14). Inclusive Design  Papanek’s influential advocacy acknowledged the political dimensions of design and the inherent biases of the time. In response to his teaching, Danish student Susanne Koefoed designed the now ubiquitous International Symbol of Access (ISA), which Guffey suggests is the most widely exported work of Scandinavian design (358). In this issue’s feature article, Sam Holleran explores the connection between visual literacy and civic life, and the design of an international symbol language, which aimed to ameliorate social disadvantage and cultural barriers. Discussions of inclusive design acknowledge that design history is most often Eurocentric, and frequently exclusionary of diversity. Articles in this issue examine more inclusive approaches to design. These efforts to make design more inclusive extend beyond the object or product, to examining techniques and processes that might improve society. Poiner and Drake, for example, explore the potential and challenges of participatory approaches in the design of buildings for a remote Indigenous community. Fredericks and Bradfield, in this issue, argue that Indigenous memes can provoke audiences and demand recognition of First Nations peoples. The meme offers a more inclusive critique of a national government’s intransigence to constitutional change that recognises Indigenous sovereignty and self-determination. Further, they advocate for co-design of policy that will enshrine an Indigenous Voice to the Australian Parliament. There are many reasons to be grateful for design and optimistic about its future: the swift design and production of efficacious vaccines come to mind.  But as Papanek recognised 50 years ago, designers, most often handmaidens of capital, are still implicated in the problems of the Anthropocene. How can design be used to repair the legacies of a century of profligacy, pollution, and climate change? Design needs its advocates, but the preaching and practice of design are best tempered with continuous forms of critique, analysis, and evaluation.

"2021","Reframing Architecture through Design","Re-Framing Participation in the Architecture Studio Recently, within design literature, significant attention has been given to collaboration across different disciplines (see for instance, Nicolini et al.; Carlile), as well as consideration of the breakdown of traditional disciplinarity and the corresponding involvement of users in co-generation (Sanders and Stappers, “Co-Creation” 11–12) through the development and deployment of structured methods and toolkits (Sanders et al., “Framework”; Sanders and Stappers, “Probes”). Relatively less attention has been paid to the workings of the “communities of practice” (Wenger) operating within the disciplinary domain of architecture. The discourse around concept design in architecture has tended to emphasise individualist approaches driven by personal philosophies, inspirations, imitation of a more experienced designer, and emphasis on latent talent or genius (for instance, Moneo). This can be problematic because without a shared language and methods there are limited opportunities for making meaning to facilitate participation between collaborators in architectural studio settings. It is worth asking then: are there things that “Architecture” might learn from “Design” about the deployment of structured methods, and might this interdisciplinary exchange promote participatory practices in studio-based cultures? We address this question by connecting and building on two important concepts relevant to design methods, meta-design as described in the open design literature (De Mul 36–37), and design frames as described by Schön and formalised by Dorst (‘Core’; Frame; see also Weedon). Through this combination, we propose a theory of participation by making shared meaning in architectural design. We animate our theoretical contribution through a design toolkit we have developed, refined, and applied over several years in typologically focused architectural design studios in Australian university contexts. One important contribution, we argue, is to the area of design theory-building, by taking two previously unrelated concepts from the design methods literature. We draw them together using an example from our own design practices to articulate a new term and concept for making shared meaning in design. The other contribution made is to the translation of this concept into the context of studio-based architectural practice, a setting that has traditionally struggled to accept structured methods. The existence of other form-metaphor design tools available for architecture and the theoretical basis of their development and connection to design literature more broadly has not always been clearly articulated (see for example Di Mari and Yoo; Lewis et al.). The rationale for giving an account of the construction and deployment of our own toolkit is to illustrate its theoretical contribution while providing the basis for future field testing and translation (including by other researchers), noting the established trajectory of this kind of work in the design literature (see, for example, Hoolohan and Browne; Visser et al.; Vaajakallio and Mattelmäki; Sanders and Stappers, “Co-Creation” and ”Probes”). In line with this issue’s thematic and epistemological agenda, we adopt what Cross identifies as “designerly ways of knowing” (223), and is at least partly a reflection on a practice in which we engage with our own disciplines and research interests to propose and deploy design thinking as a kind of critical “reflection-in-action” (Robertson and Simonsen 2). Meta-Framing: Combining Meta-Design and Framing Meta-design is a term used in open design literature to describe approaches aimed toward orchestration of a project in such a way that people are afforded the agency to become effective co-designers, regardless of their pre-existing skills or design-specific knowledge (De Mul 36). According to a meta-design approach, design is conceived of as a shared project of mutual learning instead of an individualistic expression of singular genius. Through the establishment of shared protocols and formats, what Ehn (1) calls “infrastructuring”, individuals with even very limited design experience are provided scaffolds that enable them to participate in a design project. One important way in which meta-design helps “create a pathway through a design space” is through the careful selection and adoption of shared guiding metaphors that provide common meanings between co-designers (De Mul 36). The usefulness of metaphors is also recognised in the context of design frames, the second concept on which we build our theory. Conceptualised as “cognitive shortcuts” for making “sense of complex situations” (Haase and Laursen 21), design frames were first conceived of by Schön (132) as a rational approach to design, one guided by “epistemological norms”. Frames have subsequently been further developed within the design methods literature and are defined as a system of counterfactual design decision-making that uses metaphors to provide a rationale for negotiating ill-structured problems. According to Dorst, frames involve:  the creation of a (novel) standpoint from which a problematic situation can be tackled … . Although frames are often paraphrased by a simple metaphor, they are in fact very complex sets of statements that include the specific perception of a problem situation, the (implicit) adoption of certain concepts to describe the situation, a ‘working principle’ that underpins a solution and the key thesis: IF we look at the problem situation from this viewpoint, and adopt the working principle associated with that position, THEN we will create the value we are striving for. (525)  Despite Schön choosing to illustrate his original conception of framing through the example of a student’s architectural design project, there has been limited subsequent consideration of framing in architectural studio contexts—an exception being Eissa in 2019. This may be because formalised design methods have tended to be treated with suspicion within architectural culture. For instance, Christopher Alexander’s Pattern Language is one such “highly systemised design process” (Dawes and Ostwald 10) that despite its potential to guide participatory design has had an “uneven reception” (Bhatt 716) within architecture itself. One way architecture as a disciplinary domain and as a profession has attempted to engage with design method is through typology, which is one of the few persistent and recurring notions in architectural discourse (Bandini; Grover et al.). As a system of classification, typology categorises “forms and functions as simply and unequivocally as possible” (Oechslin 37). In addition to being used as a classification system, typology has also been positioned as “a process as much as an object”, one with the potential for an “active role in the process of design” (Lathouri 25). Type and typology have been conceptualised as a particular way of projecting architecture’s “disciplinary agency” (Jacoby 936), and this goes some way to explaining their enduring value. A potentially valid criticism of framing is that it can tend toward “design fixation”, when a pre-existing assumption “inadvertently restricts the designers’ imagination” (Crilly). Similarly, typology-as-method—as opposed to a classification tool—has been criticised for being relatively “inflexible” or “reductive” (Shane 2011) and responsible for perpetuating “conservative, static norms” (Jacoby 932) if applied in a rote and non-reflexive way. We deal with these concerns in the discussion of the deployment of our Typekit below. We are drawing here on our experience teaching in the first two years of undergraduate architecture degrees in Australian university settings. As well as being equipped with a diversity of educational, social, linguistic, and cultural backgrounds, students typically have divergent competencies in the domain-specific skills of their discipline and a limited vocabulary for making shared meaning in relation to an architectural proposal. The challenge for studio-based collaborative work in such a context is developing shared understandings and a common language for working on a design project to enable a variety of different design solutions. The brief for a typical studio project will specify a common site, context, and program. Examples we have used include a bathhouse, fire station, archive, civic centre, and lifesaving club. There will then be multiple design solutions proposed by each studio participant. Significantly we are talking about relatively well-structured problems here, typically a specific building program for a specified site and user group. These are quite unlike the open-ended aims of “problem frames” described in the design thinking literature “to handle ill-defined, open-ended, and ambiguous problems that other problem-solving methodologies fail to handle” (Haase and Laursen 21). However, even for well-structured problems, there is still a multitude of possible solutions possible, generated by students working on a particular project brief. This openness reduces the possibility of making shared meaning and thus hinders participation in architectural design. Designing the Typekit The Typekit was developed heuristically out of our experiences teaching together over several years. As part of our own reflective practice, we realised that we had begun to develop a shared language for describing projects including that of students, our own, precedents and canonical works. Often these took the form of a simple formal or functional metaphor such as “the building is a wall”; “the building is an upturned coracle”; or “the building is a cloud”. While these cognitive shortcuts proved useful for our communication there remained the possibility for this language to become esoteric and exclusionary. On the other hand, we recognised the potential for this approach to be shared beyond our immediate “interpretive community” (Fish 485) of two, and we therefore began to develop a meta-design toolkit.  Fig. 1: Hybrid page from the Typekit We began by developing a visual catalogue of formal and functional metaphors already present within the panoply of constructed contemporary architectural projects assembled by surveying the popular design media for relevant source material.  Fig. 2: Classification of contemporary architectural built work using Typekit metaphors We then used simple line drawings to generate abstract representations of the observed building metaphors adopting isometry to maintain a level of objectivity and a neutral viewing position (Scolari). The drawings themselves were both revelatory and didactic and by applying what Cross calls “designerly ways of knowing” (Cross 223) the toolkit emerged as both design artefact and output of design research. We recognised two fundamentally different kinds of framing metaphors in the set of architectural projects we surveyed, rule-derived and model-derived—terms we are adapting from Choay’s description of “instaurational texts” (8). Rule-derived types describe building forms that navigate the development of a design from a generic to a specific form (Baker 70–71) through a series of discrete “logical operators” (Choay 134). They tend to follow a logic of “begin with x … perform some operation A … perform some operation B … end up with y”. Examples of such operations include add, subtract, scale-translate-rotate, distort and array. Model-derived framing metaphors are different in the way they aim toward an outcome that is an adapted version of an ideal initial form. This involves selecting an existing type and refining it until it suits the required program, site, and context. Examples of the model-derived metaphors we have used include the hedgehog, caterpillar, mountain, cloud, island, and snake as well as architectural Ur-types like the barn, courtyard, tent, treehouse, jetty, and ziggurat. The framing types we included in the Typekit are a combination of rule-derived and model-derived as well as useful hybrids that combined examples from different categories. This classification provides a construct for framing a studio experience while acknowledging that there are other ways of classifying formal types.  Fig. 3: Development of isometric drawings of metaphor-frames After we developed a variety of these line drawings, we carried out a synthesis and classification exercise using a version of the KJ method. Like framing, KJ is a technique of abduction developed for dealing objectively with qualitative data without a priori categorisation (Scupin; Kawakita). It has also become an established and widely practiced method within design research (see, for instance, Hanington and Martin 104–5). Themes were developed from the images, and we aimed at balancing a parsimony of typological categories with a saturation of types, that is to capture all observed types/metaphors and to put them in as few buckets as possible.  Fig. 4: Synthesis exercise of Typekit metaphors using the KJ method (top); classification detail (bottom) Deploying the Typekit We have successfully deployed the Typekit in architectural design studios at two universities since we started developing it in 2018. As a general process participants adopt a certain metaphor as the starting point of their design. Doing so provides a frame that prefigures other decisions as they move through a concept design process. Once a guiding metaphor is selected, it structures other decision-making by providing a counterfactual logic (Byrne 30). For instance, if a building-as-ramp is chosen as the typology to be deployed this guides a rationale as to where and how it is placed on the site. People should be able to walk on it; it should sit resolutely on the ground and not be floating above it; it should be made of a massive material with windows and doors appearing to be carved out of it; it can have a green occupiable roof; quiet and private spaces should be located at the top away from street noise; active spaces such as a community hall and entry foyer should be located at the bottom of the ramp … and so on. The adoption of the frame of “building-as-ramp” by its very nature is a crucial and critical move in the design process. It is a decision made early in the process that prefigures both “what” and “how” types of questions as the project develops. In the end, the result seems logical even inevitable but there are many other types that could have potentially been explored and these would have posed different kinds of questions and resulted in different kinds of answers during the process. The selection of a guiding metaphor also allows students to engage with historical and contemporary precedents to offer further insights into the development—as well as refinement—of their own projects within that classification. Even given the well-structured nature of the architectural project, precedents provide useful reference points from which to build domain-specific knowledge and benchmarks to measure the differences in approaches still afforded within each typological classification. We believe that our particular meta-framing approach addresses concerns about design fixation and balances mutual learning with opportunities for individual investigation. We position framing less about finding innovative solutions to wicked problems to become more about finding ways for a group of people to reason together through a design problem process by developing and using shared metaphors. Thus our invocation of framing is aligned to what Haase and Laursen term “solution frames” meaning they have an “operational” meaning-making agenda and provide opportunities for developing shared understanding between individuals engaged in a given problem domain (Haase and Laursen 20). By providing a variety of opportunities within an overarching “frame of frames” there are opportunities for parallel design investigation to be undertaken by individual designers. Meta-framing affords opportunities for shared meaning-making and a constructive discourse between different project outcomes. This occurs whether adopting the same type to enable questions including “How is my building-as-snake different from your building-as-snake?”, “Which is the most snake-like?”, or different types (“In what ways is my building-as-ramp different to your building-as-stair?”) By employing everyday visual metaphors, opportunities for “mutual learning between mutual participants” (Robertson and Simonsen 2) are enhanced without the need for substantial domain-specific architectural knowledge at a project’s outset. We argue that the promise of the toolkit and our meta-framing approach more generally is that it actually multiples rather than forecloses opportunities while retaining a shared understanding and language for reasoning through a project domain. This effectively responds to concerns that typology-as-method is a conservative or reductive approach to architectural design. It is important to clarify the role of our toolkit and its relationship to our theory-building agenda. On the basis of the findings accounted for here we do claim to draw specific conclusions about the efficacy of our toolkit. We simply did not collect experimental data relevant to that task. We can, however, use the example of our toolkit to animate, flesh out, and operationalise a model for collaboration in architectural design that may be useful for teaching and practicing architecture in collaborative, team-based contexts. The contribution of this account, therefore, is theoretical. That is, the adaptation of concepts from design literature modified and translated into a new domain to serve new purposes. The Promise of Meta-Framing through Typology Through our work, we have outlined the benefits of adopting formalised design methods in architecture as a way of supporting participation, including using toolkits for scaffolding architectural concept design. Meta-framing has shown itself to be a useful approach to enable participation in architectural design in a number of ways. It provides coherence of an idea and architectural concept. It assists decision-making in any given scenario because a designer can decide which out of a set of choices makes more sense within the “frame” adopted for the project. The question becomes then not “what do I like?” or “what do I want?” but “what makes sense within the project frame?” Finally and perhaps most importantly it brings a common understanding of a project that allows for communication across a team working on the same problem, supporting a variety of different approaches and problem-solving logics a voice. By combining methodologies and toolkits from the design methods literature with architecture’s domain-specific typological classifications we believe we have developed an effective and adaptive model for scaffolding participation and making shared meaning in architecture studio contexts.

"2021","Transformative or Tokenistic?","Participatory design is often promoted as an inclusive, open-ended, and fluid methodology for giving voice to marginalised and underrepresented user groups. In contrast, participatory design can also be used as a tool for political regeneration and is therefore sometimes criticised as ineffectual and tokenistic. Levels of stakeholder participation are not explicitly quantifiable, and the degree to which user groups may be involved in the decision-making process varies significantly. Exploring the political binaries of transformative versus tokenistic participation within an Indigenous context, this article reflects on a series of participatory workshops undertaken within the design of a preschool and community hub located in the discrete Aboriginal community of Murrin Bridge. The research draws upon Jeremy Till’s take on ‘transformative participation’ and Susanne Hofmann’s ‘Architecture is Participation’, with reference to the participatory design processes developed within Berlin-based Baupiloten’s precedent ‘Taka Tuka Land Kindergarten.’ The research also investigates the potential of adapting principles derived from Robert Chambers's Participatory Rural Appraisal as a means of adopting a socially inclusive approach to design. The article evaluates the successes and drawbacks of the participatory design methods used within the Murrin Bridge workshops and provides a critical analysis of the legitimacy of these processes as transformative, and the broader possibilities for reimagining the production of contemporary architecture through participation within in an Indigenous regional context. Participation or Placebo? Participatory design is a broad approach that refers to a design practice placing stakeholder inclusion at the forefront. In more successful examples of participatory design, the design question frames the specific context, defines the needs of the user, and balances authority across stakeholders (Hamdi). This approach engages the end-user in decision-making responsibilities, which is more likely to support a congruous relationship between the user and the design outcome (Broffman). It is important to acknowledge that the scope of inclusion in participatory design is not directly measurable and can range from an appearance of inclusion that is “really no more than a placebo” (Till) to active participation of the users, where “the boundary between “designer” and “user” becomes blurred’ (Luck). Paul Jenkins’s analytical framework, identifying three overarching forms of participation, is helpful in understanding these levels of user participation: (1) the one-way provision of information, (2) two-way consultation, and (3) negotiation or shared decision-making (Jenkins). However, participation without shared authority and user-autonomy in decision-making, indicated in the """"information"""" and """"consultation"""" levels within Jenkins’s framework, could arguably be called out as tokenistic. Carole Pateman labels this inclusion of stakeholders as """"pseudo-participation"""", performing as a box-ticking exercise to give users “a sense of influencing the design process” (Sanoff). Participatory design, also referred to as cooperative design or co-design, is inherently political and often applied as an instrument for regeneration: once participation levels are deemed satisfactory, the design process can progress. As a result, participatory processes can often reinforce power structures; the design problem is established based on the knowledge of the so called ‘expert’, rather than the lived experience of the user, and control of communication is maintained by the expert (Till). In the situation of designers working within Aboriginal contexts, there is also the implicit responsibility of providing tangible benefits to communities in relation to health and employment, while negotiating delivery and revenue expectations of the service providers (Broffman). The design process is then framed around predetermined outcomes established by the architect or other governing bodies, neglecting to genuinely respond to the knowledge and aspirations of the users. As a result, these parameters persuade the tokenistic inclusion of community, to assert satisfactory participation, which has historically created a disjoint between the users and built outcomes, as the relationship between traditional Aboriginal socio-spatial behaviors and architecture is understated (Memmott). In contrast, “transformative participation” or “inclusive design” subverts the tokenistic inclusion of stakeholders within the design process by establishing transparency in power, knowledge and decision making between the experts and end-users (Till). When working within Indigenous contexts, it is essential to understand the unique milieu from within which a design problem occurs; therefore, a deep knowledge of the community, including place, practice, culture, and organisations is key (Hamdi). This understanding allows for methodologies for community participation to be established for the user and “tailored to each context and situation” (Jenkins). While the approach recognises that there will be imbalances of power and knowledge, the aim of transformative participation is to give precedence to user empowerment through genuine and ongoing engagement and subvert assumptions of the design outcomes by ensuring stakeholder involvement is fundamental in the decision-making processes (Till). This form of engagement relies equally upon the knowledge of the user, and how this can shape the knowledge of the “expert”, as well as the ability of the expert to interpret, articulate, and translate this. Till argues that transformative participation should be developed within and in response to the specific environment insofar as “the architect must project themselves into the spatial context, physical and social of the user” (Till). The participatory approach must remain flexible throughout the research in order to respond to the environment and allow for the participants to shape the process. Shaneen Fantin further advocates Till’s position within a cross-cultural Aboriginal context, emphasising the significance of recognising the cultural knowledge, perspectives, and bias of the participants as well as their relationship with place (Fantin). Acknowledging that each participant possesses a unique cultural lens is essential in transformative design processes and demonstrates that “genuine consultation and inclusive design is a way of embedding the important link between self and place within the architectural process” (Broffman). Participatory Design in Place: Murrin Bridge  Murrin Bridge is a discrete Aboriginal community of approximately one hundred people, located in central New South Wales, 12 km from the regional centre of Lake Cargelligo. The community sits on Wiradjuri Country, although most Murrin Bridge residents trace their ancestry back to the Aboriginal people of Ngiyampaa and Barkindji nations. The township was founded in 1949 as an Aboriginal Station, set up by the NSW Government to accommodate Aboriginal people who were forcibly removed from their traditional lands as part of the NSW Aborigines Protection Act and assimilation policy.  The Murrin Bridge Local Aboriginal Land Council (MBLALC) is responsible for the management of the land, community development, and service delivery within Murrin Bridge. In recent years, the land council and community health providers relocated to Lake Cargelligo, while current services within the town such as employment (REDI.E) and welfare (Centrelink) providers operate in office buildings that are in a precarious state of disrepair. The Murrin Bridge Preschool is a not-for-profit community preschool, providing quality education and care for Indigenous and non-Indigenous children, that has become a successful enterprise, increasing its student intake and attracting students from neighbouring communities. In 2019, the Murrin Bridge Preschool, in close consultation with the Murrin Bridge Local Aboriginal Land Council, commissioned a team of architects and researchers from the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) School of Architecture to design an extension of the preschool as a community hub. The design scheme proposes two additional pavilions organised around a central courtyard to create a civic centre for the community of Murrin Bridge, with new amenities to recover and relocate the community services currently in Lake Cargelligo. The hub will also create a broader community cultural and services centre that will act as a “one stop shop” for residents to access services and participate in community and cultural events. Once complete, the Murrin Bridge Preschool Community Hub seeks to contribute to Indigenous advancement by focusing on cultural strengths and connection, as well as improved access to relevant services resulting in increased education, employment, and community safety outcomes. The research was funded through the Indigenous Affairs Group at the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, who approved seed funding for the initial scoping work. The funds were awarded to the Murrin Bridge Preschool who contracted UTS to develop a schematic design for the extension of the Preschool to incorporate the community hub. Members of the UTS team include lead researchers and architects Dr Campbell Drake, Guillermo Fernandez-Abascal, and Urtzi Grau, Indigenous advisor Allan Teale, landscape architects, and researchers Saskia Schut and Louisa King, research assistants Jack Cooper and Eduard Fernandez Garcia, and Deborah Szapiro from the School of Design. The opportunity to partner with the MBLALC was facilitated by Allan Teale, a UTS Ph.D. candidate, who discovered his Indigenous heritage when he was 40 years old. Teale traced his ancestry back to Murrin Bridge and plays an important role within the project as an Indigenous Elder, advisor, researcher, and first point of contact with the MBLALC and community. This relationship with the MBLALC was strengthened through a series of undergraduate design studios that were coordinated by Drake from 2016-2018, focused on community revitalisation and the adaptive reuse of existing infrastructure. Both Drake and Teale are founding members of The Indigenous Infrastructure and Sustainable Housing Alliance (TIISHA), which is a group of researchers and building professionals at UTS who share a commitment to developing “health enabling infrastructure” as a means to address underlying structural factors of Indigenous disadvantage. Taka Tuka Land Kindergarten  To establish a baseline prior to unpacking the participatory design processes that took place in Murrin Bridge, the participatory processes of a project of similar scope and program by Die Baupiloten titled “Taka Tuka Land Kindergarten” are explored. Die Baupiloten are a Berlin-based architecture practice specialising in kindergartens, who are championed as world leaders in participatory design involving preschool students.  Fig. 1: Taka Tuka Land Kindergarten Built between 2005 and 2007, the Taka Tuka Land Kindergarten involved direct participation from the kindergarten children in the generation of the building design. Like Murrin Bridge, the scope of the project involved the alteration and addition to an existing kindergarten based on designs that emerged from participatory workshops with students. This was a collaborative approach that evolved from Die Baupiloten’s principle that “user participation should be understood as part of the foundation of a design proposal ... it provides a robust foundation leading to a design that is highly relevant in terms of use, and to an increased sense of belonging” (Hofmann). Die Baupiloten’s design process asked the kindergarten students to respond to the spatial narrative of Astrid Lindgren’s book Pippi Longstocking. Individual workshops invited the students to develop paintings and pictures, plans and models to reflect their ideas and interpretations of Taka Tuka Land Kindergarten. These interpretations were documented by the teachers and architects, and in conjunction with observations of the children’s interactions, playtime and daily routines, were translated into a series of spatial interventions throughout the existing building, exhibiting the generative potential of storytelling and the development of collective narratives. This participatory design process also breaks down the traditional hierarchical dichotomies of expert and user to offer spatial agency through the student’s fundamental role in the design of their built environment. The Participatory Design Process In developing the schematic design proposal for the Murrin Bridge Preschool and Community Hub, the researchers arranged a series of participatory design workshops seeking to incorporate the knowledge, opinions, and aspirations of local community members within the design process. Attempting to subvert “traditional architectural practice that is associated with predetermined action through its habit of playing out established themes” (Awan, Schneider, &amp; Till), the workshops sought to develop participatory processes that emphasised user empowerment and decision making. Drawing on Die Baupiloten’s collective narrative methods, the researchers adapted principles derived from Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) to situate the participatory design workshops within a cross-cultural Indigenous context. Sharing similarities with both intercultural and inclusive design principles, Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) is a technique refined by development scholar Robert Chambers, commonly used in the international development sector, and is characterised by a participatory approach through which the “outsider” relinquishes the role of an extractive expert in favour of rapport building. The approach encourages “local people to choose and improvise methods for themselves” while “outsiders metaphorically, and sometimes actually, ‘hand over the stick’ of authority” (Chambers). PRA gives precedence to the knowledge, aspirations, and values of the community, as well as autonomy in decision-making responsibilities that can lead to the transformative destabilisation of traditional hierarchies between subjects and researchers. While all of the core principles of PRA facilitate inclusion, the principles of “offsetting biases” and “they do it” were applied to this study based on their particular relevance within a remote Indigenous context. According to Chambers, “they do it” involves the facilitator initiating a process of participatory analysis and then sitting back or walking away, taking care not to interview or interrupt. In a similar vein, offsetting biases involves “being relaxed and not rushing, listening not lecturing and being unimposing instead of important” (Chambers). In the context of designing the preschool, “offsetting biases” and “they do it” gives precedence to local Indigenous knowledge over the expertise of the academic outsider. Advocating for the ability “to learn directly from local people, directly, on the site” (Chambers), these principles can enable the potential destabilisation of the hierarchical dichotomy between “us” and “them”, allowing the researchers to access what Mudimbe describes as an “intermediate, diffused space”. The approach employed within the Murrin Bridge workshops centred on the use of the participatory techniques including storytelling, participatory drawing and modelling, and iterative and recursive feedback loops. Exploring the capacity of these techniques to enact transformative rather than tokenistic participation within an Indigenous context, the following section provides a critical evaluation of the successes and pitfalls of the methods employed during the participatory workshops carried out in designing the Murrin Bridge Preschool and Community Hub. The Participatory Design Process Meaningful participatory design processes acknowledge the significance of building mutual understandings with the community over time, recognising that it is “overly optimistic to expect a community to feel a sense of ‘ownership’ of a community planning process, especially when this is essentially a transient event. While this may just seem a matter of semantics, such terminology raises the status of participatory planning (and of its facilitators) to misleading heights” (Moran). Therefore, the process for the design of the Murrin Bridge Preschool and Community Hub commenced with a participatory workshop series, which spanned over four days across a four-week period, involving all the future users of the civic space. Staff, students, and parents of the preschool, residents of Murrin Bridge, members of the MBLALC, and various community service providers including medical, welfare, and employment agencies were all involved in the workshops to best understand the future aspirations for the centre. Workshop Series: Murrin Bridge Collective narratives create an opportunity for individuals to share their stories and experiences and can be significant in acknowledging the legacies of older generations and local knowledge (Denborough). The workshop series at Murrin Bridge Preschool began with the students and staff of the preschool, with an exercise focused on storytelling and the development of collective narratives. The preschool students were read the storybook The Emu Egg, by Aboriginal author Sharon Thorpe, from Murrin Bridge and Indigenous illustrator, David Leffler. The story was read by Allan Teale and was selected for its specificity to the community, as it depicts the cultural tale of searching for emu eggs to make a cake in Murrin Bridge.  Fig. 2: Uncle Allan reading The Emu Egg to the Murrin Bridge Preschool students Following the story, each student was presented with a laser-cut scale model of the existing classroom, where the exercise was taking place. Facilitated by the UTS research team, the students developed creative responses to The Emu Egg, imagining their ideal classroom and interpreting this through the recreation and decoration of the scale model. With encouragement from their teachers, the students enthusiastically took to the task, producing a variety of colourfully painted and textured interiors.  Fig. 3: Murrin Bridge Preschool student’s response to The Emu Egg The second exercise was centred on a 1:20 scale model of the existing preschool, situated on a printed site plan. The students developed self-portraits as figurines, along with coloured timber blocks, and were encouraged to play and build structures around the existing facility. The students’ interpretations were used to promote conversations with the parents and teachers around stakeholder needs and aspirations for the space. The preschool staff also presented several schemes of their own based on their experiences of the space and its users.   Fig. 4: Self-portrait figurines Through critical reflection of the workshop series carried out within the Murrin Bridge Preschool in relation to transformative versus tokenistic participation, it is important to identify and discuss the models and drawings that were produced by the participants, and how these artefacts were translated and incorporated by the design researchers into design proposals for built outcomes. The development of collective narratives with the preschool students produced colourful classroom interiors based on the students’ imaginations and spatial interpretations of The Emu Egg storybook, followed by abstract urban landscapes developed using coloured timber blocks. While the students delighted in the activities, upon reflection, the connection between The Emu Egg narrative and the students' creative outcomes was all but lost. Similarly, the abilty of the students to make a connection between their immediate environment of the classroom and the models they were decorating was fragmentary or absent. In considering the difficulties linking the story, the students’ artefacts, and their spatial awareness of the immediate environment suggest that the activities and methods were either poorly executed by the researchers or the activity was misdirected and perhaps more suitable for school-age students. During the workshop series, the research team discussed the potential for translating the creations of the preschool students into the design proposal, with one researcher stating that the purpose of the workshop was to build rapport with the participants, rather than using the work produced by the students in the development of design outcomes. When evaluating how the students' creations were translated into the final schematic design proposal, the vibrant colours of the painted interiors and the cubic abstractions from the timber blocks are both noticeably absent. Till refers to this type of participation as a tool for reinforcing power structures, with the predisposition of architects to neglect the contributions of participants, and instead retain their predetermined architectural outcomes. Till unequivocally states, """"under the guise of inclusion, the same old patterns of power repeat themselves, defeating the expectations of the participant citizens in actually gaining themselves anything better, and distancing them from the real processes of spatial production” (Till). This resonates with the unwitting tokenistic participation of the students that was enacted within the preschool workshops, reaffirming the hegemonic relationship between the experts and end-users by dismissing the value of their creative input within the decision-making of the design process. Susanne Hofmann, founder of Die Baupiloten, claims that “well-planned participation can also contribute significantly to a high-quality built environment and an increased sense of belonging” (Hofmann). When reflecting on the participatory techniques borrowed from Die Baupiloten’s Taka Tuka Land Kindergarten, which was applied through the storybook The Emu Egg in Murrin Bridge, the authenticity of this statement raises scepticism. Respecting and understanding Hofmann’s intent to break down the hierarchy between the expert and the user, having re-produced a similar exercise at the Murrin Bridge Preschool, the ability of Die Baupiloten to produce seven structured outcomes from kindergarten children’s interpretations of Pippi Longstocking is post-rationalised at best. The participatory process of Taka Tuka Land Kindergarten shows signs of being partially fabricated; the designers have perhaps taken creative liberty in developing the majority of the architectural interventions, irrespective of the outcomes of the workshops conducted with the students of the preschool. The remaining stages of the workshop series extended to include residents of Murrin Bridge, senior members of the MBLALC, and a variety of service providers interested in relocating to and operating from the Murrin Bridge Preschool and Community Hub. Incorporating input from previous workshops, this stage was centred on a second 1:20 scale model of the proposed schematic design for the Murrin Bridge Preschool and Community Hub. Similarly, the students were first to engage with the model and were asked to arrange and position model trees and shrubs around the design. Guided by the two landscape architects, the designers encouraged discussion around the integration of community gardens and native plants within the design proposal. Following this landscape design exercise, the preschool staff, service providers and the community members of Murrin Bridge were invited to review the schematic model and drawings. This provided an opportunity for various stakeholders to discuss their opinions of how the preschool and community hub could operate simultaneously, and how to negotiate pragmatic concerns such as ensuring adequate privacy and security as well as managing community events.  Fig. 5: Preschool student landscape arrangements  Fig. 6: Workshop with parents, preschool staff, service providers and residents  Fig. 7: Workshop with land council members, preschool staff and service providers Despite the fact that the students were asked to arrange and position vegetation around the buildings based on their understanding of the land, on reflection, it is noticeable that their input did not register in the landscape design, instead favouring the expert opinion of the designers—yet another design decision that had “misplaced good intentions” (Mahood) yet ultimately disregarded the creative input of the students, resulting in another example of tokenistic rather than transformative participation enacted within the preschool workshops. Despite the participatory shortcomings involving preschool students, the workshops did afford a range of unpredictable intercultural interactions between the researchers and stakeholders that were instrumental to informing the design outcome. One such example was a conversation between the lead landscape architect and a resident Elder about the integration of community gardens and native plants. Emerging from this conversation was a complementary strategy for designing culturally speciﬁc landscaping reminiscent with what Fantin describes as “spiritual aspects (responding to connections to place and country and spirituality) … and artistic ideas (including specifically designed cultural elements”. The landscape strategy proposes three interwoven educational zones, each tailored to local vegetation and learning outcomes. Zone One is the “Edible Woodland” consisting of mixed small trees and shrubs such as quandong and wattles. Zone Two is the “Medicinal, Ceremonial and Spiritual” area, consisting of mixed small and medium trees such as native apricot and wilga, as well as mixed shrubs like emu bush. Zone Three is the “Craft Zone”, which is made up of locally sourced mixed grasses and small shrubs suitable for weaving. Facilitated by local Aboriginal Elders, the landscape strategy encourages and celebrates the transfer of traditional knowledge, providing a culturally responsive educational setting for Aboriginal children.   Figs. 8 and 9: Proposed landscape schematics The workshop series concluded with a presentation and meeting in the offices of the Murrin Bridge Local Aboriginal Land Council (fig. 6). During this meeting, land council members, service providers and preschool staff used the schematic model to identify, outline and discuss the complexities of managing the hub with simultaneous operations between preschool programs, service providers (Centrelink, REDI.E and health), and community events. The meeting was also an opportunity to discuss the steps required to deliver the project, including consultants, funding, procurement, and partnerships. In recent years, the relationship between the preschool and the MBLALC had become strained, resulting from a series of break-ins at the preschool and disputes concerning who was responsible for maintenance as well as rectifying vandalism. The participatory approach to the design of the Murrin Bridge Preschool and Community Hub offered the chance for the preschool and MBLALC to work together towards co-designing and operating a shared facility. The design process provided the opportunity to transform this relationship between organisations, eventuating in reciprocal board representation, the drafting and signing of a new leasing arrangement, and a renewed partnership to deliver the preschool extension and community hub. The unexpected outcome between organisations suggests a form of transformative participation where the role of the “architects as brokers, advocates and agents in the design process” (Fantin) challenges typical architectural design practice. A third example of an unexpected derivative of the workshop series was the emergence of an influential sketch prepared by Uncle Michael Mitchell, preschool educator and parent, of his vision for the preschool and community hub. Mitchell’s sketch depicts a centralised communal courtyard surrounded by a series of multifunctional rooms, each with corresponding segmented gardens (fig. 10). Mitchell’s sketch was prepared independently, in advance of the workshops, and no credit for its production can be claimed by the design researchers. When analysing the design proposal that was submitted for development approval—three pavilions, each with different prescribed programs, assembled around a communal courtyard with segmented gardens—there is an uncanny resemblance to Mitchell’s sketch.  Fig. 10: Uncle Michael Mitchell’s schematic  Fig. 11: Design proposal The drawing appears to have directly influenced the design outcome, suggesting a form of transformative participation and co-authorship where Mitchell was indirectly engaged in the decision-making process. The emergence of the sketch within an intercultural design space aligns with Fantin’s assertion that “the speaking up of Indigenous stakeholders is worthy of noting because Indigenous projects in remote areas of Australia people will often avoid conflict and will not make their individual or group opinion known in an overt way”. Even though the production of this sketch was not facilitated within a formal workshop setting, it provided the opportunity for direct engagement that was presented by the workshop series; it established an intercultural design space where Mitchell felt comfortable to share his vision for the preschool. Conclusion Since undertaking the workshops in Murrin Bridge, the project has progressed so far as receiving development approval from Lachlan Shire Council and capital works funding confirmed from the NSW Department of Education, The National Indigenous Australians Agency, and Multiplex. With construction scheduled to commence by end of 2021 and the foundations of a working relationship between researchers, local residents, and partner organisations firmly set, new capacity-building opportunities for transformative participation are on the horizon. In particular, this is in relation to training and employment initiatives for local community members in the delivery of the Murrin Bridge Preschool extension and establishment of the Community Hub, suggesting an expanded role for architects and researchers as brokers, advocates, and agents challenging conventional architectural design practice. The techniques used within the workshops at Murrin Bridge were underpinned by the adaption of principles derived from Participatory Rural Appraisal, combined with methods inspired by collective narratives drawn from Die Baupiloten’s design of the Taka Tuka Land Kindergarten. Reflecting on these approaches in relation to the artefacts produced within the workshops and their translations into architectural design, the inference that the design process enacted transformative participation was unconvincing. Despite the more tokenistic results with the preschool children, the process did facilitate cross-cultural interaction to produce a culturally responsive landscape strategy, the reparation of strained relationships between community organisations, and the production of an “intermediate, diffused space” (Mudimbe), which enabled the emergence of Mitchell’s sketch that was instrumental in the architectural design outcome.

"2021","The Body, the Threshold, and the Cut: The Aesthetics and the Ethics of Measuring in Interactive Media Art","New media artists working on interactive installations often rely on different monitoring techniques, such as variable sensors in the design and the production of responsive environments and objects. In this short commentary, I will inquire into my installation Mother, Child (2011/2000) to address a new media art practice as productive alignment of agencies at the interface. The term body-sensor co-performance is used to foreground both the performative nature and the fundamental integrity of the technology and the body in interactive art. I will suggest that the setting of threshold values for different measuring operations can be understood as the boundary-making process, through which the installation feeds off the embodied liveliness of its audiences for its responsive actions. Drawing on Karen Barad’s work, these thresholds can be thematized as agential cuts. A number of specific examples in using sensors for interactivity are then addressed in order to inquire into the ways in which the questions of ethics and aesthetics entangle in creative and collaborative labors for Mother, Child.","",""
"2021","The memory of perfection: Digital faces and nostalgic franchise cinema"," This article is concerned with the intersection of digitally augmented performance and nostalgia in contemporary Hollywood franchise cinema. The practice of ‘de-ageing’ or even resurrecting actors following their real-life deaths in films like Tron: Legacy (Joseph Kosinski, 2010), Terminator Genysis (Alan Taylor, 2015), Rogue One (Gareth Edwards, 2016), Blade Runner 2049 (Denis Villeneuve, 2017), Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (J.J. Abrams, 2019), and a large number of Marvel Cinematic Universe films, is now commonplace. Though such digital faces are primarily still found in franchise cinema, some exceptions ( The Irishman, Martin Scorsese, 2019; Gemini Man, Ang Lee, 2019) are telling in their franchise-like appeals to cinematic nostalgia. In particular, the digital face is most commonly aligned with the ‘legacy film’ (Golding, 2019), resurrected franchises interested in transferring franchise protagonists, themes and fandom across generations. The digital face therefore is an expression of the convergence of the digital with film, with the franchise, with the past and with memory. For these films, memory and nostalgia are meticulous exercises involving thousands of work hours of highly skilled CGI workers and cutting-edge technology. These highly technical, virtuosic digital faces are quite literally the face of this kind of nostalgia, and as Ndalianis observes, position the face ‘as façade that opens up a time-travel passageway between past and present’, inviting a seam-spotting game between audience and filmmaker (2014). Even if the digital face is perfect in its recreation, the audience’s knowledge of the impossibility of the performance leaves a trace of artistry. Accordingly, digital faces are creative, technical and financial decisions above all. This article outlines the uses of the digital face for memory, nostalgia and seriality in contemporary Hollywood franchise cinema, with a focus on representation and death. ","",""
"2021","Systems of Choreography: Performing Normal in Public","Building upon facial recognition and other systems of identification, the next generation of biometric technology includes behavior recognition, training AI to analyze and interpret how bodies move in public spaces. Paired with already ubiquitous CCTV cameras, these software systems detect a range of motions—trips, falls, fighting, irregular gait—anything that deviates from the established norm. In this paper, I argue that by criminalizing certain movements, behavior recognition technologies effectively codify a technique, a vocabulary of acceptable and allowable movements, enacting a form of social choreography. Within this choreography, what movements are available to whom? What constitutes normal, and who is afforded or denied such a claim? In the fall of 2019, I undertook a corporeal engagement with these questions through the development of a short video project entitled One True False Move, seeking to disrupt the codes of normalcy and destabilize the surveillant technology’s position as social choreographer. In theorizing a conceptual framework and reflecting upon creative practice, I explore the body as a site of resistance, endowed with the resilient capacity to move in or out of step with systematic codes and counter attempts to be rendered legible.","",""
"2021","Beyond costume tradition and physical computing: characterizing the profile of interactive costume creators","ABSTRACT Interactive costumes enrich performance concepts and means of artistic expression. However, their creation challenges costume designers and technicians because they demand expertise in interaction design and electronic engineering. This article aims at empowering performance professionals to exploit the full potential of interactive costumes by discussing the creation process from the creators’ perspectives. Insights from expert interviews highlight that costume design combined with interaction design underlies the profile of interactive costume designers, whilst costume construction combined with electronic engineering underlies the profile of interactive costume technicians. Together, these profiles are capable of creating interactive costumes if complemented with expertise in e-textiles and body-centred design and development approaches. The findings suggest that teamwork between disciplines is essential, resulting ideally in transcending disciplinarity through shared practices, and using diverse methods, materials, and knowledge. All of this might evoke a paradigm shift in the practice and education of costume creators and other respective professions.","",""
"2021","CRUX: a creativity and user experience model","ABSTRACT The field of Virtual Reality has been developing at a steady pace, and VR is finding new uses as a support for creative tasks. The objective of this study is to propose a theoretical model describing the links between user experience and creativity. Pre-existing theoretical links have been identified in relevant scientific literature. Two experiments were then conducted in order to identify new links and replicate results. These experiments involved respectively 76 and 42 participants who individually performed a task requiring divergent creativity using virtual reality drawing tools. The results indicate that cybersickness leads to a decrease in fluency, i.e. the number of ideas generated, but also shades the links between flow and the relevance of the ideas generated. On the basis of this result, we propose the CRUX model to lead to recommendations for the design of tools and simulations to support divergent creativity.","",""
"2021","A digital distraction? The role of digital tools and distributed intelligence in woodblock printmaking practice","ABSTRACT Artists’ adoption of CNC devices and related technologies is making possible novel printmaking processes and variations on techniques. Such changes suggest a need to broaden our understanding of what constitutes a print under contemporary technological conditions. This article looks at the human-machine relationship and the state of creative cognition in the act of woodblock printmaking. Connections between the printmaker’s and programmer’s notions of creating lines indicate different ways of thinking-drawing space and position the resulting 2D print not just as the transfer of ink from block to paper but also existing as lines of code and as a 3D space. By drawing parallels between the embodied yet distributed act of traditional Japanese woodblock printmaking and the experience of CNC computerized carving in the work of Mike Lyon, I explore how woodblock printmaking might facilitate a productive collaboration with digital carving technologies.","",""
"2021","A framework for interactive artwork based on cultural heritage: focused on the evaluation of artistic value in the artwork ‘deBallution’ prototypes","ABSTRACT This study aimed to propose a framework that promotes immersion, artistic experience, and artistic value in the production of cultural heritage-based interactive artwork. Previous cultural heritage-based artworks failed to adopt symbolic narratives. This study adopts a framework based on a narrative structure to apply symbolism to interactive artwork effectively. It proposed the following five narrative structures to create the abovementioned framework: symbol, mission, activity, change, and artistic embodiment. Two prototypes were created for experimental evaluation to test the effectiveness of the proposed framework in immersion, artistic experience, and artistic value. A comparative experiment of the two prototypes with 80 audience members revealed the framework’s significant effect in terms of artistic value. This study has implications for artists and researchers, as applying the proposed framework will improve the artistic value of their artwork.","",""

"2022","It is like taking a ball for a walk: on boundary work in software development","AbstractIn this paper, we explore how the choices of boundary work in software development influence the team autonomy enacted by team members. Boundary work is when people protect their professional individual autonomy, when they downplay that autonomy to collaborate over professional boundaries, and when they create new boundaries. Team autonomy is here defined as a team using their autonomy to collaborate in deciding their own output. We use an action research design, with varied methodologies carried out through three action cycles. Our findings show that when collective, collaborative boundary work is not performed, a sort of individualized zone occurs where individuals either try to do collaborative boundary work by themselves or seek individual autonomy. We propose that individual autonomy can be divided into professional individual autonomy and situationally dependent individual autonomy. This research contributes theoretically by showing how the absence of collaborative boundary work can lead to an individualized zone. Practically, it can improve team autonomy by enhancing the understanding of why teams should perform collaborative boundary work. The value of the concept of boundary work used in this setting involves studying the intentions for collaboration, not whether collaboration actually takes place.","",""
"2022","Sketching in-vehicle ambient lighting in virtual reality with the Wizard-of-Oz method","ABSTRACT Designers desire to sketch their concepts and produce prototypes in a real-time setting. This study developed a virtual reality (VR) supported lighting sketch tool for vehicle interior designers. The tool incorporated lighting design with drag-and-drop functionality and high-definition vehicle rendering. The tool also used the Wizard-of-Oz method to help design participants easily immerse themselves into the design tasks. Six designers participated in two consecutive hour-long design workshops to evaluate the design tool. Each designer sketched eight scenarios, and the workshop gathered 48 design outcomes. In addition, a thirty-minute post-interview evaluated usability, the immersive experience of the virtual environment, and the expected role of the wizard. Finally, thematic coding was used on both workshop and post-interview verbal records to further evaluate the tool's compatibility. As a result, three vital roles of the tool were identified. First, the tool encouraged the iteration process. The tool also gave realistic design-practice experiences and would be suitable for sketching lighting in the workplace. Finally, the tool allowed designers to immerse themselves in the design space. This research anticipates a well-illustrated virtual context and situations that invite designers into an inspirational lighting design workplace.","",""
"2022","Effects of continuous and discontinuous non-relevant stimulus on creativity","ABSTRACT Innovation is made of different tasks from strategic positioning to the first phases of production. One of the main activities is the generation of ideas through different creativity phases. These creativity activities are carried out in numerous conditions and with different tools having more or less context and interactions. This study focuses on the influence of different non-relevant stimuli composing our environment on cognitive load and creativity. This experiment consists of two creativity tasks which consisted in providing answers to a given question using the visuo-spatial and audio-verbal area, with three stimulus appearance conditions: without, continuous, discontinuous. For the visuo-spatial task, participants have to illustrate their answers using an immersive drawing software. For the audio-verbal task, participants have to answer a question with a simple text editor software. Regarding the drawing task, results indicate that the discontinuous stimulus had decreased the number of ideas per participant. For the writing task, the stimulus had increased the intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load. This study reveals our creativity is under the influence of the different elements of our environment, the tool used and the task.","",""
"2023","The widening rift between aesthetics and ethics in the design of computational things","AbstractIn the face of massively increased technological complexity, it is striking that so many of today’s computational and networked things follow design ideals honed decades ago in a much different context. These strong ideals prescribe a presentation of things as useful tools through design and a withdrawal of aspects of their functionality and complexity. Beginning in the mid-twentieth century, we trace this ‘withdrawal program’ as it has persisted in the face of increasing computational complexity. Currently, design is in a dilemma where computational products can be seen as brilliantly designed and engaging to use yet can also be considered very problematic in how they support hidden agendas and often seem less than trustworthy. In this article, we analyse factors shaping this emergent ethical dilemma and reveal the concept ofa widening riftbetween what computationalthings actually are and doandthe ways in which they are presented as things for use. Against this backdrop, we argue that there is a need for a new orientation in design programs to adequately address this deepening rupture between the aesthetics and ethics in the design of computational things.","",""
"2023","“Through the digits, through the fingers”: Variations on the string figure as imaginary digital medium","This article considers artistic engagements with string figure performance and collection as ‘imaginary’ articulations of digital media. As an object of anthropological inquiry, the string figure emerges in 1888 with a short paper by Franz Boas. Encouraged by more mainstream publications by Caroline Furness Jansen (2008) and Kathleen Haddon (1930), over the course of the 20th century the string figure would become a model through which largely western writers and artists have explored both the anxieties and dreams of ideal, embodied and networked communication technologies. The present article explores, specifically, the collecting projects and films of Harry Smith in the 1960s and 1970s; the video-performance piece of 1974, titled String Games: Improvisations for Inter-City Video, by the interdisciplinary artist Vera Frenkel; and the string figure exhibit at David Wilson’s Museum of Jurassic Technology in Culver City, California. Through a media-archeological lens, the history of string figure fascination takes shape as a repository of dreams about (digital) communication, which, it is additionally suggested in a final section, might yet allow for the expansion and enlargement of conceptions of both digitality and media.","",""

It explores the literature on digital prototyping, open design, and sustainability, analyses student projects through the case study, and discusses the findings in relation to the literature review. In the study, two frameworks are suggested that aim to guide digital prototyping education in the industrial design field. The first framework aims to frame the content, and the second seeks to frame the context for the student projects. The first framework focuses on the relationship between the completeness of the products when they meet the users, the level of users’ design skills, and possible user-intervention types to the product. The second framework focuses on environmental and economic sustainability, considering the benefits and risks of four possible scenarios according to the user-engagement type.","",""
"2024","Technological mediation and 3D visualizations in construction engineering practice","AbstractThe generation and use of 3D images and visualizations through remote sensing, Building Information Modeling, and Augmented Reality technologies, have come to play a significant role in construction engineering practice. Although these technologies are promising, their potential can be misjudged when potential end-users are unaware of key assumptions that were made by developers. Realistic expectations require insights into the ways in which these technologies transform input collected into 3D visualizations and how these visualizations are possibly used on construction sites. This study’s objective is hence to explore the form of technological mediation that the generation and use of 3D images and visualizations provide between a human and objects, or aspects of these objects, that would otherwise be largely imperceptible to professionals in construction practice. We show that algorithms pre- and post-process data through their technological selectivities, which function as mediators. Double mediations of augmented and engaged relationships play a dominant role in the use of 3D images and visualizations and enhance the situational awareness of professionals in construction practice. This is the first study that applies this perspective to increase the understanding of the mediating role of 3D images and visualizations in construction practice.","",""

Participants in an art-science event completed the AESTHEMOS questionnaire on aesthetic emotions and the Multimodal Presence Scale, reporting a wide spectrum of prototypical, pleasant and epistemic emotions. Food enjoyment was correlated with the prototypical aesthetic emotions of fascination and enchantment and feelings of self-presence were correlated with the prototypical emotions of being moved/in awe. Crossmodally matched food was highly congruent with music and visuals. Our findings suggest the relevance of studying environmental aesthetics in the context of these novel eating situations.","",""

A team of researchers collaborated with two professional contemporary music ensembles based in Berlin, Germany, and Piteå, Sweden, and four composers, with the aim of creating a telematic distributed concert taking place simultaneously in two concert halls and online. Central to the project was the development of interactive textiles capable of sensing the musicians’ movements while playing acoustic instruments, and generating data the composers used in their works. Musicians, instruments, textiles, sounds, halls, and data formed a network of entities and agencies that was reconfigured for each piece, showing how networked music practice enables distinctive musicking techniques. We describe each part of the project and report on a research interview conducted with one of the composers for the purpose of analysing the creative approaches she adopted for composing her piece.","",""
