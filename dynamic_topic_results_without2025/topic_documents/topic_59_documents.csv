"2001","Content is not king","Широко известно, что Интернет – это система распространения информации, некого содержания. В то же время, если смотреть исторически, связь сама по себе оказывается более материальным понятием, чем содержание. Даже в Интернете содержание не настолько важно, насколько оно претендует (если это не послание e-mail, содержащее зловредный вирус-убийцу). Главенство связи над содержимым объясняет феномен, который сбил с толку исследователей беспроводных систем: почему с энтузиазмом была воспринята SMS-технология (Short Message System) и весьма прохладно принят протокол WAP (Wireless Application Protocol)? Основываясь на статистических данных, показывающих уровень использования сотовых телефонов, автор показывает, что вводимые 3G-системы также будут первоначально использоваться для речевого общения, а не для доступа в Интернет. В статье подчеркивается мысль, что гигантские суммы, выделяемые на поддержку содержания (контента) расходуются не по назначению.","",""

"2005","Letters to Sarah: analysis of email responses to an online editorial","An editorial opposing the violence being perpetrated on the Palestinians by the Israeli government that was written on the Common Dreams website prompted several hundred email responses to the author. The essay had been reposted to many listservs and other websites around the world. In a case study approach, we track the repostings and qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the responses to that editorial, to determine the nature of the discourse in an electronic environment. The study found that readers of the essay were prompted to write to the author largely when they agreed with her position because of their political or religious views, linked to their own experience or feelings, wished to relate their own personal stories, and when they were male.","",""

"2011","CORRIGENDUM","The Prescription of Peritoneal Dialysis. Semin Dial 21: 250-257, 2008 Page 254, left hand column, third paragraph, the first sentence ‘‘For prescribing the dose of CAPD in patients with known residual renal function, the same Dv ⁄V value, 0.304 (l ⁄24 hours) ⁄ l, should be entered in Eq. (3), but the target Kpt ⁄V ⁄Urea should be 1.70 – renal weekly Kt ⁄VUrea.’’ is in error. The following two sentences should be substituted for this sentence: ‘‘For prescribing the dose of CAPD in patients with known residual renal function, the same D ⁄PUrea value, 0.8, should be entered in Eq. (3), but the targetKpt ⁄VUrea should be 1.70 – renal weekly Kt ⁄VUrea. From Eq. (3), the target Dv ⁄V decreases by 0.018 (l ⁄24 hours) ⁄ l for 0.1 increase in renal weeklyKt ⁄VUrea.’’","",""

"2013","CORRIGENDUM","Novel synaptobrevin-1 mutation causes fatal congenital myasthenic syndrome. Volume 4. Issue 2, pp 130 and pp 133. https://doi.org/10.1002/acn3.387 Errors were identified in the Abstract (pp 130) and in the Mutation analysis section (pp 133) of the published article. The mutation in isoform D of SYB1p.Ser114ValfsTer32 should be pSer114ValfsTer34. The mutation elongates the intravesicular C-terminus of the D isoform from 4 to 33 residues rather than from 4 to 31 residues. In the Abstract, the sentence should read, “The identified mutation elongates the intravesicular C-terminus of the A isoform from 5 to 71, and of the D isoform from 4 to 33 residues.” The authors apologize for this error.","",""
