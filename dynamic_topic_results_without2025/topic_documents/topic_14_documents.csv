"2000","Approaches to Analysing the Web Text"," This paper challenges the dominance of concepts of hypertextuality as the foundation for the analysis of web texts. Instead it argues that web texts cannot be understood without reference to their specific contexts of production and consumption. As part of the construction of an alternative to existing analytical approaches to the web text contemporary practice in web design is surveyed, as are its relations with the culture of particular groups of producers. Drawing on an interdisciplinary framework allied to the field of British media and cultural studies, this paper suggests how the analysis of the web site might be approached in terms of its status as an emergent media/cultural form. It discusses how such forms might be understood in terms of the shared social conventions which inflect their production. It argues that web sites can neither be analysed in terms of generic hypertext or as a homogeneous genre and that rather the formation of groupings of sites in line with the ideologies, values and preoccupations of their producers require concrete analysis together with further research into specific practices of 'reading' web texts.

This piece is going to explore a few ideas borrowed from the analytical psychology of C. G. Jung to see if adopting the perspective of a depth psychology can shed any light on what appears to be some of the more puzzling and intriguing elements of the web. For example why do users readily assume other identities (often of the opposite sex)? On one hand we welcome the net as providing new sources of information and unparalleled opportunities for communication. While at the same time we are afraid of its dark corners, of its power to corrupt through the easy access it provides to extreme types of pornography and the dissemination of information that is socially subversive.","",""

"2000","National Borders on the World Wide Web"," The internet is often seen as a significant contributor to the globalization of culture and the economy. It is also seen as an inherently international medium, unimpeded by national borders and removed from the jurisdiction of the nation-state. This paper argues that although geographic borders may be removed from cyberspace, the social structures found in the `real' world are inscribed in online networks. By surveying 4000 web sites, it is determined that the organization of the world wide web conforms to some degree to traditional national borders. Web sites are, in most cases more likely to link to another site hosted in the same country than to cross national borders. When they do cross national borders, they are more likely to lead to pages hosted in the United States than to pages anywhere else in the world. ","",""

"2000","No More Cybertarians, Please—More Citizens, Thank You","Who invented the internet? When he’s not busy claiming the status of a role model for Love Story, Al Gore sometimes includes this achievement in his curriculum vitae. He is not alone; chain bookstores feature memoirs by all manner of men making similar assertions. The truth is out there, however. Because while Al, his girlfriend Tipper, and his roommate Tommy Lee Jones were padding around Ivy-League dorms during late-night ice-cream feasts, the RAND Corporation was busily devising means of waging the Vietnam War. Its consultancy services did not end there, of course. Our friends over at the corporation also addressed the following question: What if the Soviet Union managed to strike at the heart of the domestic U.S. communications system? Asuccessful attack would leave the country disabled, unless a devolved network could be introduced. The packet system of today originated with that desire to decentralize computing through nodal, semiautonomous sites. In keeping with those origins—state-driven Cold War consultancies—the internet, as we all know, grew nested within public institutions of government and education, and the associated warfarewelfare para-bureaucracy of publicly funded but ostensibly independent research by private universities and firms. How, then, did cybertarianism emerge as an origin myth? And what is it?","",""

Methodological issues in utilizing this survey are discussed to ensure the significance of findings is understood and to identify key methodological problems in a new field of research. Two particular problems are identified; the need to define user per computer host ratios and to identify the national origin of computers with international domain names. Statistics are presented from the five Internet Domain Surveys from January 1998 to January 2000 in the following categories: overall size, regional distribution, human development and economic distribution, linguistic distribution and user numbers. The conclusion is reached that even as the Internet is growing in all regions world-wide it remains concentrated in the highly developed nations. Some consideration of the implications of this for wider debates around the Internet is given.","",""

It presents the primarily optimistic expectations for what was then a 'new technology' created by merging the television, telephone, and the computer. In the USA, videotex is often perceived as a major market failure that should have been easy to foresee. However, success was constrained by the centralised-services architecture and applications of the time, and by undue belief in the revolutionary potential of the technology. A decentralised approach, both in technology and in applications, enabled the success of the World Wide Web - and proved many early predictors to be prescient about applications that would be popular on an interactive network.

It documents the contribution of automatic digital computing by Charles Babbage in 1833; logician George Boole's concept of digital computer circuit design in the 1850s; Herman Hollerith's punch cards of the 1890s; Alan Turing's conceptual computing of the 1930s; and Vannevar Bush's 1945 vision of modern computing and 'Memex', the theoretical precursor of hypertext. Guided by actor-network theory and diffusion of innovation theory, this paper concludes that innovations are influenced by needs and effects of the age, the power of the printed word and the evolutionary process of diffusion are inevitable aspects of adoption and diffusion of new technologies, and 'lead users' and dominant technological designs shape media technologies.

A bio-evolutionary element frequently accompanies such techno-determinist rhetoric: the social transformation associated with the internet is a natural process and a force of human progress. In this autonomous-evolutionary understanding, debate about the role of the internet in society is largely irrelevant. Governments, industries, organisations, and citizens are simply advised to connect up to and keep up with the rapidly changing techno-sphere. Failing to adopt and adapt to the internet’s evolution will mean falling behind, or being left completely out of, the unfolding information society. Internet research and academic commentary sometimes resembles this techno-determinist rhetoric. Cyberspace is believed to bring about such radical changes to social relations that any previously useful concepts and under-standings are rendered obsolete. New tools of analysis and ways of thinking are needed.

The Internet can improve our capability to understand the science of environmental degradation and communicate that knowledge to public and private decision makers. It can also improve environmental policy by increasing international equity and participation in the policy development processes. Finally, it can help decrease resource waste and associated pollution by improving the efficiency economic activity. The exploitation of these fundamental opportunities is not predestined however, and will require an ongoing elaboration of the Internet's role in global environmental sustainability.","",""

It argues that the act of driving Internet traffic to an Internet server is an act of distribution and that costs associated with it are actually software production and distribution costs. It suggests a generalized model, the Internet distribution chain, using which the variable and marginal cost of production and distribution can be revealed. Using this model the paper will show that marginal costs associated with the production and distribution of software actually resemble those of traditional products.","",""

Central to this process are the argumentation patterns used in this research which were defined with regard to a qualitative analysis of the multimedia discourse. Results of a quantitative content analysis of German news magazine coverage (1995-8) indicate that these media had a strong tendency towards a favorable assessment of the internet. The euphoric and economically optimistic argumentation patterns were most important, and outcomes of the development were evaluated as supporting the emancipation of the individual.

"2004","Critical Literacy in a Digital Era: Technology, Rhetoric, and the Public Interest, by Barbara Warnick. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2002. xi + 146 pp. $39.95 cloth. $18.00 paperback. ISBN 0-805-84115-6.","Barbara Warnick, a well-known scholar in rhetoric and communication who has of late begun applying her skills in rhetorical theory to the Internet, takes a broad look at the Internet in this book, beginning with Wired and moving into online discourse (women online; political parody). In performing such criticism, Warnick invites readers to look at the narratives and messages behind the facade of mainstream presentation; by using rhetorical theory in specific, she invites us to see all technology discourse as persuasive. For example, her critique suggests that Wired is gender and racially biased and that the magazine is undergirded with an ideology of techno-libertarianism. These features are not neutral, and they present the technology in a way that the author suggests we might challenge (or at least be aware of). In this way, Warnick has written a book that performs two tasks: It updates rhetorical theory by illustrating how rhetoric as a discipline must consider technology in its realm of artifacts for criticism, and it updates Internet studies by portraying all discourse about the Internet as persuasive (and to consider what particular message is being pushed, and by whom). Thus, the book has two general audiences. The first is those in rhetorical theory who should be persuaded by this book (if they have not been already) that Internet discourse is an important area of study. The second audience would be more akin to readers of this journal: those looking at the Internet and its social, ethical, and political implications. The book begins with an introductory chapter that makes Warnick’s case for the use of rhetoric to understand the Internet. In particular, she argues that by understanding digital discourse and its motives, we can become more literate in a critical fashion: “Critical literacy,” she tells us, “in part means communicating about communication. It includes the capacity to look beneath the surface of the discourse” (p. 6). Citing other work in digital literacy, including this reviewer’s Cyberliteracy and Kathleen Tyner’s Literacy in a Digital World, Warnick makes the case for her method (rhetorical criticism) and the artifacts that she will critique. Like Kathleen Welch’s Electric Rhetoric, Warnick notes that a rhetorical approach will help us understand the “beliefs, values, and assumptions” (p. 14) written into texts, web pages, and other digital artifacts. Specifically, the next three chapters take a case-based approach, analyzing artifacts from our digital age. In Chapter One, Warnick examines the “new frontier” (her quotations) by examining the “new libertarianism” (p. 23) presented in Wired magazine through its structure, style, motives, and other rhetorical features. Of the many interesting findings in this chapter, Warnick notes that despite all the hype about the Internet and egalitarianism, the magazine’s main model of argument is based on the “young entrepreneur,” a white male under 30 years old (p. 42). In a counting of images, she discovers (is anyone surprised?) that 71% of the people presented in the magazine are white men. This chapter ends with several examples that show that Wired might, just might, be addressing its narrow scope and lack of inclusiveness. Yet in Chapter Two, we see that perhaps this inclusive future, when it comes to gender, might mean nothing more than “masculinizing the feminine” (p. 63). The chapter’s main argument is that invitational rhetoric, that is, rhetoric that invites women to be online, by and large only serves to reinforce traditional male-techno values about what women should do. Through her critique, Warnick argues that mainstream Web sites “constructed an ‘ideal’ type of woman—one who was career oriented, opportunistic, and prepared to take risks and try new things. . . . By praising tech-savvy values and lifestyles and by upbraiding women who had other priorities . . . this invitational","",""

This paper will consider what this older, modernist perspective can contribute to a postmodern social history of the Internet in Western Australia.

"2004","The Numbers That Count","The first volume of new media & society in spring 1999 contained just 13 statistics, seven of which directly related to the internet and six of which were on other subjects. At the moment that the journal left the printer’s, the internet metrics banquet was just beginning. The intervening years produced a smorgasbord of figures that did as much to confuse and distract those examining life online as they did to provide enlightenment. First, at the time of the first issue of new media & society, many Americans probably thought that they knew a couple of things about the online world, based on the most widely-reported survey figures and online traffic measurements. Some were right, others were wrong or wrongly understood. The first thing they probably knew was that the American online population was growing smartly. The US Department of Commerce (1998b) reported that in 1994, 11 percent of US households had modems; in 1997, 26 percent had them; and by late 1998, this figure had risen to 33 percent. Subsequent reports from the US Department of Commerce (1999, 2000) and proprietary research firms showed the growth continuing into the new decade. In January 2000, Nielsen/NetRatings reported that the number of those with access to the internet had increased by 22.7 percent during 1999 to 119 million Americans (Nielsen/NetRatings, 2000). In February 2001, Nielsen/NetRatings reported that 169 million Americans had access to the internet from either home or work (Nielsen/NetRatings, 2001). Second, interested and engaged Americans probably knew that online traffic was growing briskly, yet a key ‘fact’ in wide circulation in April 1999 was disastrously out of date. The US Department of Commerce uncritically cited, in its ‘Emerging Digital Economy’ (1998a), the assertion of scientists at WorldCom’s UUNET (Unix to Unix Network) division that internet traffic ‘doubles every 100 days’ – or grows at a clip of 1000 percent a year.

Subsequent structures and practices function ideologically to control organizational members in a concertive fashion by shaping and directing the conceptual frameworks for inquiry and action in a seemingly natural way. Definitions and metaphors construct conceptual boundaries of meaning for the field of inquiry, delimiting and protecting over time what counts as Internet and Internet studies. Over time, origins of knowledge are hidden within the structure of the organizations and a culture of unobtrusive control emerges. Unless radical measures are taken to reflexively interrogate everyday routines and habitual ways of talking in academic environments, the future field of Internet studies will not transcend the traditions of the academy but will be entrenched in and reproduce traditional structures and a traditional scholarly enterprise.","",""

The Internet was thought of as a novelty of sorts and was frequently referred to as the “Information Superhighway”, a term that sounds somewhat campy today. Furthermore, the “Internet” had to be defined and described in the paper because many readers were not familiar with what the Internet actually was. As far as I am aware, this was the first published paper that addressed the topic of taxation of internet commerce.  It was truly a new frontier. The paper likened the Internet to the Silk Roads of China and coined the phrase, “The New Silk Road” to describe the Internet not as merely a new communications tool, but a new channel for the exchange of a new commodity - information.  With Internet Commerce at its infancy there were real questions looming as to whether it would take hold as a viable “trade route” and become a fixture in the marketplace, and if so, ‘who would regulate it’, if it was possible to regulate it at all. The paper envisioned the displacement of traditional means of payment in favour of “digital cash”, however this prediction proved to be inaccurate. Credit cards continue to be the most common means of paying for goods and services on the Internet, and traditional banks are now also participating through direct withdrawals from bank accounts.   At the time, it appeared that the Internet was “ungovernable”, and accordingly traditional taxation would be impossible to enforce. At the time, there was serious discussion of a “bit tax” or an “access tax”. As it turned out, this form of taxation never took hold, in part helped by the passing of an Internet Tax Moratorium by the U.S. Congress in 1998.  Traditional bricks and mortar business together with virtual businesses have tended to model themselves on the mail-order business, with taxes being levied on purchasers who reside in the same state or province as the seller, but additional forms of taxation targeted at Internet Commerce alone have not been enacted. Nevertheless, import duties have of course been avoided completely for intangible consumer products such as software and music files.  Some businesses however, primarily online casinos, have located themselves in tax haven jurisdictions and have accordingly avoided corporate taxes. For example, corporations located on-shore that are involved in the internet casino business have structured their affairs so that they reap revenues not from wagers, but from licensing fees and software development.  Residency of individuals for income tax purposes has not been significantly affected by the advent of Internet Commerce. Whereas the paper envisioned residency becoming “meaningless” on the Internet, traditional understandings of the residency of individuals for tax purposes has remained largely intact. Likewise, the location that a web site is hosted at is largely ignored when determining residency of an Internet-based business.  The advent of the Internet has affected the way many business structure their affairs and has caused certain “losses” of “traditional” taxation revenue, but the Internet apparently has not caused a wholesale revision to traditional principles of and approaches to traditional taxation. Reluctance to enact new “Internet taxes” combined with practical obstacles to collection of taxes on inter-jurisdictional internet commerce has allowed the Internet to flourish as a viable new trade route.  This paper analyzes how commerce and banking will be affected by the Internet, with particular attention to existing international frameworks for taxation. Domestic tax laws are shown to be unable to adequately control the emergence of a """"new international trade route"""". Individual and Corporate Residency laws, Tax Avoidance and Evasion, Laundering, Crossborder-Shopping, and the Transfer of Technology will be discussed in relation to taxation laws, particularly the United States' and Canada's.","",""

"2005","Ekstasis and the internet: liminality and computer-mediated communication"," Anthropologist Victor Turner suggested that all social worlds are composed of two parallel, yet seemingly contrasting models: society as social structure and society as communitas. The relationships between these two basic elements of human social and cultural life are mediated by ephemeral experiences of liminality. Other major theoretical traditions also recognize these relationships, representing a distinct conceptual framework of direct significance to advancing understandings of the internet. The internet is a natural environment for liminality and ekstasis, a place where self and society must be made to exist in a process where both are translated into the conventions of the medium. Some people actively toy with these representations while others do not. However, in the final analysis these communicative dynamics are rooted in the liminal characteristics of the medium - not the motivations and intents of internet users themselves. Approaching the internet in this way stands in stark contrast to other latent conceptual orientations that are largely concerned with moral dynamics. ","",""
"2005","Historical pragmatism and the internet"," This article argues that the literature describing the internet revolution in the 1990s was characterized by the rhetoric of the technological sublime. This rhetoric suffered from three fatal flaws: (1) it was not sufficiently grounded in the historical development of technology; (2) it viewed the internet in isolation, failing to consider the wider technological context; and (3) it failed to examine the internet in view of the social, economic, religious and political circumstances of its users. Several examples from history are cited, demonstrating that changes in various systems for the production, dissemination and preservation of cultural information both border and deborder the world. The article suggests that if internet researchers take a pragmatic, historically grounded approach, they will discover that the introduction of internet technology can be seen to have similar consequences. While the technology overcomes many boundaries (of space and time, politics and economics), other social borders may be created at the same time. It is easier to see old boundaries coming down than to see new ones being erected. Rather than being swept by utopian or dystopian enthusiasms, the article insists that the really interesting discoveries are to be made in locating the subtle social shifts taking place, relatively unnoticed, as a consequence of technological change.

Uncertainty reduction theory and predicted outcome value theory are used to contextualize individuals' motivations and behaviors in the risky and uncertain environment of online consumer-to-consumer (C2C) auctions. Data from 6477 randomly-selected auctions conducted over eBay.com indicate that more commodity information leads to more, and higher, final bids; higher seller reputation results in fewer bids for less money; and greater system security features result in fewer bids. Additionally, holding item type constant, much more variance in final bid price and bid activity can be explained by these factors as item value increases, although important differences in the direction of relations emerge as well. Based on these findings, current theoretical perspectives on uncertainty reduction are extended to the environment of computer-mediated communication and interpretations are offered to explain individuals' behaviors in initial encounters in online auctions.

"2008","“The WarGames Scenario”"," WarGames (1983), the first mass-consumed, visual representation of the internet, served as both a vehicle and framework for America's earliest discussion of the internet. WarGames presented the internet simultaneously as a high-tech toy for teenagers and a weapon for global destruction. In its wake, major news media focused on potential realities of the “ WarGames Scenario.” In response, Congress held hearings, screened WarGames, and produced the first internet-regulating legislation. WarGames engaged a “teenaged technology” discourse, which cast both internet technology itself and its users as rebellious teenagers in need of parental control. This discourse enabled policy makers to equate government internet regulation with parental guidance rather than with suppression of democracy and innovation, a crucial distinction within 1980s cold war context. Thus, this article historicizes the internet as a cultural text, examining how technology and its regulation shaped and were shaped by cultural representations. ","",""

Souvent percu comme outil de gestion, l'inventaire patrimonial offre une structure a laquelle on peut greffer des informations historiques, architecturales, toponymiques, archeologiques et biographiques. Malgre l'importance des caracteristiques architecturales dans la composition d'un inventaire, les historiens, meme dans les domaines de l'histoire sociale, economique et culturelle, ont un role a jouer pour etablir l'importance patrimoniale de certains elements et pour y associer des donnees contextuelles qui permettront au public de mieux comprendre ce patrimoine.

The digitisation of heritage inventories and their publication on the Web offer an opportunity to renew the relationship between history and the public. As evidence of the past, as vectors of cultural identity or as traces of different historical themes, components of the built heritage and of historical places provide an effective means of reaching the public since they can be presented under different formats. Often perceived as a management tool, the heritage inventory offers an structure to which we can attach historical, architectural, toponymic, archaeological and biographical information. Despite the importance of architectural features when creating an inventory, historians, even in the fields of social, economic and cultural history, have a role in defining the importance of the elements and in providing contextual data which will help the public better understand this heritage.  The distribution of inventories through the Web has made it possible to better understand heritage and to reach different audiences. Methodologies differ from project to project according to the designers' objectives, but we can identify best practices through which some successful projects stand out. Nevertheless, being on the Internet cannot in itself prevent fossilisation. Already, some innovative projects provide paths which digital inventories can use to follow technological developments, maintain their relevance as reference tools, and reach new audiences.","",""
"2009","“Fawcett”: A Toolkit to Begin an Historical Semantic Web","The Web of 2009 tantalizes the user who approaches it with an interest in history. Hughes’ and Greengrass’ recently-published Virtual Representation of the Past makes clear the variety of newly developed resources that are available. Nevertheless, the ever-increasing array of historical source material, archival records, inscriptions and reports now published on the Web, including online topic-based websites and online journals, are all too often just beyond the grasp of the non-specialist scholar. Even today, professional historical research on the Web is dependent on the researcher knowing the right websites ahead of time, not on simple queries of the Web as a whole. Some component of this global information network should be capable of supporting a query searching for all online historical evidence relating to a given time and place. For instance, it should be possible to enter the query “1767 AD” to bring the user in contact with the newspaper transcriptions from that year provided by Costa’s Geography of Slavery, with the pertinent proceedings of the Old Bailey courthouse in London published online by Emsley et al. (2009), and with the large number of remaining online sources associated with that year. It should be possible to receive highly relevant results from such queries instead of the largely irrelevant results often generated by a Google search. Such a service would, moreover, make online historical research more useful and more pertinent to the interested layperson. Imagine, for instance, a family visiting Brittany to trace their family roots. What texts, artefacts and scholarly discussions exist, they might ask, that pertain to Brittany at the time when their ancestors came to the North America? The online summaries of a local tourist bureau or Wikipedia articles are unlikely to suffice, but if the online digital contributions of local and national museums and archives were made available, such a family could more effectively plan their personal historical journey of discovery.","",""

Drawing on Burke’s notion of human beings as ‘wordlings’, I argue for the centrality of well-crafted words, especially on the internet, and offer examples of language crafted with care and passion, leading to distilled and vivid expression. I use the term ‘word bytes’ for such language, as it can cut through the multiple items of information from many other media by which it is surrounded, and demand to be noticed and remembered. I conclude we do not have to accept the impoverished form of ‘managerial’ English, often produced by elites and used to justify the ‘financialisation’ of the late capitalist world. We can begin to counter it by our own practices of using words with care and passion, and by disseminating our words. We can also stop and question ‘weasel’ language wherever we encounter it.","",""

Its goal of social connection inspired other networked arts, which eventually found a place among digital technology users.

As all transformative technologies, it leaves a stamp on society, social action and values. This is actually a case of the Internet and society mutually constructing each other. Therefore, as the Internet is in constant transformation, social values rebound and impact on further development. This paper is concerned with systems of values grouped around core ideas, here described as ideologies, which continuously renegotiates the development of the Internet. Three basic ideas are identified as underpinning the development of the packet switching system during the 1960s. It is argued that the historical development of the ARPANET, the Internet and the World Wide Web, as well as current developments, are all variations of these three ideas: the distributed network, the envelope and the identifier. It is maintained that these are translated into value systems, ideologies, held by different social groups. These three ideologies are conceptualised as speedism, boxism and markism. These are discussed in relation to various trends in past and current development of the Internet.

The notion of technical code — the cultural and social assumptions and values that become manifest in a technology’s physical and structural forms — is invoked to examine design characteristics of the internet that, in turn, reflect and provide opportunities for important social outcomes. Overall, the internet’s technical design supports interoperability and open access, while suggesting an enormous capacity for personalization and innovation. In turn, these technical features support the emergence of myriad collective social activities, resulting in a sense of individual empowerment achieved through enhanced agency. Significant countervailing forces, however, inhibit this potential. By examining the values, priorities, and assumptions that have become built into the internet, both technically and socially, the present analysis clarifies this tension and serves to frame the internet’s potential at this critical time in its evolution.

As objects become individually tagged with unique identities through the addition of small electronic chips or bar codes, their history is recorded and made available to others across a network. The advent of this ever-growing catalogue of histories means that every object will be ‘in touch’ with its current and previous owner at all times and suggests that while we as owners might like to ‘forget’ about an object, we will never truly be detached from them. However the author suggests that there exists a social and cultural inertia that is tied to a teleological perception of time and that the weight of this is hampering opportunities for the Internet of Things to embrace old things. The paper uses a series of cultural coordinates to explore our relationship with personal and social histories including the use of cosmetic surgery to correct hereditary characteristics and films from the last five years that demonstrate a more creative approach to understanding the past. Ultimately the author uses a research project that he is involved in to explore the potential for digital technology to network the past and develop an ‘Internet of Old Things’.","",""

"2012","Thomas Streeter, The Net Effect: Romanticism, Capitalism, and The Internet","Central to Thomas Streeter’s arguments is that the development of the Internet in the United States since the 1960s has largely been shaped by the social imagination of the technology at the individual and institutional levels. By crafting a critical genealogy of the Internet in the United States, Streeter’s The Net Effect not only serves as an intervention into U.S. historiography of the Internet but also as a critique of the technological determinism that has dominated new-media studies. Recognizing how discourses of the Internet have directed the creation and use of the technology, Streeter invites us to look specifically at the consequences of two dominant paradigms in the field of study: the utilitarian and control paradigm, and the expressive and identity paradigm.","",""
"2012","SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH METHODS IN INTERNET TIME","This article discusses three interrelated challenges related to conducting social science research in ‘Internet Time’. (1) The rate at which the Internet is both diffusing through society and developing new capacities is unprecedented. It creates some novel challenges for scholarly research. (2) Many of our most robust research methods are based upon ceteris paribus assumptions that do not hold in the online environment. The rate of change online narrows the range of questions that can be answered using traditional tools. Meanwhile, (3) new research methods are untested and often rely upon data sources that are incomplete and systematically flawed. The paper details these challenges, then proposes that scholars embrace the values of transparency and kludginess in order to answer important research questions in a rapidly-changing communications environment.","",""
"2012","A DECADE IN INTERNET TIME","This introductory article provides a critical assessment of the last decade of social research on the Internet and identifies directions for research over the next. Ten years is only a moment in the span of social research, but aeons in Internet time. Has social research across the disciplines been up to the challenges? Over more than 40 years, the unfolding development of the Internet and related information and communication technologies has been one of the most dynamic areas of technological and social innovation worldwide. In the first decade of the twenty-first century, its development was even more dramatic. While innovations in such areas as search, social media, big data, and the commercialization of the Internet became prominent only over the last decade, they are already taken for granted by most Internet users. It is becoming increasingly apparent to us that this interdisciplinary field must broaden even further to better connect with fields beyond the social sciences and information, communication, media and cultural studies to include stronger collaborative ties to law, ethics, and the sciences, engineering, and computer sciences, but also across the arts and humanities. This will be an almost certain requirement for interdisciplinary research over the coming decade with technology and society moving at Internet time.","",""

"2013","Karl Marx @ Internet Studies"," The task of this paper is to point out the relevance of Karl Marx for Internet Studies. Marxian concepts that have been reflected implicitly or explicitly in Internet Studies include: (1) dialectics; (2) capitalism; (3) commodity/commodification; (4) surplus value, exploitation, alienation, class; (5) globalization; (6) ideology/ideology critique; (7) art and aesthetics; (8) class struggle; (9) commons; (10) public sphere; (11) communism. The paper provides a literature overview for showing that, and how, Marxian concepts have been used in Internet Studies. Internet Studies to a certain extent analyse the Internet, economy and society in Marxist-inspired studies terms, yet do not acknowledge the connection to Marx and thus seem superficial in their various approaches discussing capitalism, exploitation and domination. We argue that it is time to actively remember that Marx is the founding figure of Critical Studies and that Marxian analyses are crucial for understanding the contemporary role of the Internet and the media in society.

Such a discourse enables the telling of a ‘history’ of the internet which involves a complex interweaving of past, present and future, as represented by the additional versions which the introduction of Web 2.0 enabled. The paper concludes that the discourse of versions embodied in Web 2.0 obscures as much as it reveals, and suggests a new project based on investigations of the everyday memories of the internet by which individual users create their own histories of online technology.

This paper investigates how hyperlinks have been used as research objects in social sciences. Reviewing a body of literature belonging to sociology, political sciences, information sciences, geography or media studies, it particularly reflects on the study of hyperlinks as indicators of other social phenomena. Why are links counted and hyperlink networks measured? How are links interpreted? The paper then focuses on barriers and limitations to the study of links. It addresses the issue of unobtrusiveness, the importance of interpreting links in context, and the possibilities of large-scale, automatic link studies. We finally argue that beyond the apparent diversity and ad hoc methodologies that the reviewed studies propose, a unified framework exists. It combines quantitative link counts, qualitative inquiries and valuation of field expertise to support link interpretation. ","",""
"2013","Mapping the landscape of Internet Studies: Text mining of social science journal articles 2000–2009"," What does ‘Internet studies’ entail as a field of social science research? We aim to answer the question by mapping research themes, theorization, and methodology of Internet studies based on 27,000+ articles published in Social Sciences Citation Index and Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index journals over the last 10 years. In analyzing the articles, we adopt a ‘bottom-up’ approach – classifying keywords of the Internet studies without any a priori categorization – to identify the boundaries, major divisions, and basic elements of the field talis qualis. The research strategy results in a number of expected, as well as surprising, patterns and trends. Internet studies have evolved into a viable field that has witnessed a booming decade. The field is clustered around four primary research themes: e-Health, e-Business, e-Society, and Human–Technology Interactions. Two or three sub-themes with different research foci and methodologies emerge within each theme. The evolution of popular keywords in each sub-theme further shows that the field has become more concerned with intricate relationships between Internet use and specific behaviors/attitudes/effects; Internet usage patterns have increasingly attracted research attention; and network perspectives and approaches have become popular. Internet studies in the past decade have been modestly theorized. Established research methods (e.g., survey, experiment, and content analysis) still prevail in the Internet studies reviewed. ","",""
"2013","Internet Studies: Perspectives on a rapidly developing field","The genealogy of this special issue begins in the fall of 2009, with a panel organized by Mia Consalvo and Charles Ess for the annual conference of the Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR) held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on 8 October. The panel was constituted by a selected set of contributors to The Handbook of Internet Studies (Consalvo and Ess, 2011). The presentations and ensuing discussion, joined by contributors to another synthesis effort (Hunsinger et al., 2010), focused on the contours of Internet Studies as an emerging field. The panel inspired Bill Dutton – then working on The Oxford Handbook of Internet Studies (Dutton, 2013) – to propose a workshop for the following spring. Its purpose was to build on the work launched by the handbooks to capture key patterns in the development of this rapidly developing field. The immediate upshot was a productive and enjoyable workshop co-sponsored by the Oxford Internet Institute and the Information and Media Studies Department of Aarhus University, held at Aarhus University on 19 March 2010. Following the workshop, the editors of New Media and Society, Steve Jones and Nick Jankowski, agreed with our proposal to build on the momentum of this workshop with an open call for papers that would be published in a special issue of the journal as one more step in support of an array of efforts to catalyze discussion of the state of the art of this developing field. The primary goals of our special issue were, first, to articulate significant bodies of findings and begin to identify an evolving set of constitutive domains within the field. Secondly, with these as primary starting points, both our contributors and we, as editors, sought to identify developing trajectories of future research. We intended to demarcate areas of likely importance, while not prematurely defining and thus closing off what is manifestly an expanding and changing field of Internet Studies. What do the articles reviewed and selected for this special issue say about the development of Internet Studies? We begin to answer this question with an overview of the contributions to the special issue, noting along the way a few selected cross-references to both the articles collected here as well as the larger relevant literatures. We close with a more general account of what we have learned about this evolving field from this special issue in light of work on our respective handbooks. 462845 NMS15510.1177/1461444812462845new media & societyEditorial 2013","",""

Misunderstanding here has to do not with getting it wrong, but with not seeing the whole picture. It springs from ignoring if and how issues such as policy and regulation, market dynamics, social movements and consumption patterns shape, limit or enhance the internet’s transformative potential. And it is in addressing this third level of misunderstanding that the authors are most successful. Through their engagement with existing literature on the internet, and their use of current examples, the authors provide a more nuanced and complex view of the different facets of the internet than is commonly offered. In fact, the book gains in interest as it gets further away from the idea of showing that the internet has been misunderstood and becomes less of a disputation and more of a description of the complex contextual factors that define the current state of the internet. In this sense, the book may have been better served with the title Contextualizing the Internet than with the one printed on its cover.","",""

"2014","<i>(Re)Inventing the Internet: Critical Case Studies</i>, edited by Andrew Feenberg and Norm Friesen. Rotterdam, The Netherlands: Sense Publishers, 2012. 146 pp. $43.00 paper. ISBN 9789460917325 (paper).","Given the push in academia toward disciplinary specialization rather than interdisciplinarity, it can be difficult to find a common vocabulary or framework within which to discuss the many different forms of social and political agency that occur with the Internet. Drawing upon the work of Andrew Feenberg, (Re)Inventing the Internet serves as a short, crisp, and enlightening introduction to what is termed critical theories of technology (CTS). Feenberg argues that CTS differ from social studies of science and technology (STS) because it sees “technological worlds as terrains of struggle on which hegemonic forces express themselves through specific design strategies in opposition to subordinate groups that are more or less successful in influencing the future form of the artifacts with which they are engaged” (3–4). The politically conscious vocabulary that Feenberg has developed is most useful for those within the information sciences who seek orientation to critical thinking about technology. Consequently, the use of the phrase “hegemonic forces” immediately alerts the reader that the book’s perspective has a long pedigree, and while there is no detailed homage to the 19th and 20th centuries, including Gramsci (Jones 2006), the book’s radical intellectual orientation is clear because Feenberg was a student of Herbert Marcuse. Habermas, another product of the Frankfurt School, is also often invoked and other important names arise, including Lukacs, Bourdieu, Lyotard, and Mouffe. However, while providing an essentially fatalistic view of technology this book does not entirely despair. What Feenberg and others do in this book is argue that the capacity to manipulate and move outside the controls of the technology is possible, particularly because of the inbuilt anarchy of the technology itself. The Internet, as a post-modern phenomenon, is “radically incomplete” (vii) because of its interpretive flexibility, and thus there is much more capacity to engage in resistance, though not at all times or in all places. In chapter 2, Sarah Grimes and Feenberg take on a critical theory of digital gaming, drawing on ludification theory. The commodification of games is an increasingly important feature of industrialized life, whether in the professionalization of sports, or online activity, or even work itself. As I was finishing this review, I received an e-mail concerning the application of “gamification” (sic) to retirement planning. Thus, the commodification and monetization of online games (virtual exchange and creation, virtual currencies, and so on) collapses the distinction between work and leisure, while games such as World of Warcraft, like many fetishized objects, still play (!) with illusions of real freedom. As Grimes and Feenberg note, “Gameplay is thus reducible to a series of variables, selections drawn from an immense but nonetheless finite number of possible options, expressed in the rudimentary language of computer code” (35). Marcuse’s fear of benign incorporation and domination by larger forces of capital or state control continues in this sphere that has massive global influence (Marcuse 1968). In chapter 3, Edward Hamilton and Feenberg take on the question of educational technology as a fait accompli in universities through an investigation of the rise of technological determinism as a response to budgetary cuts and a desire to expand the educational market as an industrial process. Computer-aided instruction (CAI) was not a result of programming code, but rather contingent upon the pedagogical and administrative decisions in the industrialized university. The role of the teacher has been cut out in favor of that of the technical expert, raising fears going back to Plato in the Phaedrus. The pedagogical","",""

"2015","Big Web data, small focus: An ethnosemiotic approach to culturally themed selective Web archiving"," This paper proposes a multimodal ethnosemiotic conceptual framework for culturally themed selective Web archiving, taking as a practical example the curation of the London French Special Collection (LFSC) in the UK Web Archive. Its focus on a particular ‘community’ is presented as advantageous in overcoming the sheer scale of data available on the Web; yet, it is argued that these ethnographic boundaries may be flawed if they do not map onto the collective self-perception of the London French. The approach establishes several theoretical meeting points between Pierre Bourdieu’s ethnography and Gunther Kress’s multimodal social semiotics, notably, the foregrounding of practice and the meaning-making potentialities of the everyday; the implications of language and categorisation; the interplay between (curating/researcher) subject and (curated/research) object; evolving notions of agency, authorship and audience; together with social engagement, and the archive as dynamic process and product. The curation rationale proposed stems from Bourdieu’s three-stage field analysis model, which places a strong emphasis on habitus, considered to be most accurately (re)presented through blogs, yet necessitates its contextualisation within the broader (diasporic) field(s), through institutional websites, for example, whilst advocating a reflexive awareness of the researcher/curator’s (subjective) role. This, alongside the Kressian acknowledgement of the inherent multimodality of on-line resources, lends itself convincingly to selection and valuation strategies, whilst the discussion of language, genre, authorship and audience is relevant to the potential cataloguing of Web objects. By conceptualising the culturally themed selective Web-archiving process within the ethnosemiotic framework constructed, concrete recommendations emerge regarding curation, classification and crowd-sourcing.

In Study 1, 498 participants were randomised to online surveys with either high or low university sponsorship. Overall, 13.9 percent of participants commenced, but did not complete the surveys, and there was no difference between the proportions of participants dropping out of each condition. However, counter to our predictions, participants in the high sponsorship condition displayed significantly higher item non-response. In Study 2 (N = 159), which addressed a rival explanation for the findings in Study 1, the overall dropout rate was 23.9 percent and sponsorship prominence had no effect on either outcome variable. Overall, these findings suggest that hosting information pages on university Web sites, placing university logos on survey pages, and including the name of the university in survey URLs do not reliably impact on dropout or item non-response. Although it may seem disappointing that enhancing sponsor visibility is not sufficient to reduce dropout and item non-response, researchers without ready access to university Web servers or branding will appreciate these findings, as they indicate that minimally visible sponsorship does not necessarily compromise data quality.","",""

Evaluating a federated search engine for Rembrandt research","The art history domain is an interesting case for search engines tailored to the digital humanities, because the domain involves different types of sources (primary and secondary; text and images). One example of an art history search engine is RemBench, which provides access to information in four different databases related to the life and works of Rembrandt van Rijn. In the current paper, RemBench serves as a case to (1) discover the requirements for a search engine that is geared towards the art history domain and (2) make recommendations for the design of user observation studies for evaluating the usability of a search engine in the art history domain, and in digital humanities at large.  A user observation study with nine participants confirms that the combination of different source types is crucial in the art history domain. With respect to the user interface, both free-text search and facet filtering are actively used by the observed participants but we observe strong individual preferences. Our key recommendation for specialized search engines is the use of faceted search (free text search combined with filtering) in combination with federated search (combining multiple resources behind one interface). In addition, the user study shows that the usability of domain-specific search engines can successfully be evaluated using a thinking-aloud protocol with a small number of participants.","",""

The tensions generated by new forms of networking due to the worldwide dissemination of TCP/IP are assessed in the framework of the paradigm shift in telecommunications reform during the 1990s.","",""
"2017","The Internet as a structure of feeling: 1992–1996","ABSTRACT Between 1992 and 1996, the Internet went from being an experiment in connecting computers to being the inevitable next step in delivering the digital “revolution.” This change in perception was not just a recognition. It was an act of social construction, setting the stage for the major reorganisation of global communications over the next two decades. The Internet as we know it was constructed with a species of elite cultural imagination. Building on earlier work, this essay elaborates the causes and character of the particular “structure of feeling” that emerged during this period. The resulting habits of thought can be seen in a number of subsequent developments, from the rapid build out of Internet infrastructure in the late 1990s, to the net neutrality debates and to design choices favouring intense, always-connected interaction. The essay concludes by suggesting that technologies are best understood, not so much as agents in their own right, but as thought-objects for the collective enactment and exploration of hopes, desires and political visions.","",""
"2017","Introduction: Internet histories","For more than four decades, the Internet has grown and spread to an extent where today it is an indispensable element in the communication and media environment of many countries, and indeed of everyday life, culture and society. These precipitous changes have called for the understanding of the innovations, actors, changes and continuities involved in these evolutions, from a technical, but also from a social, scientific, politic or economic point of view. Although the history of the Internet has not been yet very predominant within the academic literature, an increased number of books and journal articles within the last decade attest to the fact that Internet history is an emerging field of study across a number of scholarly disciplines and fields. This is most evident in Internet and new media studies, but also is clear in culture, media, communication and technology research, across the diverse settings and institutional locations where such work may be encountered. A central issue for the advancement of the field is that historical studies of the Internet have mostly been published in journals related to a variety of disciplines, and these journals only rarely publish articles with a clear historical focus. The situation has greatly improved with the various recent issues dedicated to Internet and web histories,","",""

It argues that histories of the Internet in Africa would need to be heterogeneous, multi-level and flexible, especially given the various platforms and applications through which the Internet is accessed and used on the continent. The article provides an overview of the major areas of research into the Internet in the Global South and Africa in particular, and makes suggestions for how these areas could inform a historiography of the Internet in Africa.","",""
"2017","A common language","ABSTRACT Both the Internet and the Web beat out numerous rivals to become today's dominant network and online system,1 respectively. Many of those rival systems and networks had developed alternative solutions to issues that face us today, from micropayments to copyright. But few scholars, much less thought leaders, have a meaningful overview of the origins of our online world, or of the many systems which came before. This exclusivity is a problem, since as a society we are now making some of the permanent decisions that will determine how we deal with information for decades and even centuries to come. Those decisions are about regulatory structures, economic models, civil liberties, publishing and more. This essay argues for the need to comparatively study online information systems across all these axes, and to thus develop a “common language” of known precedents and concepts as a prerequisite for making informed discussions about the future of the online world. Doing so depends on two factors: (1) preservation of enough historical materials about earlier systems to be able to meaningfully examine them; (2) interdisciplinary, international attention to “meta” stories that emerge from considering the evolution of multiple networks and online systems.","",""
"2017","Can we write a cultural history of the Internet? If so, how?","ABSTRACT What would a cultural history of the Internet look like? The question almost makes no sense: the Internet spans the globe and traverses any number of completely distinct human groups. It simply cannot have a single culture. And yet, like the railroad, the telegraph and the highway system before it, the Internet has been an extraordinary agent for cultural change. How should we study that process? To begin to answer that question, this essay returns to four canonical studies of earlier technologies and cultures: Carolyn Marvin's When Old Technologies Were New; Leo Marx's The Machine in the Garden; Ruth Schwarz Cowan's More Work for Mother and Lynn Spigel's Make Room for TV. In each case, the essay mines the earlier works for research tactics and uses them as jumping-off points to explore the ways in which the Internet requires new and different approaches. It concludes by speculating on the ways that the American-centric nature of much earlier work will need to be replaced with a newly global focus and research tactics to match.","",""

Many studies implicitly define the Internet in material terms, as a particular set of hardware and software, and consequently tend to frame the development of the Internet as the spread of these technologies from the United States. This essay explores implications of defining the Internet alternatively in terms of technology, use and local experience. While there is not a single “correct” definition, historians should be aware of the politics of the definitions they use.","",""

In this respect, they resemble hagiographies, a literary genre that consists of accounts of Christian saints and their miraculous deeds. Internet historians should break free of their familiar hagiographic mode, and treat their historical subjects more critically. The starting point for revisionist histories of networking is an acceptance that the Internet is flawed, dangerous and ephemeral.","",""

But the Internet, as it is generally known, is as much mythology as technology, a shared set of narratives that frame our expectations of the future. As we begin to write comparative, critical histories of the Internet, this seemingly stable object breaks apart, revealing a diversity of experiences, technologies, norms and motivations. The epistemological problem at the heart of Internet history requires us to borrow creatively from other fields and develop new historical methods. To arrive at new operational definitions of the Internet, we advocate the pursuit of hidden histories, obscure sources and less visible networks, stoking new life into vernacular terms such as “the Net.”","",""

It quickly evolved into a communication system used for educational purposes, and also for social interaction (message boards, real-time messaging), collaboration and online gaming. The PLATO system was one of several precursors to today's Internet, but it has been little studied. It illustrates the value of the study of Internet histories and pre-histories (insofar as PLATO and other computer-mediated communication infrastructures like it predated Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), particularly as those histories entail rhetorical discursive elements regarding technical resources, social values and ethical norms that continue to shape the development of Internet technologies.","",""

Aimed at a limited group of affluent and, above all, inexperienced consumers, the new company saw itself as an alternative to the Internet, offering targeted content in French. Subscribers would be provided with a connection to specific services established by Infonie, together with French partners. However, the development of the Internet and in particular the range of services offered by French Internet Service Providers (ISPs) obliged Infonie to rethink its strategy and look increasingly to the Internet, integrating its services with the norms of the latter and acquiring the search engine Lokace, along with shares in Caramail, a specialist site providing free email addresses. The emergence of free service providers from 1999 onwards reinforced this trend and Infonie finally became just another ISP. We analyse this process by examining both the company's communications strategy, in particular its TV advertising campaigns, and the development of its Internet portal.","",""

Given the difficulties of working with such complex archival material, how can researchers in the humanities and social sciences more generally be persuaded to integrate Internet histories into their research? How can institutions and organisations be sufficiently convinced of the worth of their own online histories to take steps to preserve them? And how can value be demonstrated to the wider general public? It touches on public attitudes to personal and institutional Internet histories, barriers to access to web archives – technical, legal and methodological - and the cultural factors within academia that have hindered the penetration of new ways of working with new kinds of primary source. Rather than providing answers, this article is intended to provoke discussion and dialogue between the communities for whom Internet histories can and should be of significance.","",""

The 2010 conversation represents one of last times Baran participated in an interview before his death in March 2011. Topics discussed include how Baran drew upon inspiration from Warren McCulloch's work on neural networks to bring distributedness to communication networks and how this led to Hot Potato Routing, which later became known as packet switching. The latter, being an foundational part of Internet technology, has placed Paul Baran firmly in the histories of networking and the Internet, even if the origins of packet switching are hotly contested – a topic that is also discussed in the conversations. Finally, Baran also shares his views on technological development and determinism and what the future for the Internet holds.","",""
"2017","Internet histories: the view from the design process","ABSTRACT The electrical engineers and computer scientists who have designed the Internet are among those who have written Internet history. They have done so within the technical document series created to provide a medium for and record of the design process, the Internet Requests for Comments (RFCs) as well as in other venues. Internet designers have explicitly written the network's history in documents explicitly devoted to history as well as indirectly in documents focused on technical matters. The Internet RFCs also provide data for research on Internet history and on large-scale sociotechnical infrastructure written by outsiders to the design process. Incorporating the history of the Internet as understood by those responsible for its design, whether in their own words or by treating the design conversation as data, makes visible some elements of that history not otherwise available, corrects misperceptions of factors underlying some of its features, and provides fascinating details on the people and events involved that are of interest to those seeking to understand the Internet. Within the RFCs, history has served both technical and social functions.","",""
"2017","What is “internet”? The case for the proper noun and why it is important","ABSTRACT Academics, style manual editors and others have recently pushed for an elimination of the capitalisation of the word “internet”. This choice may have consequences that reach far beyond language and spelling, as it lends authority to the claim that there could be more than one “internet”, which in turn is based on a historical narrative that is not necessarily accurate. By first exploring the meaning of the word “internet” and subsequently tracing its origins, this article shows how “internet” evolved from an adjective describing a class of networking activities into a proper noun defining the foundation of the current “internet” as early as 1976. It is shown how the use of “internet” as a common noun emerges post-hoc and may have commercial origins rather than historical. The article concludes by showing how both the current, popular, broad definition of “internet”, as well as its historical roots, make the plural use of the term impossible, and why it should only be considered a proper noun, written as Internet.","",""
"2017","Gaps and bumps in the political history of the internet",": In the past years, there has been a growing scholarly attention given to “digital rights contention”, that is political conflicts related to the expansion or restriction of civil and political rights exerted through, or affected by, digital communications technologies. Yet, when we turn to history to inform contemporary debates and mobilisations, what we often find are single-sided narratives that have achieved iconic status, studies focusing on a handful of over-quoted contentious episodes and generally over-representing North America, or scattered accounts that have so far escaped the notice of internet researchers. How can we explain these gaps in internet histories? How can we go about overcoming them to build a more fine-grained understanding of past socio-legal struggles around human rights in the context of media and communications? This essay calls for advancing the political history of the internet in order to empower scholars, activists and citizens alike as they address current (and future) controversies around internet politics.","",""

"2017","‘Something is rotten in the state of Denmark:’ Why the Internet’s advertising business model is broken","Large swaths of the Internet economy are based on an advertising business model. Many content platforms, social media sites and mobile applications provide a free service to users in exchange for personal data that, once collected, is sold to advertisers and data brokers to generate corporate revenue. Metcalfe’s Law predicts that corporate revenues should increase exponentially as a company’s number of connections goes up and that costs should increase linearly. The combination of exponentially increasing revenues and linearly increasing costs should generate large profits for ad-based Internet companies. However, the opposite tends to be the case. Many established Internet companies are deeply in the red and only an estimated 0.01 percent of mobile applications will ever earn a profit. This disjunction raises the question: why do so many ad-based Internet companies perform so badly?The answer lies in the interaction of two factors. First, the costs faced by advertising-based Internet companies tend to increase faster than their core resource (i.e., users). Ad-based Internet companies, therefore, do not seem to benefit from economies of scale on the cost side of the equation. The implication is that such companies need a very large number of users in order to reach profitability. Secondly, profitability’s large user base requirement turns out to be extraordinarily rare in the Internet ecosystem because the network tends to structure itself into what are known as power law distributions, where most companies get only a few users (millions maybe) while some get literally billions. This suggests that the advertising model that underwrites so many Internet companies is broken. It works for a few, but not for most.","",""

To test this thesis, the study constructs two network maps of 1000 globally most popular Web domains, one based on hyperlinks and the other using an “audience-centric” approach with ties based on shared audience traffic between these domains. Analyses of the two networks reveal that unlike the centralized structure of the hyperlink network with few dominant “core” Websites, the audience network is more decentralized and clustered to a larger extent along geo-linguistic lines.

We then outline a methodology for the analysis of social structures on the Internet: By analyzing the practical meaning of the structures of Internet platforms, we can reconstruct their providers’ and users’ ontological commitments (i.e., what kinds of social structures they have to assume “there are”).

Thirteen years later, in 1996, a replacement standard was established for the IP protocol, to resolve key anticipated technical problems. More than 20 years later, those technical problems have indeed arisen, and yet the “new” protocol, IPv6, is still not widely deployed. This paper explores technical and institutional aspects of this case in order to examine how the evolving contexts of infrastructure use may turn technological solutions into infrastructural problems.","",""

It was not the first time I had done so. I had already completed a round of interviews in 2004 with several ARPANET and Internet pioneers, Kleinrock among them. The 2004 interview took place on the day of that year’s presidential election, only days after the 35th anniversary of the launch of the ARPANET, so Kleinrock was busy, and our meeting was brief. But in 2010, Kleinrock had much more time and was generous with it. In a friendly and relaxed manner, we talked for almost three hours about how he began his career at MIT with two other friends who would later become legendary pioneers in computer history in their own right, Larry Roberts and Ivan Sutherland. Professor Kleinrock took us all the way up to the present time and touched upon some entertaining and unexpected stories. He has given many interviews over the years and participated in in-depth oral histories like the invaluable one recorded by Judy O’Neill for the Charles Babbage Institute as early as 1990, months before Tim Berners-Lee released the World Wide Web documentation. The interview below has been edited for length and for any redundancies with these prior interviews, unless they were deemed necessary for context. Kleinrock also talked about being right in themiddle of a small group of people who would change networked communication forever. Not just through the emergence of the Internet, but also through mobile communications and the development of personal computing devices. Before the interview was over, however, Kleinrock had dished out stories of the mad capers he and Larry Roberts were involved in while they were working on the development of the ARPANET. They included being thrown out of Las Vegas casinos for counting cards and collecting silver quarter coins for future melting, because these tech wizards had found out that the silver content in the coins was worthmore than the coin itself.

"2018","Web 25: histories from the first 25 years of the World Wide Web","This self-evidently timely publication, prompted by the 25th anniversary of the World Wide Web in 2014, is an important contribution to the growing field of web and Internet history. It is one of the first serious scholarly attempts to consider the factors – social, cultural, technical and economic – which have shaped the web as we know it today; and to examine how the web in turn has shaped contemporary society and our daily lived experience. The book is divided into four sections: the early web; the web of culture and media; methodological reflections; and web archives as historical source. As these headings reveal, the histories of the web are approached here from a variety of different disciplinary standpoints, using different methodologies, and shaped by different sectoral interests. Archivists and librarians, scholars in media and communication studies, journalists, information scientists and historians are all present, reflecting the interand multi-disciplinary nature of web studies. Similarly, most chapters take an admirably multi-source approach, studying the web in its wider, often analogue, context. The first section on the early web begins with Niels Br€ ugger's discussion of the hyperlink, which he rightly identifies as “a defining feature of the web”. He places it in a long tradition of human attempts to navigate between and link related data, establishing that while much about the web might be novel it is far from introducing a complete break with the past. Next, Simone Natale and Paolo Bory discuss the narratives and myths that have come to shape understandings of the web's history. They highlight the many contrasting, even divergent, stories that have taken hold of the popular imagination, from “the recurring narrative pattern of the hero” (p. 33) to “arguments about the web's decentralized and egalitarian character” (p. 35). Their choice of the plural “biographies” is deliberate. Jean Marie Deken's chapter provides a detailed case-study of the development and influence of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center's website between 1991 and 1993. It perhaps tends towards the “hero” narrative identified by Natale and Bory but is nonetheless an interesting and forensic reconstruction of events. The section concludes with Marguerite Barry's fascinating study of the language used to describe the web in its formative years, discussing evolving, and sometimes opposed, concepts such as birth and parenthood; domesticity and ferality; availability and accessibility; the commercial and the utopian. The importance of storytelling again emerges strongly. The next three chapters deal with online culture and media, ranging from changing publishing and reading behaviours in China, to the development of blogs in Italy and the impact of the web on an Australian newspaper. The international scope of the section is significant, reinforcing the argument that the impact of the web has not been experienced in the same way across nations and cultures. Michel Hockx's account of the extraordinary explosion of online literary reading in China made possible by the web is one of the strongest chapters in the collection. It reminds us that the West's concentration on the “great firewall” prevents us from fully acknowledging the vibrancy of Chinese web culture: ‘‘Not only does the world inside the great firewall get by without the core websites associated with the ‘free’ world, but it even exports websites and applications that are preferred by Chinese users outside China over the ‘free world’ INTERNET HISTORIES 2018, VOL. 2, NOS. 3-4, 351–353","",""

In order to focus on the debates regarding software within the computational chemistry community in the 1990s, the corpus we rely on consists in a scholarly mailing list, a typical corpus from its time, conceived, constructed and maintained by a community. The threaded conversations of the list also constitute a unique rhetorical form in its organisation which is technically bound to the Internet-based media of that time. We first present the issues at stake within our research topic and show how relevant is such a corpus to address them. We then discuss the “ethnographic” characteristics and the structure of the corpus. Its most interesting parts are the “flame wars”, that is outbursts of heated, short and dense debates, in an ocean of evenly distributed polite messages. We unveil how the relevant flame wars are located and extracted by producing a graphical representation of the number of messages per day over time. Once flame wars are isolated, the messages exchanged by practitioners are studied precisely to comprehend the argumentative structure of the debates and the different viewpoints of actors.","",""

"2019","Semantics of the internet: a political history","Abstract The history of the Internet has been narrated many times. However, political histories of the Internet with a non-US-centric focus are still an uncharted research area. This paper contributes to closing that research gap. It reconstructs the Internet’s history in Germany through the lens of semantic changes in press coverage on politics. In our investigation, we sought to analyse semantic change as a political history by drawing on insights concerning the relationship between semantic change and political conflict from the perspective of discourse theory and theoretical reflections on politicisation. The study follows our intuition that semantic struggles of the past leave traces in word contexts. Conversely, it uncovers semantic change by following the traces of semantic struggles in these contexts. In line with this rationale, we conducted a ‘blended reading’ of word contexts that relied on a quantitatively assisted qualitative text analysis. The study finds that the Internet has long been understood predominantly as a tool for politics in the political public. In the late 2000s, its perception as a highly politicised object of governance also became dominant. While the Internet was always associated with a medium and a public sphere, its characterisation changed from ‘web 1.0’ to a ‘web of corporations’.","",""

"2019","Introduction: Internet histories and computational methods","The internet is a born-digital medium, but for a number of years many histories of the internet have used traditional non-computational methods such as document analysis and interviews (e.g. Abbate, 2000; Banks, 2008; Goggin & McLelland, 2017; Poole, 2005; Turner, 2006). However, recent studies of Usenet and of the archived web have benefited from the born-digital nature of computer networks and have fruitfully used computational methods to explore the internet’s past (e.g. some of the chapters in Br€ ugger & Schroeder, 2017, in Br€ ugger 2017, and in Br€ ugger & Milligan, 2019), and monographs have been published where computational methods play a key role in the unlocking of the Web’s past (Milligan, 2019). Although the use of computational methods is not necessary just because the object of study itself is digital, with this special section of Internet Histories we present the possibilities and challenges related to the use of computational methods within historical studies of the internet and the web. The articles in this special section use varied computational methods to study the internet’s history in different ways, from quantitative and qualitative methods supported by computers to a variety of methods used to study the archived web. The special issue begins with “Internet Histories and Computational Methods: A ‘Round-Doc’ Discussion.” We invited a series of seven scholars to reflect on common questions around the themes of this special issue: why computational methods are important; what they need to look out for; how computational researchers need to understand their sources; as well as the history and future of these sorts of approaches.

The decision to use the packet switching principle was crucial to the development of the Internet and computer networking broadly, and in popular literature, packet switching is often attributed to three originators: Paul Baran, Donald Davies and Leonard Kleinrock. This paper does not concern itself with who invented packet switching, but rather, who had the greatest influence on the risky and highly consequential decision to base the ARPANET design on this previously untested technology. A close examination of the available documentation, including two newly re-emerged documents, indicate that Paul Baran had a much more substantial influence on the decision to use packet switching for ARPANET than most retellings of Internet history portray. The findings also show that Donald Davies’ role in the adoption of packet switching as a dominant principle for digital communication may have been less impactful than depicted in current literature and that Kleinrock may have played a significant role in bringing packet switching to the ARPANET, influenced by interactions with Baran.","",""
"2019","The Evolution of Internet Routing: Technical Roots of the Network Society","Abstract In the humanities and some social sciences, many social theories, histories, and philosophies of networks often draw on incomplete representations of the Internet’s evolution and structure. Empirical and analytical difficulties result when scholars select this partial understanding as an archetype that they use to derive underlying social properties, and consequences, of networks. These networks, in turn, are put to work as both as a metaphor to describe a (our) new kind of society, and a fundamental, causal force that is bringing it into being. In other words, society is said to be governed by networks, but the network ideal-type—insofar as it is based on visions of the Internet—is inaccurate. A common problem with this work lies in its misunderstanding of the technical functions of the Internet Protocol (IP): specifically, the misidentification of IP with routing, and thus with the distributed property of the Internet. As a corrective, I offer a brief history of Internet routing, the Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) and autonomous system in particular.","",""
"2019","Conversation pieces: On recounting new media art mailinglist cultures","Abstract In the field of media art, mailinglists such as nettime, -empyre-, SPECTRE and CRUMB have functioned as important para-institutional formations that have influentially played host to a diverse community of artists, critics, curators, activists and academics since the 1990s. These lists, we suggest, are of particular epistemological and methodological interest for the field of internet history due to their critical and experimental nature. This stems mainly from the cultivation of highly reflexive, at times ambivalent, stance towards the technical, social and aesthetic limits of such networking activity itself. In this sense, they present unique objects of study for exploring what difference computational methods might make for understanding mailinglist cultures over time; what we refer to in this article, drawing on Wolfgang Ernst, as counting and recounting the past. Our aim in this paper is, therefore, to both introduce these lists to the emerging field of internet history and scope out medium-specific methods that take the measure of concepts, discourses, cohorts, and events that have taken place through them over time.","",""

It is about web archiving a selection of web incunables published on the Dutch web before 2000 and has a special focus on home pages or user websites from internet provider Euronet* Internet from the period between 1994 and 2000. It explains how internet archaeology can be an innovative way to investigate the new digital cultures through insights from the past. Although many Dutch websites dating from before 2000 are still present on the web and some fine examples of web incunables could be saved, due to technical, legal and other issues it is still hard to archive them. The web collection which is a result of our research cannot therefore be considered as a representative selection of born digital heritage from service provider Euronet, but as the outcome of a learning process.","",""

Designed as the interface between ARPANET nodes and the common carrier telephone system, the IMP actualized the ARPANET as an experimental packet-switching communication system. We conceptualize the IMP as historical boundary object that exposes ARPANET’s close relationship to the telephone system. Our analysis offers a novel history of ARPANET as a repurposing of the existing telephone infrastructure. Beyond the historical contribution, this approach has wider implications for the theory of media infrastructures, specifically the “inter-structuralism” of ARPANET and the nature of borders between seemingly disparate social, political, and technological regimes.","",""

I still believe that is a fair assessment of the Internet of the early 2000s. But I no longer believe it holds true for the Internet today.

"2020","The field of communication’s uptake of computers, networks, and the internet: 1970–2000","Abstract Our goal in this article is to understand the historical sequences as well as consequences of the internet on the development of the academic field of communication. As a field that has one foot in the study of a most basic and necessary human activity, and another foot in the study of innovative technology, has scholarship in the field of communication followed internet developments? Is there a lag between technological developments and communication research focused on those developments? We attempt to answer our questions by searching for keywords (such as computer, internet, CMC, etc.) in content from communication journals from 1970 to 2000. We find that a large number of keywords were entirely absent, and many of the occurrences involved the same small number of terms, indicative of a relatively narrow and/or shallow amount of interest in these phenomena. The dominance of terms like ‘computer’ and ‘internet’ (and, eventually, ‘Web’) indicate a generalist tone at work in these articles. There is relatively little breadth in the vocabulary related to computers and the internet, suggesting that the field of communication that was seemingly trying to digest the entire (constructed) category of behavior associated with computers and the internet in one gigantic linguistic bite rather than focusing on activities taking place via this new medium. There was not yet a sense of meaningful differentiation in what internet-based communication could involve; ‘internet’ communication was simply communication occurring by means of an internet-based delivery system; a new medium, figuratively and literally.","",""

Developed and deployed by Netscape in 1994, debated by developers since 1995, and subject to political scrutiny since 1998, cookies have grown in visibility as they have become more mundane. While the United States was able to push for a consumer framing supported by self-regulation, it rested on effective notice and choice. As the European Union sought to establish a successful Single Market, consent in European data protection law grew in use, prominence, and strength over iterations. Although cookies were chosen as a privacy preserving mechanism for establishing state in web based interactions, they became a lightning rod for privacy concerns that have never been resolved. This article details the history of cookies as an exploration of the normative cultural constructions of a simple, unremarkable, entrenched technology using www-talk archives, IETF working group archives, browser versions, and trade literature, as well as U.S., UK, and EU government reports, caselaw, and legislative history.","",""

Drawing on economic and management literature relating to the typical trends of technological innovation, we examine the long-term development of Web technology in a theoretically informed and empirical manner. An original longitudinal dataset of 20,493 Web-related US patents is used to trace the growth curve of Web technology between the years of 1990 through 2013. We find that the accumulation of corporate Web inventions followed an S-shaped curve which shifted to linear growth after year 2004. This transition is unusual in relation to the traditional S-curve model of technological development that typically approaches a limit. The point of inflection on the S-curve coincided reasonably closely with the timing of the dot-com crash in year 2000. Moreover, we find a complex bi-directional relationship between patenting rates in Web technology and movements in the NASDAQ composite stock index. The implications of these results are discussed in theoretical and practical terms for sustained technological growth. Specific recommendations for different stakeholders in commercial Web development are included.","",""

This article rethinks legacies in internet history by positioning the notion of legacy systems as conceptual basis for a genealogical and non-teleological framing of internet history aimed to investigate lost network events as legacies of European pasts that persist and continue to affect our networked present. To demonstrate its historiographical value, I use the history of Euronet as a case in point, using a variety of primary and secondary sources, to argue that the legacy system of European cooperation and politics on which Euronet was imagined and built, persists within internet history through a variety of “successes” and “failures,” of which Euronet is only one.","",""
"2020","The narratives we inherit: the local and global in Tomsk’s internet history","Abstract In recent years scholars have called for more attention to local net histories, work that demonstrates how networked computing developed in specific geographical, material, and social contexts. Research carried out in this spirit stands in contrast to a canonical and popular history of the (singular) “Internet,” and thus sets up an opposition or dyad between “local” net histories and the “global” or mainstream history of ARPAnet, the Internet Protocol, and the World Wide Web. This article takes up the call for local net histories by focusing on Tonet, a local network that was developed in the Siberian city of Tomsk and which peaked in usage in the early 2000s. However, rather than assuming an opposition between local and global Internet history, this article interrogates how the local net and global Internet were articulated by Tonet’s computer scientists and regional journalists at the time. The article thus enquires into symbolic connections between a local net and the global Internet, unsettling this opposition while also drawing attention to the specific legacies that shaped these concepts in the case of Tonet.","",""

The entire Danish Web domain and its development from 2006 to 2015 is used as a case, based on the holdings in the Danish national Web archive. The following research questions guide the investigation: What has the Danish Web domain looked like in the past, and how has it developed in the period 2006-2015? Methodologically, we investigate to what extent one can delimit 'a nation' on the Web, and what characterizes the archived Web as a historical source for academic studies, as well as the general characteristics of our specific data source. Analytically, the article introduces a design for how this type of big data analyses of an entire national Web domain can be performed. Our findings show some of the ways in which a nation's digital landscape can be mapped, ie. on size, content types and hyperlinks.

In order to investigate the formation of this academic field, we collected articles published in major academic journals dedicated to new media and digital communication as well as mainstream periodicals in communication studies over the past quarter of a century. Relying on a combination of (semi)automated content analysis and citation analysis, we find that articles related to the internet and its manifold aspects are cited more often than research on other topics. The literature review suggests that as the socio-material infrastructure of the internet has become deeply enmeshed in society its study has evolved from a niche pursuit to the discipline’s core area of inquiry.","",""
"2021","From RangKoM and JARING to the Internet: visions and practices of electronic networking in Malaysia, 1983–1996","Abstract Early electronic networks were established for a variety of purposes, to serve different kinds of people and needs, and in vastly different political, social, and economic contexts. Examining some of the earliest electronic networks established in Southeast Asia provides us with a glimpse of the contrasting and diverse aims for which they were established and used. At the time electronic networking began to be developed in Malaysia (during the 1980s) its potential was far more open-ended. Although networking pioneers in Southeast Asia were influenced by North American experiences, they quickly developed their own ideas about what networks could be, could do, and how they could serve national or local purposes. This essay uses the concept of a “networking imaginary” to conceptualise the ways in which networks became associated with particular ideals, goals, and futures. The pioneers of electronic networking in Malaysia articulated a unique networking imaginary that anticipated networks playing a critical role in Malaysia’s developing economy. Networking, in the vision of its Malaysian founders, would play a key role in propelling Malaysia forward as a wealthy, stable, and harmonious society. These visions continue to impact the ways in which networks are imagined and used in Malaysia today.","",""

All three approaches inform this history, exploring the Canadian context. On the recommendation of US counterparts at NORAD, a top-secret whitepaper recommended Canada develop a distributed communications network (NORAD 1965), which became SAMSON: Strategic Automatic Message Switching Operational Network. SAMSON developed into an internet, though riddled with a series of setbacks beginning almost immediately, until it was disbanded in 1984. (Canadian Armed Forces 1985). This paper investigates Canada’s internet infrastructural technopolitics through Larkin’s framework of questioning how they “emerge out of and store within them forms of desire and fantasy” (2013, 329). Specifically, it asks how the design, equipment, and network protocols of this Canadian internet embodied the imaginary of Canadian independence from 1965 to 1984, drawing on primary sources from the unpublished documents of the Canadian Armed Forces that have since been declassified. The emergence of the early Canadian internet occurred during a political renewal. At a time of pushback against American and British influence, the Canadian military rejected cooperation with the US, and focused on internal threats over Cold War rivalries (Hatt 1984). By design the Canadian internet was a security apparatus, but the technopolitics embedded in the system dictate who is to be secured against whom. This paper asks how this history persists in Canada’s internet infrastructure today.","",""

After the privatization of the Internet architecture in the 1990s, the interplay between the architectural principles of end-to-end, permissionless innovation, and openness subverted equality among Internet users and hampered their ability to redesign the Internet.

This paper explores the first ways in which computer networks were used in Yugoslavia, since these are different from the modes used in the West or Russia, because the dissolution of the country – mixed with its transition from communism to democracy and the wars for independence – created an environment which allowed computer networks to be used in unprecedented ways. The paper uses a mix of historical method, computational methods for collecting and analysing USENET data, semi-structured interview, archival research, and qualitative online observation. The main findings show that access to Western technology and participation in academic networks enabled Yugoslavian STEM academia and hackers to use computer networks for the first computer networks’ propaganda war. Slovenians, Croatians, and Serbians created electronic mailing lists through which they tried to manipulate international actors and to bond the diaspora for a common cause, and they additionally fought in USENET discussion groups by implementing trolling techniques.","",""

To do so, I not only follow a strand of media historians who argue that the imagination is an important component for understanding how media change, but I also argue that Wikipedia’s data has been incorporated, re-imagined, and repurposed by sociotechnical projects in ways that have often been side-lined despite acting as the boundary lines of what is considered digital knowledge. It combines Patrice Flichy’s longitudinal theory of technical development as an imaginaire, Frederik Lesage and Simone Natale’s historical approach of biographies of media with an analysis of the interpretative flexibility of new media. Through an eclectic corpus of project websites, new articles, press releases, and blogs, I demonstrate the unexpected ways the online encyclopedia has permeated throughout digital culture over the past twenty years through projects like the Citizendium, Everipedia, Google Search and AI software. As a result of this analysis, I explain how this array of meanings and materials constitutes the Wikipedia imaginaire: a collective activity of sociotechnical development that is fundamental to understanding the ideological and utopian meaning of knowledge with digital culture.","",""

The WWW collection is of major importance not only because it is located where the Web was born but, more importantly, because it preserves documents produced during the early and little-known stages of its development. Our study has a qualitative approach and is based on in-person discussions, e-mail exchanges, and a focus group we conducted with five main actors responsible for the birth and development of the WWW collection at CERN. Through this method, we co-constructed with them a discourse, which we later analysed through inductive thematic analysis. We extracted six main topics reflecting the principal themes represented in the collection: reasons for creating a specific collection of web-related documents; salient moments in the history of the collection; discussion about its naming; issues about the originality of the documents; and future digitisation projects. This paper may be of interest to web historians and archivists looking for an overview and hidden reasons for the creation of the collection.","",""

Although CSS was proposed as a method of adding a design layer to HTML documents early on in the development of the web, they only crossed from a marginal position to mainstream usage after a long period of proselytising by web designers working towards “web standards”. The CSS Zen Garden grassroots initiative aimed at negotiating, mainstreaming and archiving possible methods of CSS web design, while dealing with varying levels of browser support for the technology. Using the source code of the CSS Zen Garden and the accompanying book, this paper demonstrates that while the visual designs were complex and sophisticated, the CSS lived within an ecosystem of related platforms, i.e., web browsers, screen sizes and design software, which constrained its use and required enormous sensitivity to the possibilities browser ecosystems could reliably provide. As the CSS Zen Garden was maintained for over ten years, it also acts as a unique site to trace the continuing development of web design, and the imaginaries expressed in the Zen Garden can also be related to ethical dimensions that influence the process of web design. Compared to Flash-based web design, work implemented using CSS required a greater willingness to negotiate source code configurations between browser platforms. Following the history of the individuals responsible for creating and contributing to the CSS Zen Garden shows the continuing influence of layer-based metaphors of design separated from content within web source code.","",""

"2023","REVOLUTIONARY DISCOURSES IN A TIME CAPSULE: A HISTORIOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS OF CANONICAL, INTELLECTUAL LITERATURE CONCERNING THE SOCIAL IMPACT AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE INTERNET.","Whilst the internet’s development can be traced back to the 1940s (Turner, 2006; Flichy 2015), the rhetoric of a digital revolution primarily emerged during the early 1990s and mid-00s and was often produced by the US-based academic community which has been intrinsically involved with the advancement of the internet. The dominant conceptualizations put forward in their popular, scholarly writings about the technology’s past and future, became authoritative in our academic understanding of the internet’s social impact and significance. Subsequently, notions like ‘the electronic highway’ were adopted in legislative and popular discourse which, in turn, influenced how the internet was understood, designed, and used on a broader, societal level.  Notable authors of these influential texts - Howard Rheingold, Nicholas Negroponte, Sherry Turkle, and Geert Lovink - wrote their findings based on their own experiences with internet initiatives and from their particular theoretical backgrounds and positionality. Most importantly, these texts present valuable information as if coming from a time capsule; often framed with a rhetoric of transformation, the writers themselves contribute to the idea of a revolutionary internet following optimistic notions of digital utopianism and technological solutionism, situated in a particular Zeitgeist. The aim of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of how these revolutionary notions developed over time and what their grander impact was on our contemporary conceptions, in and outside the influential American context. This is achieved by conducting a critical, historiographical analysis of canonical, intellectual literature about the early internet and thus re-contextualizes it as historical traces itself.","",""
"2023","IF NOT, ELSE: STANDARDS, PROTOCOLS, NETWORKS AND HOW THEY MAKE A DIFFERENCE","The contemporary Internet's """"network of networks"""" has become infrastructural to our lives. The Internet is a stack of physical, data link, network, transport, and application layers which all have unique rules and roles. While many see Internet infrastructure as a foregone conclusion, Paris, Cath and Myers West (2023) write “Internet infrastructure is built slowly, over time, protocol by protocol, in response to many different technical, social, political, environmental, and economic imperatives”. Even as the particular model of the Internet we are all accustomed to has become the standard, other attempts proliferated and eventually failed, as did the Soviet Internet (Peters 2016), and as this panel highlights, the Internet is still ever-evolving.  The project of this panel is to trace alternative, parallel, and emergent network models, standards and protocols, theorize their impact as they appear in different places, spaces, and contexts, and gesture towards how the Internet might be different. As critical internet studies have since the early 2000s shown, computational standards, protocols, and network diagrams are more than technical details, they have the power to shape and structure the conditions for our socio-cultural lifeworlds (Galloway 2006; Chun 2008; Bratton 2016). As Gehl (2014) puts it: “interfaces, database structures, mechanisms of connection all shape social activities”. Change an element in the stack and a different connectivity, a different future becomes possible.  The papers of this panel introduce and discuss five different and potentially revolutionary network technologies that manage and organize our online lives.  The first paper represents a media genealogy of ActivityPub – a protocol that enables the Fediverse, a collection of social media sites that can communicate with one another. The author argues that ActivityPub was not produced through an instrumental process, but was the result of accidents and coincidences. The accidental nature of the protocol, coupled with its being authored by self-identified queer and trans developers, has put it on a collision course with both the “standard” approach to standards production as well as mainstream, corporate social media.  The second paper focuses on the design of the Interplanetary Internet and the idea of delay-tolerant networking fundamental to operating in outer space. The author maintains that when delays are central to a network model, we are forced to rethink how our connections are maintained and organized in the future. Delay-tolerant networking is thus not only a technical solution for a communications system but a control protocol through which interplanetary life can be managed.  The third paper is also focused on the temporality of networks. The third paper examines how time is enacted as a design ideology in the course of the development of a future internet architecture protocol project: named data networking (NDN). This work locates aspects of the sociomateriality of time in the processes of building Internet infrastructure and demonstrates how it binds together cultural, economic, and discursive power. The paper argues that thinking through time as a design ideology can be useful in projects imagining how the Internet might be built to engender and support different values than market ideology.  The fourth paper is about the organizational culture of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a key internet standards and protocol organization. The paper argues that the organization is guided by a culturally inflected anti-political engineering ethos, whose depoliticizing tendencies hampers the organization’s functioning and its ability to rise above narrow industry-interest and pursue a public interest internet.  The fifth paper looks to the Crypto Wars of the 1990s as a moment where things could have been otherwise; comparing the examples of PGP and RSA encryption software and how they shaped the nature of our networked systems. It argues that a combination of regulatory and commercial interests influenced the development and use of cryptography in ways that facilitated the development of e-commerce, but left private messaging in dubious legal status.  Collectively the papers investigate alternative and emergent trends behind the Internet and its network models, standards, and protocols. The protocols and rules for network connection, standards bodies, and modes of governance are critical to maintaining and upkeeping a network. Their impact, however, is not merely technical but potentially world-changing. The papers direct their critical gaze towards the development of these technologies and what their introduction to our world potentially entails. By focusing on projects of past, present, and future and by exploring the Internet’s deepest sociotechnical layers, the panel critically dismantles the commonly-held idea that the Internet is a monolith and illustrates that the history of the Internet is still being written.","",""
"2023","All WARC and no playback: The materialities of data-centered web archives research"," This paper examines the Web ARChive (WARC) file format, revealing how the format has come to play a central role in the development and standardization of interoperable tools and methods for the international web archiving community. In the context of emerging big data approaches, I consider the sociotechnical relationships between material construction of data and information infrastructures for collecting and research. Analysis is inspired by Star and Griesemer's historical case of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology which reveals how boundary objects and methods standardization are used to enroll actors in the work of collecting for natural history. I extend these concepts by pairing them with frameworks for studying digital materiality and the representational qualities of data artifacts. Through examples drawn from fieldwork observations studying two data-centered research projects, I consider how the materiality of the WARC format influences research methods and approaches to data extraction, selection, and transformation. Findings identify three modalities researchers use to configure WARC data for researcher needs: using indexes to support search queries, constructing derivative formats designed for certain types of analysis, and generating custom-designed datasets tailored for specific research purposes. Findings additionally reveal similarities in how these distinct methods approach automated data extraction by relying upon the WARC's standardized metadata elements. By interrogating whose information needs are being met and taken into account in the design of the WARC's underlying information representation, I reveal effects on the emerging field of web history, and consider alternative approaches to knowledge production with archived web data.

"2023","The aesthetics of the self: The meaning-making of Internet aesthetics","In this study we explore the so-called Internet aesthetics, labels applied on heterogenous collections of materials and activities by Internet users, which are discussed and constructed primarily on the Internet. We conducted qualitative content analyses on entries of AestheticsWiki, as well as interviews with 11 Internet aesthetics enthusiasts. In contrast to established notions such as genre, style or subculture, Internet aesthetics are characterized by few conventions, but seem fundamentally open for individual interpretations. We therefore theorize that they primarily serve as toolkits, through which individuals give sense and coherence to personal experience, in line with a situation-specific self-image. In doing so, they contribute to a reflexive myth of the self. ","",""

"2024","“The real ethernet”: The transnational history of global Wi-Fi connectivity"," Wi-Fi is an integral and invaluable part of our media practices. Wireless networks are blended into our media environment and, in terms of infrastructural importance, have become comparable with electricity or water. This article offers a new transnational perspective on the underexplored history of IEEE 802.11 standards by focusing on the tensions between the United States and Europe in terms of development trajectories of wireless technology. The goal is to analyze the standardization of wireless networking through a transnational lens and to contribute to enhanced understanding of the global proliferation of Wi-Fi technology. Four particular aspects of the transnational development of Wi-Fi technology are discussed: the rivalry between US and European standards, the constitutive choice to focus on data transmission, radio spectrum availability, and the peculiarities of network authentication.
