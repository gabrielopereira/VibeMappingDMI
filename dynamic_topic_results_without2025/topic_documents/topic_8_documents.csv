"2019","Erratum","The human RCTEC/RCTE cell stocks used here (1) and in (2,3) were originally provided by Dr. Loghman-Adham (then at St. Louis University) to co-author Dr. Wandinger-Ness (University of New Mexico) through an MTA in 2001. The SV40 immortalized human RCTEC/RCTE cells were characterized as being of distal tubule cell line as detailed in (4). On the basis of recent short tandem repeat (STR) DNA sequencing (Performed by IDEXX BioResearch) of the earliest passages of the RCTEC/RCTE cell stocks it became evident the cells were of mixed lineage. Further analyses of PCR products using QIAxcel capillary electrophoresis demonstrated the presence of a canine product. The product was sequenced and established to be of canine origin. A set of canine specific STR markers were compared to the sample and showed that the sample had a genetic profile with 92% identity to the MDCK cell line. Later cell stocks that were used in the present publication were STR profiled and showed drift to 100% MDCK lineage. Despite being of canine origin, rather than human as was previously thought, MDCK is similarly a distal tubule epithelial cell line. For this reason, previous interpretation and conclusions drawn using these cells in (1–3) remain sound, but for purposes of rigor, reproducibility and experimental validation by others we report on this misidentification. This information will also be reported for listing on the International Cell Line Authentication Committee (ICLAC) database (http://iclac.org).","",""
