    "abstract": "\n         \n        'The vital experience of the glad animal sensibilities made doubts impossible on the question of our speed; we heard our speed, we saw it, we felt it as a thrilling; and this speed was not the product of blind insensate agencies, that had no sympathy to give, but was incarnated in the fiery eyeballs of the noblest amongst brutes, in his dilated nostril, spasmodic muscles, and thunder-beating hoofs.' \n\n-- Thomas de Quincey (1849), \"The English Mail-Coach\"\n       \n      For Thomas de Quincey, the thrust of speed is intimately linked with the thrust of the body. Subjectivity is formed by and through a corporeal experience of acceleration. In this way, De Quincey has the jump on those other lovers of automated speed: the Italian Futurists. That heady clash of bodies, speed and information, or the technological sublime, we characteristically associate with the development of twentieth-century communication is already articulated some sixty years before Marinetti imagines the 'divine fusion' of body and machine. Thomas de Quincey's 1849 ode to the postal service -- \"The English Mail Coach\" -- functions as a significant text in modernity's velocity culture. Specifically, de Quincey allows us to historicise the critical terms of 'speed', 'body' and 'circulation'. This paper makes some preliminary historical observations about the acceleration of communication and transport systems and how this rapidity might give rise to new forms of subjectivity or the emergence of what Jeffrey T. Schnapp calls 'the kinematic subject'. \n      The perceptual reconfiguration of time and space is central to an understanding of modernity's preoccupation with speed. Rapid data circulation through digital information systems means that distance appears to shrink and time seems to collapse. Manuel Castells calls this a 'new time regime' (429). Temporality now functions according to a double logic: a simultaneous binary of 'the eternal and of the ephemeral'. The contemporary 'manipulation of time' turns on 'instantaneity and eternity: me and the universe, the self and the net' (462-3). For David Harvey the defining feature of postmodernity is 'time-space compression'. Capitalism is 'characterised by speed-up in the pace of life, while so overcoming spatial barriers that the world sometimes seems to collapse inwards upon us' (241). \n      Castells and Harvey are not, of course, the first to notice the degree to which the changing rhythms of a communication vehicle might impact upon perceptions of time and space. In 1909 Marinetti announces its demise: 'Time and Space died yesterday. We already live in the absolute, because we have created eternal, omnipresent speed'. Yet this death is prefigured some 120 years before by the 18th century author Hannah More in a letter where, quoting Alexander Pope, she illustrates her reaction to the introduction of the mail coach:\n      \n        I have just been thinking that if the amorous poet, who modestly wished to annihilate time and space had lived to see our fortunate days, he would have seen his prophetic visions realised... cards having well-nigh accomplished the first, and mail-coaches the last. (Qtd. in Lewis 264) \n      \n      This letter is dated 1788, only four years after the establishment of the mail coach system. Initially the service ran between London and Bristol so that Hannah More writing from Somerset would complain of being bypassed by this new mode of information circulation:\n      \n      \n        Of the other blessing, the annihilation of space, I cannot partake; mail-coaches, which come to others, come not to me. Letters and newspapers, now that they travel in coaches like gentlemen and ladies, come not within ten miles of my hermitage. (265) \n      \n      More here identifies an important historical factor in the transformation of information networks. It concerns the coupling of transportation and communication: information travels 'in coaches like gentlemen and ladies'. In More's 18th century account the two remain connected while, as James Carey has noted, the significance of the 19th century's invention of the telegraph is that it splits the two processes. The telegraph 'allowed symbols to move independently of geography and independently of and faster than transport' (213). For de Quincey, a pivotal feature of the mail coach is the way in which communication and transportation function coextensively. Recounting his travels on the coach as it distributes news from the Napoleonic wars he notes that 'the grandest chapter of our experience, within the whole mail-coach service, was on those occasions when we went down from London with the news of victory' (290). For de Quincey, as for other commentators, the mail coach is a political instrument. Through the increasing efficiency of its communication infrastructure, it 'binds the nation together' (Austen 361). As de Quincey puts it 'the mail-coach, as the national organ for publishing these mighty events, thus diffusively influential, became itself a spiritualised and glorified object to an impassioned heart' (272). \n      What impresses de Quincey most, however, is the speed of this vehicle. Or perhaps, more accurately, it is a particular relation between the self and speed, which confers on the mail coach a 'glory of motion' (270). By the time he publishes his essay, postal and newspaper circulation by mail-coach is nearly at an end. The last mail coach ceases action in London in 1846 (Daunton 123) and postal distribution begins to be carried out by rail. De Quincey clearly mourns the loss of this form of communication. And his regret depends on the self's perception of speed. That is, to qualify as an authentic act of transportation (of the body, of the post or of language), one must, to some degree, be aware of the systems of circulation, the modes of delivery and the vehicle of communication. One ought to be able to experience the speed at which one travels or the mail is delivered. The body must remain in contact with the message. In de Quincey's view the railway communication system fails for these sorts of reasons:\n      The modern modes of travelling cannot compare with the mail-coach system in grandeur and power. They boast of more velocity, not however as a consciousness, but as a fact of our lifeless knowledge, resting upon alien evidence; as, for instance, because somebody says that we have gone fifty miles in the hour though we are far from feeling it as a personal experience ... . Apart from such an assertion, or such a result, I myself am little aware of the pace. But, seated on the old mail-coach, we needed no evidence out of ourselves to indicate the velocity. (283, emphasis in the original) \n      Perched atop the careening mail coach, the self needs no secondary evidence to confirm its propulsion: 'we heard our speed, we saw it, we felt it as a thrilling'. But with the emergence of railway systems, the self somehow becomes cut off or distanced from the mode of transport: 'But now, on the new system of travelling, iron tubes and boilers have disconnected man's heart from the ministers of his locomotion' (284). To be sure, rail is faster. But that fails to impress de Quincey for the rail cannot offer him the same sublime effect. The mail coach is drawn by 'royal horses like cheetahs' (282) while the train lacks the power to raise even 'an extra bubble in a steam-kettle' (284). The sublimity of speed is also aural. But once again the railroad fails to inspire awe: 'the trumpet that once announced from afar the laurelled mail; heartshaking, when heard screaming on the wind ... has now given way for ever to the pot-wallopings of the boiler' (284). \n     In Burke's formulation of the sublime there is danger and terror but there must also be a certain distance from this threat. It is 'simply painful' when we are aroused by causes that 'immediately affect us' but it is sublime when 'we have an idea of pain and danger, without being actually in such circumstances' (51) . For de Quincey sitting inside the carriage seems to offer too much safety and distance, the interior reserved as it is for the 'porcelain variety of the human race' (273). Instead, he travels aloft near the driver because of 'the air, the freedom of prospect, the proximity to the horses, the elevation of seat' (275). And he has the possibility of reining them in himself: 'the certain anticipation of purchasing occasional opportunities of driving' (275)1. The closer he is to the ministers of his locomotion, the better de Quincey likes it. The more he becomes the agent of his own speed, the more immediate, authentic and sublime seems his journey. For de Quincey, then, the superiority of the mail coach over the railroad lies not in terms of absolute speed but rather it concerns issues about the body's experience of and relation to that speed. As Matthew Schneider (1995) puts it 'the difference between the two with respect to their speed, privileges mail coaches by virtue of their violent immediacy, their ability to transmit the actual or living sensations rather than one that is intermediate or representational' (152)2. \n      \n      In a fascinating paper about the correlation between speed and subjectivity Jeffrey T. Schnapp identifies the mail coach in general and de Quincey in particular as emblematic of an 'inaugural moment' in the development of an 'anthropology of speed' (3). With a quick side swipe at the ahistorical and apocalyptic underpinning of Paul Virilio's Speed and Politics, Schnapp argues that although speed has always been 'an agent of individuation' it is with modernity that it begins to depend on the relation between self and vehicle:\n      \n          ... the mere experience of riding on horseback was not enough to establish a modern culture of velocity. Speed's rise as a cultural thematic, its move into an everyday realm of perceptibility, its adoption as sacrament of modern individualism, became possible only with the development of mechanical buffers between rider, horse, and roadway: buffers that enable new fantasies of attachment, first, between rider and engine, and, then, according to a more complex logic, between rider, engine, vehicle, and/or landscape. (10-1) \n          What is particularly productive about Schnapp's account is that he schematises the history of transportation in terms of the relation between speed, body and vehicle. For Schnapp this is a pivotal dynamic. De Quincey's equestrian desire and his disdain for railroad travel, is part of a historical process where individuality comes to be 'identified with administration of one's own speed' (14). In Schnapp's model, there are 'two concurrent yet distinct experiences of velocity', one that he calls 'thrill-based' and the other 'commodity-based'. The first is experienced in modes such as on top of the mail-coach and later, cars, motorbikes and aeroplanes. 'Commodity-based' refers to train and bus travel. The difference between the two is that thrill-based transportation occurs when the passenger 'can envisage himself as the author of his velocity' while in 'commodity-based' forms the traveller is 'shielded from the natural environment and the engine, and passively submits himself to velocity' (18-9). \n          De Quincey's essay is a valuable resource for communications historiography. Like Jacques Derrida, he recognises how the rhythms of the postal service function to construct identity. As a system of circulation and exchange, the post office institutionalises modes of correspondence, producing and regulating particular subjectivities. And like Postman Pat, de Quincey knows the corporeal pleasures of delivering the mail. \n          \n          Footnotes \n          \nThere are also issues of class at work here. Tickets were more expensive to sit inside the carriage which de Quincey, then a student at Oxford, could not afford. He attempts to reverse these class distinctions by arguing that 'inside which had been traditionally regarded as the only room tenantable by gentlemen, was, in fact, the coal-cellar in disguise' (187). \n            The secondary material on de Quincey is quite extensive. In the last 15 years his work has been investigated from a number of different angles including poststructuralist approaches to language and his transitional status as a figure between Romanticism and Modernism.

    "abstract": "\n \n       \"Outwit, Outplay, Outlast\"\n      \"All entertainment has hidden meanings, revealing the nature of the culture that created it\" ( 6). This quotation has no greater relevance than for the most powerful entertainment medium of all: television. In fact, television has arguably become part of the \"almost unnoticed working equipment of civilisations\" (Cater 1). In other words, TV seriously affects our culture, our society, and our lives; it affects the way we perceive and approach reality (see Cantor and Cantor, 1992; Corcoran, 1984; Freedman, 1990; Novak, 1975). \n      In this essay, I argue that the American television programme Survivor is an example of how entertainment (TV in particular) perpetuates capitalistic ideologies. In other words, Survivor is a symptom of American economic culture, which is masked as an \"interpersonal game\". \n      I am operating under the assumption that television works \"ideologically to promote and prefer certain meanings of the world, to circulate some meanings rather than others, and to serve some interests rather than others\" (Fiske 20). I argue that Survivor promotes ideals on two levels: economic and social. On the economic level, it endorses the pursuit of money, fame, and successful careers. These values are prevalent in American society and have coalesced into the myth of the \"American Dream\", which stands for the opportunity for each individual to get ahead in life; someone can always become wealthy (see White, 1988; Cortes, 1982; Grambs, 1982; Rivlin, 1992). These values are an integral part of a capitalistic society, and, as I will illustrate later, Survivor is a symptom of these ideological values. On the second level, it purports preferred social strategies that are needed to \"win\" at the game of capitalism: forming alliances, lying, and deception. \n      Ideology \n      The discussion of ideology is critical if we are to better understand the function of Survivor in American culture. Ideologies are neither \"ideal\" nor \"spiritual,\" but rather material. Ideologies appear in specific social institutions and practices, such as cultural artefacts (Althusser, For Marx 232). In that way, everyone \"lives\" in ideologies. Pryor suggests that ideology in cultural practices can operate as a \"rhetoric of control\" by structuring the way in which people view the world:\n      Ideology `refracts' our social conditions of existence, structuring consciousness by defining for us what exists, what is legitimate and illegitimate, possible and impossible, thinkable and unthinkable. Entering praxis as a form of persuasion, ideology acts as a rhetoric of control by endorsing and legitimising certain economic, social and political arrangements at the expense of others and by specifying the proper role and position of the individual within those arrangements. (4) \n      Similarly, Althusser suggests, \"ideology is the system of ideas and representations which dominate the mind of a man or a social group\" (Ideology 149). Thus, ideology, for Althusser, represents the way individuals \"live\" their relations to society (Eagleton 18). \n      Grossberg suggests, \"within such positions, textuality is a productive practice whose (imaginary) product is experience itself. Experience can no longer serve as a mediation between the cultural and the social since it is not merely within the cultural but is the product of cultural practices\" (409). The \"text\" for study, then, becomes the cultural practices and structures, which determine humans. Althusser concludes that ideology reifies our affective, unconscious relations with the world, and determines how people are pre-reflectively bound up in social reality (Eagleton 18). \n      Survivor as a Text \n      In the United States, the \"reality TV\" genre of programming, such as The Real World, Road Rules, and Big Brother (also quite famous in Europe), are currently very popular. Debuting in May, 2000, Survivor is one of the newest additions to this \"reality programming.\" \n     Survivor is a game, and its theme is: \"Outwit, Outplay, Outlast\". The premise is the following: \n      \n      Sixteen strangers are \"stranded\" on a remote island in the South China Sea. They are divided into two \"tribes\" of eight, the \"Pagong\" and \"Tagi.\" They have to build shelter, catch food, and establish a \"new society\". They must work together as a team to succeed, but ultimately, they are competitors. The tribes compete in games for \"rewards\" (luxury items such as food), and also for \"immunity\". Every third day, they attend a \"tribal council\" in which they vote one member off the island. Whoever won the \"immunity challenge\" (as a tribe early in the show, later, as an individual) cannot be voted off. After several episodes, the two tribes merge into one, \"Rattana,\" as they try to \"outwit, outlast, and outplay\" the other contestants. The ultimate prize is $1,000,000. \n      The Case of Survivor\n      As Althusser (For Marx) and Pryor suggest, ideology exists in cultural artefacts and practices. In addition, Pryor argues that ideology defines for us what is \"legitimate and illegitimate,\" and \"thinkable and unthinkable\" by \"endorsing certain economic and social arrangements\" (4). This is certainly true in the case of Survivor. The programme is definitely a cultural artefact that endorses certain practices. In fact, it defines for us the \"preferred\" economic and social arrangements. The show promotes for us the economic arrangement of \"winning\" money. It also defines the social arrangements that are legitimate, thinkable, and necessary to win the interpersonal and capitalistic game. First, let us discuss the economic arrangements that Survivor purports. \n      The economic arrangements that Survivor perpetuates are in direct alignment with those of the \"game\" of capitalism: to \"win\" money, success, and/or fame (which will lead to money). While Richard, the $1,000,000 prize winner, is the personification of the capitalistic/American Dream come true, the other contestants certainly have had their share of money and fame. \n      For example, after getting voted off the island, many of the former cast members appeared on the \"talk show circuit\" and have done many paid interviews. Joel Klug has done approximately 250 interviews (Abele, Alexander and Lasswell 62), and Stacey Stillman is charging $1200 for a \"few quotes,\" and $1800 for a full-length interview (Millman et al. 16). Jenna Lewis has been busy with paid television engagements that require cross country trips (Abele, Alexander and Lasswell 63). In addition, some have made television commercials. Both B. B. Andersen and Stacey Stillman appeared in Reebok commercials that were aired during the remaining Survivor episodes. \n      Others are making their way even farther into Hollywood. Most have their own talent agents who are getting them acting jobs. For example, Sean Kenniff is going to appear in a role on a soap opera, and Gervase Peterson is currently \"sifting through offers\" to act in television situation comedies and movies. Dirk Been has been auditioning for movie roles, and Joel Klug has moved to Los Angeles to \"become a star\". Even Sonja Christopher, the 63-year-old breast cancer survivor and the first contestant voted off, is making her acting debut in the television show, Diagnosis Murder (Abele, Alexander and Lasswell 57). \n      Finally, two of the women contestants from Survivor were also tempted with a more \"risky\" offer. Both Colleen Haskell and Jenna Lewis were asked to pose for Playboy magazine. While these women are certainly attractive, they are not the \"typical-looking\" playboy model. It is obvious that their fame has put them in the mind of Hugh Heffner, the owner of Playboy. No one is revealing the exact amount of the offers, but rumours suggest that they are around $500,000. Thus, it is clear that even though these contestants did not win the $1,000,000, they are using their famous faces to \"win\" the capitalistic game anyway. \n      Not only does Survivor purport the \"preferred\" economic arrangements, it also defines for us the social arrangements needed to win the capitalistic game: interpersonal strategy. The theme of the strategy needed to win the game is \"nice guys don't last\". This is demonstrated by the fact that Gretchen, a nice, strong, capable, and nurturing \"soccer mother\" was the seventh to be voted off the island. There were also many other \"nice\" contestants who were eventually voted off for one reason or another. \n      However, on the other hand, Richard, the million-dollar winner, used \"Machiavellian smarts\" to scheme his way into winning. After the final episode, he said, \"I really feel that I earned where I am. The first hour on the island I stepped into my strategy and thought, 'I'm going to focus on how to establish an alliance with four people early on.' I spend a lot of time thinking about who people are and why they interact the way they do, and I didn't want to just hurt people's feelings or do this and toss that one out. I wanted this to be planned and I wanted it to be based on what I needed to do to win the game. I don't regret anything I've done or said to them and I wouldn't change a thing\" (Hatch, n.pag.). \n      One strategy that worked to Richard's advantage was that upon arriving to the island, he formed an alliance with three other contestants: Susan, Rudy, and Kelly. They decided that they would all vote the same person off the island so that their chances of staying were maximised. Richard also \"chipped in\", did some \"dirty work\", and ingratiated himself by being the only person who could successfully catch fish. He also interacted with others strategically, and decided who to vote off based on who didn't like him, or who was more likeable than him (or the rest of the alliance). \n      Thus, it is evident that being part of an alliance is definitely needed to win this capitalistic game, because the four people who were part of the only alliance on the island were the final contestants. In fact, in Rudy's (who came in third place) final comments were, \"my advice for anybody who plays this game is form an alliance and stick with it\" (Boesch, n.pag.). This is similar to corporate America, where many people form \"cliques\", \"alliances\", or \"particular friendships\" in order to \"get ahead\". Some people even betray others. We definitely saw this happen in the programme. \n      This leads to another essential ingredient to the social arrangements: lying and deception. In fact, in episode nine, Richard (the winner) said to the camera, \"outright lying is essential\". He also revealed that part of his strategy was making a big deal of his fishing skills just to distract attention from his schemings. He further stated, \"I'm not still on the island because I catch fish, I'm here because I'm smart\" (qtd. in Damitol, n.pag.). For example, he once thought the others did not appreciate his fishing skills. Thus, he decided to stop fishing for a few days so that the group would appreciate him more. It was seemingly a \"nasty plan\", especially considering that at the time, the other tribe members were rationing their rice. However, it was this sort of behaviour that led him to win the game. \n      Another example of the necessity for lying is illustrated in the fact that the alliance of Richard, Rudy, Sue, and Kelly (the only alliance) denied to the remaining competitors that they were scheming. Sue even blatantly lied to the Survivor host, Jeff Probst, when he asked her if there was an alliance. However, when talking to the cameras, they freely admitted to its existence. \n      While the alliance strategy worked for most of the game, in the end, it was destined to dissolve when they had to start voting against each other. So, just as in a capitalistic society, it is ultimately, still \"everyone for her/himself\". The best illustration of this fact is the final quote that Kelly made, \"I learned early on in the game [about trust and lying]. I had befriended her [Sue -- part of Kelly's alliance]; I trusted her and she betrayed me. She was lying to me, and was plotting against me from very early on. I realised that and I knew that. Therefore I decided not to trust her, not to be friends with her, not to be honest with her, for my own protection\" (Wiglesworth, n.pag.). Therefore, even within the winning alliance, there was a fair amount of distrust and deception. \n      Conclusion \n      In conclusion, I have demonstrated how Survivor promotes ideals on two levels: economic and social. On the economic level, it endorses the pursuit of money, fame, and successful careers. On the social level, it purports preferred interpersonal strategies that are needed to \"win\" at the game of capitalism. In fact, it promotes the philosophy that \"winning money at all costs is acceptable\". We must win money. We must lie. We must scheme. We must deceive. We must win fame. Whether or not the audience interpreted the programme this way, what is obvious to everyone is the following: six months ago, the contestants on Survivor were ordinary American citizens; now they are famous and have endless opportunities for wealth. \n          \n      References \n      \n Abele, R., M.

    "abstract": "\n      Newspapers and the 7:15 Showing\n      Cinemagoing involves planning. Even in the most impromptu instances, one\n        has to consider meeting places, line-ups and competing responsibilities. \n        One arranges child care, postpones household chores, or rushes to finish\n        meals. One must organise transportation and think about routes, traffic,\n        parking or public transit. And during the course of making plans for a\n        trip to the cinema, whether alone or in the company of others, typically\n        one turns to locate a recent newspaper. Consulting its printed page lets\n        us ascertain locations, a selection of film titles and their corresponding\n        show times. In preparing to feed a cinema craving, we burrow through a\n        newspaper to an entertainment section, finding a tableau of information\n        and promotional appeals. Such sections compile the mini-posters of movie\n        advertisements, with their truncated credits, as well as various reviews\n        and entertainment news. We see names of shopping malls doubling as names\n        of theatres. We read celebrity gossip that may or may not pertain to the\n        film selected for that occasion. We informally rank viewing priorities\n        ranging from essential theatrical experiences to those that can wait for\n        the videotape release. We attempt to assess our own mood and the taste of\n        our filmgoing companions, matching up what we suppose are appropriate\n        selections. Certainly, other media vie to supplant the newspaper's role\n        in cinemagoing; many now access on-line sources and telephone services\n        that offer the crucial details about start times. Nonetheless, as a\n        campaign by the Newspaper Association of America in Variety aimed to\n        remind film marketers, 80% of cinemagoers refer to newspaper listings for\n        times and locations before heading out. The accuracy of that\n        association's statistics notwithstanding, for the moment, the local daily\n        or weekly newspaper has a secure place in the routines of cinematic life. \n      A basic impetus for the newspaper's role is its presentation of a\n        schedule of show times. Whatever the venue -- published, phone or on-line\n        -- it strikes me as especially telling that schedules are part of the\n        ordinariness of cinemagoing. To be sure, there are those who decide what\n        film to see on site. Anecdotally, I have had several people comment\n        recently that they no longer decide what movie to see, but where to see a\n        (any) movie. Regardless, the schedule, coupled with the theatre's\n        location, figures as a point of coordination for travel through community\n        space to a site of film consumption. The choice of show time is governed\n        by countless demands of everyday life. How often has the timing of a film\n        -- not the film itself, the theatre at which it's playing, nor one's\n        financial situation --determined one's attendance? How familiar is the\n        assessment that show times are such that one cannot make it, that the film\n        begins a bit too earlier, that it will run too late for whatever reason,\n        and that other tasks intervene to take precedence? \n      I want to make several observations related to the scheduling of film\n        exhibition. Most generally, it makes manifest that cinemagoing involves\n        an exercise in the application of cinema knowledge -- that is, minute,\n        everyday facilities and familiarities that help orchestrate the\n        ordinariness of cultural life. Such knowledge informs what Michel de\n        Certeau characterises as \"the procedures of everyday creativity\" (xiv). \n        Far from random, the unexceptional decisions and actions involved with\n        cinemagoing bear an ordering and a predictability. Novelty in audience\n        activity appears, but it is alongside fairly exact expectations about the\n        event. The schedule of start times is essential to the routinisation of\n        filmgoing. Displaying a Fordist logic of streamlining commodity\n        distribution and the time management of consumption, audiences circulate\n        through a machine that shapes their constituency, providing a set time for\n        seating, departure, snack purchases and socialising. Even with the\n        staggered times offered by multiplex cinemas, schedules still lay down a\n        fixed template around which other activities have to be arrayed by the\n        patron. As audiences move to and through the theatre, the schedule\n        endeavours to regulate practice, making us the subjects of a temporal\n        grid, a city context, a cinema space, as well as of the film itself. To be\n        sure, one can arrive late and leave early, confounding the schedule's\n        disciplining force. Most importantly, with or without such forms of\n        evasion, it channels the actions of audiences in ways that consideration\n        of the gaze cannot address. Taking account of the scheduling of cinema\n        culture, and its implication of adjunct procedures of everyday life,\n        points to dimensions of subjectivity neglected by dominant theories of\n        spectatorship. \n      To be the subject of a cinema schedule is to understand one assemblage of\n        the parameters of everyday creativity. It would be foolish to see cinema\n        audiences as cattle, herded and processed alone, in some crude Gustave\n        LeBon fashion. It would be equally foolish not to recognise the manner in\n        which film distribution and exhibition operates precisely by constructing\n        images of the activity of people as demographic clusters and generalised\n        cultural consumers. The ordinary tactics of filmgoing are supplemental\n        to, and run alongside, a set of industrial structures and practices. \n        While there is a correlation between a culture industry's imagined\n        audience and the life that ensues around its offerings, we cannot neglect\n        that, as attention to film scheduling alerts us, audiences are subjects of\n        an institutional apparatus, brought into being for the reproduction of an\n        industrial edifice. \n      Streamline Audiences\n      In this, film is no different from any culture industry. Film\n        exhibition and distribution relies on an understanding of both the market\n        and the product or service being sold at any given point in time. \n        Operations respond to economic conditions, competing companies, and\n        alternative activities. Economic rationality in this strategic process,\n        however, only explains so much. This is especially true for an industry\n        that must continually predict, and arguably give shape to, the \"mood\" and\n        predilections of disparate and distant audiences. Producers, distributors\n        and exhibitors assess which films will \"work\", to whom they will be\n        marketed, as well as establish the very terms of success. Without a doubt,\n        much of the film industry's attentions act to reduce this uncertainty;\n        here, one need only think of the various forms of textual continuity\n        (genre films, star performances, etc.) and the economies of mass\n        advertising as ways to ensure box office receipts. Yet, at the core of the\n        operations of film exhibition remains a number of flexible assumptions\n        about audience activity, taste and desire. These assumptions emerge from\n        a variety of sources to form a brand of temporary industry \"commonsense\",\n        and as such are harbingers of an industrial logic. \n      Ien Ang has usefully pursued this view in her comparative analysis of\n        three national television structures and their operating assumptions about\n        audiences. Broadcasters streamline and discipline audiences as part of\n        their organisational procedures, with the consequence of shaping ideas\n        about consumers as well as assuring the reproduction of the industrial\n        structure itself. She writes, \"institutional knowledge is driven toward\n        making the audience visible in such a way that it helps the institutions\n        to increase their power to get their relationship with the audience under\n        control, and this can only be done by symbolically constructing\n        'television audience' as an objectified category of others that can be\n        controlled, that is, contained in the interest of a predetermined\n        institutional goal\" (7). Ang demonstrates, in particular, how various\n        industrially sanctioned programming strategies (programme strips,\n      \"hammocking\" new shows between successful ones, and counter-programming to\n        a competitor's strengths) and modes of audience measurement grow out of,\n        and invariably support, those institutional goals. And, most crucially,\n        her approach is not an effort to ascertain the empirical certainty of\n      \"actual\" audiences; instead, it charts the discursive terrain in which the\n        abstract concept of audience becomes material for the continuation of\n        industry practices. \n      Ang's work tenders special insight to film culture. In fact, television\n        scholarship has taken full advantage of exploring the routine nature of\n        that medium, the best of which deploys its findings to lay bare\n        configurations of power in domestic contexts. One aspect has been\n        television time and schedules. For example, David Morley points to the\n        role of television in structuring everyday life, discussing a range of\n        research that emphasises the temporal dimension. Alerting us to the non-\n        necessary determination of television's temporal structure, he comments\n        that we \"need to maintain a sensitivity to these micro-levels of division\n        and differentiation while we attend to the macro-questions of the media's\n        own role in the social structuring of time\" (265). As such, the\n        negotiation of temporal structures implies that schedules are not\n        monolithic impositions of order. Indeed, as Morley puts it, they \"must be\n        seen as both entering into already constructed, historically specific\n        divisions of space and time, and also as transforming those pre-existing\n        division\" (266). Television's temporal grid has been address by others as\n        well. Paddy Scannell characterises scheduling and continuity techniques,\n        which link programmes, as a standardisation of use, making radio and\n        television predictable, 'user friendly' media (9). John Caughie refers to\n        the organization of flow as a way to talk about the national\n        particularities of British and American television (49-50). All, while\n        making their own contributions, appeal to a detailing of viewing context\n        as part of any study of audience, consumption or experience; uncovering\n        the practices of television programmers as they attempt to apprehend and\n        create viewing conditions for their audiences is a first step in this\n        detailing. \n      Why has a similar conceptual framework not been applied with the same\n        rigour to film? Certainly the history of film and television's\n        association with different, at times divergent, disciplinary formations\n        helps us appreciate such theoretical disparities. I would like to mention\n        one less conspicuous explanation. It occurs to me that one frequently sees\n        a collapse in the distinction between the everyday and the domestic; in\n        much scholarship, the latter term appears as a powerful trope of the\n        former. The consequence has been the absenting of a myriad of other -- if\n        you will, non-domestic -- manifestations of everyday-ness, unfortunately\n        encouraging a rather literal understanding of the everyday. The\n        impression is that the abstractions of the everyday are reduced to daily\n        occurrences. \n      Simply put, my minor appeal is for the extension of this vein of\n        television scholarship to out-of-home technologies and cultural forms,\n        that is, other sites and locations of the everyday. In so doing, we pay\n        attention to extra-textual structures of cinematic life; other regimes of\n        knowledge, power, subjectivity and practice appear. Film audiences\n        require a discussion about the ordinary, the calculated and the casual\n        practices of cinematic engagement. Such a discussion would chart\n        institutional knowledge, identifying operating strategies and recognising\n        the creativity and multidimensionality of cinemagoing. What are the\n        discursive parameters in which the film industry imagines cinema\n        audiences? What are the related implications for the structures in which\n        the practice of cinemagoing occurs? \n      Vectors of Exhibition Time\n      One set of those structures of audience and industry practice involves\n        the temporal dimension of film exhibition. In what follows, I want to\n        speculate on three vectors of the temporality of cinema spaces (meaning\n        that I will not address issues of diegetic time). Note further that my\n        observations emerge from a close study of industrial discourse in the U.S.\n        and Canada. I would be interested to hear how they are manifest in other\n        continental contexts. \n      First, the running times of films encourage turnovers of the audience\n        during the course of a single day at each screen. The special event of\n        lengthy anomalies has helped mark the epic, and the historic, from\n        standard fare. As discussed above, show times coordinate cinemagoing and\n        regulate leisure time. Knowing the codes of screenings means\n        participating in an extension of the industrial model of labour and\n        service management. \n      Running times incorporate more texts than the feature presentation alone.\n        Besides the history of double features, there are now advertisements,\n        trailers for coming attractions, trailers for films now playing in\n        neighbouring auditoriums, promotional shorts demonstrating new sound\n        systems, public service announcements, reminders to turn off cell phones\n        and pagers, and the exhibitor's own signature clips. A growing focal\n        point for filmgoing, these introductory texts received a boost in 1990,\n        when the Motion Picture Association of America changed its standards for\n        the length of trailers, boosting it from 90 seconds to a full two minutes\n        (Brookman). \n      This intertextuality needs to be supplemented by a consideration of inter-\n        media appeals. For example, advertisements for television began appearing\n        in theatres in the 1990s. And many lobbies of multiplex cinemas now offer\n        a range of media forms, including video previews, magazines, arcades and\n        virtual reality games. Implied here is that motion pictures are not the\n        only media audiences experience in cinemas and that there is an explicit\n        attempt to integrate a cinema's texts with those at other sites and\n        locations. \n      Thus, an exhibitor's schedule accommodates an intertextual strip,\n        offering a limited parallel to Raymond Williams's concept of \"flow\",\n        which he characterised by stating -- quite erroneously -- \"in all\n        communication systems before broadcasting the essential items were\n        discrete\" (86-7). Certainly, the flow between trailers, advertisements\n        and feature presentations is not identical to that of the endless, ongoing\n        text of television. There are not the same possibilities for\n      \"interruption\" that Williams emphasises with respect to broadcasting flow.\n        Further, in theatrical exhibition, there is an end-time, a time at which\n        there is a public acknowledgement of the completion of the projected\n        performance, one that necessitates vacating the cinema. This end-time is\n        a moment at which the \"rental\" of the space has come due; and it harkens a\n        return to the street, to the negotiation of city space, to modes of public\n        transit and the mobile privatisation of cars. Nonetheless, a schedule\n        constructs a temporal boundary in which audiences encounter a range of\n        texts and media in what might be seen as limited flow. \n      Second, the ephemerality of audiences -- moving to the cinema, consuming\n        its texts, then passing the seat on to someone else -- is matched by the\n        ephemerality of the features themselves. Distributors' demand for\n        increasing numbers of screens necessary for massive, saturation openings\n        has meant that films now replace one another more rapidly than in the\n        past. Films that may have run for months now expect weeks, with fewer\n        exceptions. Wider openings and shorter runs have created a cinemagoing\n        culture characterised by flux. The acceleration of the turnover of films\n        has been made possible by the expansion of various secondary markets for\n        distribution, most importantly videotape, splintering where we might find\n        audiences and multiplying viewing contexts. Speeding up the popular in\n        this fashion means that the influence of individual texts can only be\n        truly gauged via cross-media scrutiny. \n      Short theatrical runs are not axiomatically designed for cinemagoers\n        anymore; they can also be intended to attract the attention of video\n        renters, purchasers and retailers. Independent video distributors,\n        especially, \"view theatrical release as a marketing expense, not a profit\n        center\" (Hindes &amp; Roman 16). In this respect, we might think of such\n        theatrical runs as \"trailers\" or \"loss leaders\" for the video release,\n        with selected locations for a film's release potentially providing\n        visibility, even prestige, in certain city markets or neighbourhoods. \n        Distributors are able to count on some promotion through popular consumer-\n        guide reviews, usually accompanying theatrical release as opposed to the\n        passing critical attention given to video release. Consequently, this\n        shapes the kinds of uses an assessment of the current cinema is put to;\n        acknowledging that new releases function as a resource for cinema\n        knowledge highlights the way audiences choose between and determine big\n        screen and small screen films. Taken in this manner, popular audiences\n        see the current cinema as largely a rough catalogue to future cultural\n        consumption. \n      Third, motion picture release is part of the structure of memories and\n        activities over the course of a year. New films appear in an informal and\n        ever-fluctuating structure of seasons. The concepts of summer movies and\n        Christmas films, or the opening weekends that are marked by a holiday,\n        sets up a fit between cinemagoing and other activities -- family\n        gatherings, celebrations, etc. Further, this fit is presumably resonant\n        for both the industry and popular audiences alike, though certainly for\n        different reasons. The concentration of new films around visible holiday\n        periods results in a temporally defined dearth of cinemas; an inordinate\n        focus upon three periods in the year in the U.S. and Canada -- the last\n        weekend in May, June/July/August and December -- creates seasonal\n        shortages of screens (Rice-Barker 20). In fact, the boom in theatre\n        construction through the latter half of the 1990s was, in part, to deal\n        with those short-term shortages and not some year-round inadequate\n        seating. \n      Configurations of releasing colour a calendar with the tactical\n        manoeuvres of distributors and exhibitors. Releasing provides a\n        particular shape to the \"current cinema\", a term I employ to refer to a\n        temporally designated slate of cinematic texts characterised most\n        prominently by their newness. Television arranges programmes to\n        capitalise on flow, to carry forward audiences and to counter-programme\n        competitors' simultaneous offerings. Similarly, distributors jostle with\n        each other, with their films and with certain key dates, for the limited\n        weekends available, hoping to match a competitor's film intended for one\n        audience with one intended for another. Industry reporter Leonard Klady\n        sketched some of the contemporary truisms of releasing based upon the\n        experience of 1997. He remarks upon the success of moving Liar, Liar (Tom\n        Shadyac, 1997) to a March opening and the early May openings of Austin\n        Powers: International Man of Mystery (Jay Roach, 1997) and Breakdown\n        (Jonathan Mostow, 1997), generally seen as not desirable times of the year\n        for premieres. He cautions against opening two films the same weekend,\n        and thus competing with yourself, using the example of Fox's Soul Food\n        (George Tillman, Jr., 1997) and The Edge (Lee Tamahori, 1997). While\n        distributors seek out weekends clear of films that would threaten to\n        overshadow their own, Klady points to the exception of two hits opening on\n        the same date of December 19, 1997 -- Tomorrow Never Dies (Roger\n        Spottiswoode, 1997) and Titanic (James Cameron, 1997). Though but a\n        single opinion, Klady's observations are a peek into a conventional strain\n        of strategising among distributors and exhibitors. Such planning for the\n        timing and appearance of films is akin to the programming decisions of\n        network executives. And I would hazard to say that digital cinema,\n        reportedly -- though unlikely -- just on the horizon and in which texts\n        will be beamed to cinemas via satellite rather than circulated in prints,\n        will only augment this comparison; releasing will become that much more\n        like programming, or at least will be conceptualised as such. \n      To summarize, the first vector of exhibition temporality is the\n        scheduling and running time; the second is the theatrical run; the third\n        is the idea of seasons and the \"programming\" of openings. These are just\n        some of the forces streamlining filmgoers; the temporal structuring of\n        screenings, runs and film seasons provides a material contour to the\n        abstraction of audience. Here, what I have delineated are components of\n        an industrial logic about popular and public entertainment, one that\n        offers a certain controlled knowledge about and for cinemagoing audiences. \n      Shifting Conceptual Frameworks\n      A note of caution is in order. I emphatically resist an interpretation\n        that we are witnessing the becoming-film of television and the becoming-tv\n        of film. Underneath the \"inversion\" argument is a weak brand of\n        technological determinism, as though each asserts its own essential\n        qualities. Such a pat declaration seems more in line with the mythos of\n        convergence, and its quasi-Darwinian \"natural\" collapse of technologies. \n        Instead, my point here is quite the opposite, that there is nothing\n        essential or unique about the scheduling or flow of television; indeed,\n        one does not have to look far to find examples of less schedule-dependent\n        television. What I want to highlight is that application of any term of\n        distinction -- event/flow, gaze/glance, public/private, and so on -- has\n        more to do with our thinking, with the core discursive arrangements that\n        have made film and television, and their audiences, available to us as\n        knowable and different. So, using empirical evidence to slide one term\n        over to the other is a strategy intended to supplement and destabilise the\n        manner in which we draw conclusions, and even pose questions, of each. \n      What this proposes is, again following the contributions of Ien Ang, that\n        we need to see cinemagoing in its institutional formation, rather than\n        some stable technological, textual or experiential apparatus. The\n        activity is not only a function of a constraining industrial practice or\n        of wildly creative patrons, but of a complex inter-determination between\n        the two. Cinemagoing is an organisational entity harbouring, reviving and\n        constituting knowledge and commonsense about film commodities, audiences\n        and everyday life. An event of cinema begins well before the dimming of\n        an auditorium's lights. The moment a newspaper is consulted, with its\n        local representation of an internationally circulating current cinema, its\n        listings belie a scheduling, an orderliness, to the possible projections\n        in a given location. As audiences are formed as subjects of the current\n        cinema, we are also agents in the continuation of a set of institutions as\n        well. \n      \n          \n      References\n      \nAng, Ien.

    "abstract": "\n      What could it possibly mean when a journal brazenly announces that its conceptual theme for an issue is the idea of \"Renew\"? Does it signal the first signs of panic, that M/C no longer has \"it\", whatever that elusive \"it\" might be? Could it indicate that M/C is in the first stages of deaththroes? Could it be some Stalinist or perhaps Maoist moment of cultural revolution and cleansing so that the editorial collective emerges more committed than ever to its mission? Or is it just another example of how marketing ploys have invaded all our discourses and made us appeal to idea of change in order to convince you that we are hip (as Dr Evil intoned in Austin Powers) with it and relevant to these crazy mixed-up times.\n      Well, you would all be right. We wanted to renew the mandate of M/C. We still want to move ideas outward in our study of popular culture in all its manifestations and allow the journal to keep straddling the line between the popular and the academic. Although we have on occasion veered to the discourses of academic disciplines, we have tried to maintain a sensibility about how ideas can migrate and not be cloistered behind the professionalisation of cultural knowledge. We have provided a platform for understanding the shifts in contemporary culture as new media become more central to the rearticulation of our cultural experiences. And we have tried to maintain a thematic approach to critical engagement and allowed those concepts and themes to motivate a lateral patterning of thinking for our writers and readers.\n      There is no question that our strategy has been successful. We have a regular and widely international readership. We have an incredibly international list of contributors to M/C which has given the journal an enviable international and national profile in the field of media and cultural studies. But we want more. We want to be more engaging, more widely read and actively making ideas move from the intellectual periphery to the cultural and political hearths. The 'renew' issue underlines this mandate and attempts to reinvigorate the journal with its original style posture and acknowledgement of its now international contributors. Part of this issue is designed as a moment of self-reflection by those first M/C writers, not so much on the journal itself but more generally on the concept of renewal. The other part of the issue is collected from submissions made to this theme from other writers. What we have produced is a powerful double-shot of perceptive ponderings on renewal in and around media and culture.\n      Opening the issue, Adam Dodd's \"'Unacceptable Renewals': The Geopolitics of Martian Cartography\" uses the Mars face controversy as a looking glass through which to critique the broader science of cartography, the technologies actualising this science, and the politicised discourses of the people who practice Martian cartographies. The article demonstrates that the values of truth ascribed to cartographic objects are realised through practices that are not free-floating, but located and relocated institutionally and politically (amounting to the same thing).\n      The geopolitics of transportation are explored in Felicity Meakins's \"Reknowing the Bicycle; Renewing its Space\", which considers the early impacts of the bicycle on our land- and cityscapes, before the motor car made its presence felt. With the resurgence of cycling as a means of transportation as well as recreation, Meakins suggests, some of these effects may be renewed.\n      In \"Virtual Domesticity: Renewing Cybernetic Living Environments\", Nick Caldwell moves from discussing cyberspace in terms of how it manipulates the real to suggesting how the real can \"colonise\" cyberspace. Caldwell relates the personal computer to metaphors of domestic space, suggesting that we relate to the PC in ways which reflect our own manipulation of living space. He begins by noting the work space/computer space parallels used in the Windows operation system, through filing icons etc., and then moves to the home analogy. The manipulation of the domestic space is explained more specifically in a descriptive comparison between moving house and reinstalling Windows, spring cleaning and defragmenting, and the audio/visual control panels which bear a remarkable resemblance to the average home hi-fi system.\n      In \"Dash or Slash?: Renewing the Link between Media and Culture\", M/C's outgoing Production Editor Axel Bruns ruminates on some issues that surrounded the naming of the journal nearly three years ago -- looking at the name \"M/C\" and the implications that pesky \"/\" has had for information structuring conventions on the World Wide Web and computer systems in general. What does a slash between the terms reveal about our conceptions of media and/or culture, and of the links between them?\n      P. David Marshall's \"Renewing Cultural Studies\" offers two essays for the price of one. In one of them, he suggests that the project of cultural studies can be described as the study of recombinant culture, which inherently engenders its own renewals of theory, policy and practice. Following on from this, his second essay engages with the study of cultural production as it occurs on the side of the audience. New media technologies are constantly renewing the relationships between 'producer' and 'audience', enabling a far more active audience role, and a stronger focus of cultural studies on this area might also renew cultural studies' own interests.\n     Some of the themes raised in these articles from the original M/C contributors are also taken up in the other submissions that complete this issue. In \"One or Many Media?\", Steven Maras also uses M/C's title slash to begin a discussion of the tensions between those treacherously similar terms 'medium', 'media', and 'the media'. In an effort to tease out the fine distinctions separating them, he traces the conceptual frameworks attached to each term, uncovering their complex interrelationships.\n      \n      The spirit of Marx's Grundrisse resonates throughout Janin Hadlaw's comparison of the discourses surrounding newer communications technologies with those which accompanied the emergence of the telephone. In \"Plus Que Ça Change: The Telephone and the History of the Future\", the material and social realities which provide the emergence of new technologies with their historical footing are also mobilised as a legitimate ground from which a notion of ongoing renewal in the field of techno-communications can be advanced.\n      Finally, Steven Mizrach focusses on another ubiquitous form of communications technology in \"Natives on the Electronic Frontier\". Taking apart an older anthropological position around media and traditional culture -- that media such as television and radio destroy the authenticity and community roots of a society -- the author works through a preliminary reading of how television can be a source for the renewal of the languages and crafts of an Amerindian community.\n      So, at the end of the first three volumes of M/C - A Journal of Media and Culture, this mixed issue with articles from a number of new as well as some of our longest-serving contributors demonstrates that we've achieved a resonance of ideas between our editorial collective and an impressive list of world-wide collaborators -- as well as, hopefully, with our readers. The coming year will see a number of significant changes in M/C, enabling us to face our future with renewed energy and continue on our mission to connect the popular and the academic; we are not going away, although we are constantly renewing ourselves with each issue and we encourage others to join in this continual process of engaged critical analysis of contemporary culture...\n      Team M/C\n          \n      Citation reference for this article  \n      MLA style:\n      \n Team M/C. \"Editorial: 'Renew'.\" M/C: A Journal of Media and Culture 3.6 (2000).

    "title": "Odyssey Renewed",
    "abstract": "\n      The first home video-gaming console, the Magnavox Odyssey, was released in 1972. Its limited graphical capacities led Magnavox to ship it with a number of plastic overlays for the user's television that would admit a little variety into the then relatively crude gaming experience, limited to a built-in, Pong-like game. Computer and video games have come a long way since then, but it often seems as if critical approaches to gaming have continued shuffling through these plastic films, taking transformations of the screen, or on-screen events, for the whole of the gaming experience. It seems to me that reflection has been paralysed, becoming a discourse of regulation as it revolves around anxieties about gender, violence and narrative. I'd like to explore these anxieties as they've emerged in a few places, and then see if I can articulate the beginnings of an approach that might afford us a more complex, less pessimistic aesthetics of gaming. \n      Anxieties around gender are partly premised upon an evident difference in the types, frequency and extent of gameplay on the part of boys and girls. Recent Australian research suggests that while 76% of boys use home computers for gameplay, the proportion of girls who do the same is around 60% (Cuppitt and Stockbridge 1996). In addition, similar Australian research suggests that while 98% of 12-17 year old boys play games regularly, only around 89% of girls do (Durkin and Aisbett 2000). There is evidence that girls and boys favour different gaming genres (Durkin and Aisbett 2000), and there is little doubt that the magazines and Websites that operate so integrally within gaming cultures tend to hail and attract a mostly male audience. Evidence of this kind of gender split can be seen across the extant research, and from it the argument is often made that this gender imbalance implies a lifelong advantage for boys proceeding from an early pleasurable familiarity with computers. In addressing this problem, rather than confronting questions of access, and parental or teacherly responsibilities to guarantee equity of access for boys and girls, or even looking at issues of gender representation, many critics have instead argued that most games are fundamentally unsuited to the way girls play.\n      In a recent anthology, From Barbie To Mortal Kombat (1998), essentialist discourses of gender are deployed in assembling a consensus around what is termed the 'girls games movement'. Time and again in most of the assembled articles and interviews, claims are made that girls' and boys' interests and styles of play are fundamentally different. While boys allegedly favour destructive play, with an emphasis on mastery, control and competition, girls -- it's constantly asserted -- require collaboration and co-operation, an emphasis on feelings and discussion, a less competitive framework for play, and, above all, narrative. Repeatedly in the anthology, its impugned that games now do not encompass the narrative complexity or richness that girls need, and that girls are alienated from the violent 'twitch and kill' dynamic that pervades gaming.\n      Apart from the thoroughgoing essentialism -- which is brilliantly interrogated by the game-grrlz featured at the end of the anthology -- what troubles me about much of the anthology and much contemporary critical work on games is the implied moral demand that young people's game-culture begin to measure up to another generation's notions of 'appropriate' cultural experiences. A persistent trope in critical work on games -- from Jenkins's piece in the anthology (Jenkins 1998) to works like Marsha Kinder's Playing with Power (1991) -- is the parent-critic watching their children playing video games and becoming perplexed and worried about what is going on. The panic around the lack of 'girls games' -- apart from affording a lucrative opportunity to produce and market worthy material to concerned parents -- serves to authorise the 'correction' of young people's culture. The move from a critique of gaming -- one which rarely engages sympathetically with its pleasures -- to an attempt to inject strong, adult-devised narrative content into games is a move from speaking about gamers ('over their heads') to speaking for gamers.\n      This speaking-for, this flutter of panic has, I think, more than a little to do with an anxiety around the dissipation of cultural power. Theorists of moral panic like John Springhall tell us that moral panics function as attempts to preserve the intergenerational status quo and the cultural-critical hierarchy of a particular period (Springhall 1998). Catharine Lumby argues that new media are like force-fields that reorganise social relations in their wake, and that the anxieties they can inspire can tell us a lot about who feels threatened by such re-organisations, and why (Lumby 1997). Gaming is disturbing in that although it shares some features with other, more familiar visual media, it seems finally, stubbornly unassimilable to the modes of criticism that have developed in relation to those forms. Entrenched critical narratives of spectatorship, or the relationship between viewers, texts, meaning and the economies of cultural production don't seem to find any useful or lasting purchase here. No-one would now argue that televisual or cinematic experiences are passive, but gaming's requirement in principle for the player's direct physical participation in the production of cultural experience means that the old separations underpinning mechanisms of identification or notions of consuming audiences seem irritatingly awkward. Faced with these and other difficulties, criticism has tended to become mesmerised with what is shared -- the screen -- and to be at once frustrated and provoked by the enormous differences still inscribed there. While the close scrutiny of gender representations in gaming has uncovered some serious problems, alongside the demand for narrative we can also see it as part of an older generation's attempt to adapt familiar, free-floating critical modes and models to a group of media with which it has no apparent deep or pleasurable engagement. Faced with a radical analytical and critical failure, the lack of any pleasure to account for or recover, and the need to preserve a cultural and critical hierarchy premised upon the study of other media, it is perhaps inevitable that a desire to alter gaming -- to make it more familiar -- has arisen, and with it a critical discourse of regulation.\n      If we move beyond the screen, if we simply attend to what happens when we and others play games, we allow the possibility of a new aesthetics of gaming to emerge that moves beyond such desires for control. When we realise that what is almost never talked about in current critical work is the body of the player or the nature of machine-mediated play, a field begins to open that might allow us to talk about the uses and pleasures of gaming, and to see its various forms in a wider network of interactions. \n      Paradigm-cases for beginning the sorts of investigations I'm thinking of are those amazing arcade games, like Dance Dance Revolution, that enable and even require public performance and public display. Often positioned at the street entrances of arcades, these games usually attract passing crowds to stop and watch (male and female) players dancing in time with thumping tunes and on-screen instructions. Points are scored by closely matching foot placement with the directional arrows thrown up onto the small screen, but what really attracts the onlookers is the undeniable, individual -- and, strictly, unnecessary -- flair with which the dancers often execute their moves. What at the level of programming, and from an analysis of the screen alone, is the most rudimentary of narratives nevertheless mediates a thrilling and spectacular playful-performative display.\n      And this is where we begin to see that gaming pleasures do not, perhaps cannot, rely on finished or closed narratives. It seems to me that the undeniable popularity of gaming comes from the provision of endlessly recursive grammars and vocabularies for cyborg players to narrate performance, play and self. While many gaming genres and titles do include chunks of traditional narrative storytelling, it seems to me that these often simply embellish the distinctive pleasures of gaming, which require and enact the fundamental redistribution of authorial and narrative power. Gaming establishes a new relationship between perceptual fields and bodies -- a relationship fundamentally different from cinematic or televisual relationships. Associated with these pleasures and relationships is gaming's demand for an ontology -- a series of ontologies -- that can conceive of the moment of play as simultaneously social, mechanical, neither, both. Code and performance, programming and improvised play, when seen together in this way, make the demand for narrative -- ultimately premised upon the separation of consumer and product, spectator and image -- empty of any force. This is to say that when we begin to see the moment of gameplay as a hybrid one -- one where human and machine, play and code, text and reading, producer and consumer cannot be meaningfully distinguished -- we can then begin to see that its unfixed, unstriated forms of play demand a hybrid aesthetics. \n     Such a hybrid aesthetics would move beyond the screen alone to consider gaming's involvement in multiple networks, and thus come to a consideration of its pleasures and possibilities that avoided discourses of morality and control. What it would consider is not only the relationship between gaming and other forms of 'visual culture', but simultaneously its technological artefacts, its involvement with transnational industry, the physical dexterities and epistemologies it demands, the differing shapes of its collectives as it proliferates, its interactions with urban spaces, and its production of different kinds and mixtures of spectators, players, narratives and machines. This kind of Latourean anthropology, with its refusal to bracket gaming as another form of 'soft' culture, is a critical approach that will allow us some traction on gaming's slippery surface, as it allows us to talk about its complexity all at once. If we begin to see games as 'mediators -- that is, actors endowed with the ability to translate what they transport', who in turn 'associate, combine and redeploy countless actors' (Latour 1993), if we look beyond the screen and instead, following Wittgenstein, look for the meaning of games in their everyday social use, we will have begun to look at games in a way that is more interested in what they do, than in what they allegedly do not do. Carrying out this kind of aesthetic project will require not only an attention to the involvement of players' bodies in gaming, but to the patterns of games' dissemination, and to what players themselves say about the games they play.\n      \n      Such an approach need not, in opposing the pessimism that goes with screen-fetishism, veer toward the utopianism of so much cyber-rhetoric. If we take arguments like Latour's seriously, we will say not that gaming represents a revolutionary moment, but that there has always been a deep involvement between humans and our technologies, such that machines and humans constitute collectives for social action. An aesthetics of gaming that takes cognisance of this will short-circuit conveniently polarised debates, and clear space for a more interesting consideration of the networks and uses of gaming. Perhaps those of us who have keenly felt the pleasures and possibilities of gaming can extend a conversation that is no longer sifting through the Odyssey's yellowing transparencies.\n          \n      References\n      \nCassell, Justine and Henry Jenkins, eds.

    "abstract": "\n      Editors' Preface\n      When Ulf Wilhelmsson first contacted us about including his \"Dialogue on Film and Philosophy\" in the M/C 'chat' issue, we were initially taken aback. True, the notion of chat surely must include that of 'dialogue', but Wilhelmsson's idea, as he put it to us, was that of a Socratic dialogue about film. The dialogue \"Film och Filosofi\" already existed in Swedish, but he had done an initial rough translation of the dialogue on his Website. Since Wilhelmsson put this to us in the very early days of the submission period, we decided to have a look.\n      Wilhelmsson had omitted to mention the fact that his dialogue was amusing as well as informative. Playing Socrates was ... Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino was not just discussing film, but he was moderating a hefty grab-bag of influential philosphers, film-makers, film-scholars and the odd Beatle (John Lennon). Furthermore, creeping in to many of the utterances in the discussion was Wilhelmsson's take on Tarantino's vernacular -- keep an eye out for \"Bada boom bada boom, get it?\" and \"Oh Sartre. Dude, I would also like to provide a similar example\". The philosphers sometimes also get a chance to break out of their linguistic bonds, such as Herakleit, who tells us that \"War is the primogenitor of the whole shebang\". Occasionally, Wilhelmsson lets his conversants get rowdy (St Thomas of Aquinas and Aristotle yell \"Tabula Rasa!\" in unison), put on accents (Michel Chion with French accent: \"Merci merci. Je vous en pris that you are recognising tse sound\"), be \"dead sure of themselves\" (George Lakoff and Mark Johnson; Noam Chomsky thanks us for our attention) and wander in and out of the dialogue's virtual space (at the end, Immanuel Kant returns to us after his daily walk around town).\n      Unfortunately, due to its length, the dialogue can not be supplied in regular M/C 'bits', and so we have made it available as a downloadable Rich Text Format file.\n      Felicity Meakins &amp; E.

    "title": "Neither Male or Female",
    "abstract": "\n      Very large numbers of people habitually spend time interacting in online social spaces based on the software developed by Pavel Curtis for Lambda MOO. Although chatting is part of the functionality of these spaces, it is much richer than the functionality given by basic chat rooms. In particular, members of these spaces explicitly declare a gender within the space (I will call it their 'presenting gender'), which may or may not correspond with their offline gender. As well as the traditional options of \"male\" and \"female\", it is possible to choose presenting genders such as \"neutral\", \"royal\", or \"witch\". Around 35% of the members of Media MOO and 22% of Lambda MOO have a presenting gender that is neither \"male\" nor \"female\" (Danet).\n      I surveyed active citizens of another such space, Little Italy, by examining 400 characters that had accessed the space during the preceding month. Of these, 72 (18%) had a presenting gender other than \"male\", \"female\", and the default, \"neutral\" (assigned to Little Italians who haven't yet chosen a presenting gender). 11% had default presenting gender. I found that those who had a presenting gender 'other' than \"male\", \"female\", or the default were more likely to still be active in Little Italy a year later. This result holds at the 80% significance level -- in other words, there is a less than 1 in 5 probability that the difference observed could have arisen by chance if the distributions were in reality identical. In fact, 'other'-gendered active citizens were 23% more likely than \"male\" and 32% more likely than \"female\" active citizens to be still active a year later. This suggests that 'other'-gendered chat may be more a pleasant (or addictive) activity than male- or female-gendered chat. Amazingly, 49% of the 'other'-gendered citizens sampled were still active a year later. \n      This intrigued me, so I sent a message to currently active Little Italians with presenting genders other than male or female, asking them why they had chosen such a presenting gender. I had 28 responses. Quotations from the responses below are by permission, and translated from the Italian.\n      A popular idea amongst gender theorists (e.g. Stone) is that choosing a presenting gender other than \"male\" and \"female\" is a strategy for people who don't feel they fit precisely into gender stereotypes. This may include most of us to some degree. As the Kinks sang, \"girls will be boys and boys will be girls, it's a mixed-up, muddled-up, shook-up world, except for Lola\" -- where Lola has ambiguous presenting gender, and thus is the only non-mixed-up one. This is indeed the reason given by one respondent for choosing a presenting gender other than male or female: \"despite being a man, I feel very feminine (since I was small I've always wanted to be a woman)\". However, no other respondents gave this as their reason.\n      Another idea from the literature is that of \"gender masking\" (Jaffe et al. 11-2, and table 1). According to this theory, people, especially women, hide their gender online in order to avoid discrimination and harassment, or gender-related assumptions. Indeed, one respondent described his/her 'masked' character as \"a mind without sex or body, an entity without appearance, as insubstantial as a cloud of smoke\". On the other hand, the majority of other-gendered Little Italians give some clue that they are either male or female in their character descriptions, and most give some clue when speaking socially within Little Italy. Italian is an inflected language, and has many constructions that reveal whether the speaker is male or female -- it is rare (although not unknown) for a Little Italian to avoid these constructions or to use them ambiguously, as might be expected by someone masking their gender.\n      To consider another idea, Bruckman (also Reid ch. 3 iii) suggests that the online world can be an \"identity workshop\" (1), where people can emphasise particular aspects of their personality, or try out new personae, or experience what it is like to be someone completely different. Some Little Italians emphasise part of their real identity through their presenting gender, choosing for example to have a gender such as \"rebel\", \"dutch\", or \"angel\". One respondent suggested, \"I chose 'angel' because I help everyone who asks me -- and some who don't ask -- let's say I like being a guardian angel ;) and because my name is Michelangelo\". Other Little Italians choose 'other' presenting genders precisely because these genders do not have an offline equivalent. Their choice is a form of creativity or escapism. One such respondent asked, \"if everything is just like reality, what's the point of logging on?\" This creative aspect becomes clear in the more outré genders invented by Little Italians, such as \"\\V/amp!\" for a vampire character, which includes a visual reference to Dracula's high collar, and \"...nothing like the sun\" (the ellipsis is part of the gender).\n      One surprise was that several citizens became 'other'-gendered by accident! Offline it is difficult to have a sex-change without realising, but online a badly-designed interface can have this effect. 3% of the sample had gender \"me\", which is a side-effect of a particular mistake in the use of the space.\n      Another surprise was the joke gender. If you ask the system for information about a Little Italy character, one line of the answer is of the form \"Sex: &lt;the character's presenting gender&gt;\". Around 2% of the sample had presenting genders such as \"If only!\", \"Too much!!\", and \"Go ahead!!\". Several other citizens told me their genders were references to in-jokes amongst their online friends.\n     Some characters had an 'other' gender because the character portrayed was not a human being -- such as a duck with presenting gender \"duck\", and a character called Harley with presenting gender \"H-D\". Looking at the 'other' genders in the sample, I was struck by the diversity both of the genders themselves, and of the reasons for which they are chosen. There is no single motive valid for most 'other'-gendered citizens.\n      \n      I was also struck by their lightheartedness. Gender studies texts tend to treat the choice of presenting gender as something highly serious and important. Several writers deal with gender as performance (Butler interviewed by Osborne and Segal, 109-26) or masquerade (Danet) with playful and ironic characteristics (Haraway 149-81). These writers, however, tend to emphasise a serious purpose underlying the performance. Haraway talks of \"serious play\" (149) and Butler is interested in performing gender as a subversive practice that aims to undermine the dominant forms of gender. Little Italy shows that in online spaces this need not be the case. The Little Italian with presenting gender \"duck\" does not think of herself as a duck, she is not critiquing female stereotypes, she is not questioning the idea of femaleness, she is not hiding her offline gender to avoid harassment, she is not asserting her inner duckiness; she's just having a bit of fun. Little Italy is more of an identity playground than an identity workshop.\n      The creation of 'other' presenting genders in Little Italy is an example of the unexpectedly creative use of public space by members (in this case the space after Sex: in the character information) that was not originally designed with this use in mind. It is perhaps even more fascinating than other examples of folk art in unexpected places, such as graffiti, crop circles, bumper stickers or carved spoon handles, because of the clarity of its relationship with the artists' (lighthearted) construction of their identities.\n      'Stickiness' -- the likelihood of visitors to continue visiting a Website over an extended period of time -- is a quality much sought after by e-companies. Little Italy is very 'sticky' for all its citizens, but exceptionally so for other-gendered ones. In my opinion, it is the personal creative investment of the other-gendered citizens in Little Italy that makes them especially likely to remain active citizens. 'Other' presenting genders are possible in Little Italy because Pavel Curtis's software does not limit the options to male and female. This research suggests that designers and administrators of commercial Websites who want stickiness should avoid making assumptions about how their visitors may wish to present and express themselves. Rather, they should try to leave spaces open for their visitors' creativity. Many commercial Websites try to control and limit visitors' interaction, using forms and limited-choice menus. But if I am right about the stickiness of personal creative investment, then this may be a mistake. Creative empowerment of visitors may be better for the bottom line.\n          \n      Acknowledgements\n      \nGrazie ai cittadini e wiz di Little Italy, sopratutto a quelli citati, per loro aiuto e amichevolezza.\n      \nReferences\n      \n Bruckman, Amy. \"Identity Workshop: Emergent Social and Psychological Phenomena in Text-based Virtual Reality.\" Masters thesis, MIT Media Laboratory. 1992.\n         Danet, Brenda. \"Text as Mask: Gender and Identity on the Internet.\" Conference on \"Masquerade and Gendered Identity\".

    "title": "The Politics of a Country Culture",
    "abstract": "\n      Traditionally, the country way of life, the country worldview -- the country culture -- has been understood differently to the city way of life. Notions of rural have been represented in terms such as 'Eden', 'Arcadia', 'Golden Age', and associated with beauty, fertility, moral uprightness and authenticity. In contrast, notions of urban have been characterised by pollution, sterility, degeneration and artificiality. In Australia, the culture of the first white settlers developed out of this tradition, but with its own distinctive characteristics. The harshness and indomitability of the landscape became the means by which unique character, unifying myths of belonging and societal significance were constructed and asserted. In contrast to the communities of the country's original inhabitants, which were perceived as passive, unproductive and disconnected, the new culture was characterised by notions of 'land', 'masculinity', 'white', 'productive', 'homogenous' and 'nationalistic' (Moore 54; Turner 6; Ward; White 16ff.).\n      Defining the country worldview in contemporary Australia, however, is problematic. Question marks hang over the continued significance, even existence, of a specifically country culture. Post-war Australia has witnessed enormous economic and social changes, wrought by improved transport and communication networks, a shrinking rural population, and the decreasing importance of the agricultural industries. The steady decline in grass roots support for the National Party of Australia, traditional defender of the country way of life, suggests that the voting population no longer views the upholding of specifically pro-country policies as necessary to the well-being of the nation. Australia is now recognised as the most urbanised, sub-urbanised and multi-cultural of the western industrialised nations. Globalisation of the mass communications media has blurred the boundaries between rural, urban, state and national. Consequently, many argue that the differences between the country and city are now insignificant (for example, Aitkin 34-41). \n      Yet notions of country that are distinct, even definitive, continue to be represented in various urban-based communications industries, cultural policies, and the discourses of environmental politics and nationalism. Examples include John Laws's very popular Across Australia radio talk-back programme which celebrates the outback, the farmer and 'battler', and the 'True Blue' music of country artist John Williamson; the push by the Green movement to separate and protect wilderness areas of 'natural' bushland from the corrupting influences of human cultivation; and the continued significance of the 'bush' and 'bushman' in divers constructions of national cultural identity. Share and Lawrence argue that such representations are a state of mind rather than a state of being, \"in the imagination of the cosmopolis\" only (Share &amp; Lawrence 101). Imagined or otherwise, however, the evidence suggests that they are representations which are nevertheless there -- albeit constructed in varying ways, with varying emphases, and in a variety of settings. \n      Tamworth: Country at Heart \n      Jacka argues that it is the 'local', constructed by a specific set of forces and circumstances and operating within a particular time frame and place, that provides the best or most 'authentic' means of analysing notions of the 'country' (qtd. in Share &amp; Lawrence 102). Tamworth, situated in North Western New South Wales, approximately four hundred kilometres from Sydney, is one such 'authentic' locality. \n      The city of Tamworth and its surrounding hinterland is populated by some 55,000 people. Timber and farmland constitute 95% of its land use. Agricultural production generates the bulk of its net income. The Tamworth electoral district has been designated 'country' by the State Electoral Office. Promotional billboards erected by the Tamworth City Council and situated on all major highways into the city describe Tamworth as 'the heart of country'. Tamworth is renowned as 'the Country Music Capital of Australasia' and celebrates 'country' values annually through a highly successful Country Music Festival. Clearly, notions of country are significant in the shaping of how Tamworth is perceived as a community locally and nationally. These notions are an important component of the process of meaning generation, circulation and exchange inTamworth -- indeed, they are an important component of the essential fabric that constitutes the Tamworth culture. \n      Analysis \n      The Tamworth worldview was studied through an analysis of the coverage of the local NSW state election campaigns of 1995 and 1999 by Tamworth's only regional daily newspaper, the Northern Daily Leader. Regional daily newspapers are a useful means of analysing the major preoccupations of a culture. They contribute significantly to the construction and representation of the communities they serve: they are moulded by the specific needs of their communities; they are prominent influences of the norms, values and processes of these communities; they are the product of a community that is connected by common and local interests and knowledge, written with and by the people of this community (Mules et al. 242). The coverage of the 1995 and 1999 election campaigns represented a discrete sample of texts with a common focus. An important aspect of this focus was Mr Tony Windsor, Independent State Member for Tamworth. \n      Windsor's Independent status was significant to the study. Firstly, it suggests that he was elected to office on his own merits or on the merits of his policies, as against any particular party affiliation. Papadakis and Bean argue that a vote for an Independent most often represents a protest vote against the dominant players in the political system rather than any systemic approval of the policy positions or other qualities of the recipient (109). This may well have been the case for Windsor's initial victory in 1991. However, in the 1995 election he won an unprecedented 83% of the primary vote, representing voters from right across the political spectrum. He further increased his majority in the 1999 election. Windsor's extraordinary popularity suggests that his appeal cut across the political boundaries into the social and cultural realms. As such, Windsor embodies a singular means of analysing the socio-politico-cultural preoccupations of those he represents. \n      The study tracked story frequency and space, and analysed pictorial, headline and lead texts in terms of story focus, personal and thematic associations, and candidate agency. It was found that the Leader markedly privileged Windsor over his opponents in regards to story frequency and space. The pictorial and key word analyses identified Windsor's public persona as more active and more person-oriented than those of his opponents, and as associated more often with exterior settings, particularly those in or connected with 'bush' locations. This stood in contrast to the representations of his major ALP opponents. In both elections they were female, associated more with interior settings, and represented as speaking more than doing, passive more than active, and concerned more with their emotions and states of being than was Windsor. \n      Overall, the Leader's representation of Windsor was found to comprise the six notions noted above as being characteristic of the traditional country worldview. Windsor's connections with and concerns for the land and country issues were significant. The construction of male and female gender roles was masculinist in nature. The absence of any signifiers associated with notions of 'Aboriginality', 'ethnicity', even 'diversity', indicated the existence of naturalised discourses of 'white' and 'homogeneity'. Notions of productivity were evident through Windsor's preoccupation with the business and industry. Nationalism was implied through Windsor's association with characteristics that epitomise traditional understandings of what it is to be an Australian. \n      Two additional characteristics were also identified. The first of these was named 'Independent', as indicated through the significance placed upon Windsor's politically Independent status. It was defined by the traditional understandings of the country worldview and ideas of integrity, 'a fair go' for the country, and of giving power back to the people. In contrast, the major political parties, ALP and National Party, were associated with the city, corruption, interference, lack of democracy, the undermining of country values by city values, and a subordination of the country to the city. The second characteristic was named 'community'. It was indicated through ideas of belonging and like-mindedness, andWindsor's representation as friendly, person-oriented and concerned with the active provision of services for the people. \n      Implications \n      The Tamworth culture is characterised by the notions of 'land', 'masculinity', 'white', 'productive', 'homogenous', 'nationalistic', 'Independent' and 'community'. This very characterisation, however, is one that gives rise to a number of questions. What drove the Leader to construct and represent the Tamworth culture in this way? How did and does this particular characterisation serve the needs of the Tamworth people? How and why are these needs different to the needs of city people -- or even people in other rural communities? \n      Perhaps the best answer lies with the demonstrated longevity of the essential nature of the Tamworth worldview. Traditional notions of country have remained distinctive, even definitive, despite Australia's urbanisation, suburbanisation, multiculturalism; despite the enormous economic and social changes that have been wrought by globalisation; despite the consequent blurring of boundaries between rural, urban, state and national. This traditional nature, it seems, is resistant to change. \n      Yet there is also evidence that a blurring of boundaries, even change, has occurred in Tamworth. Examples include the fact that the combined income generated by secondary and tertiary industries in the Tamworth district is now greater than that generated by agriculture; Windsor, with whom the Leader so closely associates the land and other notions traditionally associated with the country, also holds a university degree in economics; the annual Country Music Festival is celebrated largely from within the confines of the city of Tamworth itself; Tamworth City Council and Country Music Festival both have sites on the World Wide Web, thereby connecting them with the very globalisation that the Leader would have them resisting. \n      Although this may suggest that the country has actually appropriated, even assimilated many of the notions that are most often associated with change in today's society, it also seems that this assimilation is one that is on the country's terms only. Notions of the city are subordinated to notions of the country. Change is appropriated, but in a way that maintains the status quo -- that perpetuates the essential country worldview, both locally and nationally. \n      Such evidence of change may also suggest that the Leader's representation of Windsor, of Tamworth, is perhaps a state of mind rather than a state of being. It is a representation that taps into the imagination of the people rather than their everyday existence. In so doing, it worked to position over 85% of the population into voting a particular way in the 1995 and 1999 NSW State elections. It may also work to draw the many people from around Australia who bring their tourist dollars into Tamworth each year to celebrate country values through the Country Music Festival. The Tamworth culture may well uphold a construction of Australian identity that is outside the direct experience of those who live on the coastal fringes, yet it provides an attractive, even desirable holiday destination for many. \n      Perhaps this is because people, country and city alike, continue to see the country as a place that offers them a simple solution to tensions and conflicts that are otherwise unresolvable. Change produces anxiety -- especially a postmodern change in which all semblances of certainty have been removed. On the other hand, the study suggests that the country worldview represents that which does not change. Its definitive nature stands in contrast and provides an alternative to the relativism of the city. Notions of country represent a surety in a world that is otherwise uncertain. \n          \n      References  \n      \nAitkin, D. \"Countrymindedness: The Spread of an Idea.\" Australian Cultural History 4 (1985): 34-41.      \n        Moore, A. \"The Old Guard and 'Countrymindedness' during the Great Depression.\" Journal of Australian Studies 27 (1990): 54.        \n        Mules, W., T.

    "abstract": "\n      Professional sport has always tried to entertain an audience to make money. Since the advent of the electronic mass media, the focus of the entertainment has shifted from the live audience to the remote. This has forced changes to the rules and structure of the more popular sports to increase their compatibility with the media. Although the driving force behind the alterations is ultimately economic profit, the nature of the changes is determined by the technological needs of the media. Many fans and devotees of particular sports see these changes as breaks with tradition which will have a detrimental effect on the future of their game. However, it could also be argued that \"the technology is the message\" (Potts 1) because sport has a long history of being changed by new technologies.\n      To gain a true understanding of why the focus of professional sport has shifted to the remote audience all you have to do is attend a match on a rainy day. Early this year I went to watch Essendon play the Sydney Swans at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The game was close until the last five minutes and was an extremely exciting spectacle, which would have had me on the edge of my seat if it weren't pouring. I didn't have an umbrella and I was trying to make sure no water got down between my jacket and the bottom of my seat. I was faced with an interesting emotional situation of enjoying a highly skilled game and wanting the whole pointless exercise to finish so I could get dry. I wished I'd stayed home and caught the game on TV.\n      Being wet and suddenly not knowing whether it was worth the effort annoyed me. The thought of TV made my mood worse because it was then that I noticed something for the first time. In Australian Rules, every time a goal is kicked the ball is returned to the centre of the field and bounced again to restart the game. I have memories of playing in many games where a goal was kicked and the ball raced back to the centre by an over-zealous umpire who then bounced the ball, smugly re-beginning the game before any of the actual players made it back. This was not happening at the SCG.\n      When the ball returned to the centre the umpire waited. Once he saw a light flashed from the Channel 7 box, he bounced the ball. I knew immediately what was going on from the number of times I'd watched a game on TV and it had restarted before the ad finished. The ad light was holding up the excitement of the game and prolonging my stay in the rain.\n      The umpire had to wait for the light to flash so the drama for the TV audience was heightened. Sport is perfectly suited to the medium of TV because \"the intrinsic properties of TV will favour expression, spectacle and emotion over reason and argument\" (Potts 8). Professional sport is almost entirely spectacle. The skills, the costumes and the physiques of the players all appeal to the public. The skills, the costumes, the physiques of the players all appeal to the public. The expressions on the faces of the players in close-up provoke emotion in the audience. The score has a narrative movement that creates a dramatic tension for the audience. Watching a delayed telecast, people go out of their way to not know the score in advance so that the tension and entertainment will be higher.\n      The relationship between sport, television and, to a lesser extent, other forms of media, \"is commonly described as the happiest of marriages\" (Rowe 32). The media offers exposure (which generates sponsorship) as well as rights fees. Sport offers the media an almost perfect composition. Viewers are drawn to watch because \"it presents a spectacle of content, drama, excitement and eventual resolution\" (Wilson 37).\n      The rate at which goals are kicked in Australian Rules allows the TV broadcaster regular opportunities to get on with its primary work: advertising. Before the flashing light was introduced, an advertisement would often finish after the game had restarted. The TV audience would be bought back to attention by the return of the program only to find the narrative already in progress.\n      With the light this is no longer the case. A goal is scored, the narrative moves, and an ad allows the viewer freedom to move around or change the channel (a vital requirement of the ease necessary in the medium). The viewer returns to see the tension mount again.\n     But what does this gain for the TV broadcaster? It is unlikely that this single change would determine a significant shift in audience size. A viewer may be momentarily put off by coming back to an already moving game but not to the point where they change channels. It doesn't affect the advertiser because their ad is played in full whatever happens. The light doesn't actually do anything to boost the broadcaster's income or ratings.\n      \n      It does, however, signify a change in the public consumption of professional sport. The focus of sport as entertainment has shifted from the live audience to the remote audience. The flashing light is not the first example. It simply stood out to me because of my background and the situation I was in. Most US sports have undergone tremendous change, affecting everything from the length of the game to the basic structure of the rules. Changes have occurred in these sports to suit the remote audience, via the media. This audience would rather stay at home and view a more detailed coverage in the comfort of their own home where the benefits far outweigh the losses. They have instant replays, commentary, statistics, no foul weather or uncomfortable seats and, most importantly, if the game turns out to be boring, they can watch something else. It is \"a more satisfying and pleasant way of experiencing sport\" (Rowe 147) and can attract new fans.\n      Professional sport is trying to appeal to a larger audience as a whole, trying to get its share of the ratings. Audience shares have become a medium of exchange: the larger the audience the greater the revenue. This audience needs to be constantly entertained to stop it from pressing another button on the remote.\n      But this is not the first example of technology changing the nature of sport. Every sport has been integrally linked with technology from its very beginning. As technologically induced change occurs in society it is reflected by changes in the nature of sport. Cricket is bound by the technology involved in the manufacture of the bat and the ball. As rubber developed and wood machining advanced, the bat advanced and batting became easier; as leather working advanced, the ball advanced and the bounce off the pitch became truer; as mechanical engines advanced, the lawn mower advanced and the ground became smoother and easier to play on. All these technological advances make changes to the way the game is played. The scientific study of physiology advanced the technology of the shoe and thereby athletics. The medically derived technology of the performance-enhancing drug changes almost all professional sports. The list goes on. Advances that affect society are reflected by professional sport. This encompasses more than just advances in materials and engineering processes. It includes the way culture follows economic systems and divides itself up into markets and work forces. Hence, the development of the professional sportsperson.\n      Sport must capture its market in order to survive and must be compatible with changes in culture. Information technology is becoming a force in most areas of our lives and is changing the way our culture operates. Sport will change along with this and will be modified by the introduction of digital technology and the Internet. Technology creates an excess of information which changes the consumption of sport which introduces an ad light at the SCG which makes (me) the viewer want to go home and watch the TV. The technology is the message.\n          \n      References\n      \nPotts, J. \"The Technology is the Message.\" Thinking Media. Ed. M. Wark. Sydney: Pluto Press, forthcoming.\n          Rowe, D.

    "abstract": "\n      There's something of an unspoken tendency in the field of conversation analysis to conflate the notion of 'conversation' with that of 'all forms of talk'.1 Hence the very positive efforts in the field to try to find the mechanisms behind what people do when they talk together, whenever they talk together, whoever they may happen to be, whatever the topic, whatever the type of talk. To stress: this is absolutely admirable and a great advance on, to name a few, social semiotics, speech-act theory and formal pragmatics. But is it possible that the various types of talk that we can find inside single conversations may be interesting and significant, not just for analysts but also for those who, as we hope to show, manifestly orient to generic changes within the conversations they are co-constructing? \n      One way of opening up this possibility is to try to contrast conversation with chat. Obviously some conversations can be all chat, and some not. Less obviously, some conversations might involve no chat whatsoever (because they have only 'business' to conduct). But for the most part, and this is our point, even the least 'chatty' conversations seem to be capable of switching into that genre. Our question is: what is occurring at such boundaries and, more importantly, how -- that is, as an effect of what possible general conversational mechanisms? \n      Here, we're taking 'chat' in its most widely accepted sense: as talk which is specifically informal and relaxed; the kind of talk that pretty much any co-conversationalists can do, even in the midst of the most serious 'business'. We're even sufficiently happy (at least as an initial approximation) with dictionary definitions of 'chat'. For example:\n      vi to talk easily or familiarly. -- vt (often with up) to talk informally and often flirtatiously in order to gain something, eg to cajole or seduce. (\"Chat\") \n      Naturally (though fans and exponents of the transitive verb), we are professionally interested in the intransitive definition. That is, we are not contrasting conversation with chatting (up) someone, rather we are contrasting it with the type of talk that chat is, as such. And one of our initial warrants for chat being a members' (rather than just an analysts') category is the fact that the term, 'chat' can be used ironically/euphemistically, thereby trading on its ubiquitous sense of informality. Hence, in police dramas like Wildside, Bill might suggest, ironically, to a suspect 'we'll go down to the station for a chat then', both meaning 'I'm going to interrogate the shit out of you' and clearly implying the rough-hewn violence common to that particular show. And, as it turns out, we can discover such euphemistic and/or ironical (if milder) usages in actual data. In the following fragment of psychological-assessment talk, for example, we can hear the assessor using 'chat' as a place-holder for the formal business of testing itself2:\n      \n      What follows is an actual instance of 'formal' talk alternating into and out of chat. This fragment is, by contrast, from a call to a software helpdesk.3\n      \n      We take it that any reader/analyst can hear the very distinct change of conversational genre the participants themselves orient to after the pause (between lines 6 and 7) when Paul asks 'still on holidays Hank?' And we take it that what can be heard is a 'switch of gears', as it were, from the formal business of the technical telephone conversation (formulated later as 'attack[ing] this Internet business') to informality, to the kind of chat that more or less any interlocutors can have. Our hypothesis, here, is that what chat can do inside formal talk (and though it may also do many other things besides) is to maintain the parties as being in a state of talk while, as far as the formal business is concerned, they mutually know they have 'nothing to talk about' -- for now, but must later. \n      In this case, we (and they) can hear the impending arrival of a state of 'nothing to talk about' as the computer screen (at Hank's end) goes into a long sub-routine of disinstalling large amounts of software. The gap of 26 seconds is, by any conversational standards4 -- and particularly on the phone -- an astronomically long time. (If in doubt, try pausing this long in a conversation without the possibility of its coming to completion.) The consultant (Paul) then actually has to formulate the pause with 'that's ticking over is it?' Both parties, that is, can discoverably hear that they're in for a long wait before the official business of the call can be returned to. Then, once the 'Direct show' message comes on, both know that the wait will be extremely long. However, this is the state (computer-wise) that both want to achieve, must achieve, and have oriented the conversation towards so far. Hence: 'Good' and a short pause from the Helpdesk consultant (Paul). Now the question is: what to do? Paul has already sat out a 26 second pause -- accountably audible as Hank's pause since he says he'll check something out (the 'Properties' on the C drive) but has not come back to him on the results of that check. Indeed, Hank's accountability is displayed as such by Paul's 'innocent' enquiry about the computer's state at turn #4. Can another such thing be tolerated without cessation of the call -- and at such a critical point for the business of the call? It's then a brilliant display of conversational aesthetics (not to mention timing) on Paul's part to go into 'still on holidays Hank?' -- thereby initiating a chat sequence as such, and knowing, as conversationalists do, that such matters (the weather, the state of one's life, how things are with one, etc.) are, as Sacks put it, inexhaustible, ultra-rich topics (Lectures 601-4). In this way, the chat sequence can be extended as long as it may happen to take for the business to be resumed -- for example, when the machine's sub-routine is over, and the work of fixing this 'Internet business' can be resumed. Note, for now, how elegantly the computer sub-routine synchronises with the conversational sub-routine: this is computer-mediated-conversation at its cutest. \n     But note at the same time that Hank is manifestly concerned that the business of the call could be endangered by a segue into 'mere' chat -- after all, he's paying for the call. His task is now: how to keep the chat going until his computer is back up for the next stage, without losing the business talk? So, in turn 8, he starts to re-segue the chat towards business talk: I'm on holiday, but it's a chance to get my own computer work done (he being a professional who routinely calls the helpline on behalf of others -- and known to the Helpdesk as a 'legend'). This is extremely neat as a way of handling both (a) topics (holidays and computers) and (b) talk-genres (formal helpline talk and chat). The line that runs 'I thought while I'm off I'll try and attack this Internet business' is particularly sweet as a way of managing this, as it were, interface. \n      \n      So then, while the term 'chat' may, conventionally, gloss some kind of disengagement from businesslike conversation, while it may seem to be 'small talk', of no weight, irrelevant even, it might rather be (as inspection of some actual materials shows) that it's in fact ultra-critical to keeping the 'serious' stuff happening. 'Chat' -- the pursuit of 'irrelevant' topics (holidays and so on) -- can, organisationally, be absolutely relevant to the doing of whatever serious business is in hand. Chat, rather than being trivial, may then be central to the organisational work of everyday serious talk. While computers can facilitate (a form of) chat -- as in Internet 'chat lines' -- the reverse is also true: chat can make Internet computing (and, perhaps, many other forms of supposedly formal conversation, like psychological testing) possible as such. \n          \n      References  \n      \n      \nAntaki, Charles, and Mark Rapley. \"'Quality of Life' Talk: The Liberal Paradox of Psychological Testing.\" Discourse and Society 7 (1996): 293-316.\n      \"Chat\".

    "title": "The Meanings of Culture",
    "abstract": "\n      Culture: Its Many Meanings \n      One of the problems we encounter in dealing with culture is that there are so many different meanings and definitions attached to the term. We think of culture two ways: first, in terms of aesthetic matters (relative to thearts) and second, as a concept used by anthropologists to describe the way people live. There are, so I understand, something like a hundred different definitions of culture used by anthropologists. \n      The Origins of the Term \"Culture\" \n      The word 'culture' comes from the Latin cultus, which means 'care', and from the French colere which means 'to till' as in 'till the ground'. There are many terms that stem from the word culture. For example, there is the term 'cult' which suggests some kind of a religious organisation. We are continually amazed at the power cults have to shape our behavior, to brainwash us -- to turn intelligent and educated people into fanatics. Here we are dealing with the power of charismatic personalities and of groups over individuals. If cults can exercise enormous power over individuals and groups of people, can't we say that cultures also can do the same thing, though usually not to the same extreme degree? \n      There is also the term 'cultivated', which means something that has been grown or, in the realm of aesthetics and the arts, sophisticated taste. Just as plants only exist because they are cared for by some cultivator, over a period of time, so people's taste and cultivation only are developed by education and training. It takes time to develop a refined sensibility, to become discriminating, to appreciate texts that are difficult and complex and not immediately satisfying. \n      Bacteriologists also speak about cultures, but they use the term to describe the bacteria that are grown in Petri dishes if they are given suitable media (sources of nourishment). This matter of bacteria growing in media may be an important metaphor for us: just as bacteria need media to grow into culture, so do human beings need cultures to survive and develop themselves. We don't do it all on our own. In the chart below I show the interesting parallels:\n      \nBacteriology\n        Bacteria\n        Grow in media\n        Form cultures\n        Sociology/Anthropology \n        Humans\n        Affected by media\n        Form cultures\n      \nOf course we are much more complex than bacteria; in truth, each of us form a kind of medium for countless kinds of bacteria that inhabit our mouths and various other parts of our bodies. Bacteriology involves the cultivation and study of micro-organisms (bacteria) in prepared nutrients and the study of media (and what is often called cultural criticism nowadays) involves the study of individuals and groups in a predominantly, but not completely, mass-mediated culture. Not all culture is mass mediated. \n      An Anthropological Definition of Culture \n      Let me offer a typical anthropological definition of culture. It is by Henry Pratt Fairchild and appeared in his Dictionary of Sociology and Related Sciences: \n      \n        A collective name for all behavior patterns socially acquired and transmitted by means of symbols; hence a name for all the distinctive achievements of human groups, including not only such items as language, tool-making, industry, art, science, law, government, morals and religion, but also the material instruments or artifacts in which cultural achievements are embodied and by which intellectual cultural features are given practical effect, such as buildings, tools, machines, communication devices, art objects, etc. (80)\n      \n      Let's consider some of the topics Fairchild mentions.\n      Behavior Patterns. We are talking about codes and patterns of behavior here that are found in groups of people. \n      Socially Acquired. We are taught these behavior patterns as we grow up in a family in some geographical location and are profoundly affected by the family we are born into, its religion, and all kinds of other matters. \n      Socially Acquired. We are taught these behavior patterns as we grow up in a family in some geographical location and are profoundly affected by the family we are born into, its religion, and all kinds of other matters. \n      \n      The Distinctive Achievements of Human Groups. It is in groups that we become human and become enculturated or acculturated (two words for the same thing, for all practical purposes). We have our own distinctive natures but we are also part of society. \n      Artifacts in which cultural achievements are embodied. The artifacts we are talking about here are the popular culture texts carried in the various media and other non-mediated aspects of popular culture (or not directly mediated) such as fashions in clothes, food preferences, artifacts (what anthropologists call 'material culture'), language use, sexual practices and related matters. \n      We know that a great deal of our popular culture, while not carried by the media, is nevertheless profoundly affected by it. \n      We can see, then, that culture is a very complicated phenomenon that plays some kind of a role in shaping our consciousness and our behavior. You may think you are immune from the impact of the media and popular culture, but that is a delusion that is generated, I would suggest, by the media. \n      We think we are not affected in significant ways by the media and popular culture (sometimes called mass mediated culture) and culture in general but we are wrong. Culture affects us but it doesn't necessarily determine every act we do; though some scholars, who believe the media are very powerful, might argue with this point. \n      Falling Off the Map: What Travel Literature Reveals \n      For a graphic example of how cultures differ, let me offer two quotations from the travel writer Pico Iyer from his book Falling Off the Map: Some Lonely Places of the World, a collection of travel articles about seldom-visited places (by American travelers, at least). Saigon: \n      \n        the only word for Saigon is 'wild'. One evening I counted more than a hundred two-wheel vehicles racing past me in the space of sixty seconds, speeding around the jam-packed streets as if on some crazy merry-go-round, a mad carnival without a ringmaster; I walked into a dance club and found myself in the midst of a crowded floor of hip gay boys in sleeveless T-shirts doing the latest moves to David Byrne; outside again, I was back inside the generic Asian swirl, walking through tunnels of whispers and hisses. \"You want boom-boom?\" \"Souvenir for you dah-ling?\" \"Why you not take special massage?\" Shortly before midnight, the taxi girls stream out of their nightclubs in their party dresses and park their scooters outside the hotels along 'Simultaneous Uprising' Street. (134-5) \n      \n       \n      Compare his description of Saigon with his portrait of Reykjavik, Iceland, equally as fascinating and fantastic but considerably different from Saigon. \n      \n        Even 'civilization' seems to offer no purchase for the mind here: nothing quite makes sense. Iceland boasts the largest number of poets, presses, and readers per capita in the world: Reykjavik, a town smaller than Rancho Cucamonga, California, has five daily newspapers, and to match the literary production of Iceland, the U.S. would have to publish twelve hundred new books a day. Iceland has the oldest living language in Europe; its people read the medieval sagas as if they were tomorrow's newspaper and all new concepts, such as 'radio' and 'telephone', are given poetical medieval equivalents. Roughly three eldest children in every four are illegitimate here, and because every son of Kristjan is called Kristjansson, and every daughter Kristjansdottir, mothers always have different surnames from their children (and in any case are rarely living with the fathers). The first day I ever spent in 'Surprise City' (as Reykjavik is called), I found golden-haired princesses and sword-wielding knights enacting fairy-tale sagas on the main bridge in the capital. (67-8) \n      \n      We can see that there are considerable differences between Saigon and Reykjavik, though just as (to be fair) Iyer points out the incredible differences between cities in Vietnam, such as the differences between Saigon and Hue. Iyer's description of the landscape of Iceland may help explain the national character of the Icelanders. As he writes:\n      \n        I knew, before I visited, a little about the epidemic oddness of the place: there was no beer in Iceland in 1987, and no television on Thursdays; there were almost no trees, and no vegetables. Iceland is an ungodly wasteland of volcanoes and tundra and Geysir, the mother of geysirs, a country so lunar that NASA astronauts did their training there. (67) \n      \n      There has to be some influence of this remarkable landscape and climate, of the Iceland geographical location, the amount of light and darkness in which people live, upon the people who live there and there has to be some influence of the jungle and the climate of Vietnam on its people. \n      What we become is, it seems to me, due to some curious combination of factors involving our natures (that is, the hard-wired elements of our personalities) and our cultures, with the matter of chance playing a big role as well. \n      What we become is, it seems to me, due to some curious combination of factors involving our natures (that is, the hard-wired elements of our personalities) and our cultures, with the matter of chance playing a big role as well. \n          \n      References  \n      \n Fairchild, Henry Pratt.

    "abstract": "\n      Biopunk is an intriguing development of that essential cultural reference point for the information age: cyberpunk. William Gibson's Neuromancer (1984) did more than popularise the phrase cyberspace, it laid the basis for a genre that went on to capture the turbulent zeitgeist of a new digital age in which the promises of the much-vaunted, information society finally seemed possible. Karl Marx used the phrase \"All that is solid melts into air...\"1 to describe the profound social changes wrought by capitalism. It is also a fitting description of the apparent technology-induced paradigm shift in our contemporary perception of the world. Increasingly, solid, material structures are viewed in immaterial, informational terms and the boundaries between previously distinct categories are blurring. This paradigm shift has produced attendant tensions and the significance of biopunk resides in its cultural representation or 'playing out' our contemporary ontological confusion: physicality's newly problematic status. This article briefly samples the work of the British writers Jeff Noon and Michael Marshall Smith to argue that in the rapidly-approaching era of a fully-mapped human genome, biopunk provides a much-needed cathartic imaginative outlet for our growing confusion about the status of the physical in our brave new digital world.\n      Viral Times -- Hybrid Confusion\n      In the past we have always assumed that the external world around us has represented reality, however confusing or uncertain, and that the inner world of our minds, its dreams, hopes, ambitions, represented the realm of fantasy and the imagination. These roles it seems to me have been reversed ... the one small node of reality left to us is inside our own heads. (Ballard 5)\n      The notion that biopunk's imaginative excesses can provide potentially useful insights into the contemporary condition is backed by the sense that the traditional boundary between the real and imagined worlds has become irretrievably blurred. Thus J.G. Ballard suggests that the ubiquity and pervasiveness of modern technology has reversed our usual ontological categories, a sentiment endorsed by Columbus, a character from Noon's novel Pollen, who asserts that \"what is presently inside the head will shortly be outside the head. The dream! The dream will live!\" (193). The increasing perception of such an ontological reversal is reflected in claims that cyberpunk can be viewed as social theory (Burrows) whereas \"Baudrillard's futuristic postmodern social theory can be read in turn as science fiction\" (Kellner 299).\n      Cyberpunk fiction utilises the pace of technological change as a permanent narrative back-drop, and having identified various social trends within late capitalism re-presents them with an 'exaggerated clarity' that has become its hallmark. Biopunk takes such exaggerations even further. It metaphorises cyberpunk's social instabilities into an alarming maelstrom of biological uncertainty: exaggerated clarity becomes exaggerated anxiety. Biopunk develops the informationally saturated mise-en-scène of cyberpunk by exploring further the implications of the increasing convergence between information as an abstract entity and its embodied manipulation in biological DNA. It pursues Marx's previously cited image of melting ephemerality with fictional fervour: \"These days the doors between the two worlds were slippery, as though the walls were going fluid\" (Noon, Pollen 92)2. \n      Biopunk's fictional emphasis upon disorienting levels of fluidity reflects non-fictional concerns about the potential information overloading tendencies of digital technologies: \"the tie between information and action has been severed ... we are glutted with information, drowning in information, we have no control over it, don't know what to do with it\" (Postman 6). In Pollen, Noon provides a grotesque metaphorical representation of Postman's fears in his portrayal of a near-future Manchester struggling to cope with the after-effects of the widespread dispersal of a powerful fertility drug called Fecundity 10. The city is over-run by exponentially proliferating flora and fauna that combine in a frenetic confusion of unlikely hybrid genetic couplings. Noon uses a blurring of previously distinct genetic categories to symbolise society's inability to control the growth of information. His fiction 'fleshes out' digitally-induced anxieties with a sustained depiction of futuristic Hieronymous Bosch-like febrility and fecundity, or, to use a phrase of Baudrillard's, 'organic delirium':\n      The Zombies were dancing and blooming around the shit and the dust, flowers sprouting from their tough skins, petals falling from their mouths. It was a fine show of fauna and flora, all mixed into one being. New species ... It was a time of happenings and flower power. A time of changes. That's why this hayfever wave is exciting me so much, despite the danger. It's got me in two minds, this fever. The flowers are making a come back, and the world is getting messier. The barricades are coming down. This city is so fucking juicy right now. (Noon, Pollen 117 &amp; 166)\n      Noon's Nymphomation is set in a near-future Manchester that is the testing site for a national lottery based upon a domino-like game. The neologism that provides the novel's title, continues his key theme of fecundity, it is used:\n      ... to denote a complex mathematical procedure where numbers rather than being added together or multiplied or whatever, were actually allowed to breed with each other, to produce new numbers, which had something to do with 'breeding ever more pathways towards the goal'. (Noon, Nymphomation 119)\n     Fecundity in this setting does not only apply to the mating of informational and biological entities but is also apparent in the meme-like transmission of a pervasive copulatory capitalist zeitgeist: \"the naked populace, making foreplay to the domiviz, bone-eyed and numberfucked ... Even the air had a hard-on, bulging with mathematics. Turning the burbflies into a nympho-swarm, liquid streets alive with perverts ...\" (Noon, Nymphomation 65) General fecundity is specifically manifested in a glut of commercial activity which the authorities no longer seem able to control: \"the streets of Blurbchester were thick with the mergers, a corporate fog of brand images. People had to battle through them ... The Government was at a loss regarding the overwhelming messages; they knew the experiment had gone wrong ... but how to right it?\" (240). Informational overload becomes a reproductive frenzy whereby corporate messages breed literally like flies. Gibson's dance of biz becomes an actual buzz:\n      \n      As the burbflies went out of control, blocking out the streetlights, making a cloud of logos. It was rutting season for the living verts, and all over the city the male blurbs were riding on the backs of females. Biting their necks, hoping for babyverts. The city, the pulsating city, alive with the rain and colours and the stench of nymphomation Mathemedia. Here we go, numberfucked ... (Noon, Nymphomation 159)\n        In the real world, the process of technological change causes flux and confusion. Cyberpunk fiction represents this by describing dystopian social environments. Its protagonists revel in the loss of traditional and coherent social values such as law and order and community where its protagonists revel in an unlimited smorgasboard of privatised formerly public services. Biopunk's distinctive quality stems from its own peculiar perspective on such confusion, manifested in a distinctive attention to bodily substance and a whole bestiary of new hybrid life-forms.\n        Fleshy Contempt\n        For Case, who'd lived for the bodiless exultation of cyberspace it was the Fall. In the bars he'd frequented as a cowboy hotshot, the elite stance involved a certain relaxed contempt for the flesh. The body was meat. Case fell into the prison of his own flesh. (Gibson, Neuromancer 12)\n          This early passage from Neuromancer describes its protagonist's addictive relationship to the Matrix and provides a neat summary of cyberpunk's perspective on the growing subordination of the physical. Digital pleasure is experienced at the expense of alienation with the material environment. In Douglas Coupland's 'factional' work Microserfs (1995) the excessively manicured lawns at Microsoft headquarters merely represent an epiphenomenon of a more deeply-rooted societal trend towards the diminished importance of our physical sensibilities. Lego, or 'Satan's playtoy', is humorously identified as an emblematic commodity of this tendency due to the way in which it is responsible for brainwashing \n          entire generations of youth from the information-dense industrialized nations into developing mind-sets that view the world as unitized, sterile, inorganic, and interchangeably modular ... Lego is, like, the perfect device to enculturate a citizenry intolerant of smell, intestinal by-products, nonadherence to unified standards, decay, blurred edges, germination and death. Try imagining a forest made of Lego. Good luck. Do you ever see Legos made from ice? dung? wood? iron? and sphagnum moss? No -- grotacious, or what? (Coupland 258)\n          A typically distinguishing feature of biopunk is its willingness to stretch such aspects of the digital zeitgeist to their limits. In contrast to Coupland's easy humour and cyberpunk's \"relaxed contempt for the flesh\", biopunk refashions sentiments of unease with physical immediacy to take the form of nauseating disgust with the biological per se. In Spares, this is vividly embodied when, for example, objects fall into reality from the cyberspatial Gap:\n          It was a bird, of a kind. A bird or a cat, either way. It was featherless, but stood a foot tall on spindly jointed legs; its face was avian but -- like the body -- fat and dotted with patchy, moulting orange fur. Two vestigial wings poked out of its side at right angles, looking as if they had been unceremoniously amputated with scissors and then re-cauterized. Most of the creature's skin was visible, an unhealthy white mess that appeared to be weeping fluid. The whole body heaved in and out as it sat, as if labouring for breath, and it gave of a smell of recent decay -- as if fresh-minted for death ... its beak opened. The hole this revealed looked less like a mouth than a churned wound, and the eyes, though vicious, were faltering ... The bird tried to take a step towards us, but the effort caused one of its legs to break. The top joint teetered in its socket and then popped out. The creature flopped onto its side. The skin over the joint tore like an over-ripe fruit, releasing a gout of matter that resembled nothing so much as a heavy period mixed with sour cream. (Smith 162)\n          Biopunk's almost neo-gnostic distaste for flesh has arguably become increasingly apparent in William Gibson's later work. In Neuromancer, for example, the tone of 'relaxed contempt' is still evident in his description of the population's consumer demand: \"Summer in the Sprawl, the mall crowds swaying like windblown grass, a field of flesh shot through with sudden eddies of need and gratification\" (60). However, his vision is certainly less relaxed when, by the time of Idoru (1996), he describes how the media's audience\n          ... is best visualized as a vicious, lazy, profoundly ignorant, perpetually hungry organism craving the warm god-flesh of the annointed. Personally I like to imagine something the size of a baby hippo, the color of a week-old boiled potato, that lives by itself, in the dark, in a double-wide on the outskirts of Topeka. It's covered with eyes and it sweats constantly. The sweat runs into those eyes and makes them sting. It has no mouth ... no genitals, and can only express its mute extremes of murderous rage and infantile desire by changing the channels on a universal remote. Or by voting in presidential elections. (28-9)\n          Conclusion\n          Just before an airplane breaks the sound barrier, sound waves become visible on the wings of the plane. The sudden visibility of sound just as sound ends is an apt instance of that great pattern of being that reveals new and opposite forms just as the earlier forms reach their peak performance. (McLuhan 12)\n          McLuhan's image of the dramatic visibility of sound right at the moment of its imminent supercedance is a useful way of conceptualising the significance of biopunk and its obsessive highlighting of bodies and their metaphoric power. Perhaps as we leap-frog the mechanical technologies of modernity into a postindustrial world where information attains the status of the fourth element, biopunk is performing an idiosyncratic eulogy at the funeral of physicality.\n          \n          Footnotes \n          \nMarshall Berman uses this phrase for the title of his historical, socio-cultural exploration of capitalism and its effects. \n            Further examples include:\n            ... the world is getting very fluid these days. Very fluid. Dangerously so (Noon, Pollen 101)\n                          ... It was a fluid world and there was danger for everybody living there. (157)\n                                      ... the real world is up for grabs, especially since the world has become so fluid. (200)\n                                                  ... Even time was becoming fluid under the new map (246)\n                                                              ... Coyote is howling now, turning the road into liquid so he can glide down its throat. (254)\n                                                                        The world was dissolving and the new day bled away ... safety, the rules, cartography, instruction ... all the bad things were peeling away (278)\n          \nReferences \n          \n Ballard, J.G.

    "abstract": "\n      As the science fictional years come upon us -- 1999, 2000, 2001 -- there is a sense that this is the future, and nothing much has changed. Indeed, the future has turned out to be pretty much like the past, but with Tamagotchis and Karaoke. Beyond Darko Suvin's adoption of the term \"novum\" and the souls sold to the demons of postmodernism, the criticism of science fiction remains more or less the same as it did thirty years ago, except that it is now often written by people who have only read Neuromancer. It is high time that this critical apparatus was shaken up. The various techniques and devices in the arsenal of the contemporary science-fiction writer need to be explored anew. In The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, Clute and Grant introduced a series of terms, such as \"polder\" and \"instauration\", which they made use of in their analyses of the fantastic mode1. It is hoped that the terms I introduce gain similar currency. In the limited space I have available, I can only explore the terminology of plot. \n      The key to the popular fictional genres, both visual and literary, is that they are defined by a certain sense of familiarity with the material, a familiar engendered by repetition with difference. Even within this overall scheme of generic recognition, there is a stage further when a plot is borrowed entire from another work. It is clearly easy for a writer to borrow a plot from someone else, as it is known that it already works, has already pleased readers and rations out the degree of originality in a genre which depends upon originality. \n      For example, Dan Simmons's Hyperion has a series of characters telling each other stories to pass the time on a journey: obviously this is Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales. But in addition to that it is a gathering together of disparate characters, who are going to go and visit this wonderful, strange being, to ask for their deepest desires. As I read this, I began to wonder whether one of them wanted a brain and one of them wanted a heart and one of them wanted courage and one of them wanted to go back to Kansas. This is of course the structure of The Wizard of Oz. Hyperion is thus Canterbury Tales meets Wizard of Oz sung to the tune of Keats, and is therefore hailed as being startlingly original. At the end of Hyperion, as the characters go off to see the Wizard, one character bursts into song: \n       'What's that song you're singing to Rachel?'\n  The scholar forced a grin and scratched his short beard. 'It's from an ancient flat film...'\n  'But who is the wizard?' asked Colonel Kassad...\n  'And what is Oz?' asked Lamia.\n  'And just who is off to see this wizard?' (Hyperion 500-1) \n\n      In order to avoid charges of plagiarism, Simmons reveals his sources, or, to be more charitable, acknowledges the intertextual borrowing which he has been engaged in. \n      Another plot which gets used again and again is in cyberpunk, where the non-spatial realm of cyberspace stands in for the realm of the dead, the Underworld, and an analogue for Orpheus is sent to rescue a version of Eurydice: a female is kidnapped by a god of the Underworld, and a male hero has to rescue her, only to be trapped behind himself. This is the plot which underlies Vurt, Snow Crash, and one of the less obvious cyberpunk classics, Mythago Wood. The titular wood is a realm whose interior dimensions do not match the exterior's, rather like cyberspace. The main character's entry into the wood to rescue his brother and mother / sister-in-law / lover strikes a suitable note of incest, and the beings encountered there are mythic archetypes. As Pollen was to make clear, the Underworld is the realm of the collective unconscious, the realm of Story, Myth and Archetype2. \n      The great trilogy of the 1990s, Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars Trilogy, borrows the structure of The Lord of the Rings. In Fellowship of the Ring a group of disparate characters come together and set off on a mission, there's a great calamity following a betrayal and they are all scattered. In the next volume, The Two Towers, the scattered characters wander around aimlessly, not really achieving anything, and there's a couple of battles or revolutions. Finally in The Return of the King there are last climatic battles, councils of peace, characters die of old age and there's a sense of loss, that the world has been changed, but for the next generation. Compare this to the structure of Robinson's epic: in Red Mars a group of disparate characters (the First Hundred) come together and set off on a mission to Mars, there's a great calamity following a betrayal and they are all scattered. In Green Mars the scattered characters wander around aimlessly, not really achieving anything, and there's a couple of battles or revolutions. Blue Mars depicts a final climatic battle, councils of peace, characters die of old age -- as does the reader -- and there's a sense of loss, that the world has been changed, but for the next generation. (Curiously Kim Stanley Robinson next work, Antarctica, was a reworking of Blue Mars, but without the Mars, a feature it also shares with Lord of the Rings.) \n      Repetition in narratives happens with entire works, but also within narratives. These are known as Cookie Dough Plots. Home-made cookies are made by using cutters which produce the same shape again and again from dough. In the same way, narratives can be constructed from a series of broadly similar events which are repeated ad infinitum. A recent example of this is Dan Simmons's Endymion (1996), where the entire plot is organised around the two poles of: 'We're being chased' and 'Phew, we've escaped'. This fills up over four hundred pages. \n      The Ping Pong Plot is one where two plotlines interconnect and are told alternatively: two sets of characters are involved in two separate storylines, where the action is occurring simultaneously and the author cuts between the two. William Gibson does this a lot in his fiction, with increasing numbers of character sets. \n      Strangely enough, great science fiction of twenty or thirty years ago was around two hundred pages in length, and great science fiction of today is around the four hundred page mark. It's twice the size of an old novel. Most of these novels use the Ping Pong Plot, with events alternating between two sets of characters who usually, but not always, meet up by page four hundred. They might as well be in separate novels. In fact what we appear to have in today's great science fiction, is two novels. As no-one would pay $50 for a two hundred page novel, they get two for the price of one, shuffled in accordance to the rules of Ping Pong. \n      In Jovah's Angel, by Sharon Shinn, there are two sets of characters: the first plot is an angel looking for her mortal beloved soul mate or perfect man and the second is a man wandering around. And reading it, the reader thinks, 'Ooh, I wonder who her perfect man is going to be? Ooh, there's another 390 pages to find out.' The novel is an example of the Ping Pong Cookie Dough Plot variant, where the chase-escape-chase format is enlivened by switching -- Ping-Ponging -- between the chaser and the chased. \n      In Jovah's Angel, by Sharon Shinn, there are two sets of characters: the first plot is an angel looking for her mortal beloved soul mate or perfect man and the second is a man wandering around. And reading it, the reader thinks, 'Ooh, I wonder who her perfect man is going to be? Ooh, there's another 390 pages to find out.' The novel is an example of the Ping Pong Cookie Dough Plot variant, where the chase-escape-chase format is enlivened by switching -- Ping-Ponging -- between the chaser and the chased. \n      Perhaps the most significant example of this Timeslip Ping Pong in recent years is Mary Doria Russell's The Sparrow (1996), where the action alternates between the account of the preparation for the voyage and the voyage itself and the account of the aftermath of the voyage. There's the before of events and the after of events, moving towards the discovery of the dark secret at the heart of the tale. It doesn't quite keep up the Ping Pong, as some chapters slip into the past or the future, and the Pings are not sufficiently distinguishable from the Pongs. \n      In the past, series of novellas or novels used a variation on the Timeslip Ping Pong Plot, where the events and resolution of one story sets up the problem for the next. Rather than a series of sequels, what often happened was a number of sequels and prequels, until the final, ultimate and closing Prelude. (In a sense this is what Jack Womack is doing in his Dryco sequence). \n      One variation on this should be known -- after E.E. 'Doc' Smith's novels -- as the My-Ultimate-Weapon-Is-More-Ultimate-Than-Yours-Is Sequence. In every Lensman novel there is an Ultimate Weapon, a weapon too dreadful to use, which they use after all, since they have it around, cluttering up the place. Fortunately for the sequence, the UW can be countered by the Ultimate Strategic Defense Initiative (or USDI) which is much more ultimate, and an even more UW. By the time you get to the eighth novel in the sequence, the UW of the first book ought to be renamed the Antipenultimate Antipenultimate Antipenultimate Antipenultimate Antipenultimate Antipenultimate Penultimate Ultimate Weapon. \n      The preceding terminology covers the major versions of narratives used within contemporary science fiction, narratives which it seems likely will dominate the next century of science fiction. Similarly the same sorts of settings, which I hope to explore elsewhere, will dominate: in particular the rainy city, post-holocaust and the next five minutes (although the pre-millennial tension setting is clearly now obsolete). \n      \n      Footnotes \n      \nA \"polder\" is a realm which is deliberately maintained as separate and distinct from the outside world (Clute 772-3). \"Instauration fantasies\" are those where \"the real world is transformed\" (Clute 501). \n        For cyberpunk and the underworld narrative see Joan Gordon, \"Yin and Yang Duke It Out\", in Storming the Reality Studio: A Casebook of Postmodern Science Fiction, ed. Larry McCaffery (Durham and London: Duke UP, 1991). For a longer exploration of Mythago Wood see my article in Vector 192 (March/April 1997): 4, and my \"Journeys beyond Being: The Cyberpunk-Flavoured Novels of Jeff Noon\", Novel Turns: The Novel in Europe Now, ed. by John Gatt-Rutter (forthcoming). The term \"cyberpunk-flavoured\" is one I coined for a discussion of the works of Jeff Noon: the novels share a number of characteristics of cyberpunk, whilst not necessarily being unproblematically cyberpunk. A tradition of works which have a realm analogous to cyberspace, or a realm which serves a comparative narrative need, could be identified; Borges's use of the term \"precursor\" might be useful here to characterise such a tradition, although as Mythago Wood is more or less contemporary with Neuromancer it cannot properly be a precursor. The cyberspatial realm of the Vurt feather is something between an interior mental landscape and a computer game; the wood realm of Mythago Wood is somewhere between an interior mental landscape which can be simulated / created / entered with the use of electrical stimulation on the brain and a secondary world. \n        \nReferences \n        \n      \n Clute, John, and John Grant, eds.

    "abstract": "\n      1.\n      In this paper, I want to begin to contemplate the possibility that the concept of culture could one day be thought outside modern Western thought, via a reading of Martin Heidegger's 'Dialogue on Language between a Japanese and an Inquirer'. As we shall see, for Heidegger, the dominant position here is representationalism. And so a large part of what I want to do here is to begin to shake the concept of culture from these dominant representationalist moorings.1\n      Heidegger's problem with the history of Western thought may be put as follows. In this tradition, the difference between Being and beings (the ontological difference) is forgotten so that Being comes primarily to be considered in terms of beings. Beings are, in turn, considered in terms of their relations to one another, with the being called 'man' routinely standing to one privileged side of those known as 'objects'. Thereby thinking about Being is reduced to the question: how is it that man relates to objects? The problem is compounded when the answer to this question is given as: man knows objects. And it is even further compounded by the dominance throughout all of this of representational thinking: the idea that man knows objects only 'indirectly' through their representations.2 To challenge representational thinking in Heidegger's sense, then, is to challenge not just a 'way of knowing' but also the dominance of 'man' (Foucault's central uptake of Heidegger), the separation between 'man' and 'things', subject and object, and, ultimately, it is to challenge the very idea that Being is no more than the aggregate of empirically accessible beings. \n      To find alternatives to representational thinking Heidegger looks elsewhere, or, more precisely, in turning to the pre-Socratic Greeks, elsewhen. He does this throughout his work, but most explicitly in Early Greek Thinking. Yet even this work barely distinguishes between (what we would now think of as) natural and cultural production in any clear way. Instead, it appears there as if the ontological difference itself -- the difference between Being and beings, between sheer coming-to-presence and that which happens to be present -- is of such urgent importance that it cuts across the apparently less important distinction between natural and cultural varieties of beings. As an advancement of his claims about the ontological difference (as a neglected and almost unthinkable difference today), the Heidegger of Early Greek Thinking in effect obviates the nature/culture distinction along with representational thinking. \n      If the modern Western concept of culture, then, depends for its existence on the prior existence of a constitutive outside (such as nature) then is it possible that culture as such (whatever theory of it we hold) is irrevocably part of representationalist thinking? Is it intrinsically representationalist -- from, say, Hobbes to the present day or, indeed, in whatever past or future manifestation -- by virtue of its dependence on a culture/non-culture distinction? If this is so, again, there is a remarkable consequence for all the cultural disciplines and for cultural studies in particular. It is this: any non-representationalist approach to culture would be a contradiction in terms; so that, by virtue of it being specifically culture we are interested in, our interest will be necessarily representationalist. Outside representationalism, what we are dealing with could not be culture as such. The sorts of objects which we have, until now, thought of as cultural objects (photographs, museums, policy documents, forms of dress, music and so on) become interesting and significant outside representationalism only to the extent that they instanciate the ontological difference. We can, that is, no longer afford to think of the cultural as ontologically separate in any way. Instead, the move away from representational thinking would mean that objects of whatever kind -- 'gods and men, temples and cities, sea and land, eagle and snake, tree and shrub, wind and light, stone and sand, day and night' (Early 40) -- are effects of the distinction between coming-to-presence and merely happening to be present. And they ought to be experienced, inspected and understood for what they are, fundamentally, in this respect. What would this mean? \n      One occasion where the later Heidegger does treat 'cultural' matters (in several senses and by, perhaps for the first and only time, going across contemporary cultures) is in his 'Dialogue on Language between a Japanese and an Inquirer'.3 This strangely readable little colloquy requires inspection, I believe, if we are to proceed any further along what the Heidegger of Early Greek Thinking calls 'the lines of usage' and into the peculiar territory beyond representational thinking.4\n      2. \n      What is at stake here may be this: whether in this dialogue we are experiencing a cultural difference. Or perhaps, whether we are experiencing the presence of culture(s) at all. Put another way: the essay in question (in the form of a dialogue) may be an instance of either (a) a cultural difference or dialogue; or else of (b) an accidental similarity or monologue. Let us look briefly at both possibilities. \n      If (a), then we have a clear lesson (on the model of the 'danger' of language): the nature of culture cannot derive from a metaphysical distinction between culture and contenders for the title of 'non-culture' (for example, physical nature or science or barbarism); for anything that was a culture would have to be already in place in order to generate such a division (or anything like it) in the first place. The name, then, of this prior condition cannot be 'culture' itself. But that is precisely how the cultural disciplines have used the term -- 'cultures', we hear, are what make the 'nature/culture' distinction -- albeit that each may do it in its own, 'culturally specific', way.5 This is why the cultural disciplines cannot imagine a culture which does not, in itself, have a deeply-seated representational concept of culture as its ultimate ground. Anthropological thinking -- in the broadest philosophical sense, not just in reference to a specific discipline -- entails the search for the other's meaning of its own (anthropology's) idea of culture. In effect, it cannot imagine a culture outside Western metaphysics but must forever translate 'different cultures' into versions of it (albeit with minor empirical differences). So if the name of the condition for the nature/culture distinction (that is, the name of the nature of culture) cannot be 'culture', instead its name must be 'representational thinking' -- at least for all cultural theory to date. The modern concept of culture's ultimate contradiction would be that it would rest upon the assumption of its own universal presence while also denying cultural universals. \n      If (b) -- if, that is, we are not, in this dialogue, undergoing an experience with culture at all -- then the 'Japanese' is no more than a token non-European Heideggerian. He is whatever may be non-European 'in' Heidegger himself. He is a fictional device for having Heidegger's fellow Europeans (his readers) see how it is possible to think outside Western thinking -- or at least to get a glimpse of such a possibility. He is a stooge, a ploy, and -- what's more -- an 'orientalised' ploy: a classically European fictional depiction of the mysterious Orient and its inscrutable thinking.\nSo much is at stake in how we read this work. And a number of very important issues depend on our (necessarily ethical and political) decision as to how we should read the essay. For if reading (a) prevails, cultural difference (or whatever term we decide to use to replace it and its ultimately limited horizon) is not something, in itself, of its nature or essence, that can give any comfort to notions of 'orientalism' or 'stereotypes' or any of the other tropes of fashionable (cross-)cultural criticism. Instead, the cultural itself, wherever it is predicated on Western representational thinking, is intrinsically Western thinking. There is no outside of Western culture (the Western concept of culture) for that culture to grasp -- whether it would ideally grasp it in scientific, anthropological, liberal humanist, cultural relativist, orientalist, colonialist or racist ways. These 'ways' and the differences between them have no meaning on reading (a). They are all, in effect, one way. \n\n      But if reading (b) prevails, then all seems well with Western representational thinking. It has no problem because, now, all cultures would, factually, have a Western concept of culture at their core, albeit of a particular inflexion. They would all be just like 'us' in their essential metaphysics. He who recorded the different tensions or versions of this single metaphysics might be a scientist or anthropologist. He who appreciated such small variations might be a liberal humanist or a cultural relativist. He who dogmatically believed in the superiority of his own tension or difference and degraded others might be an orientalist, a colonialist or a racist. But these would be, on reading (b), but small variations along a single path. They would be like the right, left and centre lanes of a one-way street. \n      So neither reading turns out to be very hopeful for today's cultural disciplines. The first suggests a much deeper-seated difference than those disciplines have been able to imagine hitherto; something much less easily grasped than the culture/non-culture distinction (and such that some 'cultures' are not, in and of themselves, quite that). The second suggests that the easy victories of principled cultural criticism and cultural identity politics (as well as those of less 'enlightened' positions) are grounded on the most Western of Western thinking: its representationalist theology.6\n      It looks as if there are only two possibilities: either culture rests upon a bed of difference that lies so deep as to remain forever outside Western thinking; or every other is ultimately, at the deepest point of difference we can think, a version of the West. But on both sides of the divide, the initial idea of culture is culture-as-presence: 'are we in the presence of an intercultural dialogue?'; or 'are we in the presence of a culture talking to itself?' If we could move even a little way from this and begin to think of culture-as-coming-to-presence (or just as 'to come', to invoke a Derridean variation on the theme), then it turns out that (a) and (b) are necessarily undecidable matters within representational thinking itself but that, as we begin to move outside it,the decision becomes irrelevant. But we must reserve this (in)decision for another occasion and proceed with the dialogue at hand. \n      3. \n      To proceed, we must continue with the dialogue's attention to language and particularly to the 'danger' of speaking about it. Language, that is, has a nature but it is concealed (by the representationalist difference between the sensuous and the suprasensuous) and this concealing is a 'danger' (21). One contender for the nature of language is to take it as 'the house of Being' (22). And this prompts us to remember that the dialogue describes the two cultures as different 'houses' (5) -- different 'language realities' (24) -- so that 'the nature of language remains something altogether different for the East asian and the European peoples' (23). In fact, it is so different that the question of what language is may not be a possible one for the Japanese (23). He insists that his people 'pay no heed' to the question of the nature of language. Instead they have a word that 'says the essential being of language, rather than being of use as a name for speaking and for language' (23). So this is not a referring word but rather a 'hinting' word (24). And the 'hint' would be what the Japanese translator feels when he feels the 'wellspring' from which such different languages as German and Japanese might arise. He also describes this in terms of a 'radiance'. This 'hinting', or 'gesturing', or 'bearing' (26) must not, the Inquirer demands, be clarified into a form of 'conceptual representation' (25). Were it to be, we would miss its nature outside Western reason. There is no analytic or empirical equivalent of 'the nature of language'. To think so is itself an instance of the worst sorts of metaphysics at work. \n      Following through the dialogue, we also find that to ask about the nature of language is also to ask the hermeneutic question in its non-standard sense;that is not as a methodological question about the means of interpreting texts but as a metaphysical question about what interpretation itself is (29-30). And this in turn has to do with 'bearing' (as in bearing a message, being a messenger -- gesturing, bearing, hinting). The so-far unannounced Japanese word for the nature of language, on the one hand, and the question of what hermeneutics is, on the other, stand together. 'Man stands in hermeneutical relation to the two-fold' (32), where 'the two-fold' is glossed as presencing (coming-to-presence) and present beings. \n      This hermeneutic relation, however, is complex. It involves man in preserving the two-fold (32) and also in the two-fold (presencing/present) using man (33). And, obviously enough perhaps, this idea of 'use' can no longer mean empirical usage in its quasi-linguistic sense. For, as we soon learn from the rest of the essays in On the Way to Language, the linguistic arts and sciences are thoroughly representationalist since they begin with the assumption of the simple existence of present beings (forgetting coming-to-presence and language's criticality to it) and consider language, as it were, to come later as a means of, and for, their re-presentation. (And this is, I would argue, precisely the function of terms such as 'language', 'discourse', 'signification' and 'image' in, for example, cultural studies.) Nevertheless the alternative to this mistaken view of language, the alternative that Heidegger calls 'the hermeneutic relation', is agentive. In fact it is doubly so. It involves, that is, practices (of preserving and using): 'the sway of usage' (33) and 'the sway of the two-fold' (34). The Japanese claims that there is a kinship between this thinking and his (or their) own (41). \n      This hermeneutic relation, however, is complex.

The Japanese claims that there is a kinship between this thinking and his (or their) own (41). \n          \n      Footnotes \n      \nRepresentational thinking is clearly alive and well today in cultural studies -- perhaps even to the point whereby this otherwise critical discipline rarely subjects this concept to critical scrutiny. See Hall (Representation). A draft paper 'Representation and Cultural Studies' (available on request) deals with this question. \n        Hall's Representation book lists three such forms of indirect representation: 'the production of meaning through language, discourse and image'. \n        Two other central locations for Heidegger on culture are 'The Age of the Word Picture' and 'Science and Reflection'. Here and elsewhere, of course, Heidegger has very little time for the idea of culture and 'culturalist' explanations -- possibly because of their traditionally deep imbrication in representationalism. At times, his opposition is so vehement that we can practically hear him reaching for his gun. \n        In Early Greek Thinking, Heidegger translates a crucial part of the Anaximander fragment as follows: '... along the lines of usage [custom, practice]: for they let order and thereby also reck belong to one another (in the surmounting) of disorder' (Early 57). \n        \nA paper submitted for this issue of M/C nicely displays this in a single phrase: 'the Western cultural pattern that assigns things masculine to the cultural and things feminine to the natural' (my emphases). \n        On this matter, see Hunter on 'Setting Limits'. \n      \nReferences  \n      \n Hall, Stuart (ed).

    "abstract": "\n      This article aims to analyse an intercultural telephone invitation given by a Chinese tutor to an Australian student, and highlight general principles of intercultural invitations. This anecdote is based on a true story that took place in a university in Australia, but the persons' names used here are fictitious for the sake of confidentiality. Below is the transcript of the actual conversation between the Chinese tutor Dr Lin Liang (L) and his student Catherine Jones (C):\n      \n      \n        \n\nC: Catherine speaking.\n          \n          L: Hi, Catherine, this is Lin.\n          \n        \n          C: Hi, Teacher Lin.\n          \n        \n          L: I would like to invite you to our New Year's party to be held in my house this Saturday evening.\n          \n        \n          C: This Saturday? I am afraid I won't be able to make it because I am going to my best friend's birthday party.\n          \n        \n          L: You know this is the end of our school year. It would be so nice for all of our classmates to gather together.\n          \n        \n          C: But I have already promised my friend.\n          \n        \n          L: En... It is a pity...\n          \n        \n          C: Sorry about that, but --\n          \n        \n          L: Never mind. Enjoy your party then.\n          \n        \n          C: Thanks.\n          \n        \n          L: That's OK, bye.\n          \n          C: Bye. \n        \nHowever, the story does not end here. About two hours later, Dr Lin rang Catherine a second time, asking if it was still possible for her to consider attending the Saturday party. Late in the evening around 9.00 pm, Dr Lin rang her yet again to invite her to the party, saying it would be OK even if she stayed just for a short while. The next day, Catherine lodged a complaint with the Dean, alleging that Dr. Lin's repeated calls constituted sexual harassment. Dr. Lin was highly distressed to learn of the complaint, and explained that he just wanted to indicate sincerity and warmth as required by an invitation, and had no other intentions. \n      This communication breakdown invites a number of questions:\n      \nWhat are the factors underlying Catherine's interpretation that Dr. Lin's repeated calls constituted sexual harassment? \n        What are the factors underlying Dr. Lin's contention that his actions were intended to emphasise his sincerity? \n        What factors would need to be recognised in order to facilitate culturally competent performances on both their parts? \n      \nIn order to answer these questions, this article will adopt a holistic approach based on an analytic framework encompassing three theoretical dimensions. This framework is comprised as follows:\n      \n Differences in intercultural exchange and politeness behaviour; Aristotle's distinction between the three orientations of persuasive/rhetorical appeal; ethos, pathos, and logos;\n         Austin and Searle's theory of speech acts, as applied to politeness behaviour and felicity conditions in communicative interaction as applied to the act of inviting.\n      \nThese approaches are conceptualised as three overlapping spheres, and their relatedness can be further illustrated:\n      \n \n          Figure 1\n      First and foremost, the case study in question is related to an intercultural interaction between the Australian and Chinese culture, and some research findings in relevant areas may help highlight the differences in politeness behaviour between high-context and low-context cultures (Hall). According to Hall, high-context cultures such as Chinese tend to stress the use of internalised or implicit message while low-context cultures tend to emphasise the use of explicit messages. In other words, in Chinese culture, the message may have some shared implied meanings that may go beyond the linguistic forms used in the message. Kaplan's model on oriental circularity and western linearity seemed to in accordance with Hall's model. Young's exploration of the directness and indirectness of American and Chinese requests further substantiated this point. \n      In a similar way, differences may arise in determining the criteria for appropriate behaviour relating to the use of other directives across cultures. As Gao and Ting-Toomey suggest, Chinese culture seems to pay attention to qing (reciprocity and feelings of obligation) and guanxi (relationship building), while in low-context cultures such a stress tends to be missing. This difference may also help explain the differences in communicative patterns as discussed by Kaplan and Young. Zhu found that in making a sales offer, Chinese companies often try to establish a long-term relationship with their clients (\"Structural Moves\"). In contrast, Australian companies seem to mainly focus on promoting products. The stress on qing in Chinese culture may also be a crucial factor that contributes to the different criteria for a polite invitation as compared to the Australian culture. The following discussion will further explore the other two parameters (see Figure 1) the two cultures differ in when making an invitation, which may have finally led to the breakdown in communication between Dr. Lin and Catherine. \n     As shown in Figure 1, the argument underpinning this approach is that a given illocutionary act reflects culture-specific preferences for certain persuasive/rhetorical orientations, thereby affecting the socio-linguistic performance, i.e. parole as opposed to langue (Cullen) related to politeness principles. In short, the persuasive/rhetorical orientation varies between cultures, which means that the nature of ostensibly equivalent illocutionary acts also varies. Consequently, cross-cultural competence will be limited unless one is aware of the rhetorical and politeness codes implicit in the performance of certain communicative actions. Note that rhetorical orientation may also influence the politeness behaviour directly as a specification of that orientation. This in turn requires an awareness of cultural preferences toward certain persuasive/rhetorical orientations. The interconnections between them and the theoretical utility of this approach will be made explicit in the course of this discussion. \n      \n      Austin and Searle conceptualise the speech acts as comprising of locution (langue) and illocution (parole). What is of vital importance is the illocutionary force of an utterance which is the performance of a speech act, such as an invitation. According to Searle, an invitation is a directive used to get the addressee to do something. Invitation can be understood as a particular form of persuasive speech act. It is generally intended to produce a particular response (i.e. acceptance). As an illocutionary action, an invitation seeks to establish a relationship of social expectations between the host and invitee. This requires certain felicity conditions to be met. In other words, for the speech act to be socially significant, it must create a shared sense of meaning in regard to some perceived change or modification to existing social relations. These are often so obvious that they require little explanation. However, felicity conditions in speech-acts are culture-specific and may include rhetorical and politeness devices that are not obvious to other cultures. \n      Politeness behaviour in invitations, related to using appropriate language forms, is an important element in competent illocutionary performance. Leech contends that polite illocutions are likely to be seen as minimising the addressee's cost and maximising his/her benefits, and the opposite is true for the addresser. Politeness behaviour can also be further explained in the light of Brown and Levinson's face-saving theory. Many actions we perform with words are potential face-threatening acts, such as requests and invitations (Brown and Levinson). The addresser is thus often confronted with negative face wants and has to address them by applying Leech's principles, in which maximising the addressee's benefits is the dominant strategy to gain politeness. \n      However, strategies to maximise the addressee's benefits can be culture-specific. This is further connected to the persuasive/rhetorical orientation. Based on Aristotle, the appeal from ethos emphasises the persuader's (host's) character and status or other social conventions which might oblige compliance. The appeal from pathos emphasises emotion/feelings (either positive or negative) in inducing the desired response. The appeal from logos emphasises reason and the logical consistency of the proposal with the ideas and motives of the persuadee (invitee). Moran and Stripp found that western cultures tend to have a logical orientation, while others such as Japanese and Chinese tend to be characterised by emotional or dogmatic orientations. In a similar manner, Chinese scholars seem to address ethos, logos and pathos at the same time, in particular the logos and pathos. These principles remain a well-accepted principle in Chinese writing theories. Li, for example, clearly explicates the persuasive principle in writing as qing li (the combination of the emotional and logical approaches). The explicitly preferred qing (feelings/emotions) can be seen as part of the Confucian values relating to harmony, consensus and relationship building as noted by Hofstede and Bond. The different rhetorical orientations are also further explored by Campbell. \n      This difference may suggest that the preferred rhetorical orientations are also a key aspect underpinning competent illocutionary performance. For example in Chinese invitations, a stress on the emotional approach may validate behaviours such as repeating the invitation even after initial refusal. However, a stress on the logical orientation, such as in western cultures, may negate the validity of these politeness conditions. This clearly points out the necessity of understanding the criteria for competent performance across cultures. \n      The felicity conditions of invitation in Euro-Australian culture require, first, that the potential host be in a legitimate position to offer hospitality, and second, that the potential guest be -- at least theoretically -- able and willing to accept. Thirdly, the locutionary form of politeness requires use of conventionally appropriate terms of address and wording. The illocutionary form requires that the host symbolically offer hospitality to the invitee without the imposition of charges or other demands. Furthermore, the implied benefit to the invitee would ideally be achieved though implied cost to the host (even if the invitee is addressed as if their presence constitutes the bestowal of a favour). Fourthly, depending on the nature of the relationship between the host and invitee, certain persuasive/rhetorical orientations are preferred over others (eg. an appeal to emotion may seem out of place in formal invitation). \n      The initial invitation meets these criteria. Dr. Lin offers and Catherine declines, citing a plausible and legitimate reason for being unavailable. From Catherine's perspective, the felicity conditions for invitation are now redundant. She has already declined in a manner which makes it clear that she is socially obliged to be elsewhere. From a persuasive/rhetorical perspective, the first invitation was primarily based on an appeal from logos/reason. i.e. Dr. Lin did not know that Catherine had already committed herself to other plans and it would be reasonable to suppose that she might appreciate being invited to a social occasion. This was backed up by a secondary appeal from pathos/emotion, whereby Dr. Lin pointed out that it would be nice for the whole class to get together. However, the priority of attending a best friend's birthday-party over-rides both these appeals. In Euro-Australian culture, close personal friends enjoy greater social priority than classmates or more distant associates. \n      For Dr. Lin, however, the politeness criteria for invitation were still applicable. From a Chinese cultural perspective, the illocutionary performance of invitation may require repetition of the offer, even if the initial approach has been declined. According to Zhu (Business Communication), in Chinese culture repeating invitations is an accepted ritual to indicate sincerity and hospitality. Thus in Dr. Lin's view the second approach is required to perform the illocutionary act competently. The persuasive appeal, however, has become oriented toward ethos, reflecting Chinese conventions pertaining to politeness behaviour. For Dr. Lin not to repeat the invitation might suggest that Catherine's presence was of merely casual concern. Therefore the sincerity of the invitation demanded the gesture of repetition, regardless of the logical grounds cited for the initial refusal. \n      Unfortunately, Dr. Lin and Catherine perceive the second invitation in very different ways based on the illocutionary performance criteria of their respective cultures. For Catherine, the logical basis for her initial refusal renders Dr. Lin's performance incompetent, and creates uncertainty about his apparent motives. In Euro-Australian culture, the repeated invitation makes no logical sense, since a perfectly legitimate reason for declining has already been provided. Therefore the communicative action cannot be interpreted as an invitation. If it is, then it is performed in a culturally incompetent fashion which could legitimately be construed as pestering. Repeating an invitation which has already been declined may appear to be an emotional appeal. While an illocutionary invitation based on pathos conceivably may be competent in Euro-Australian culture, the only circumstances that it would occur in is between relatively close friends. The power-relations between Catherine, as student, and Dr. Lin, as tutor, precludes felicity in this case. Thus the same locutionary action is interpreted as two quite different illocutionary actions. This depends on the interpreter's culturally specific understanding of the social significance of the locution. Since Catherine's cultural conventions would implicitly deny the validity of a repeated invitation, the communicative action must be construed as something else. \n      Catherine may have classified the repeated invitation as a minor issue of little consequence. However, when Dr. Lin called her up to invite her a third time, she interpreted the illocutionary act as harassment. From a contemporary Euro-Australian perspective, pestering may be irritating, but harassment is political in nature. Three factors lead Catherine to this conclusion. First, after two previous declinations, the third invitation could not fulfil the illocutionary performance criteria of a legitimate invitation. In particular, the persuasive/rhetorical orientation of the repeated appeals were not oriented toward logos, as befits the formality of the lecturer-student relation. Indeed, it was Dr. Lin's apparent attempt to approach Catherine in a non-formal manner (apparently oriented toward pathos rather than logos) which led her to this interpretation. \n      Second, the fact that Dr. Lin' social status is higher than Catherine's introduced the problem of the implicit power-relations in the discourse. For Catherine, the third invitation was intrusive and pushy, and it seemed that her explanations had been ignored. The evening call demanded that she re-engage in the discourse of day-time student-tutor power-relations. Since she is subordinate to Dr. Lin, other strategies through which she might have asserted her rights may have carried the risk of subsequent disfavour. However, she obviously resented what she perceived as an attempt to inappropriately use status to interfere with her personal affairs and sought out higher authority to rectify the situation, hence the complaint of harassment made to the Dean. Ironically, Dr. Lin's third invitation in the evening may well have been intended to reduce the social distance between himself and Catherine created by workplace space-time power-relations. For Dr. Lin, the first invitation expressed the illocutionary intent. The second call made sure that the invitee was made to feel assured of the sincerity of the invitation, and the third ring expressed the would-be host's appreciation. Establishing a host-guest relationship is a key illocutionary function in Chinese invitation. Note though, that there may also be a 'face' consideration here. Dr. Lin attempts to facilitate Catherine's attendance by pointing out that it would be acceptable to attend for a brief period. This suggests a re-emphasis on the orientation to logos, since it points out a compromise which allows Catherine to attend both parties. It also allowed Dr. Lin to save 'face' by not having his invitation totally disregarded. However, it failed as an illocutionary performance because the felicity conditions for polite invitation had already been violated as far as Catherine was concerned, even though they remained intact throughout for Dr. Lin. \n      In conclusion, it can be seen from the above analysis of the communication breakdown that persuasive orientations and politeness principles are interrelated and culturally sensitive. Euro-Australian culture stresses the logical orientation in illocutionary performance whereas Chinese culture seems to emphasise both the logical and emotional approaches. Without a recognition of this difference, specific politeness behaviours in intercultural invitations can lead to illocutionary incompetence. This has been exemplified by Catherine's misconstrual of Dr. Lin's intended invitation-performance as harassment. Therefore in intercultural communication, one ought not to judge a speech act such as an invitation based on one's own culture's felicity conditions. First and foremost, a basic understanding of persuasive orientations between cultures is essential. With appropriate understanding of these principles one can avoid misinterpreting the intent of the addresser, thus overcoming barriers in intercultural communication. Specifically, further appreciation of the interplay between rhetorical orientation, politeness codes and felicity conditions in illocutionary performances in different cultures is required for a fuller comprehension of potential cross-cultural incompetence. With this in mind, greater tolerance can be achieved, and intercultural competence enhanced.\n          \n      References\n      \nAristotle. Aristotle on Rhetoric: A Theory of Civic Discourse.

    "abstract": "\n      As a specialist in culture and communication studies, teaching in a\n  school of business, I realised that the notion of interdisciplinarity is\n  usually explored in the comfort of one's own discipline.  Meanwhile, the\n  practice of interdisciplinarity is something else.  The very notion of\n  disciplinarity implies a regime of discursive practices, but in the zone\n  between disciplines, there is often no adequate language.  This piece of\n  writing is a brief analysis of an example of the language of business\n  studies when business studies thinks about culture.  It looks at how\n  business studies approaches cultural difference in context of\n  intercultural contact. \n  \nGeert Hofstede's Cultures and Organizations: Software of the Mind (1991)\n  \nThis article is a brief and very selective critique of Geert Hofstede's\n  notion of culture in Cultures and Organizations: Software of the Mind. \n  Hofstede has been publishing his work on cross-cultural management since\n  the 1960s.   His work is routinely used in reference to\n  cross/multi/intercultural issues in business studies (a term I use to\n  include commerce, finance, management, and marketing).  Before I begin, I\n  must insist that Hofstede's Cultures and Organizations: Software of the\n  Mind is a very useful text for business studies students, as it introduces\n  them to useful concepts in relation to culture, like culture shock,\n  acculturation (not enculturation -- I suppose managers are repatriated\n  before that happens), and training for successful cross-cultural\n  communication.\n  \nIt is worth including here a brief note on the subtitle of Cultures and\n  Organizations: Software of the Mind.  This \"software of the mind\" is\n  clearly analogous to computer programming.  However, Hofstede disavows the\n  analogy, which is central to his thesis, saying that people are not\n  programmed the way computers are. So they are, but not really. \n  \nHofstede claims that in order to learn something different, one \"must\n  unlearn ... (the) ... patterns of thinking, feeling, and potential acting\n  which were learned throughout (one's) lifetime\". And it is this\n  thinking/feeling/acting function he calls the \"software of the mind\" (4). \n  So, is the body the hardware?  Thinking and feeling are abstract and\n  could, with a flight of fancy, be seen as \"software\". However, acting is\n  visible, tangible, and often visceral.  I am suggesting that \"acting\"\n  either represents or is just about all we have as culture.  Acting (in the\n  fullest sense, including speech, gesture, manners, textual production,\n  etc.) is not evidence of culture, it is culture.   Also, computer\n  technology, like every other technology, is part of culture, as evident in\n  this journal. \n  \nCulture\n  \nI share Clifford Geertz's concept of culture as a semiotic one, where\n  interpretation is a search for meaning, and where meaning lies in social\n  relations.  Geertz writes that to claim that culture consists in brute\n  patterns of behaviour in some identifiable community is to reduce it (the\n  community and the notion of culture). Human behaviour is symbolic action. \n  Culture is not just patterned conduct, a frame of mind which points to\n  some sort of ontological status.  Culture is public, social, relational,\n  and contextual.  To quote Geertz: \"culture is not a power, something to\n  which social events, behaviours, institutions, or processes can be\n  causally attributed; it is a context\" (14).  Culture is not an ontological\n  essence or set of behaviours.  Culture is made up of webs of\n  relationships.  That Hofstede locates culture in the mind is probably the\n  most problematic aspect of his writing. \n  \nCulture is difficult for any discipline to describe because different\n  disciplines have their own view of social reality.  They operate in their\n  own paradigms.  Hofstede uses a behaviourist psychological approach to\n  culture, which looks at what he calls national character and typical\n  behaviours.  Even though Hofstede is aware of being, as an observer  of\n  human behaviour, an integral part of his object of analysis (other\n  cultures), he nevertheless continuously equates the observed behaviour to\n  particular kinds of national thinking and feeling where national is often\n  collapsed into cultural.  Hofstede uses an empirical behaviourist paradigm\n  which measures certain behaviours, as if the observer is outside the\n  cultural significance attributed to behaviours, and attributes them to\n  culture. \n  \nHofstede's Notion of Culture\n  \nHofstede's work is based on quantitative data gathered from\n  questionnaires administered to IBM corporation employees in various\n  countries.  He looked at 72 national subsidiaries, 38 occupations, 20\n  languages, and at two points in time (1968 and 1972), and continued his\n  commentary on that data into the 1990s.  He claims that because the entire\n  sample has a common corporate culture, the only thing that can account for\n  systematic and consistent differences between national groups within a\n  homogeneous multinational organisation is nationality itself.  It is as if\n  corporate culture is outside, has nothing to do with, national culture\n  (itself a complex and dynamic concept).  Hofstede's work does not account\n  for the fact that IBM is an American multinational corporation and, as\n  such, whatever attributes are used to measure cultural difference, those\n  found in American corporate culture will set the benchmark for whatever\n  other cultures are measured. This view is supported in business studies in\n  general where American management practices are seen as universal and\n  normal, even when they are described as 'Western'. \n  \nThe areas Hofstede's IBM survey looked at are:  \n\n1. Social inequality, including the relationship with authority (also\n          described as power distance); \n  2. The relationship between the individual and the group (also\n          described as\n            individualism versus collectivism); \n  3. Concepts of masculinity and femininity: the social implications of\n            having been born as a boy or a girl (also described as masculinity versus\n            femininity); \n  4. Ways of dealing with uncertainty, relating to the control of\n          aggression\n            and the expression of emotions (also described as uncertainty avoidance).\n\nThese concepts are in themselves culturally specific and have become\n      structurally embedded in organisational theory.  Hofstede writes that\n      these four dimensions of culture are aspects of culture that can be\n      measured relative to other cultures.  What these four dimensions actually\n      do is not to combine to give us a four-dimensional (complex?) appreciation\n      of culture.  Rather, they map onto each other and reinforce a politically\n      conservative, Eurocentric view of culture.  Hofstede does admit to having\n      had \"a 'Western' way of thinking\", but he inevitably goes back to \"the\n      mind\" as a place or goal.  He refers to a questionnaire composted by\n\"Eastern', in this case Chinese minds ... [which] ... are programmed\n      according to their own particular cultural framework\" (171).  So there is\n      this constant reference to culturally programmed minds that determine\n      certain behaviours. \n      \nIn his justification of using typologies to categorise people and their\n      behaviour (minds?) Hofstede also admits that most people / cultures are\n      hybrids.  And he admits that rules are made arbitrarily in order to\n      classify people / cultures (minds?).  However, he insists that the\n      statistical clusters he ends up with are an empirical typology. \n      \nSuch a reduction of \"culture\" to this kind of radical realism is\n      absolutely anatomical and enumerative.  And, the more Hofstede is quoted\n      as an authority on doing business across cultures, the more truth value\n      his work accrues.  The sort of language Hofstede uses to describe culture\n      attributes intrinsic meanings and, as a result, points to difference\n      rather than diversity.  Languages of difference are based on binaristic\n      notions of masculine/feminine, East/West, active/passive,\n      collective/individual, and so on.  In this opposition of activity and\n      passivity, the East (feminine, collectivist) is the weaker partner of the\n      West (masculine, individualist).  There is a nexus of knowledge and power\n      that constructs cultural difference along such binaristic lines.  While a\n      language of diversity take multiplicity as a starting point, or the norm,\n      Hofstede's hegemonic and instrumentalist language of difference sees\n      multiplicity as problematic.  This problem is flagged at the very start of\n      Cultures and Organizations. \n      \n12 Angry Men: Hofstede Interprets Culture and Ignores Gender\n      \nIn the opening page of Cultures and Organizations there is a brief\n      passage from Reginald Rose's  play 12 Angry Men (1955).  (For a good\n      review of the film see http://www.film.u-\n      net.com/Movies/Reviews/Twelve_Angry.html. The film was recently remade.)\n      Hofstede uses it as an example of how twelve different people with\n      different cultural backgrounds \"think, feel and act differently\".  The\n      passage describes a confrontation between what Hofstede refers as \"a\n      garage owner\" and \"a European-born, probably Austrian, watchmaker\".  Such\n      a comparison flags, right from the start, a particular way of categorising\n      and distinguishing between two people, in terms of visible and audible\n      signs and symbols. Both parties are described in terms of their\n      occupation.  But then the added qualification of one of the parties as\n      being \"European-born, probably Austrian\" clearly indicates that the\n      unqualified party places him in the broad category \"American\".  In other\n      words, the garage owner's apparently neutral ethnicity implies a normative\n\"American\", against which all markers of cultural difference are measured. \n      \nHofstede is aware of this problem.  He writes that \"cultural relativism\n      does not imply normlessness for oneself, nor for one's society\" (7).\n      However, he still uses the syntax of binaristic classification which\n      repeats and perpetuates the very problems he is apparently addressing. \n      One of the main factors that makes 12 Angry Men such a powerful drama is\n      that each man carries / inscribes different aspects of American culture. \n      And American culture is idealised in the justice system, where rationality\n      and consensus overcomes prejudice and social pressure.  Each man has a\n      unique make-up, which includes class, occupation, ethnicity, personality,\n      intelligence, style and experience.  But 12 Angry Men is also an\n      interesting exploration of masculinity.  Because Hofstede has included a\n      category of \"masculine/feminine\" in his study of national culture, it is\n      an interesting oversight that he does not comment on this powerful element\n      of the drama. \n      \nPeople identify along various lines, in terms of ethnicities, languages,\n      histories, sexuality, politics and nationalism.  Most people do have\n      multiple and varied aspects to their identity.  However, Hofstede sees\n      multiple lines of identification as causing \"conflicting mental programs\".\n      Hofstede claims that identification on the gender level of his hierarchy\n      is determined \"according to whether a person was born as a girl or as a\n      boy\" (10).  Hofstede misses the crucial point that whilst whether one is\n      born female or male determines one's sex, whether one is enculturated as\n      and identifies as feminine or masculine indicates one's gender.  Sex and\n      gender are not the same thing.  Sex is biological (natural) and gender is\n      ideological (socially constructed and naturalised). This sort of blindness\n      to the ideological component of identity is a fundamental flaw in\n      Hofstede's thesis.  Hofstede takes ideological constructions as given, as\n      natural. For example, in endnote 1 of Chapter 4, \"He, she, and (s)he\", he\n      writes \"My choice of the terms (soft feminine and hard masculine) is based\n      on what is in virtually all societies, not on what anybody thinks should\n      be (107, his italics).  He reinforces the notion of gendered essences, or\n      essences which constitute national identity. \n      \nIndeed, the world is not made up of entities or essences that are\n      masculine or feminine, Western or Eastern, active or passive.  And the\n      question is not so much about empirical accuracy along such lines, but\n      rather what are the effects of always reinscribing cultures as Western or\n      Eastern, masculine or feminine, collectivist or individualist. In an era\n      of globalism and mass, interconnected communication, identities are\n      multiple, and terms like East and West, masculine and feminine, active and\n      passive, should be used as undecidable codes that, at the most, flag\n      fragments of histories and ideologies. \n      \nIdentity\n      \nEast and West are concepts that did not come out of a political or\n      cultural vacuum.  They are categories, or concepts, that originated and\n      flourished with European expansionism from the 17th century.  They\n      underwrote imperialism and colonisation.  They are not inert labels that\n      merely point to something \"out there\".  East and West, like masculine and\n      feminine or any other binary pair, indicate an imaginary relationship that\n      prioritises one of the pair over the other.  People and cultures cannot be\n      separated into static Western and Eastern essences.  Culture itself is\n      always diverse and dynamic.  It is marked by migration, diaspora, and\n      exile, not to mention historical change. There are no \"original\" cultures.\n      The sort of discourse Hofstede uses to describe cultures is based on an\n      ontological and epistemological distinction made between East and West. \n      \nCulture is not something invisible or intangible.  Culture is not\n      something obscure that is in the mind (whatever or wherever that is) which\n      manifests itself in peculiar behaviours.  Culture is what and how we\n      communicate, whether that takes the form of speech, gestures, novels,\n      plays, architecture, style, or art.  And, as such, communication includes\n      the objects we produce and exchange and the symbols to which we give\n      meaning. So, when Hofstede writes that the Austrian watchmaker acts the\n      way he does because he\n      \n  cannot behave otherwise. After many years in his new home country, he\n        still behaves the way he was raised.  He carries within himself an\n        indelible pattern of behaviour\n      \nhe is attributing a whole range of qualities which are frequently given\n      by dominant cultures to their cultural \"others\" (1).  Hofstede attributes\n      politeness, tradition, and, above all, stasis, to the European-Austrian\n      watchmaker.  The phrase \"after many years in his new home country\" is\n      contradictory.  If so many years have passed, why is \"home\" still \"new\"? \n      And, indeed, the watchmaker might still behave the way he was raised, but\n      it would be safe to assume that the garage owner also behaves the way he\n      was raised.  One of the main points made in 12 Angry Men is that twelve\n      American men are all very different to each other in terms of values and\n      behaviour.  All this is represented in the dialogue and behaviour of\n      twelve men in a closed room. \n      \nIf we are concerned with different kinds of social behaviour, and we are\n      not concerned with pathological behaviour, then how can we know what\n      anyone carries within themselves?  Why do we want to know what anyone\n      carries within themselves?  From a cultural studies perspective, the last\n      question is political.  However, from a business studies perspective, that\n      question is naïve.  The radical economic rationalist would want to know as\n      much as possible about cultural differences so that we can better target\n      consumer groups and be more successful in cross-cultural negotiations. \n      \n  In colonial days, foreigners often wielded absolute power in other\n        societies and they could impose their rules on it [sic]. In these\n        postcolonial days, foreigners who want to change something in another\n        society will have to negotiate their interventions. (7)\n      \nThose who wielded absolute power in the colonies were the non-indigenous\n      colonisers.  It was precisely the self-legitimating step of making a place\n      a colony that ensured an ongoing presence of the colonising power.  The\n      impetus behind learning about the Other in the colonial times was a\n      combination of spiritual salvation (as in the \"mission civilisatrice\") and\n      economic exploitation (colonies were seen as resources for the benefit of\n      the European and later American centres).  And now, the impetus behind\n      learning about cultural difference is that \"negotiation is more likely to\n      succeed when the parties concerned understand the reasons for the\n      differences in viewpoints\" (7). \n      \nCulture as Commerce\nWhat, in fact, happens, is that business studies simultaneously wants to\n\"do\" components of cross-cultural studies, as it is clearly profitable,\n      while shunning the theoretical discipline of cultural studies.  A\n      fundamental flaw in a business studies perspective, which is based on\n      Hofstede's work, is a blindness to the ideological and historical\n      component of identity. \n      \n\nBusiness studies has picked up just enough orientalism, feminism,\n      marxism, deconstruction and postcolonialism to thinly disavow any\n      complicity with dominant (and dominating) discourses, while getting on\n      with business-as-usual.  Multiculturalism and gender are seen as modern\n      categories to which one must pay lip service, only to be able to get on\n      with business-as-usual.  Negotiation, compromise and consensus are desired\n      not for the sake of success in civil processes, but for the material value\n      of global market presence, acceptance and share. \n      \nHowever, civil process and commercial interests are not easily separable.\n      To refer to a cultural economy is not just to use a metaphor.  The\n      materiality of business, in the various forms of commercial transactions,\n      is itself part of one's culture.  That is, culture is the production,\n      consumption and circulation of objects (including less easily definable\n      objects, like performance, language, style and manners).  Also, culture is\n      produced and consumed socially (in the realm of the civil) and circulates\n      through official and unofficial social and commercial mechanisms.  Culture\n      is a material and social phenomenon.  It's not something hidden from view\n      that only reveals itself in behaviours. \n      \nHofstede rightly asserts that culture is learned and not inherited. \n      Human nature is inherited.  However, it is very difficult to determine\n      exactly what human nature is.  Most of what we consider to be human nature\n      turns out to be, upon close inspection, ideological, naturalised. \n      Hofstede writes that what one does with one's human nature is \"modified by\n      culture\" (5).  I would argue that whatever one does is cultural.  And this\n      includes taking part in commercial transactions.  Even though commercial\n      transactions (including the buying and selling of services) are material,\n      they are also highly ritualistic and highly symbolic, involving complex\n      forms of communication (verbal and nonverbal language). \n      \nCulture as Mental Programming\n      \nHofstede's insistent ontological reference to 'the sources of one's\n      mental programs' is problematic for many reasons.  There is the constant\n      ontological as well as epistemological distinction being made between\n      cultures, as if there is a static core to each culture and that we can\n      identify it, know what it is, and deal with it. It is as if culture itself\n      is a knowable essence.  Even though Hofstede pays lip service to culture\n      as a social phenomenon, saying that \"the sources of one's mental programs\n      lie within the social environments in which one grew up and collected\n      one's life experiences\" (4), and that past theories of race have been\n      largely responsible for massive genocides, he nevertheless implies a kind\n      of biologism simply by turning the mind (a radical abstraction) into\n      something as crude as computer software, where data can be stored, erased\n      or reconfigured. \n      \nIn explaining how culture is socially constructed and not biologically\n      determined, Hofstede says that one's mental programming starts with the\n      family and goes on through the neighbourhood, school, social groups, the\n      work place, and the community. He says that \"mental programs vary as much\n      as the social environments in which they were acquired\", which is nothing\n      whatsoever like computer software (4-5).  But he carries on to claim that\n\"a customary term for such mental software is culture\" (4, my italics). \n      \nBefore the large-scale changes which took place in the second half of the\n      twentieth century in disciplines like anthropology, history, linguistics,\n      \nand psychology, culture was seen to be a recognisable, determined,\n      contained, consistent way of living which had deep psychic roots.  Today,\n      any link between mental processes and culture (formerly referred to as\n\"race\") cannot be sustained.  We must be cautious against presuming to\n      understand the relationship between mental process and social life and\n      also against concluding that the content of the mind in each racial (or,\n      if you like, ethnic or cultural) group is of a peculiar kind, because it\n      is this kind of reductionism that feeds stereotypes.  And it is the\n      accumulation of knowledge about cultural types that implies power over the\n      very types that are thus created. \n      \nConclusion\n      \nA genuinely interdisciplinary approach to communication, commerce and\n      culture would make business studies more theoretical and more challenging.\n      And it would make cultural studies take commerce more seriously, beyond a\n      mere celebration of shopping.  This article has attempted to reveal some\n      of the cracks in how business studies accounts for cultural diversity in\n      an age of global commercial ambitions.  It has also looked at how\n      Hofstede's writings, as exemplary of the business studies perspective,\n      papers over those cracks with a very thin layer of pluralist cultural\n      relativism.  This article is an invitation to open up a critical dialogue\n      which dares to go beyond disciplinary traditionalisms in order to examine\n      how meaning, communication, culture, language and commerce are embedded in\n      each other. \n      \n          \n\n     References\n      \n     \nCarothers, J.C.

    "abstract": "\n      \n      What is game who got game\n      Where's the game \n      In life \n      Behind the game \n      Behind the game \n      I got game \n      She got game \n      We got game \n      They got game \n      He got game -- He Got Game by Public Enemy(From the soundtrack to the 1998 Spike Lee film He Got Game)\n      \n      There is an interesting pattern that develops when a relatively new object of study is broached by cultural studies academics. A reflex response is to defend the reasons why you are giving time to studying these apparently innocuous pastimes. Defenses of television studies twenty-five years ago could have resembled the way that the new forms of games are now being investigated: a preamble of justification -- like an incredibly deep inhalation that has to precede a long-winded exhalation -- would be necessary before launching into the dance of critical analysis. Thankfully our authors have learned and progressed from their forebears at least in this issue (but probably not in every version of game material that you will see flowing outwards in the next few years) and our articles get to the heart of the game, conceptually, analytically and critically. What we're telling you is that this is a remarkable issue that, along with the online re-play conference of 1999, launches the study of games in the contemporary moment of new media game forms and their call and response to previous patterns of play and pastimes. The articles here represent cutting-edge thinking about games and we have, as your humble issue editors, collected those postures and positions in one place. \n      The term pastime to describe playing games has become a bit antiquated, but we'd like to regenerate it here. Our various authors have obviously devoted an incredible number of hours to understanding the games that they describe: contemporary computer games, as much as learning the intricacies of a particular sport, often require an investment of time over weeks and months to achieve sometimes only limited mastery. A pastime has usually been relegated to rainy Saturday afternoons when children (or adults) couldn't work out what do with themselves and were trapped within the confines of the home. To pass the time the old standard board games would appear: from the Victorian Snakes and Ladders to the spirit of proprietorial capitalism of Monopoly; from the war dimensions of Risk and Chess to the mildly headache-producing Scrabble. Passing time could be seen as a description of what childhood has often been about: a transitional reality whose value is always questionable and debatable by others because it is seen as the foundation for the rest of life. Indeed, one element of the moral panic about contemporary computer games is a matter of adults trying to determine whether these games are valuable for their children's future employability in the information economy or a massive waste of time that can never be recovered (Marshall). The pastime, instead of being of peripheral importance has now moved centre-stage in contemporary life through the ubiquity of electronic games and the fact that these games no longer are clearly the province of adolescents but a major cultural reality for a very large population from the ages 5 to 50. The concept of game has similarly migrated, so that most of the authors who have written for this issue have dealt with video and computer games primarily and not with sport or board games or even television game shows, although we have our new and intriguing representative articles from some of these other domains. \n      Several of our authors have been intrigued by how video and computer games have now become metaphors for contemporary life. Certainly recent films have used the game as the new way to deal with the fears and powers of general technological change. In \"Flip Horizontal: Gaming as Redemption\" José dos Santos Cabral Filho relies on Roger Callois's categories to debate the role of the game in the formation of identity in contemporary culture's continuous debate about the power of technology to determine, and the freedom that technology apparently endows to its users. \"The Fortean Continuity of eXistenZ within a Virtual Environment\" by Adam Dodd revisits the work of philosopher of the paranormal, Charles Fort, and explores the connections between his ontology of continuity and the movement of signs within a postmodern, virtual, networked environment, analysing Cronenberg's 'game' film eXistenZ and relationships between the body, media, truth and representation. In \"Game\" Rebecca Farley ponders the concepts of 'game' and 'play' and how these intersect with the values of the society in which games are produced and played, and argues for game theories that recognise the essential element central to all gaming experiences: the player. \"The Knowledge Adventure: Game Aesthetics and Web Hieroglyphics\" by Axel Bruns looks at the shifting aesthetic relationship between words and images in new media as exemplified by the Internet, as a focus for an examination of the influences computer gaming has brought to the Internet, and to computing in general. \n      Our tapestry on the game weaves from this larger conceptual pattern into analytical reflection about the aesthetics and narratives in particular games. In \"Odyssey Renewed: Towards a New Aesthetics of Video-Gaming\", Jason Wilson identifies the limitations of critical approaches that focus mainly on the screen and on-screen events; he calls for an expanded aesthetics of gaming that recognises the possibilities for \"hybrid, cyborg players to narrate performance, play and self\" and then analyses how players access this in a variety of games. In \"Towards an Aesthetics of Navigation -- Spatial Organisation in the Cosmology of the Adventure Game\", Bernadette Flynn takes us on a guided tour through the virtual worlds of the exploration/adventure games Myst and The Crystal Key via the historic, visual structures of art, architecture and cinema, and examines how these past forms and influences are used to establish representational context, and position, and work to orient and narrate players through the ludic space. In \"Computer Games and Narrative Progression\", Mark Finn examines the varying degrees of success with which theories from existing media have been applied to computer games, and analyses a variety of console games, specifically using the concepts of narrative progression and subject positioning, showing how these are both enforced by the game and negotiated in the complex relationship between game and player. \n      Computer games are highly diverse in terms of game genre, technology, interactivity and the positioning of the player -- physically, narratively, subjectively and ideologically. While certain analyses may be applied to games in general, some of the best work gets into the particularities of gameplay, success, pleasure and expertise. The two following articles each provide an in-depth analysis of a particular game -- how it is structured, how players interact with the game, and the ideological assumptions that are inherent in the game software. \"The Fabric of Virtual Reality -- Courage, Rewards and Death in an Adventure MUD\" by Daniel Pargman takes us inside the world of the online adventure MUD (Multi-User Domain) in his analysis of the text-based SvenskMUD, which has been running in Sweden for the last nine years. In \"Settler Stories: Representational Ideologies in Computer Strategy Gaming\" Nick Caldwell examines a real-time strategy (RTS) game, The Settlers, demonstrating how ideological assumptions about culture and production may be actualised in a virtual environment. \n      Our final two articles deal with the fascinating intersection between games and media: how games are used to create media content, and how this repositioning as media spectacle influences and indeed dictates many aspects of the game. In \"Technology and Sport\" Greg Levine discusses the impact of media broadcast of sporting matches on televised sport through an analysis of Australian Rules football and looks at the broader effects of technological innovation on sport. Carol Morgan examines another meeting of game and media in \"Capitalistic Ideology as an 'Interpersonal Game': The Case of Survivor\", an analysis of this year's highly popular game show Survivor and the economic and social ideals that are implicit in, and perpetuated by that particular game. \n      Oh, and then there is our final, final submission that you should not miss -- like an extra game level that you haven't discovered yet: this contribution comes from a person who actually failed in his attempt to capture what he wanted to say through an article for submission to the 'game' issue. Jesper Juul, along with 3D graphics by Mads Rydahl, has created a game instead that is designed for your pleasure and for those who have waded through the articles of game theory. It's called \"Game Liberation\" and its composed of four levels where you as game theorist have to blast away to destroy each theory that tries to colonise games and claim they have worked out their cultural significance. So cool down with a pleasant round of Space Invader-style shoot-em-up after a hard day of facing the faux-titans of media and cultural studies. Experience the zen-zone pleasure of games firsthand without leaving your comfort zone of intellectual gymnastics. \n      We have tried to capture here some of the surface and depth of game culture -- if we can be so bold as to propose a new area of cultural study that is consolidating as a clear and interesting domain of popular culture and intellectual inquiry. As our articles demonstrate game culture does not fit comfortably into past forms of media analysis although there are insights about games that can be teased outwards from their relationship to visual/textual media forms. We invite your comments so that the analytical/critical process initiated by this issue can continue and encourage you to extrapolate outwards through your interventions and contribution on the Media-Culture list associated with M/C. Our authors are thirsty for discussion and debate. Although the issue is not quite like an adventure game, we invite you to point and click and investigate its various threads of game culture. \n      P.

If that original project had stood, then only the papers in the \"Cultural Theory\" middle section (Laba, McHoul, Mules) would have filled the brief in the strictest sense. \n      In that section, Martin Laba begins by taking apart philosophical and anthropological versions of culture and running them up against his own experiences of cultural action in Pakistan (where \"cultural action\" is opposed to \"theoretical insinuation\"). Behind Laba's \"ethnography\", for those who have eyes to read it, lies a deep and trenchant critique of what is now the dominant and, to some extent, restrictive discipline in the area, Cultural Studies. \n      This is followed by Alec's own paper which, on the surface, deals with a rather obscure (and atypical) dialogue of Heidegger's. It could, of course, have been located in the \"Crossing Cultures\" section (Berger, Degabriele, Gillard, Hyndman). But that's not the main point. The main point is to effect a critique -- in the Kantian sense of pushing to the limits in order to define -- of the idea of culture, by asking \"When are we in the presence of a culture and not something else altogether?\" The fundamental assumption here is that, ontologically, the cultural is a quite specific domain, contrary to the popular idea that \"everything is cultural\". \n      Warwick Mules takes this up in a different and original way by asking how the concept of culture is practically challenged by current technologies. His argument is that our idea of culture is always tainted by the idea of physical presence. When new technologies allow that presence to be removed, what shall we then take as \"the cultural\"? As it turns out, for Mules, the cultural then becomes much more significant and less dominated by its \"other\" -- the social. As he writes: \"the reduction of culture to the social should be replaced by an inquiry into the proliferation of the social through the cultural, as so many experiences of the virtual in time and space\". \n      So all of that would make a fine issue in itself. Except that we received much more challenging and contestable papers that opened up the question of culture by showing it rather than saying it. Arthur Asa Berger's paper, to start with, looks like the \"pure theory\" of Section 2, since it starts with something called \"the origins of the term\". But, in fact, by looking at travellers' stories -- and so using cultural difference as its sticking post -- and then coming back, after the fact, to the question of culture itself, leaves us wondering about the very idea. His view, that culture makes a \"big difference\", opens matters up in new ways that \"pure theory\" could never resolve. \n      Shifting the ground, Maria Degabriele asks what happens when a traditionally non-culturalist discipline opens its doors to the idea of culture. Here, she writes specifically of Business Studies -- perhaps one of the last areas of intellectual inquiry where we'd expect to find culture discussed. Although critical of how Business Studies manipulates the idea of culture, she concludes with the possibility of opening a dialogue between the disciplines and how that may be done. \n      Then we move on, again in the disciplinary sense, to Garry Gillard's investigation of culture in Freud's meaning of the term. If \"Freud reads culture like a text\", as Gillard says from the outset, then there might be a possible super-text, that is also a mind-culture system. The consequences of such a hypothesis are far-reaching -- because, if Gillard is right, then culture is built into the psychoanalytic project from the start rather than being a mere add-on to an analysis of individual minds.\n      Then the David Hyndman paper takes us back to the more \"practical\" world by making us read the pages of perhaps the international cross-cultural organ, the National Geographic. Who, in the West, has never seen such pages? Who has never taken this ubiquitous organ as their own way into the culturally \"exotic\"? What Hyndman does is to take us there -- again -- but with a critical edge. And, in the process, shows us what the common sense idea of culture is in its mediated form. \n      What surprised us, as editors of these pieces, was how often the question of culture overlapped with the question of identity. Somehow the two are intrinsically linked perhaps? To open this possibility, Felicity Newman, Tracey Summerfield and Reece Plunkett stage three quite different and distinct reflections on three equally distinct forms of cultural identity: being a Jew, being a lawyer and being a dyke. What emerges from this is a rather curious paradox: identities are radically different both in their \"content\" and in the ways in which different persons come to acquire and accept them. What is shown here, even if it's not said, is this: can there be a single theory of cultural identity that can cope with such incredible differences? If not, then identity itself may be a radically and irrevocably fractured concept.\n      Something similar emerges when we look at cultural identities that are specific and local in the geographical sense. Here, Catherine Richardson takes us through the question of culture in an Australian country town, Tamworth, during an election phase. What is opened here is the possibility of islands of relatively stable cultural identity in a world which Richardson sees as otherwise fragmented and fractured and therefore torn by anxiety about cultural identities.\n      Finally, Nadine Wills opens up the questions of cultural identity and cross-cultural alterity by turning to the everyday matter of clothing. Her argument is that \"culture defines itself not only by what is contained within but by what is outside its boundaries as well\". Working, then, with the dual concepts of borderlines and \"transition discourses\", Wills shows us how these can be used to analyse cultures as inter-connected small worlds.   \n      Susan Luckman\n&amp;  Alec McHoul\n  -- 'Culture' Issue Editors\n          \n      Citation reference for this article  \n       MLA style:\n       \n Susan Luckman, Alec McHoul. \"Editorial: 'Culture'.\" M/C: A Journal of Media and Culture 3.2 (2000).

    "title": "Culture as Action",
    "abstract": "\n      Culture is a mercurial concept -- volatile, contested, and somehow, less\n      than the sum of its parts. Its anthropology, it can be argued, was rooted\n      in an exoticising scholarship typical of the late 19th-century colonialist\n      ruminations on all things \"other\"; in contemporary terms of course, this\n      exoticising tendency would be termed, as it should, \"Orientalist\". Still,\n      there is something more than merely residual in the persistence of a\n      notion of culture as a summary, as a package of knowledge and practice, as\n      a name for identity, or even politics, all of which draw clearly from the\n      well of Edward B. Tylor's bold attempt to terminologically and\n      conceptually capture \"the most complex whole\", a people's entire way of\n      life (albeit non-white, non-literate, non-western people) from what we can\n      trust were the considerable comforts of his armchair. This Tylorean notion\n      of culture, as Clifford Geertz once suggested, leads to a \"conceptual\n      morass\" that \"obscures a great deal more than it reveals\" (4).\n\t  \n      Another definitional foundation of culture for consideration is the\n        philosophical tradition of German Idealism. Culture as a process of\n        aesthetic education was for Friedrich Schiller a means of progressing from\n        a state of nature to a state of reason without the destruction of nature.\n        Schiller offered a critique of Kant's account of the development of reason\n        (the achievement of the state of rationality as key to the education and\n        progress of humanity) as necessarily predicated on the containment and\n        ultimately, the destruction of nature (against the chaos and moral abyss\n        that is nature). Schiller argued for the capacity of art to infuse nature\n        with morality, to serve as an intermediary of sorts, between chaotic\n        nature and the structures of pure reason. It is the cultivation of moral\n        character -- Bildung -- that is the foundation of this capacity, and that\n        defines the nature and purpose of \"culture\" as a process of aesthetic\n        education. There were two influential trajectories that seem inspired by\n        this philosophical source. First, there was an important sense from the\n        German Idealists that culture was a determining principle of nation (the\n        nation-state is achieved through Bildung, through cultivation), and\n        accordingly, culture was understood as the source of nationhood. Second,\n        culture took on the sense of moral authority, an Arnoldian equation of\n        culture with high culture and a concomitant mistrust of all things\n        democratic and popular, which debase and ultimately threaten the authority\n        of high culture. \n\t\t\n      Raymond Williams's reinterpretation of culture merits attention because\n        of its departure from previous traditions of defining culture, and because\n        it is a useful foundation for the view of culture proposed later in this\n        discussion. Williams offered a detailed historical analysis of the\n        reasons for the under-theorisation of the British labour movement, and the\n        glaring dislocation of the English proletariat from the ideas, the\n        concepts, the political theory of capitalism. Actual working classes in\n        Britain, the \"lived culture\" of workers, fit neither into broad political\n        theoretical currents, nor into an examination of workers as elements in a\n        historical process -- this lived culture defied the embrace of political\n        analysis. Williams argued for a more anthropological view of culture, and\n        decisively shifted the concept away from the British literary-cultural\n        tradition, away from Arnold's \"high culture\", to a view of culture as a\n        whole way of life, and open to the vision and the possibilities of social\n        integration, popular classes, and popular struggles in ordinary, everyday\n        life. \n\t\t\n      Williams argued compellingly for the \"ordinariness\" of culture. As Bill\n        Readings notes, \"Williams's insistence that culture is ordinary was a\n        refusal to ignore the actual working classes in favor of the liberated\n        proletarians who were to be their successors after the revolution\" (92).\n        In this sense, culture confounds political theory -- or to stretch the\n        point, culture confounds systematic theorising. In a similar vein, and in\n        a classic of anthropological inquiry, Clifford Geertz argued that the\n        analysis of culture was \"not an experimental science in search of law, but\n        an interpretive one in search of meaning\" (4). Such an \"interpretive\"\n        project demands above all, that that the analyst is also a participant in\n        a dimension of the culture she/he is describing. \n\t\t\n      I want to consider two of Geertz's assertions in his interpretive theory\n        of culture to frame my proposal for a concept of culture-as-action. \n        Geertz maintained that cultural analysis is guesswork rather than\n        systematic theorising, which he regarded as a manipulation or\n        reconstruction of reality through analytical practices in search of\n        elegant schemata. Cultural analysis is \"guessing at meanings, assessing\n        the guesses, and drawing explanatory conclusions from the better guesses,\n        not discovering the Continent of Meaning and mapping out its bodiless\n        landscape\" (20). Clearly, Geertz trained his critical sights on\n        anthropological trends to extrapolate from material data singularly\n        coherent, even symmetrical systems, orders, properties, and universals in\n        a method that wants to imitate, but is not science. Interpretation\n        resists scientism. \n\t\t\n      In a second assertion, Geertz argued that any sustained symbolic action --\n        the stuff of culture -- is \"saying something of something\" (448-53). \n        While this assertion appears disarmingly simple, it is profound in its\n        implications. It points to the possibility that cultural analysis, if it\n        is to grasp and interpret layered, textured, and often thoroughly complex\n        significations, must attend to \"semantics\" rather than \"mechanics\"; the\n        representation of the substance of culture, its symbolic expressive forms\n        and its unfolding action, rather than the insinuation, or even the bold\n        declaration of systems and formulas, however elegant, of cultural patterns\n        and process. The concern in interpretation -- a form of representation --\n        is that \"a good interpretation of anything -- a poem, a person, a history,\n        a ritual, an institution, a society -- takes us into the heart of that of\n        which it is the interpretation\" (18). To describe culture is to attend to\n        action -- actual and resonant -- and such descriptions representations\n        have responsibility; specifically, they must seek to grasp and portray\n        social discourse and its possible meanings in ways that allow symbolic\n        action -- the vocabulary of culture -- to speak on its own behalf. \n      \n      We arrived back in Lahore after a day's journey by jeep over the bone-dry\n        and dusty roads of rural Punjab. The air was a toxic soup, and the heat\n        was crushing, as it always is in Pakistan in monsoon season. The interior\n        of the vehicle was an oven, and I was feeling sealed and cooked, even with\n        all the windows open. My friend and driver, Ashicksahib and I were soaked\n        with sweat from the journey, and we were eager to finally get out of the\n        jeep as we pulled into the city in the late afternoon. I had been through\n        a half dozen bottles of water, but I still felt dizzy with dehydration. I\n        knew that this day was the celebration of Mohammed's birthday, and while I\n        expected many people on the streets, I was unprepared for the magnitude of\n        the event that was taking place. \n\t\t\n      The crowds consumed us. We crawled along until we couldn't continue. The\n        jeep had to stop as the sea of celebrants became denser and denser inside\n        the city, and Ashicksahib shrugged his massive shoulders, smiled at me\n        from under his thick white moustache, wiped his neck with a sodden cloth,\n        and said in Urdu, \"That's it, we cannot move, there's nowhere for us to\n        go. We must be patient.\" I had never seen this much humanity gathered in\n        a single place before. There were only boys and men of course, thousands\n        and thousands of them moving along in joyous procession -- on foot, piled\n        on platforms of flatbed trucks, stuffed into rickshaws, two or three\n        sharing scooters and bicycles. The usual animal multitudes -- herds of\n        water buffalo, goats, some camels, the ubiquitous miserable and thread-\n        bare donkeys with their carts -- all stood passively in the midst of the\n        chaos, too exhausted or too confused to register any instinctive response.\n        Blasting loudspeakers competed from a hundred different directions, chants\n        and patriotic music, prayers and devotional declarations, the staccato\n        delivery of fundamentalist pedagogy and the improvised reveries of\n        individuals with small bullhorns. The soft drink vendors shouted to the\n        crowds to make way as they spun their carts around over and over again,\n        and darted off into fray. \n\t\t\n      I brought out my camera, and because the noise was deafening, I mimed to\n        Ashicksahib my intention to take some photos from the roof of the jeep. \n        He motioned with an affirmative sweep of his hand and the typical and\n        essential south Asian head roll, and I pried open the door and squeezed\n        out against the celebrants pressed up to the side of the jeep. I hoisted\n        myself onto the roof and sat cross-legged to steady myself for some wide-\n        angle shots of the celebrations. I had some concern over my obviousness --\n        white and western -- but everyone who saw me shouted greetings in Urdu or\n        Punjabi, waved and smiled, and young boys ran up very close to the jeep to\n        see what I was up to. I heard Ashicksahib laughing, and all seemed safe --\n        until the squadrons of Sunni fundamentalists caught sight of me as their\n        trucks crawled by in a formation that seemed remarkably disciplined and\n        militaristic in the direct contrast to the emotionalism and formlessness\n        of the event. \n\t\t\n      Like the wave in a sports stadium, the young men stood up one by one on\n        the back of the trucks, their green turbans cut into the indefinite wash\n        of a grey, polluted sky, their eyes searching until they fixed on me, now\n        exposed and vulnerable on the roof of the jeep. And quickly they leapt\n        from their trucks like a SWAT team responding crisply to a crisis, precise\n        and efficient, jaws clenched, cocked for action. I saw them first through\n        the lens of my camera, and uttered an expletive or two appropriate to the\n        situation. I knew I was in trouble, and clearly, I had nowhere to go. \n\t\t\n      The turbans formed a green ribbon winding through the mass. As they\n        approached, the eyes of the militants were trained on me with the focus of\n        a predator about to take down its prey. I slipped back into the jeep\n        through the window, and motioned for Ashicksahib to look over the crowd\n        and see the slow and steady movement of the green turbans toward us. His\n        smile vanished instantly, and he readied himself for confrontation. When\n        the first militant reached the jeep's window, Ashicksahib's entire body\n        was taut and urgent, like a finger twitching on the trigger of a pistol. \n\t\t\n      \"American! American! No photo! No photo!\" The leader of the group\n        shouted at me in English and began to bang the side of the jeep. Ten or\n        twelve young men, eyes flaring under their turbans, screamed at me and\n        joined in the assault on the jeep. Ashicksahib had waited for a\n        particular moment, it occurred to me later, a certain point in the rising\n        arc of tension and emotion. He opened his door, but did not leave the\n        jeep. Instead he stood on the step on the driver's side, half in and half\n        out, slowly unfurled his considerable frame to its full height, and began\n        his verbal assault. He stood on his perch above the action and in a play\n        of passions, he shouted his opponents into submission. There were a few\n        physical sorties by the militants, attempts to kick the door of the jeep\n        into Ashicksahib, but these were displays, and Ashicksahib kicked back\n        only once. And suddenly they wavered, an erosion of spirit evidenced in\n        their eyes, a bending to the force roaring above them. They gave up their\n        attempts to grab my camera, to gain entry to the jeep, and with a swift\n        gesture of his hand, the leader called his small army into retreat. \n      \n      This same festival that mobilised great masses of people in celebration,\n        that enacted the inextricableness of nationalist and Pakistani Muslim\n        commitment and identity, that on the surface appeared to articulate and\n        demonstrate a collective belief and purpose, also dramatised conflictive\n        divisions and the diverse interpretations of what it means to be a\n        Pakistani, a Muslim, a Punjabi, an Indus person, a Lahori, a poor person,\n        a person of means, and numerous other identities at stake. As an obvious\n        westerner in the midst of the event, I was variously ignored, warmly\n        greeted as a friendly foreigner, or accosted as an unwelcome interloper,\n        each interaction unfolding within a broader and deeper passionate ritual\n        which for some meant play and celebration, and for others meant a serious\n        and forceful demonstration of affiliation, faith, and nationalism. \n\t\t\n      I had been working in both village and urban contexts on issues and\n        strategies around communication/education and advocacy with South Asia\n        Partnership-Pakistan, a non-government organisation based in Lahore that\n        was engaged in front-line work for social change. The organisation was\n        driven by the pursuit of the principles of civil society, and on a daily\n        basis, it contended with the brutal contradictions to those principles.\n        Its work was carried out against a bulwark of poverty and fundamentalism\n        that seemed impenetrable, and this moment of imminent confrontation\n        resonated with the complex historical, cultural, and political dynamics of\n        identity, religion, nationalism, colonialism, and a seething cauldron of\n        south Asian geopolitics. \n\t\t\n      As Paulo Freire argued that world views are manifested in actions that\n        offer insight into broader and prevailing social and political conditions,\n        so Geertz maintained that societies \"contain their own interpretations\". \n        This was not essentialism -- there were none of the conceits or\n        romanticism of essentialist readings of the commonplace as encapsulated\n        social and political axioms. Rather, these views were a call for\n        analytical honesty, a participatory and political dimension to cultural\n        analysis that works to gain some access to these \"interpretations\" by\n        encountering and apprehending culture in forms of action. Cultural\n        analysis becomes a kind of trial-by-fire, a description from a viewpoint\n        of participatory engagement. By \"participatory\", I mean everything that\n        the bloodlessness and obfuscation of so much of Cultural Studies is not --\n        an actual stake in action and consequence in a real world of politics. \n\t\t\n      The interpretation of culture is valuable when it attends to action\n        rather than theoretical insinuation; to cultural volatility and\n        contingency, and the broad determinants of social discourse rather than\n        schemata and structure as critical ends. Interpretation has a\n        participatory dimension -- an involvement, an engagement with culture\n        described and interpreted -- which eschews the privilege of theory\n        unimpeded by empirical evidence. \n      \n          \n\t  \n      References\n      \nFreire, Paulo.

    "abstract": "\n      \n      \"For most of us, if we do not talk of ourselves, or at any rate of the individual circles of which we are the centres, we can talk of nothing. I cannot hold with those who wish to put down the insignificant chatter of the world.\" -- Anthony Trollope, Framley Parsonage\n      \n      This issue of M/C explores the notion of 'chat', examining its contexts, forms, functions and operations. 'Chat' appears to be a descriptive subset of 'talk', often characterised somewhat unfairly as idle or frivolous 'small talk', 'gossip' -- the kind of tête-à-tête that is mediated through cups of tea (alluded to in Jen Henzell's cover image). However, 'chat' is not only an extremely prevalent activity, but, as Trollope implies, a primary social activity. Serious academic regard for 'chat' can be traced to Malinowski's (150) coining of the term \"phatic communion\" to refer to talk that expresses the \"ties of union\", a notion later taken up by Laver (\"Communicative Functions\"; \"Linguistic Routines\"). Watzlawick, Beavin and Jackson made a similar distinction between the content level of communication (contains assumptions that are communicable) and the relationship level (which reveals the speaker's attitude to the assumptions communicated and the speaker's relationship with and opinion of the hearer). 'Chat', they argue, is more about building and solidifying relationships between interactants than imparting information. Even gossip, probably the most content driven form of 'chat', lets hearers know that they are regarded well enough by the speakers to be drawn into confidence.\n      We have divided the M/C 'chat' issue into two sections along the lines of context. The first section deals with what might be termed 'traditional' or 'more general' forms of chat, where the interactants are either physically (face-to-face) or acoustically (telephone) copresent. Given both the period and the medium in which M/C 'chat' is being published, it should not be surprising that the second section deals with computer-mediated communication (CMC). With the advent of CMC, 'chat' -- and research on it -- has been transformed, taking with it much of the old formula and leaving behind some of its trappings.\n      M/C 'chat' is introduced by Charles Antaki's Feature Article \"Two Rhetorical Uses of the Description 'Chat'\". In this insightful and highly accessible piece, Antaki explores the paradoxical manner in which the description of a discursive event as 'chat' may be used to socially persuasive ends. Antaki takes as his starting point the fact that some uses of the word 'chat' demonstrate an old-fashioned view of spoken discourse as an inefficient information-transmission system ('mere talk' and 'gossip'). This, he argues, belies -- and belittles -- its use in actual talk. Analyses of four transcripts containing the descriptor 'chat' illustrate how speakers deploy it as a tactic to promote a description of an informal and blameless event, when in fact the episode in question might be categorised as something rather different. As befits an article by a member of Loughborough University's influential Discourse and Rhetoric Group, folded into the analysis is a persuasive demonstration of the methodological and theoretical strength of Conversation Analysis (CA) for describing language-in-use. However, as Antaki concludes, this is not just a game for analysts - we are all fundamentally sensitive to the power of the 'chat' descriptor.\n      M/C 'chat' is introduced by Charles Antaki's Feature Article \"Two Rhetorical Uses of the Description 'Chat'\".

The first half of Frankland's article is an historical demonstration of the almost inevitable links between the rise of the urban form and moves away from local media to media globalisation. Given this history, in the second half of the article Frankland asks what effect the absence of local forms of media might have. He argues that local media forms are important sense-making mechanisms, operating at the level of personal effectivity, for assimilating the constantly changing media-scape. Local news media, and the even more micro level of 'chat' may act as \"transition discourses\", meaningful local contexts in which we may discuss the global.\n      Most of the articles in this collection are about forms of chat to which both parties consent. \"Invitation or Sexual Harassment? An Analysis of an Intercultural Communication Breakdown\" by Zhu Yunxia and Peter Thompson considers quite the opposite -- unwelcome 'chatting up' or verbal sexual harassment. Zhu and Thompson examine a series of three telephone invitations to a party from a male Chinese tutor to a female Australian student, which resulted in an accusation of sexual harassment. Through an analysis combining Searle's speech acts, Austin's felicity conditions and Aristotle's rhetorical strategies, Zhu and Thompson suggest that different cultures use different tactics in the speech act of an invitation and they believe that the potential for miscommunication is increased when intercultural differences are present in the interaction.\n      \"The Naturally-Occurring Chat Machine\" is Darren Reed and Malcolm Ashmore's interesting methodological reflection on the nature of the data collection and transcription processes of Conversation Analysis (CA), in order to \"provoke a reconsideration of the marginal status of textually conducted interaction as a proper topic for CA\". The worked-up complexities of CA transcripts, they argue, produce a myth of an unmediated origin, when in fact 'machinic-productive processes' are used to produce data considered 'studiable' in the CA of face-to-face conversations. Analogous processes produce data for the CA of Internet newsgroup messages. Ironically, in terms of CA's claim of using 'naturally occurring' data, Reed and Ashmore make the controversial counter-claim that newsgroup data might be considered superior to transcribed data, as the textual character of Internet newsgroups is the result of participants' work. In effect, therefore, Internet newsgroup data is considerably less mediated than recorded and transcribed conversations.\n      Reed and Ashmore provide a neat link between bring the first section of M/C 'chat', dealing with what might be termed 'traditional chat media', and the second section concentrating on computer-mediated communication (CMC). The boom in CMC also marks the renaissance of Conversation Analytic research. Interestingly, both Reed and Ashmore, who end this section, and Paul ten Have, who we asked to introduce the CMC section, note that the proliferation of new interaction media not only provides new contexts in which to investigate human interaction, but also very conveniently produce easy-to-use data as a natural process of participation.\n     Paul ten Have begins the CMC section with an introduction to some of the fundamental features and concerns of CMC research in his ethnographic investigation of how to find someone to talk to in a chat room. From the standpoint of Membership Categorisation Analysis (MCA), \"Computer-Mediated Chat: Ways of Finding Chat Partners\" takes us through a description of the more or less generic categorisation features of most chat rooms, and then into the three primary concerns that CMC users often make apparent very early in an interaction: age, sex and location, indicated by the acronymic \"a/s/l please\". Interestingly, his conclusion is that while it is clear that pre-existing communication procedures must be adapted to the new environment -- manifested perhaps most obviously by a more explicit questioning when searching for chat partners -- current media do not provide much scope for radical change in the fundamentals of 'chat'.\n      \n      Paul ten Have begins the CMC section with an introduction to some of the fundamental features and concerns of CMC research in his ethnographic investigation of how to find someone to talk to in a chat room.

She notes that most interactive CMC systems place certain restrictions on the way in which a person may present themselves on arrival in the room. In her article, \"Neither Male nor Female: Other -- Gendered Chat in Little Italy\", Mowbray notes that the Little Italy's system (created by Pavel Curtis originally for Lambda MOO) gives participants the opportunity to broaden their gender presentation options from 'female' or 'male' to a range of 'other genders'. Mowbray observes that a fifth of the inhabitants of Little Italy opt to choose a gender other than that of the traditional 'female' or 'male', and, significantly, that half of users presenting as 'other genders' are still participating after a year -- more than the traditionally gendered Little Italians. Through 28 responses from these Little Italians, Mowbray investigates why these other-gendered participants are more likely to remain in the one space than those who chose 'female' or 'male'. She concludes that it is \"the personal creative investment by the other-gendered citizens in Little Italy that makes them especially likely to remain active citizens.\" Mowbray considers Little Italy's system to be an excellent demonstration of a \"stickiness\" feature -- a feature of a CMC system that attracts long term use. Her results should be of interest to software companies wanting to design popular -- and profitable -- chat rooms.\n      Since interactive synchronous and quasi-synchronous CMC systems became popular with the release of IRC, ICQ, Webchat and various ISP chat rooms, a flood of research about the transformation of language in computer-mediated situations has resulted. However most of this work has concentrated on chat between strangers. Campbell and Wickman observe this bias in their article, \"Familiars in a Strange Land: A Case Study of Friends Chatting Online\", choosing instead to concentrate on computer-mediated chat between acquaintances. In this autoethnographic account, the authors note that although they have adopted some of the more common conversational CMC strategies, they have also created their own, relevant to their particular circumstances. Historically, CMC research has argued that the 'cues-filtered-out' nature of CMC systems leads to depersonalisation and the lack of necessity to adhere to social conventions of politeness. However, Campbell and Wickman note that in their own chat as online and offline familiars, they observe a strong need to adhere to politeness conventions, due to the face-to-face consequences of their online actions. This interesting finding suggests that politeness theory may be of great value in future CMC research, particularly that comparing and contrasting chat between familiars and strangers, and/or face-to-face and online interaction.\n      As Ylva Hård af Segerstad points out, most CMC research is conducted on English language forums. M/C 'chat' is pleased to help redress this balance with the publication of investigations on the impact of computer-mediation on languages other than English, in this case Swedish. Given the English focus of the Internet, however, CMC research on languages other than English must, of course, take account of the variations between the language-specific and 'international' (read English-language) forums. This being the case, Hård af Segerstad discusses the result of questionnaire data and logged conversations to determine if written online Swedish is being adapted in ways particular to it, or if Swedish written language is being developed in analogy with adaptations observable in international chat rooms. While the surprisingly uniform results of the two data sources indicate that Swedish written language is being adapted for online chat (rather than using one language offline and another online), the actual adaptation strategies are much the same as those observed in other adaptations of writing in general.\n      In their paper \"Chatting to Learn and Learning to Chat in Collaborative Virtual Environments\", Teresa Cerratto and Yvonne Wærn discuss the importance of conversation to educational contexts and the communication problems inherent in using an electronic medium as an educational tool. These authors are more concerned with the information transmission aspect of chat rather than its dominant relationship characteristics. They examine two groups of teachers in Sweden who are learning to use the new collaborative virtual environment, TAPPED IN™. Cerratto and Wærn note some of the strategies that the teachers adopt in attempting to gain the floor in this CVE where there are a number of people vying for attention. At the same time, tactics used by teachers for communicative collaboration are also discussed by these authors. Finally, on the basis of an analysis of their data, Cerratto and Wærn provide arguments for the importance of leadership in these particular learning environments, arguing a leader helps maintain the informational coherence of the discussions.\n      In terms of redressing imbalances in CMC research, not only has language been particularly biased to English, but in some media -- Internet Relay Chat (IRC) in particular -- most research has been qualitative in nature. We may know how users manage their interactions online, but how many are doing so? The bases of many generalisations about adaptation strategies are somewhat shaky on the quantitative front. Much can be gained by combining the quantitative with the qualitative, and with this in mind, Hinner has taken it upon himself to not only create a system capable of capturing usage statistics for all the major IRC networks, but also to provide two years of these statistics and make this system available on his Website. His article details the processes involved in creating the Socip statistical program and sample graphs of the kinds of information that his system can provide.\n      The CMC section of M/C 'Chat' brought to our attention many more articles than we could publish in the already quite expanded issue, and we were sorry to have had to pass over promising work in this popular field. The contributions included, however, represent a turning point in CMC research, in which our wonder -- and glee -- of describing findings of social interaction in what were assumed to be anti-social media, has turned to the detailed consideration of just how socialisation is accomplished in what promise to be increasingly common media. What has not changed, as Paul ten Have notes, and, indeed, as Charles Antaki began the issue, is that all human life can be found in language-in-use -- wherever it takes place.\n      Hinner's article brings the CMC section of M/C 'chat' to a close, but is not quite the last blast. Very early in the article submission process, Ulf Wilhelmsson contacted us about including his \"Dialogue on Film and Philosophy\". Wilhelmsson wanted to translate -- from the original Swedish -- his Socratic dialogue about film in which Quentin Tarantino moderates a discussion involving numerous influential philosophers, film-makers, film-scholars and the odd Beatle (John Lennon). While we were somewhat taken aback, the rough translation of the first few lines was interesting, and, as it turns out, quite entertaining. Unfortunately, due to its length, the dialogue can not be supplied in regular M/C 'bits', and so we have made it available as a downloadable Rich Text Format file. See the Editor's Preface to Wilhelmsson's article for more information on its content and to download the file itself.\n      This very global issue of M/C brings together people in Germany to New Zealand, Sweden to the UK, all chatting about chat.

    "abstract": "\n      Culture defines itself not only by what is contained within but by what is outside its boundaries as well. Sesame Street's refrain of 'one of these things is not like the other, one of these things does not belong' articulates this creation of boundaries. However, boundaries are not static. Boundaries, and thus cultures, are ever-changing. The decision of 'one of these things does not belong' is always being evaluated and redefined through cultural processes. One of the most obvious processes and signifiers of the visual boundaries of culture is clothing. \n      Clothing maps bodies. Clothing maps culture. Clothing maps boundaries. The visual boundaries of culture have traditionally been placed onto the body with clothing. Fashion and national costume establish both similarities and dissimilarities. While costumes are seemingly frozen in contrast to the supposed vagaries of fashion, both produce bodies of knowledge. However, in Western cultures especially, national costumes project a supposed cultural sameness on the iconographic level that fashion does not. Instead of examining culture per se, this essay will briefly look at ways in which the boundaries of culture are placed and replaced on bodies by costume. \n      Clothing maps bodies. Clothing maps culture. Clothing maps boundaries. The visual boundaries of culture have traditionally been placed onto the body with clothing. Fashion and national costume establish both similarities and dissimilarities. While costumes are seemingly frozen in contrast to the supposed vagaries of fashion, both produce bodies of knowledge. However, in Western cultures especially, national costumes project a supposed cultural sameness on the iconographic level that fashion does not. Instead of examining culture per se, this essay will briefly look at ways in which the boundaries of culture are placed and replaced on bodies by costume. \n      Costumes depend upon certain cultural knowledges and body techniques to be worn properly. Therefore, it is not the clothing itself but how it is worn that makes it cultural. It is for this reason that costume, as symbolic shorthand, often seems exotic or even ridiculous. Wearing a costume depends upon body techniques that change much more quickly than the veneer of cultural iconography that the costumes produce. Thus, 'it's a small world after all' is placed in the 'fantasyland' section of Disneyland; neither in the past, present or future. Not surprisingly, the fantastic and ridiculous are also the exotic 'Other'. \n      While costumes such as kimono, dirndl and military uniforms are understood as national costumes, my definition of costumes in the cultural mapping process is much broader. Costumes serve as iconography on a broad cultural level so that not only do they help define the borders of culture -- either physically or symbolically -- they often seem to stand in for it in its absence as well. The very thing that represents difference -- in this case costume -- is the very thing that is pointed to as the difference. Outside the boundaries of one culture, the 'one of these things does not belong' is reduced to representing all that is different (and so exotic and ridiculous) about the 'Other' culture. Thus, costumes help constitute culture just as they threaten to displace it. However, costume culture is continually suppressed by its own insistent excess that makes it so appealing for cultural iconography in the first place. \n      Few costumes have been exoticised by Western culture as much as Asian clothing. Often one piece of clothing, such as the cheongsam or kimono, supposedly metonymically represents all Asian culture. However, even within Asian culture, these costumes are used to define boundaries. Specifically, kimonos compartmentalise cultural display both within and outside of Japanese culture. Within Japanese culture, \n      \n        a decision to wear kimono is not casual. Kimono-clad women on a Japanese street reflect neither the nonchalance of Hindu housewives in saris nor the set-piece sentimentality of Heidis-in-dirndls. To wear kimono is, inevitably, to make a statement; Kimono equally inescapably mark the boundary of the foreign. Despite the inspiration that the European couturiers periodically rediscover in the kimono tradition, despite the ready-to-wear boutique 'kimona' and low-end lingerie in American import stores, the fact is that no foreigner can wear a kimono without looking silly, at least to the Japanese. (Dalby 112-3)\n      \n      While most Western bodies do not conform to the body techniques of the kimono, neither do many contemporary Japanese bodies. Costumes are often ridiculous or exotic even in their own culture and this serves a specific function. \n      As opposed to fashion, costumes are defined by their static and unchanging exoticism. Indeed, costumes are exotic even within the culture they represent. Costumes are cultural repositories; they are antiquated, outmoded images of a nostalgised past. Costumes communicate victories and triumphs made quaint. Costumes are the G-rated version of cultures past that should have been. When the past seems comfortably ridiculous, as proven in the excessively mannered appearances of national costumes, the boundaries of contemporary body mapping are naturalised. The exoticness of discarded body techniques and modes of display upon which costumes depend, suddenly make the present seem all the more sophisticated and relevant in comparison. Inevitably, this process works to create boundaries between cultures both past and present. While one's own cultural costumes may seem a little silly they also connote a cultural (and costumed) past. Thus, other cultures (vis-à-vis their costumes) are positioned as sillier -- the memory they embody is different -- and so other costumes become caricature not memory because of this difference. \n      This process of caricaturing other cultures can be understood as a transition discourse1. Transition discourses are the processes of temporary cultures that are essential to explain change. Thus, transition discourses are also the temporary mannerisms and body techniques of 'habitus': \"'Habitus' refers to specialised techniques and ingrained knowledges which enable people to negotiate the different departments of existence\" (Craik 4). Like fashion, costumes can be understood as transition discourses. Fashion, as a transition discourse, is an important temporal indicator of negotiations in popular culture. Fashion, understood as ever-changing, is an obvious example of a transition discourse. However, costume -- despite its seeming inertia -- is also a transition discourse. Clearly, this was and is the case in Hollywood. The costumes used to portray racial and ethnic stereotyping (e.g. the collective condensing of all Asians into one costume or 'yellowface') change regularly to correspond with current cultural prejudices. This continuously creates and re-creates 'Other' bodies and other cultures. In this process of 'Othering', cultures create themselves as well. \n      Thus, the reductive aspects of transition discourses are also productive. Daniel Roche points out in his book, The Culture of Clothing, that national costume -- specifically the military uniform -- is continually placed and replaced onto bodies in productive ways. \n      \n        Uniform, along with the cogneries of military discipline procedures, should not be seen only in terms of docility and repression, or ideological instrumentality. It creates through education, realises a personage and affirms a political project by demonstrating omnipotence. (Roche 229) \n      \n      Costumes do not only discipline and regulate the body, they also produce new bodies as old transition discourses are discarded. The physical costume may remain the same but, like the body, its techniques change. Thus, the cultural past is continuously refigured for the cultural present with transition discourses such as national costume. \n      Costumes define changing borders and boundaries of culture. In particular, costumes often visually signify how the foreign is made familiar and vice versa. Costumes in the early musical Footlight Parade clearly show how costumes act as transition discourses to refigure 'Other' bodies. In the Shanghai Lil' finale of Footlight Parade, James Cagney plays a sailor looking for his Asian whore, Shanghai Lil'. Cagney searches for her throughout Shanghai's port bars and opium dens. Eventually he finds his Shanghai Lil', in racist 'yellowface' make-up: Ruby Keeler. They express their joy together through tap. First, they dance separately, then in sync. Again, like in Disneyland's 'it's a small worldafter all', while their costumes show their differences (he wears a tuxedo and top hat while she wears a satin cheongsam pyjama set and Princess Leia hair), their dancing proves their sameness. \n      The Shanghai Lil' number is a famous Busby Berkeley dance sequence which culminates with Cagney being called back to his ship. Marching soldiers fill the screen as Chinese prostitutes and opium addicts suddenly join ranks and wave American flags as the soldiers march by. Much is made in this sequence of the disciplined male body. The men parade and the women watch. Keeler, however, breaks ranks to try and join Cagney on his ship. At this point, everything about Keeler's character is ridiculous because she is not American. First, her 'yellowface' make-up and broken speech caricature the Chinese culture she represents. Secondly, her assumption that they will live together on his naval vessel is made ridiculous as she pushes herself through the dark navy formations of the sailors in her pastel satin costume. Finally, Keeler's character is made ridiculous by her body techniques. A soldier slams his rifle down on Keeler's foot as she stands in the middle of the military formation. Keeler grabs her foot, winces and makes faces. In fact, it is at this point that Keeler drops the racist Asian persona and responds like an American. Earlier in the sequence, the number foreshadows this possibility with an Asian sailor and some prostitutes speaking in American accents. This productive rather than reductive result is what allows Keeler to be transformed from 'not like the others' to 'one of these things'. Keeler's actions are in contrast to her costume and necessitate a new transition discourse to allow for the romantic conclusion of her relationship with Cagney. \n      It is at this point that a series of marching chorus girls in short, short cheongsams and white, plastic coolie hats overtake Keeler. Costume has transformed the prostitutes and addicts into patriots and thus into the paradoxical sameness evident in 'it's a small world after all'. The 'coolie' chorus joins the sailors in parade. Together the chorus girls and the sailors form an American flag and then a picture of President Roosevelt's face. Finally, they reform to create the triumphant American eagle shooting puffs of smoke and puffs of their symbolic victory. The undesirables have been assimilated, new bodies and new cultures have been produced even though they wear costumes that signify their difference. Clearly, at this point, the Chinese-ness of the prostitutes has been rehabilitated through the ridiculous excess of their new costumes. The 'Chinese girls' (the white female chorus in racial drag) change from a dangerous and uncontrolled foreignness to a more familiar stereotyped and ridiculous 'Other'. At the same time, the 'coolie' costumes rehabilitate the excess of the marching sailors by naturalising the American sailor costumes. \n      While the sailor uniform has disciplined Cagney's previously drunken fop (the previously drunk Cagney is suddenly sober when in uniform), the uniform also produces a new persona for Keeler. In the last few seconds of the number, Cagney marches off with the other sailors to his ship. However, as they reach the ship Cagney and Keeler turn to wink at the camera and reveal that Keeler is masquerading in a sailor costume. Keeler's sameness, previously indicated by her body techniques (her tap dancing), can transcend her difference. However, cross-dressed in a sailor uniform, she is still signified as a transgressor. Cultural boundaries need to be changed before she can be accepted. \n      It is a simple card trick that reveals this change of boundaries. A card trick, a children's amusement, makes this change of boundaries seem simple and inevitable which again naturalises Cagney and Keeler's union. Cagney gestures to Keeler to watch as he flips through a deck of cards. The movement of the cards animates a tiny ship that puffs big billows of smoke and zigzags into an empty white space. It is a place without borders where puffs of smoke again signify victory over difference. Again, costume is used to insist on the paradox of difference and sameness. Again, culture is displaced onto costume and transition discourses. Sadly, it seems that it is a small world after all and the creation of boundaries as a way of defining culture is ever-present. \n          \n      Footnotes \n      \nThanks to Jane Roscoe for coining the term 'transition discourse' recently.

    "abstract": "\n \n      The theme for this issue of M/C is 'renew'. This is a term that could be approached in numerous ways: as a cultural practice, in terms of broader dynamics of change, in terms of the future of the journal. In this piece, however, I'd like to narrow the focus and think about renewal in the context of the concept of 'media' and media theory. This is not to diminish the importance of looking at media in relation to changing technologies, and changing cultural contexts. Indeed, most readers of M/C will no doubt be aware of the dangers of positing media outside of culture in some kind of deterministic relationship. Indeed, the slash in the title of M/C -- which since its first editorial both links and separates the terms 'media' and 'culture' -- is interesting to think about here precisely because the substitution of the 'and' opens up a questioning of the relation between the two terms. While I too want to keep the space between media / culture filled with possibility, in this piece I want to look mainly at one side of the slash and speculate on renewal in the way we relate to ideas of media. \n      Since its first editorial the slash has also been a marker of M/C's project to bridge academic and popular approaches, and work as a cross-over journal. In the hope of not stretching the cross-over too far, I'd like to bring contemporary philosophy into the picture and keep it in the background while thinking about renewal and the concept of 'media'. A key theme in contemporary philosophy has been the attempt to think difference beyond any opposition of the One and the Many (Patton 29-48; Deleuze 38-47). In an effort to think difference in its own terms, philosophers like Gilles Deleuze and Jacques Derrida have resisted seeing difference as something dependant on, derivative or secondary to a primary point of sameness and identity. \n      In this brief piece, and out of respect of M/C's project, my intention is not to summarise this work in detail. Rather, I want to highlight the existence of this work in order to draw a contrast with the way in which contemporary thinking about media often seems caught up in a dynamic of the One and Many, and to pose the question of a different path for media theory. Having mentioned philosophy, I do want to make the point that 'One or Many Media' is not just an abstract formulation. On the contrary, the present day is a particularly appropriate time to look at this problem. Popular discussion of media issues itself oscillates between an idea of Media dominance (the One) and an idea of multiple media (multimedia). Discussions of convergence frequently invoke a thematics of the One arising out of the Many, or of the Many arising from the One. \n      Medium, Media, the Media. Which one to use? We need only to list these three terms to begin see how the tension between the One and the Multiple has influenced contemporary thinking about media. \n      An obvious tension exists on the level of grammar. 'Media' is the plural of 'Medium'. That is, until we use the term 'the Media' which can be used to refer to the singularity of (a specific area of) the Press. Walter Ong dubs 'medium' \"the fugitive singular\" to describe this phenomenon (175). To compensate for the increasing use of 'the media' as a singular it is becoming more common to see the term 'mediums' instead of 'media'. \n      A second tension exists on the level of the senses. 'The media', and in some senses a 'medium', conveys the notion of a media form distinct from the senses. As Michael Heim notes,  \n       Medium meant conceptual awareness in conjunction with the five senses through which we come to understand things present before us in the environment. This natural sense of media was gradually dissipated during the modern period by man-made extensions and enhancements of the human senses ... . Electronic media gave new meaning to the term. We not only perceive directly with five senses aided by concepts and enhanced by instrumentation, but also are surrounded by a panorama of man-made images and symbols far more complex than can be assimilated directly through the senses and thought processes. Media in the electronic sense of acoustic-optic technology ... appear to do more than augment innate human sensory capacities: the electronic media become themselves complex problems; they become facts of life we must take into account as we live; they become, in short, the media. (47) \n\n      In this passage, Heim shows how through extension and instrumentation 'the media' comes to occupy a different register of existence. 'The media' in this account are distinct from any general artefact that can serve as a means of communication to us. On this register, 'the media' also develops into the idea of the mass media (see Williams 169). In popular usage this incorporates print and broadcasting areas (usually with a strong journalistic emphasis), and is often personified around a notion of 'the media' as an agent in the contemporary political arena (the fourth estate, the instrument of a media baron). \n      This brings us to a third tension, to do with diversity. The difference between the terms 'Medium', 'Media', 'the Media', is clearly bound up with the issue of diversity and concentration of media. Sean Cubitt argues that a different activation of interactive media, intermedia, or video media, is crucial to restoring an electronic ecology that has been destroyed by the marketplace (207). What the work of theorists like Cubitt reveals is that the problem of diversity and concentration has a conceptual dimension. Framed within an opposition between the One and the Multiple, the diversity in question -- of different senses and orders of media -- is constrained by the dominant idea of the Media.\n     Many theorists and commentators on 'the Mass media' barely acknowledge the existence of video media unless it is seen as a marketplace for the distribution of movies. This process of marginalisation has been so thorough that the contemporary discussion of the Internet or interactive digital media often ignores previous critical discussion of the electronic arts -- as if McLuhan had no connection with Fluxus, or convergence had no links to intermedia experimentation. In a different example, it is becoming common to discuss 'personal media' like laptops and intelligent jewellery (see Beniger; Kay and Goldberg). But if media theory has previously failed to look at T-shirts and other personal effects as media then this is in part due to the dominance of the idea of the mass media in conceptual terms. This dominance leads Umberto Eco to propose an idea of the \"multiplication of the media\" against the idea of mass media, and prompts him to declare that \"all the professors of theory of communications, trained by the texts of twenty years ago (this includes me) should be pensioned off\" (149). \n      \n      It could be argued that rather than represent a problem the sliding between these terms is enabling not disabling. From this perspective, the fact that different senses of media collapse or coalesce with one another is appropriate, since (as I hope I've shown) different senses of media are often grounded in other senses. Indeed, we can agree with this argument, and go further to suggest that renewing our relationship to concepts of media involves affirming the interplay of different senses of media. What needs careful consideration here, however, is how we think of different senses of media. For it is very often the case that this question of difference is blocked from discussion when an order of media is used to secure a territory or a foundation for a particular idea of how things should work. From this foundation particular ideas of One-ness/Same-ness or Many-ness can emerge, each of which involves making assumptions about differences between media, and the nature of difference. Examples might include notions of mainstream and alternative, professional and non-professional, 'industry' and 'artistic' ways of working.1 In each case a dominant idea of the media establishes itself as an order against which other practices are defined as secondary, and other senses of media subordinate. \n      Surveying these tensions (grammatical, sensory and diversity) between the terms 'Medium', 'Media', 'the Media', what becomes apparent is that neither of them is able to stand as 'the' primary conceptual term. \n      Attempting to read contemporary developments in light of the One of the mass media means that theory is often left to discuss the fate of an idea, broadcasting, that represents only one way of organising and articulating a medium. Certainly, this approach can yield important results on the level of audience studies and identity politics, and in respect to government policy. Jock Given's work on broadcasting as a \"set of technologies, social and cultural practices, cultural forms, industries, institutional forms, words and an idea\" usefully contests the idea that broadcasting is dying or has no place in the digital future (46). However, research of this kind is often constrained by its lack of engagement with different orders of media, and its dependence on an idea of the One medium that is now under erasure.2\n      Attempting to read contemporary developments in light of the One of the mass media means that theory is often left to discuss the fate of an idea, broadcasting, that represents only one way of organising and articulating a medium. Certainly, this approach can yield important results on the level of audience studies and identity politics, and in respect to government policy. Jock Given's work on broadcasting as a \"set of technologies, social and cultural practices, cultural forms, industries, institutional forms, words and an idea\" usefully contests the idea that broadcasting is dying or has no place in the digital future (46). However, research of this kind is often constrained by its lack of engagement with different orders of media, and its dependence on an idea of the One medium that is now under erasure.2\n      Exploring the potential of 'Medium' as a primary term leads again into the problem of the One and the Many. The content of every medium may be, as McLuhan said, another medium (8). But we should search for the hidden One that binds together the Many. Indeed, multimedia can precisely be seen in this way: as a term that facilitates the singularising of multiple media. In a historically significant 1977 paper \"Personal Dynamic Media\" by Alan Kay and Adele Goldberg, we read that \n      the essence of a medium is very much dependent on the way messages are embedded, changed, and viewed. Although digital computers were originally designed to do arithmetic computation, the ability to simulate the details of any descriptive model means that the computer, viewed as a medium itself, can be all other media  if the embedding and viewing methods are sufficiently well provided. (255) \n      It is following this passage that Kay and Goldberg use the term \"metamedium\" to describe this system, which effectively seals the Many into the One, and compromises any sense that 'multimedia' can fully live up to the idea of multiple media. \n      Situating the term 'media' as a primary term is interesting primarily because Heim deems it the \"natural sense of media\". There is some value in re-asserting the most general understanding of this idea, which is that any artefact can serve to communicate something to the senses. That said, any exploration of this kind needs to keep a critical eye not just on the McLuhanesque extension of the senses that Heim mentions, but also the imperative that these artefacts must mediate, and function as a means of communication. In other words, any celebration of this conception of media needs to be careful not to naturalise the idea that communication is the transmission of ideal contents. As Derrida's work shows, a complex system is required for a media to work in this way. It is only via a particular system of representation that a medium comes to serve as a vehicle for communication (311-2). As such, we should be wary of designating this idea of media as 'natural'. There are of course other reasons to be cautious with the use of the term 'natural' in this context. Contemporary usage of 'media' show that the human sensorium has already entered a complex cyborg future in which human actions, digital files, data, scripts, can be considered 'media' in a performance work or some other assemblage. \n      Contemporary media theory resolves some of the problems of the terms 'Medium', 'Media', 'the Media' serving as a primary conceptual figure by reading them against one another. Thus, the mass media can be criticised from the point of view of the broader potential of the medium, or transformations in a medium can be tracked through developments in interactive media. Various critical or comparative approaches can be adopted within the nexus defined by these three terms. One important path of investigation for media theory is the investigation of hybrid mixed forms of media as they re-emerge out of more or less well defined definitions of a medium. A concern that can be raised with this approach, however, is that it risks avoiding the problem of the One or Many altogether in the way it posits some media as 'pure' or less hybrid in the first instance. \n      In the difficult process of approaching the problem of One or Many media, media theory may find it worthwhile listen in on discussion of the One or Many opposition in contemporary philosophy. Two terms that find a prominent place in Deleuze's discussion of the multiplicity are \"differentiation\" and \"actualisation\". I'd want to suggest that both terms should hold interest for media theorists. For example, in terms of the problem of One or Many Media, we can note that differentiation and actualisation have not always been looked at. Too often, the starting point for theories of media is to begin with a particular order of media, a conception of the One, and then situate multiple practices in relationship to this One. Thus, 'the media' or 'mass media' is able to take the position of centre, with the rest left subordinate. This gesture allows the plural form of 'media' to be dealt with in a reductive way, at the expense of an analysis of supposed plurality. (It also works to detach the discussion of the order of media in question from other academic and non-academic disciplines that may have a great deal to say about the way media work.) A different approach could be to look at the way this dominant order is actualised in the first place. Recognition that a multiplicity of different senses of media pre-exists any single order of media would seem to be a key step towards renewal in media theory. \n      This piece has sought to disturb the way a notion of the One or Many media often works in the space of media theory. Rather than locate this issue in relation to only one definition of media or medium, this approach attempts to differentiate between different senses of media, ranging from those understandings linked to the human sensorium, those related to craft understandings, and those related to the computerised manipulation of media resources. The virtue of this approach is that it tackles head on the issue that there is no one understanding of media that can function as an over-arching term in the present. The human senses, craft, broadcasting, and digital manipulation are all limited in this respect. Any response to this situation needs to engage with this complexity by recognising that some understandings of media exceed the space of a medium. These other understandings can form useful provisional points of counter-actualisation.4\n          \n      Footnotes \n      \nRecent Australian government decisions about the differences between digital television and datacasting would be interesting to examine here.\n        In relation to Given's work I'd suggest that a fuller examination of media's digital future needs to elaborate on the relationship between 'the media' and alternative understandings of the term in computing, for example, such as Kay and Goldberg's. In this way, the issue of future conceptions of media can be opened up alongside the issue of a future for the media.\n        Monaco's, \"Mediography: In the Middle of Things\" is a rare example. In the section 'Levels of the Game' Monaco usefully distinguishes between different orders of media.\n        My thanks to the anonymous M/C reviewers for their useful comments, and also Anna Munster for her suggestions.\n      \nReferences \n      \nBeniger, James R. \"Personalisation of Mass Media and the Growth of Pseudo-Community.\"  Communication Research 14.3 (June 1987): 352-71.    \n        Cubitt, Sean.

    "abstract": "\n      Representation of Aboriginality in National Geographic \n      In trafficking images of cultural difference, National Geographic has an unrivalled worldwide reach to over 37 million people per issue. Over the past 25 years, 48 photographs of Aboriginal Australians have appeared in 11 articles in the magazine. This article first examines how the magazine has exoticised, naturalised and sexualised Aboriginal Australians. By deploying the standard evolutionary model, National Geographic typically represents Aboriginal Australians as Black savages relegated to the Stone Age. In the remote outback \"Arnhem Land Aboriginals Cling to the Dreamtime\" (Scollay &amp; Tweedie 645). In \"Journey into Dreamtime\" (Arden &amp; Abell 8) an Aboriginal man is \"triumphant with his kill of a wild turkey [and] leads a small group of Aborigines who have returned to some of the old ways of their nomadic ancestors in the Great Sandy Desert\". The article concludes that the Stone Age encounter with modernity depicted in the magazine became a journey through time from location past to location present. \n      Exoticisation \n      The world of the Aboriginal Australians is male through the eyes of National Geographic. This stems from the Western cultural pattern that assigns things masculine to the cultural and things feminine to the natural realm (Ortner). The male Aboriginal performer of an initiation ritual in \"Leapingin tribute\" (Scollay &amp; Tweedie 656-7) is represented as rooted in tradition and living in a sacred yet superstitious world. Portraits abound of men with painted faces, as in \"Surging energy\" (Scollay &amp; Tweedie 648). Male finery and self-display become salient markers, Aboriginal \"Boys summon courage\" in male initiation focussing on bloodletting (Scollay &amp; Tweedie 656). Such images convey the impression that the region is one of nature, taboo, danger and adventure and that it is a land out of time. The enchantment with ritual stems from it being a key to the past and indicative of photographer and writer having travelled through space to travel through time, similar to the connection made by Victorian evolutionary anthropologists last century (see Fabian). \n      Naturalisation \n      The naturalised Aboriginal Australians appearing in National Geographic are characterised by having timeless societies and personalities, what Wolf identifies as people without history. Routine location narratives naturalise Aboriginal Australians through their remote landscapes and seascapes (\"blazing bushfire\", Scollay &amp; Tweedie 652-3; \"conjuring an image as old as his ancestors\", \"scorched in one season, sodden in the next\" Newman &amp; Abell 3-9).\n      In the West the cultural appropriation of nature is the object of labour, whereas for Aboriginal Australians it is the subject of labour. Aboriginal men are hunters (\"triumphant with his kill\", Arden &amp; Abell 9; \"the earth and sea of their own accord furnish them with all the things necessary for life\", Newman &amp; Abell 14-5). Thus, in National Geographic the productive world of work further naturalises the Aboriginal 'Other'. \n      Sexualisation \n      Naked Black women provide the hallmark National Geographic imagery of the sexualized 'Other'. By purveying the nude Aboriginal female, the magazine develops Western ideas about race, gender and sexuality, subcategorised in each case as black, female and unrepressed (Lutz &amp; Collins 115). Women are white, men are Black and Black women are invisible in popular visual representations of motherhood in Western culture. In trafficking in photographs of Black women for an overwhelmingly white readership, National Geographic is clearly linking narrative threads of gender and race (Lutz &amp; Collins166). As the readers' gaze focusses on the Aboriginal child they become the site for dealing with racial anxieties through creating the Black love object (\"an appetite for learning\", Scollay &amp; Tweedie 654; \"mud mates\", Ellis &amp; Austen 8-9). National Geographic's nickname for mother-child photos is 'tits and tots' (Meltzer) and they are a romantic staple in the magazine. Aboriginal mothering in \"marriages of diplomacy\" is idealised as the foundation of human social life (Scollay &amp; Tweedie 650-1). However, with \"seven of Johnny Bungawuy's 11 wives and a handful of his 52 children\" this marriage is exotic enough to make cultural difference an issue because it depicts the unusually large number of plural marriage partners available to Aboriginal men in their practice of polygyny. \n      The attribution of erotic qualities and sexual license to Aboriginal women is a result of displaying their bodies for close examination. The naked Aboriginal women in \"marriages of diplomacy\" represent the nude stylised as ethnographic fact (Scollay &amp; Tweedie 650-1). The addition of a woman in the \"marriages of diplomacy\" photograph commoditises the practice of polygyny and illustrates that women have traditionally been seen as objects to be possessed, owned and adornments to the lives of men (Pollack). \n      Location Past to Location Present \n      Idealisation of the Aboriginal 'Other' allows for detemporalisation to be played out in alluring images of a simpler, natural Aboriginal world only now tentatively facing the throes of modernisation. Social Darwinism counterpoises superstition/ritual with science/technology and darker skin/exotic clothes with lighter skin/Western clothes. The Aboriginal guide bearing a \"striking resemblance to his counterpart on the Burke-Wills journey\" facilitates a form of ancestor worship that relates to what Rosaldo calls imperialist nostalgia for the passing of what we ourselves have destroyed (Judge &amp; Scherschel 165). Photographs of the Aboriginal Australians are organised into a story about cultural evolution couched in normative discourse of modernisation and development as progress. \n      In photographs contrasting the premodern with the modern the commodity stands for the future: \"soda, soap, and spears in the arms of an [Aboriginal] father and daughter demonstrate their coexistence with white society\" (Scollay &amp; Tweedie 662). While for the Aboriginal father in \"keeping faith with past and future\" his \"son enters an era that will inevitably propel his people into modern society\" (MacLeish &amp; Nebbia 171). Commodities in these contrasting representations are to be seen simply as a stage on the way to Westernisation. Dynamism, change and agency are apportioned to the Western centre, while Aboriginal Australians are just responding to the onslaught of modernisation on the periphery. \n      Aboriginal masculinisation of modernity is situated in a series of photographs depicting the expansive frontier outback where Aboriginal stockmen are content to muster the cattle of white station owners. In \"boiling the red dust\" the Aboriginal stockman strums his guitar but sometimes \"lapses into tradition and roams on walkabout\" (Walker &amp; Scherschel 457). Another Aboriginal stockman, in \"saga of beef or bust\", \"uses his tracking ability to run down strays and cleanskins -- unbranded beasts\" (MacLeish &amp; Nebbia 161). \"Other than his boots and a jug of water all he owns is rolled into the swag\", the Aboriginal stockman must compete with the modern helicopter (\"pesky as a giant fly\", MacLeish &amp; Stanfield 165); alternatively, \"with a wager on the line, an Aboriginal stockman whoops it up at the annual Bedourie Race Meeting\" (Ellis &amp; Austen 3). The idealised image is one of the rugged yet happy lives of the Aboriginal stockman in transition to modernity. \n      Social evolutionary theory \"saw women in non-Western societies as oppressed and servile creatures, beasts of burden, chattels who could be bought and sold, eventually to be liberated by 'civilisation' or 'progress', thus attaining the enviable position of women in Western society\" (Etienne &amp; Leacock 1). Aboriginal feminisation of modernity is told through stories about the premodern helpmate to husband work of Aboriginal women. \"Sharing a 'cuppa' at the start of their day\" is gendered with vulnerability, primitivity, superstition and the constraints of tradition (Newman &amp; Abell 24-5). The ambivalent message represented in \"sharing a 'cuppa' at the start of their day\" is complicated by the Aboriginal woman's stockman partner being white. Western ideological understanding of women's work has changed since WWII from helpmate to husband to self-realisation and independence (Chafe). However, images of Aboriginal women in modern work are conspicuously absent. \n      Dispossessed Aboriginal prospectors earn money by 'yandying' (\"Paddy Blair's no Irishman\", MacLeish &amp; Stanfield 166) -- \"winnowing by tossing handfuls of ore into the wind to separate dirt from tin or gold\" and 'noodling' -- \"poking through rubble\" (\"selling water and renting bulldozers\", Moore &amp; Tweedie 569). Abject \"down-and-outs addicted to cheap, poisonous wood alcohol\" end up as dispossessed fringe-dwelling 'goomies' in Redfern (\"matron saint\", Starbird &amp; Madden 224-5).   \n      Resistance through situationally motivated undertaking by Indigenous people against expropriation of land and resources is rarely represented in the media (see Drinnon), and National Geographic first attempts such a representation in the 1980s with \"heads of several clans\" (Scollay &amp; Tweedie 653). Aboriginal men attempt to block a government mining survey crew. But the six Aboriginal men gaze off in different directions and only one is clearly focussed on something in the frame, thus the assembled men assume a disconnected, uncoordinated look. \n      In the 1990s National Geographic story \"The Uneasy Magic of Australia's Cape York Peninsula\", Aboriginality is equated with caring for the land (Newman &amp; Abell). Aboriginal peoples of Cape York Peninsula are portrayed as conservators valuable for their preservation of biocultural diversity (\"the richlytextured landscape\", Newman &amp; Abell 17). Aboriginal \"white sand people\" of Cape York Peninsula are \"on a sacred mission\" when they \"return an ancestor's skull to their homeland at Shelbourne Bay (Newman &amp; Abell 32-3). After years of frustrated efforts to win back their lost domain, the peninsula's native people are at last gaining ground\". Aboriginal Australian uses of land and resources are idealised as non-destructive and caring in contrast to rapacious postcolonial development aggression. National Geographic images of Aboriginal Australians have moved from the exoticised, naturalised and sexualised location past. Images in the location present of Cape York mirror the postcolonial transition from Aboriginal dispossession informed by terra nullius to their contemporary empowerment informed by native title. \n          \n      References \n      \n Arden, H., and S.

    "abstract": "\n      In his recent re-evaluation of McLuhanite theories for the information age, Digital McLuhan, Paul Levinson makes what at first glance appears to be a curious statement: he says that on the Web \"the common denominator ... is the written word, as it is and has been with all things having to do with computers -- and will likely continue to be until such time, if ever, that the spoken word replaces the written as the vehicle of computer commands\" (38). \n      This, however, seems to directly contradict what any Web user has been able to experience for several years now: Web content has increasingly come to rely on graphics, at first still, now also often animated, and continues to include more and more audiovisual elements of various kinds. We don't even have to look at the current (and, hopefully, passing) phase of interminable Shockwave splash pages, which users have to endure while they wait to be transferred to the 'real' content of a site: even on as print-focussed a page as the one you're currently reading, you'll see graphical buttons to the left and at the bottom, for example. Other sites far surpass this for graphical content: it is hard to imagine what the official Olympics site or that of EXPO 2000 would look like in text-only versions. \n      The drive towards more and more graphics has long been, well, visible. Already in 1997 (at a time when 33.6k modems were considered fast) Marshall considered the Internet to have entered its \"graphic stage, a transitional media form that has made surfing the net feel like flipping through a glossy magazine or the interlinkages of a multimedia game or encyclopedia CD-ROMs\"; to him this stage \"relies on a construction that is textual and graphically enhanced through software overlays ... and highlighted by sample images, sound bites and occasionally short, moving images\" (51). This historicised view mirrors a distinction made around the same time by Lovink, who divided users into \"IBM-PC-modernists\" still running text-based interfaces, and those enjoying the \"Apple-Windows 95-postmodernism\" of their graphical user interfaces (Lovink and Winkler 15). In the age of GUIs, in fact, 'text' in itself does not really exist on screen any more: everything from textual to graphical information consists of individual pixels in the same way, which is precisely what makes Levinson's initial statement appear so anachronistic. The move from 'text' to 'graphics and text' could thus be seen as a sign of the overall shift from the industrial to the information age -- a view not without precedent, since the transition from modernist to postmodernist times is similarly contemporaneous with the rise of graphic design as a form of communication as well as art. \n      Beyond such broad strokes, we can also identify some of the finer details presented by the current state of graphics on the Web, however. Marshall's 'graphic stage', after all, was a 'transitional' one, and by now it seems that we might have passed it already, entering into a new aesthetic paradigm which appears to have borrowed many of its approaches from the realm of computer games: the new Web vision is shiny, colourful, animated, and increasingly also accompanied by sound effects. This is no surprise since the mass acceptance of personal computers themselves was largely driven by their use as a source of entertainment. Gaming and computers are inseparably interconnected, and the development of home computers' graphical capabilities in particular has long been driven almost exclusively by players' needs for better, faster, more realistic graphics. \n      Of course, the way we interact with computers also owes a significant debt to games. Engagement in a dialogue with the machine, in which the computer displays both our own actions and its responses, representing us and itself simultaneously on screen, is the predominant mode of computing, and such a mode of engagement (dissolving the barriers between human mind and machinic computation) can now also be found in our interaction with the Web. Here, too, individual knowledge blends with the information available on the network as we immerse ourselves in hypertextual connectivity. As Talbott writes, \"clearly, a generation raised on Adventure and video games -- where every door conceals a treasure or a monster worth pursuing in frenetic style -- has its own way of appreciating the hypertext interface\" (13); not only has the Web taken on the aesthetics of computer gaming, then, but using the Web itself exhibits aspects of participation in a global 'knowledge game'. Talbott means to criticise this when he writes that thus \"the doctrines of endless Enlightenment and Progress become the compelling subtext of a universal video game few can resist playing\" (196), but however we may choose to evaluate this game, the observation itself is sound. \n      One possible reason for taking a critical view of this development is that computer and video games rarely present more than the appearance of participation; while players may have a feeling of control over features of the game, the game itself usually remains entirely unaffected and ready for a restart at any moment. Web users might similarly feel empowered by the wealth of information to which they have gained access online, without actually making use of that information to form new knowledge for themselves. This is a matter for the individual user, however; where they have a true interest in the information they seek, we can have every confidence that they will process it to their advantage, too. Beyond this, the skills of information seeking learnt from Web use might also have overall benefits for users, as a kind of 'mind-eye coordination' similar to the 'hand-eye coordination' benefits often attributed to the playing of action games. The ability to figure out unknown problems, the desire to understand and gain control of a situation, which they can learn from computer games, is likely to help them better understand the complexity and interconnectedness of anything they might learn: \"it could ... well be true that the cross-linking inherent in hypertext encourages people to see the connections among different aspects of the world so that they will get less fragmented knowledge\" (Nielsen 190). \n      The increasingly graphical nature of Web content could appear to work against this, however: \"extensions of traditional hyperTEXT systems to encompass hyperMEDIA introduces [sic] a new dimension. ... The picture that 'speaks a thousand words' may say a thousand different words to different viewers. Pictures or graphics lend themselves much more than does text to multiple interpretations\", as McAleese claims (12-13) -- but perhaps this overrates significantly the ability of text to anchor down meaning to any one point. Rather, it is questionable whether text and images really are that different from one another -- viewed from a historical perspective, certainly, opinions are divided, it seems: \"the medieval church feared the power of the visual image because of the way it appeared to licence the imagination and the consideration of alternatives. Obversely, contemporary cultural critics fear that the abandonment of the written word in favour of graphics is stifling critical and creative powers\" (Moody 60) -- take, for example, the commonly held view that movies made from novels limit the reader's imagination to the particular portrayal of events chosen for the film. \n      In fact, there are good reasons to believe that both text and images (especially when they are increasingly easy to manipulate by digital means, thus losing once and for all their claim to photographic 'realism') can 'say a thousand different words to different viewers' -- indeed, traditional photography has also been described as 'writing with light'. As Levinson notes, therefore, \"once the photograph is converted to a digital format, it is as amenable to manipulation, as divorced from the reality it purports to represent, as the words which appear on the same screen. On that score, the Internet's co-option of photography -- the rendering of the formerly analogue image as its content -- is at least as profound as the Internet's promotion of written communication\" (43), and this, then, may perhaps begin to provide a resolution to his overall preference for writing as the predominant Internet communication form, as quoted above: online writing now includes in almost equal measure 'print' text and graphical images, both of which are of course graphically rendered on screen by the computer anyway; they combine into a new form of writing not unlike ancient hieroglyphics. On the Web, writing has come full circle: from the iconographic representations of the earliest civilisations through their simplification and solidification into the various alphabets back to a new online iconography. \n     This also demonstrates the strong Western bias of this technology, of course: had computers emerged from Chinese or Japanese culture, for example -- where alphabets in the literal sense don't exist -- chances are they would never have existed in a text-only form. Now that we have passed the alphabetic stage to re-enter an era of iconography, then, it remains to be seen how this change along with our overall \"'immersion' in hypertext will affect the way that we mentally structure our world. Linear argumentation is more a consequence of alphabetic writing than of printed books and it remains to be seen if hypertext presentation will significantly erode this predominant convention for mentally ordering our world\" (McKnight et al. 41). \n      \n      Perhaps the computer game experience (where a blending of text and graphics had begun some time before the Web) can provide some early pointers already, then. The game-like nature of information search and usage online might help to undermine some of the more heavily encrusted structures of information dissemination that are still dominant: \"we are promised, on the information 'library' side, less of the dogmatic and more of the ludic, less of the canonical and more of the festive. Fewer arguments from authority, through more juxtaposition of authorities\" (Debray 146). This is also supported by the fact that there usually exists no one central authority, no one central site, in any field of information covered by the Web, but that there rather is a multiplicity of sources and viewpoints with varying claims to 'authority' and 'objectivity'; rather than rely on authorities to determine what is accepted knowledge, Web users must, and do, distil their own knowledge from the information they find in their searches. Kumon and Aizu's notion that from the industrial-age \"wealth game\" we have now moved into the \"wisdom game\" (320) sums up this view. However, for all the ludic exuberance of this game, we should also be concerned that, as in any game, we are also likely to see winners and losers. Those unaware of the rules of the game, and people who are prevented from playing for personal or socioeconomic reasons (the increased use of graphics will make it much more difficult for certain disabled readers to use the Web, for example) must not be left out of it. In gaming terminology, perhaps the formation of teams including such disadvantaged people is the answer? \n          \n      References \n      \n Debray, Régis. \"The Book as Symbolic Object.\" The Future of the Book.

    "abstract": "\n      As one of the more visible manifestations of the boom in new media, computer games have attracted a great deal of attention, both from the popular press, and from academics. In the case of the former, much of this coverage has focussed on the perceived danger games pose to the young mind, whether that danger be physical (in terms of bodily atrophy due to inactivity) or social (in terms of anti-social and even violent behaviour, caused by exposure to specific types of content). The massacre at Columbine High School in the United States seems to have further fuelled these fears, with several stories focusing on the fact that the killers were both players of violent video games (Dickinson 1999; Hansen 1999). These concerns have also found their way into political circles, promoting a seemingly endless cycle of inquiries and reports (for example, see Durkin 1995; Durkin and Aisbett 1999).\n      Academic discourse on the subject has, perhaps somewhat surprisingly, tended to adopt a similar line, tracing out a return to the dark days of media effects theory. This is especially true of those studies that focus on the psychological aspects of computer game usage. For example, Scott (1995) conducted a study specifically aimed at investigating \"to what extent, if any, aggressive computer game playing would have on individuals of different personality composition, and in which particular aspects of aggressiveness this might be experienced\" (Scott 1995, 122). Similarly, Ballard (1999) examined the relationship between gender and violent computer games arguing that the level of violence depicted in a game directly affects the interaction between players of different genders.\n      Almost without exception, these studies come from the experimental tradition of media research, often employing laboratory experiments in order to test their hypotheses. As the problems with this methodology have been covered extensively elsewhere (for example, see Hall 1982; Murdock and Golding 1977; Lowery and DeFleur 1983) I will not go into detail here, except to point out that most experimental research underestimates the importance of physical context in media use.\n      Other studies have attempted to approach the subject from a more qualitative perspective, often utilising theories derived from post-structuralism to examine the construction of identity in games. For example, Alloway and Gilbert (1998) explore relationship between computer games and notions of masculinity, arguing that simplistic notions of effects dramatically underestimate the sophistication of the readers. Similarly, Beavis (1998) argues that it is necessary to more fully explore the relationship between games players and games before engaging in debates about the social benefits or dangers of the medium. According to Beavis:\n      Other studies have attempted to approach the subject from a more qualitative perspective, often utilising theories derived from post-structuralism to examine the construction of identity in games. For example, Alloway and Gilbert (1998) explore relationship between computer games and notions of masculinity, arguing that simplistic notions of effects dramatically underestimate the sophistication of the readers. Similarly, Beavis (1998) argues that it is necessary to more fully explore the relationship between games players and games before engaging in debates about the social benefits or dangers of the medium. According to Beavis:\n      However, while arguments like that of Beavis clearly take the debate in another direction, in many cases the writers find themselves mired in the same ideological paradigm as the effects theorists. While stressing the need for a more nuanced conceptualisation of the game-player relationship, Beavis also implies that games are potentially destructive, stating that \"young people need to be helped to critique and resist the subject positions and ideologies of video games\" (Beavis, 1998).\n      In response, the games industry itself has launched several attacks on the academic community, many of which, ironically, are framed in the kind of aggressive terminology the researchers are themselves concerned about. For example, Green argues,\n      But for a group of academics to draw sweeping conclusions about an industry they are so obviously clueless about, based on a ludicrous, half-assed experiment that sounds like something out of a Simpsons episode, adds absolutely nothing to the discussion. (136)\n     While it could be argued that Green's \"from the hip\" response itself adds little to the dialogue, it does serve to highlight one of the more surprising aspects of the computer games debate. As Green asserts, it is apparent that many of the scholars conducting research into computer games seem to know very little about the subject they are studying, a situation analogous to television researchers watching only cinematic films. Indeed, given the descriptions some researchers give of particular games, it is doubtful that they have actually played the game themselves, raising questions about the extent to which they are authorities in the area. This paper is, at least in part, aimed at rectifying this situation, by providing some broad commentary on the specific characteristics of the game medium. For the sake of convenience, I will be focussing mainly on games available on home consoles such as the Sony Playstation, and will restrict my argument to single-player games.\n      \n      Computer games are clearly a distinct form of media; while many are played through established technology like televisions and computers, there would seem to be something intrinsically different about their mode of address. This is primarily a function of their interactivity; unlike most forms of media, computer games respond to direct input from their audience. However, at the same time, games also display characteristics that are, at least superficially, similar to existing media forms. While games are often categorised according to the type of action required of the player (eg shooting, driving, puzzle-solving etc), they can also readily be categorised into the same genres used for other entertainment media such as films and video cassettes. Games can be based on sports, action, drama, comedy and even music, although admittedly the broad category of \"simulation\" game has no direct counterpart in film and video, except, perhaps philosophically, for documentary.\n      \n      Film and television genres are traditionally defined in terms of a set of key textual characteristics, with iconography, setting and narrative being perhaps the most obvious. Applying these notions to computer games it soon becomes clear why the generic classifications used for other media have been so easily adapted to the new medium. For example, the iconography of an action film like Face Off (explosions, guns, corpses etc) can all be found in an action game such as Syphon Filter. Similarly, the settings of horror films like I Know What You Did Last Summer (old houses, dark alleys etc) are all faithfully reproduced in horror games like Resident Evil. These correlations are true of most filmic genres and computer games, to such an extent that there is a growing trend in crossover production of \"game of the film\" (eg. Tomorrow Never Dies, Die Hard, Independence Day) and \"film of the game\" (Pokémon, Mortal Kombat) texts.\n      When we turn our attention to narrative, however, the situation becomes somewhat more complex. Like films and television programs, games usually have definite beginning and end points, but what happens between these points seems, at least superficially, to be dramatically different. Regardless of their genre, films and television programs are self-propelling entities; the actions of the characters drive the narrative forward toward some kind of resolution. In the case of a television series, this resolution might only be partial, but at the end of the program's duration there is still some kind of finality to the narrative process, albeit temporary. Games, on the other hand, are designed for extended and often repeated playing, and as such necessarily resist narrative closure, and therefore have to provide pleasure for the player in other ways.\n      In some cases, games adopt a strategy that is similar in many ways to episodic television; the game is divided in into several \"sub-games\", with overall narrative resolution only being achieved through the successful completion of the sub-games. A good example of this is Dreamworks' Medal of Honor, a first-person action game set is World War Two. In order to complete the game, players must successfully carry out a series of missions, which are themselves divided into several tasks. In keeping with the action orientation of the genre, these tasks usually involve destroying some piece of military equipment, and players are rewarded based upon their proficiency in carrying them out.\n      What is especially interesting about games like Medal of Honor is their ability to create an illusion of narrative freedom; players can effectively dictate the course the narrative takes depending on how they perform certain tasks. Resident Evil and its sequels take this concept one step further, creating a virtual gaming environment in which the player is seemingly free to go wherever they want. However, while the players are free to dictate the narrative flow at the level of what I have termed the sub-game, completion of the overall game (and therefore narrative closure) requires the player to follow a rigidly pre-established path through the game's levels. Players could in theory spend days wandering the desolate landscape of Resident Evil 2, but they just wouldn't get anywhere.\n      \n      Other genres of game present different problems in terms of narrative progression, and indeed some would argue that certain games progress without possessing a narrative at all. Racing games are the most obvious example of this; driving around the same track for up to 80 laps does not constitute a narrative as it is traditionally conceptualised. However, racing games are increasingly adopting narrative conventions in order to deepen the gaming experience. Formula One 99, for example, allows the player to take the place of any of the drivers from the 1999 Formula One season, accruing points depending on finishing position in the same way as the real championship. In this context, each race operates as a sub-game, and the successful completion of each race allows the game as a whole to be completed.\n      A slightly different take on the idea of a racing narrative is taken by Gran Turismo, a game that quickly became the most successful title from Sony's Polyphony Digital. Over the traditional racing format, Polyphony superimposed a narrative based on the game's own fictional economy. Players begin the game with enough credits to purchase a low-performance vehicle, which can then be upgraded as players win races and earn enough credits to afford the necessary parts. In this way, Gran Turismo generates a narrative that is described by the player's quest to constantly purchase faster and better cars, a narrative which, given the game's 400-car menu, can take months to reach its conclusion.\n      One aspect of computer game narratives that has surprisingly received little attention to this point is the introductory video: the short animated sequence used to set the scene for the game that follows. Typically, these sequences are created entirely from computer generated images, and in terms of genre, perform a similar function to film trailers. As well as introducing the main characters, introductory videos inform the player about the type of game they're about to play, whether it be a racing game like Gran Turismo or a sports simulation like Cricket 2000.\n      \n      More importantly, introductory videos also work to discursively position the player within the narrative, providing them with information about the subject positions they are permitted to assume. For fighting-based action games like Tekken and its sequels, the introductory video provides information about all the characters in the game, telling the player that they can assume any one of the multiple identities the game offers. Other games, like Medal of Honor, are much more restrictive in terms of their subject possibilities, allowing the player to adopt only one role in the single-player version. In fact, the introductory video for Medal of Honor explicitly positions the player in a very narrowly-defined role, using a first person voice over to instruct the player that they will be acting as a particular American soldier, \"Jimmy Patterson\".\n      However, even games that offer very limited latitude in terms of subject positioning can still be open to radical interpretation. The very interactivity that differentiates games from other forms of audio-visual media means that players can actively \"read against\" the narrative provided for them, driving the game toward new (but still inherently limited) conclusions. For example, players of Medal of Honor can attempt to achieve the game's goals through stealth rather than violence, a tactic which, interestingly, always results in a lower score. Similarly, players of some racing games can usurp the game's internal logic, substituting the goal of a race win with one of vehicular destruction. The key here is that pleasure seems to be derived through a complex relationship between the player-driven narrative and the narrative imposed by the game engine.\n      This notion of the \"resistant\" reading of game narratives serves to demonstrate that the relationship between the player and game text is more complex than it at first appears; certainly it is more complex than simple media effects studies imply. What is needed now is a more rigorous investigation of both the textual characteristics of the game medium, and of how players interact with those characteristics. It is only after such an investigation has been carried out that a more constructive dialogue on the socio-cultural implications of game playing can be begun.\n          \n      References  \n      \nAlloway, N., and P.

    "abstract": "\n        The technical apparatus is, then, being made at home with the rest of our world. And that's a thing that's routinely being done, and it's the source of the failure of technocratic dreams that if only we introduced some fantastic new communication machine, the world will be transformed. Where what happens is that the object is made at home in the world that has whatever organisation it already has.\n        \n        -- Harvey Sacks (Lectures on Conversation Vol. 2., 548-9)\n        Chatting, or having a conversation, has long been a favourite activity for people. It seemed so ordinary, if not to say trivial, that it has for almost equally long not been studied in any dedicated way. It was only when Harvey Sacks and his early collaborators started using the tape recorder to study telephone conversations that 'conversation' as a topic has become established (cf. Sacks, Lectures Vol. 1). Inspired by Harold Garfinkel, the perspective chosen was a procedural one: they wanted to analyse how conversations are organised on the spot. As Sacks once said: \n      The gross aim of the work I am doing is to see how finely the details of actual, naturally occurring conversation can be subjected to analysis that will yield the technology of conversation. (Sacks, \"On Doing 'Being Ordinary'\" 411)\n      Later, Sacks also started using data from audio-recorded face-to-face encounters. Most of the phenomena that the research on telephone conversation unearthed could also be found in face-to-face data. Whether something was lost by relying on just audio materials was not clear at the beginning. But with video-based research, as initiated by Charles Goodwin in the 1970s, one was later able to demonstrate that visual exchanges did play an essential role the actual organisation of face-to-face conduct. When using telephone technology, people seemed to rely on a restricted set of the interactional procedures used in face-to-face settings. But new ways to deal with both general and setting-specific problems, such as mutual identification, were also developed. Now that an increasing number of people spend various amounts of their time 'online', chatting with friends or whoever is available, it is time to study Computer-Mediated Conversation (CMC), as we previously studied face-to-face conversation and Telephone (Mediated) Conversation, using the same procedural perspective. We may expect that we will encounter many phenomena that have become familiar to us, and that we will be able to use many of the same concepts. But we will probably also see that people have developed new technical variations of familiar themes as they adapt the technology of conversation to the possibilities and limitations of this new technology of communicative mediation. In so doing, they will make the new technology 'at home in the world that has whatever organisation it already has.' \n      Space does not allow a full discussion of the properties of text-based CMC as instantiated in 'chat' environments, but comparing CMC with face-to-face communication and telephone conversations, it is obvious that the means to convey meanings are severely restricted. In face-to-face encounters, many of the more subtle aspects of the conversation rely on visual and vocal productions and perceptions, which are more or less distinguishable from the 'text' that has been uttered. Following the early work of Gregory Bateson, these aspects are mostly conceived of as a kind of commentary on the core communication available in the 'text', that is as 'meta-communication'. While the 'separation' between 'levels' of communication, that these conceptualisations imply may distort what actually goes on in face-to-face encounters, there is no doubt that telephone conversations, in which the visual 'channel' is not available, and text-based CMC, which in addition lacks access to voice qualities, do confront participants with important communicative restrictions.\n      An important aspect of text-based computer-mediated chatting is that it offers users an unprecedented anonymity, and therefore an unprecedented licence for unaccountable action, ranging from bland banality to criminal threat, while passing through all imaginable sexual 'perversities'. One upshot of this is that they can present themselves as belonging to any plausible category they may choose, but they will -- in the chat context -- never be sure whether the other participants 'really' are legitimate members of the categories they claim for themselves. In various other formats for CMC, like MUDs and MOOs, the looseness of the connections between the people who type messages and the identities they project in the chat environment seems often to be accepted as an inescapable fact, which adds to the fascination of participation1. The typists can then be called 'players' and the projected identities 'characters', while the interaction can be seen as a game of role-playing. In general chat environments, as the one I will discuss later, such a game-like quality seems not to be openly admitted, although quite often hinted at. Rather, the participants stick to playing who they claim they are. In my own text, however, I will use 'player' and 'character' to indicate the two faces of participation in computer-mediated, text-based chats.\n      In the following sections, I will discuss the organised ways in which one particular problem that chat-players have is dealt with. That problem can be glossed as: how do people wanting to 'chat' on the Internet find suitable partners for that activity? The solution to that problem lies in the explicit naming or implicit suggestion of various kinds of social categories, like 'age', 'sex' and 'location'. Chat players very often initiate a chat with a question like: \"hi, a/s/l please?\", which asks the other party to self-identify in those terms, as, for instance \"frits/m/amsterdam\", if that fits the character the player wants to project. But, as I will explain, categorisation plays its role both earlier and later in the chat process. \n      'Membership Categorisation' in Finding Chat Partners \n      The following exploration is, then, an exercise in Membership Categorisation Analysis (MCA; Hester &amp; Eglin) as based on the ideas developed by Harvey Sacks in the 1960s (Sacks, \"An Initial Investigation\", \"On the Analyzability of Stories\", Lectures on Conversation Vol. 1). An immense part of the mundane knowledge that people use in living their everyday lives is organised in terms of categories that label members of some population as being of certain types. These categories are organised in sets, called Membership Categorisation Devices (MCDs). The MCD 'sex' (or 'gender'), for instance, consists of the two categories of 'male' and 'female'. Labelling a person as being male or female carries with it an enormous amount of implied properties, so called 'category-predicates', such as expectable or required behaviours, capacities, values, etc. My overall thesis is that people who want to chat rely mostly on categorical predications to find suitable chat partners.\n      Finding a chat partner or chat partners is an interactive process between at least two parties. Their job involves a combination of presenting themselves and reading others' self presentations. For each, the job has a structure like 'find an X who wants a Y as a partner', where X is the desired chat character and Y is the character you yourself want to play. The set of XY-combinations varies in scope, of course, from very wide, say any male/female combination, to rather narrow, as we will see. \n     The partner finding process for chats can be loosely compared with partly similar processes in other environments, such as cocktail parties, poster sessions at conferences, and telephone calls. The openings of telephone calls have been researched extensively by conversation analysts, especially Schegloff (\"Sequencing\", \"Identification\", \"Routine\"; also Hopper). An interesting idea from this work is that a call opening tends to follow a loosely defined pattern, called the canonical model for telephone openings. This involves making contact, mutual identification/recognition, greetings and 'how-are-you?'s, before the actual business of the call is tackled. When logging on to a chat environment, one enters a market of sorts, where the participants are both buyers and sellers: a general sociability-market like a cocktail party. And indeed some writers have characterised chat rooms as 'virtual cocktail parties'. Some participants in a cocktail party may, of course, have quite specific purposes in mind, like wanting to meet a particular kind of person, or a particular individual, or even being open to starting a relationship which may endure for some time after the event. The same is true for CMC chats.\n      \n      The trajectory that the partner-finding process will take is partly pre-structured by the technology used. I have limited my explorations to one particular chat environment (Microsoft Chat). In that program, the actual partner-finding starts even before logging on, as one is required to fill in certain information slots when setting up the program, such as Real Name and Nickname and optional slots like Email Address and Profile. When you click on the Chat Room List icon, you are presented with a list of over a thousand rooms, alphabetically arranged, with the number of participants. You can select a Room and click a button to enter it. When you do, you get a new screen, which has three windows, one that represents the ongoing general conversation, one with a list of the participants' nicks, and a window to type your contributions in. When you right-click on a name in the participant list, you get a number of options, including Get Profile. Get Profile allows you to get more information on that person, if he/she has filled in that part of the form, but often you get \"This person is too lazy to create a profile entry.\"\n      Categorisation in Room Names\n      When you log in to the chat server, you can search either the Chat Room List or the Users List. Let us take the Chat Room List first. Some room names seem to be designed to come early in the alphabetically ordered list, by starting with one or more A's, as in A!!!!!!!!!FriendlyChat, while others rely on certain key words. Scanning over a thousand names for those words by scrolling the list might take a lot of time, but the Chat Room List has a search facility. You can type a string and the list will be shortened to only those with that string in their name. Many room names seem to be designed for being found this way, by containing a number of more or less redundant strings that people might use in a search. Some examples of room names are: A!!!!!!!!!FriendlyChat, Animal&amp;Girls, Australia_Sydney_Chat_Room, christian evening post, desert_and_cactus_only, engineer, francais_saloppes, francais_soumise_sub_slave, german_deutsch_rollenspiele, hayatherseyeragmensürüyor, holland_babbel, italia_14_19anni, italia_padania_e_basta, L@Ros@deiVenti, nederlandse_chat, sex_tr, subslavespankbondage, Sweet_Girl_From_Alabama, #BI_LES_FEM_ONLY, #Chinese_Chat, #France, #LesbiansBiTeenGirls_Cam_NetMeeting, #polska_do_flirtowania, #russian_Virtual_Bar?, #tr_%izmir, #ukphonefantasy.\n      A first look at this collection of room names suggests two broad classes of categorisation: first a local/national/cultural/ethnic class, and second one oriented to topics, with a large dose of sexual ones. For the first class, different kinds of indicators are available, such as naming as in Australia_Sydney_Chat_Room, and the use of a local language as in hayatherseyeragmensürüyor, or in combination: german_deutsch_rollenspiele. When you enter this type of room, a first function of such categorisations becomes apparent in that non-English categorisations suggest a different language practice. While English is the default language, quite a few people prefer using their own local language. Some rooms even suggest a more restricted area, as in Australia_Sydney_Chat_Room, for those who are interested in chatting with people not too far off. This seems a bit paradoxical, as chatting in a world-wide network allows contacts between people who are physically distant, as is often mentioned in chats. Rooms with such local restrictions may be designed, however, to facilitate possible subsequent face-to-face meetings or telephone contacts, as is suggested by names like Fr@nce_P@ris_Rencontre and #ukphonefantasy.\n      The collection of sexually suggestive names is not only large, but also indicative of a large variety of interests, including just (probably heterosexual) sex, male gay sex, female lesbian or bi-sexuality. Some names invoke some more specialized practices like BDSM, and a collection of other 'perversities', as in names like 'francais_soumcateise_sub_slave', 'subslavespankbondage', 'golden_shower' or 'family_secrets'. But quite often sexual interest are only revealed in subsequent stages of contact.\n      Non-sexual interests are, of course, also apparent, including religious, professional, political or commercial ones, as in 'christian evening post', or 'culturecrossing', 'holland_paranormaal', 'jesussaves', 'Pokemon_Chat', 'francais_informatique', and '#Russian_Philosophy_2918'.\n      Categorisation through Nicknames\n      Having selected a room, your next step is to see who is there. As chatting ultimately concerns exchanges between (virtual) persons, it is no surprise that nicknames are used as concise 'labels' to announce who is available on the chat network or in a particular room. Consider some examples: ^P0371G , amanda14, anneke, banana81, Dream_Girl, emma69, ericdraven, latex_bi_tch1 , Leeroy, LuCho1, Mary15, Miguelo, SomeFun, Steffi, teaser.\n      Some of these are rather opaque, at least at first, while others seem quite ordinary. Anneke, for instance, is an ordinary Dutch name for girls. So, by using this nick name, a person at the same time categorises herself in two Membership Categorisation Devices: gender: 'female' and language: 'Dutch'. When using this type of nick, you will quite often be addressed in Dutch, for instance with the typically Dutch chat-greeting \"hoi\" and/or by a question like \"ben jij Nederlandse?\" (\"are you Dutch?\" -- female form). This question asks you to categorise yourself, using the nationality device 'Dutch/Belgian', within the language category 'speaker of Dutch'. Many other first names like 'amanda' and 'emma', do not have such a language specificity and so do not 'project' a specific European language/nationality as 'anneke' does. Some French names, like 'nathalie' are a bit ambiguous in that respect, as they are used in quite a number of other language communities, so you may get a more open question like \"bonjour, tu parle francais?\" (\"hi, do you speak French?\"). A name like 'Miguelo' suggests a roman language, of course, while 'LuCho1' or 'Konusmaz' indicate non-European languages (here Chinese and Turkish, respectively).\n      Quite often, a first name nick also carries an attached number, as in 'Mary15'. One reason for such attachments is that a nick has to be unique, so if you join the channel with a nick like 'Mary', there will mostly be another who has already claimed that particular name. An error message will appear suggesting that you take another nick. The easiest solution, then, is to add an 'identifying detail', like a number. Technically, any number, letter or other character will do, so you can take Mary1, or Mary~, or Mary_m. Quite often, numbers are used in accord with the nick's age, as is probably the case in our examples 'Mary15' and 'amanda14', but not in 'emma69', which suggests an 'activity preference' rather than an age category. Some of the other nicks in our examples suggest other aspects, claims or interests, as in Dream_Girl, latex_bi_tch1, SomeFun, or teaser. Other examples are: 'machomadness', 'daddyishere', 'LadySusan28', 'maleslave', 'curieuse33', 'patrickcam', or 'YOUNG_GAY_BOY'. More elaborate information about a character can sometimes be collected from his or her profile, but for reasons of space, I will not discuss its use here.\n      This paper's interest is not only in finding out which categories and MCDs are actually used, but also how they are used, what kind of function they can be seen to have. How do chat participants organise their way to 'the anchor point' (Schegloff, \"Routine\"), at which they start their actual chat 'business'? For the chatting environment that I have observed, there seems to be two major purposes, one may be called social, i.e. 'just chatting', as under the rubric 'friendly chat', and the other is sexual. These purposes may be mixed, of course, in that the first may lead to the second, or the second accompanied by the first. Apart from those two major purposes, a number of others can be inferred from the room titles, including the discussion of political, religious, and technical topics.\n      Sexual chats can take various forms, most prominently 'pic trading' and 'cybersex'. As becomes clear from research by Don Slater, an enormous 'market' for 'pic trading' has emerged, with a quite explicit normative structure of 'fair trading', i.e. if one receives something, one should reciprocate in kind. When one is in an appropriate room, and especially if one plays a female character, other participants quite often try to initiate pic trading. This can have the form of sending a pic, without any verbal exchange, possibly followed by a request like 'send also'. But you may also get a verbal request first, like \"do you have a (self) pic?\" If you reply in a negative way, you often do not get any further reaction, or just \"ok.\" A 'pic request' can also be preceded by some verbal exchanges; social, sexual or both. That question -- \"have a pic?\" or \"wanna trade\" -- can then be considered the real starting point for that particular encounter, or it can be part of a process of getting to know each other: \"can i c u?\"\n      The second form of sexual chats involves cyber sex. This may be characterised as interactionally improvised pornography, the exchange of sexually explicit messages enacting a sexual fantasy or a shared masturbation session. There is a repertoire of opening moves for these kinds of games, including \"wanna cyber?\", \"are you alone?\" and \"what are you wearing now?\"\n      Functions of Categorisations \n      Categorisations in room names, nicks and profiles has two major functions: guiding the selection of suitable chat partners and suggesting topics. Location information has quite diverse implications in different contexts, e.g. linguistic, cultural, national and geographical. Language is a primordial parameter in any text-based activity, and chatting offers numerous illustrations for this. Cultural implications seem to be more diffuse, but probably important for some (classes of?) participants. Nationality is important in various ways, for instance as an 'identity anchor'. So when you use a typically Dutch nick, like 'frits' or 'anneke', you may get first questions asking whether you are from the Netherlands or from Belgium and subsequently from which region or town. This may be important for indicating reachability, either in person or over the phone. Location information can also be used as topic opener. So when you mention that you live in Amsterdam, you often get positive remarks about the city, like \"I visited Amsterdam last June and I liked it very much\", or \"I would die to live there\" (sic) from a pot-smoking U.S. student.\n      After language, age and gender seem to be the most important points in exploring mutual suitability. When possible partners differ in age or gender category, this quite often leads to questions like \"Am I not too old/young for you?\" Of course, age and gender are basic parameters for sexual selection, as people differ in their range of sexual preferences along the lines of these categories, i.e. same sex or opposite sex, and roughly the same age or older/younger age. Such preferences intersect with straight or kinky ones, of which a large variety can be found. Many rooms are organised around one or another combination, as announced in names like '#LesbiansBiTeenGirls_Cam_NetMeeting', 'Hollandlolita' or '#Lesbian_Domination'. In some of these, the host makes efforts to keep to a more or less strict 'regime', for instance by banning obvious males from a room like '#BI_LES_FEM_ONLY'. In others, an automated welcome message is used to lay out the participation rules.\n      Conclusion\n      To sum up, categorisation plays an essential role in a sorting-out process leading, ideally, to small-group or dyadic suitability. A/S/L, age, sex and location, are obvious starting points, but other differentiations, as in sexual preferences which are themselves partly rooted in age/gender combinations, also play a role. In this process, suitability explorations and topic initiations are intimately related. Chatting, then, is text-based categorisation. New communication technologies are invented with rather limited purposes in mind, but they are quite often adopted by masses of users in unexpected ways. In this process, pre-existing communicational purposes and procedures are adapted to the new environment, but basically there does not seem to be any radical change. Comparing mutual categorisation in face-to-face encounters, telephone calls, and text-based CMC as in online chatting, one can see that similar procedures are being used, although in a more and more explicit manner, as in the question: \"a/s/l please?\"\n          \n      Footnote\n      \nThese ideas have been inspired by Schaap; for an ethnography focussing on the connection between 'life online' and 'real life', see Markham, 1998.\n      \nReferences\n      \nHopper, Robert.

Virilio is an architect of the 'Brutalist' school and political 'critic of the art of technology' as well as a Husserlian phenomenologist and post-Einsteinian analyst of technoculture. In recent years Virilio has developed his own political approach to the technocultural and experiential effects of speed and technoscience on the organisation of cyberspace and cyberculture. It is an approach that is increasingly being adopted and adapted by a variety of pre-eminent thinkers on the Left such as Jean Baudrillard, Slavoj Zizek and Andre Gorz.\n      As the son of a Breton mother and an Italian communist father in Nazi-occupied France, Virilio spent the majority of World War II as an anxious evacuee in Nantes. In 1950 he converted to Christianity in the fraternity of 'worker-priests'. Virilio was educated at the L'École des Métiers d'Art in Paris and first became a craftsman in stained glass before becoming a sort of intellectual provocateur and co-editor of Architecture Principe, an architectural group and occasional review devoted to radical political and architectural experimentation. Between 1963 and 1966 Virilio dedicated his time to studying the architecture of war and to the construction of the 'bunker church' of Sainte-Bernadette du Banlay at Nevers. Virilio became politically active during the 1968 May revolt and this led to an irrevocable split with his partner in Architecture Principe, the architect Claude Parent. In 1969 Virilio was instated as a professor of architecture at the École Speciale d'Architecture at the behest of the students there, a position he occupied until his retirement in 1997. Virilio's major work is Speed &amp; Politics: An Essay on Dromology (1986), written, he maintains, to raise the political question of speed as the hidden side of economic development. Virilio's recent texts such as Open Sky (1997) and now The Information Bomb can therefore be regarded as important advances in his current work on the politics of techno, or, cyberculture.\n      As the son of a Breton mother and an Italian communist father in Nazi-occupied France, Virilio spent the majority of World War II as an anxious evacuee in Nantes.

Virilio's recent texts such as Open Sky (1997) and now The Information Bomb can therefore be regarded as important advances in his current work on the politics of techno, or, cyberculture.\n      Virilio's newest political and technocultural work, The Information Bomb, is set to become an important text of intellectual and dromological analysis. On its opening page Virilio quotes Werner Heisenberg, the German physicist, chief architect of quantum mechanics and founder of the 'uncertainty principle': 'No one can say what will be \"real\" for people when the wars which are now beginning come to an end'. Briefly, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that if a simultaneous calculation is made of the location and speed of a particle then, no matter how faithful the calculations, there is always an uncertainty in the values acquired. It deals with the simultaneous calculation of energy and time. The uncertainty occurs because the act of perceiving the system interferes with it in an unpredictable manner. But uncertainty is only significant at the atomic and subatomic levels and at these levels throws the principle of causality into confusion. Virilio's The Information Bomb therefore examines the dromological and uncertain relationships between the 'reality' of the war universe, speed and, crucially, our perception of its main causalities.\n      The key question and the first sentence of Virilio's book is: 'The civilianisation or militarisation of science?' Virilio answers by describing what he calls the catastrophes of postmodern technoscience and globalisation, Americanisation, biotechnology, Internet pornography and the advertising industry in the most uncompromising terms. Virilio's riposte to the question is already contained in the book's title. This is because, for him, since the end of World War II, the militarisation of science and the construction of two kinds of bomb have overshadowed civilian life. The first is the atom bomb, 'which is capable of using the energy of radioactivity to smash matter'. The second is the information bomb, 'which is capable of using the interactivity of information to wreck the peace between nations'. Virilio delineates the existence of the information bomb, of an explosion of mediated misery around the world, in terms of the deterioration of language and the sheer seductive power of TV and computer screens, the acceleration of history and the emergence of new inter-generational conflicts. Virilio forcefully argues that the advent of the information bomb requires the creation of a new type of social deterrence if nations are to avoid the 'fission' of their 'social cores' as they enter into the uncertain and often shocking world of chronopolitics. For this is a topsy-turvy world where neo-liberalism confronts 'cyberfeminism' and the military-scientific complex contemplates the arrival of 'cyberwar' and 'grey ecology' (the pollution of distances) under the sign of cinematic disinformation from Hollywood and the technological transformation of work through the introduction of mobile phones and 'zero-hour' contracts. Or, as Virilio says at one point in The Information Bomb: in today's 'dromocratic' capitalism, when the biotech corporation calls, 'you come running'.\n      It would, though, be incorrect to view Virilio's political opposition to the uncritical acceptance of technoculture and the explosion of the information bomb as a wholly pessimistic stance on the spread of neo-liberalism in realms such as the multimedia. Virilio's work is, for example, in no way analogous to that of Baudrillard, the intellectual high priest of postmodernism. In truth, Virilio manifestly frames his recent writings in relation to a guarded optimism concerning what I have elsewhere called his 'hypermodern' technocultural theory: a theory involved with the acceleration and dislocation of modern forms of thought about the contemporary world and how it is depicted. It is therefore perfectly plausible to derive from Virilio's dromological texts a scientifically 'uncertain' conception of 'reality' that focusses on the concepts of hypermodernism and 'hypermodernity'. The latter is an idea centred on coming to terms with the speeding-up of historical processes and a critical analysis of modernity based on a political perception of technoculture that is catastrophic. \n      In this way, Virilio typically conceives of the developments he documents in The Information Bomb not as the psychoanalytic problems of progress but as the technoscientific and 'excessive' displacement of them. It is a conceptualisation that is evident in his dromological and dynamic writings on the subject of 'information superhighways' and the 'full range of communications disturbances acquired over the recent centuries of technology'. 'In this field', Virilio says, progress 'acts like a forensic scientist on us' since it violates 'each bodily orifice'. But such 'brutal incursions' do not merely influence individuals; they colonise them. For Virilio, then, progress 'heaps up, accumulates and condenses in each of us the full range of (visual, social, psycho-motor, affective, sexual, etc.) detrital disorders which it has taken on with each innovation, each with their full complement of specific injuries'. All criticism of technology having disappeared, 'we have slid unconsciously from pure technology to techno-culture and, lastly, to the dogmatism of a totalitarian techno-cult...'\n      As can be ascertained from the above examples, Virilio's work sits uneasily with almost all the prevailing paradigms and methodological approaches currently on offer. Chasing a multitude of Foucauldian discontinuities and shape-shifting Deleuzian inflected 'lines of flight' simultaneously, The Information Bomb can thus be seen as a reflection of his self-professed 'anarcho-Christianity'. It is a methodological stance, political perspective and religious position Virilio shares to some extent with the author of The Technological Society (1964), the late Jacques Ellul. Viewed from this angle, Virilio's oppositional and overtly political writings on the 'hypermodern condition' present a comprehensible methodological outlook. It is, however, an outlook that is somewhat at odds with the political and intellectual terrain occupied by 'transpolitical' postmodernists such as Baudrillard, 'poststructuralist anarchists' like Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze and the deconstructionist and 'spectral Marxist' Jacques Derrida. Nonetheless, it would be a mistake to imagine that Virilio's rather abstract writings in The Information Bomb opposing the rise of neo-liberalism and the hypermodern condition have not touched a nerve in France. Left-leaning theoreticians and the editors of newspapers such as Le Monde Diplomatique regularly pursue Virilio's forthright opinions in the form of articles and interviews on everything from Fukuyama's The End of History and the Last Man (1992) to his own thoughts on the end of geography and technoculture. Virilio is therefore a very creative political theorist who articulates himself with equal ease in academic and non-specialist technocultural works. Unlike Foucault, Virilio is the personification of the 'engaged intellectual'. Rather than simply opting for the life of a professor of architecture at the École Speciale d' Architecture, Virilio has always chosen to communicate his ideas to as wide an audience as possible, a strategy that earned him a 'National Award for Criticism' in 1987.\n     Virilio's contemporary writings thus necessarily involve a dromological, political and technocultural encounter with the militarisation of science in the shape of the Internet. Even so, unlike Virilio's earlier texts such as Open Sky (1997), in The Information Bomb Virilio does not merely concentrate his gaze on society's apparent need for speed but, decisively, on its present-day extension into pornography and advertising and their integration into the commercialisation of the art world. Describing the 1997 London Royal Academy exhibition entitled 'Sensation' ostensibly held to present young British artists, Virilio suggests that, like many others, in actuality, this exhibition was designed and presented by 'the sex-culture-advertising movement'. This is because the '110 works on display (a portrait of child-murderer Myra Hindley, casts of childlike bodies with mouths replaced by phalluses, etc.) belonged, without exception, to Charles Saatchi, one of Britain's great advertising moguls'. What is at issue here for Virilio is the recognition that, like the need for speed and the example of the Internet, the distinctions between the world of pornography, the world of art and the world of advertising have all but been obliterated in the name of nothing more profound than 'breaking down the last taboos'. However, in Virilio's hypermodern conception of the 'terminal arts', a 'confrontation between a tortured body and an automatic camera' not only signifies the coming of the 'sex-culture-advertising-complex' but, equally importantly, the onset of 'endocolonisation' or, what takes place when militarised technoscience colonises the human body with the aim of reducing every member of humanity that has 'had its day' to the status of a 'specimen'.\n      \n      The political critiques provided by Virilio in The Information Bomb are a welcome development. For, today, it is sometimes all too easy to criticise the discipline of cultural studies for its celebration of political, technological and cultural différance without any corresponding recognition of economic and other inequalities founded on class, gender and race. Moreover, Virilio's fervent and occasionally maniacal critique of the art of technology stands out because it stretches from political and technocultural studies to economic and film studies, sometimes in the space of a single paragraph. Taking in Hollywood directors and obvious film productions such as Jan de Bont's Speed as well as the work of French cinematic pioneers like the Lumière brothers', Virilio's The Information Bomb is an important publication. But, unlike numerous other 'cybercultural' tomes, the significance of this book is derived from the fact that it also manages to extend the scope of political and technocultural studies through the provision of often-abstruse pronouncements such as Kafka's claim that the cinema 'involves putting the eye into uniform'.\n      The political critiques provided by Virilio in The Information Bomb are a welcome development.

For example, Virilio's The Art of the Motor (1995) has been an important reference point in the recent writings of imaginative Marxists as distinct as Zizek in The Plague of Fantasies (1997) and Gorz in Reclaiming Work: Beyond the Wage-Based Society (1999). It would be difficult to believe that The Information Bomb will not become another significant source in the future works of other creative radicals, offering as it does not only a provisional pathway out of the quicksand of postmodernism but also a way into the sympathies of ordinary people. Firing off political concepts and technocultural neologisms at the speed of light, Virilio's passionately argued texts do not always hit their intended targets. But for anyone seeking a hypermodern critique of the cultural logic of late militarism that ranges from the Internet and the commercialisation of art to endocolonisation and the accident, Virilio's radical political and technocultural theory of speed contained in The Information Bomb is just what you have been waiting for.\n          \n      Citation reference for this article  \n      MLA style:\n      \n John Armitage. \"The Uncertainty Principle: Paul Virilio's 'The Information Bomb'.\" M/C: A Journal of Media and Culture 3.3 (2000).

    "abstract": "\n      The process of modernisation can be understood to have contributed to a radical loss of collective and individual orientation, by depriving geography of identity, and replacing place by space. \"Space\", writes Klapp, \"robs identity. Place, on the other hand, nurtures it, tells you who you are\" (28). If the replacement of place by space is an achievement of modernity, the replacement of space by time can be considered a postmodern hallmark. The fact is that cultures are now bounded as entities more in time than in space, and \"time depth now prevails over field depth\" (Virilio 24). It is, in other words, the unfolding of time that reflects change more immediately than does spatial distance. In fact space itself is now defined by time.\n      The 200-year development course of the meter as the unit of length, for example, displays an interesting parallel to the space-time transition. In 1793 the French government decided the unit of length to be 10-7 of the earth's quadrant passing through Paris and to be called meter. It became clear in further examinations that the earth's quadrant had been miscalculated, but this discovery did not stop the use of the unit. Initially referred to as \"meter of the archives\", the unit was announced in 1799 to be based on a measurement of a meridian between Dunkirk and Barcelona, embodied by a rectangular platinum bar with polished parallel ends. This bar, which was supposed to equal one ten-millionth (10-7) part of the quadrant of the earth, went on to serve as the international standard of length throughout the 19th century. In 1872, the length was set as the official definition of meter by the International Commission of the Meter, even though it was admitted that \"its relationship to a quadrant of the earth was tenuous and of little consequence anyway\"1. The original bar was then replaced by another platinum-iridium line tool which was christened \"the international prototype meter\" and its 'copies' were distributed between member countries of the International Metric Convention in 1889. This definition was to serve as the reference of length until the mid-twentieth century. In 1960, following decades of deliberation, meter was redefined in the Eleventh General Conference on Weights and Measures as \"1,659,763.73 vacuum wavelengths of light resulting from unperturbed atomic energy level transition 2p10 - 5d5 of the krypton isotope having an atomic weight of 86\". This is an interesting development, because now the concept of length is removed from a geographical reference like the distance between Dunkirk and Barcelona to a 'virtual', non-geographical space like the distance between the peaks of the sine waves of a certain type of light. Finally in 1983 the meter was redefined once again. This time the definition refers directly to time as the unit for measuring space. The meter is defined currently as \"the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second\". A fast glance at this history reveals the absence of 'real' reference for what we have come to accept as the 'standard' unit, and the unstable nature of this unit. More intriguingly, the course of development of this definition portrays the gradual progression of reference from geographic place to virtual space and from there to time.\n      Shrinking Time \n      If the modern question of identity concerned locality and spatial reference, what informs the question of identity in the postmodern condition is primarily defined by temporal locatedness and virtual geography or even virtual space. This progression then causes speed to inevitably inform the issue of identification reference. The speed of environmental change is gradually approaching a point where identity could lack a reference, a precedence with which to identify oneself. The conflict is fundamental: if self-identification has traditionally always already implied a reference in time, then acceleration is inherently the enemy of identity, by continuously curtailing the stuff identity is made of. It is not a coincidence perhaps that the concerns of social sciences have gradually moved from being able to predict the future to being content with simply explaining the present, as the high speed of change leaves little room for the luxury of prediction.\n      If the modern question of identity concerned locality and spatial reference, what informs the question of identity in the postmodern condition is primarily defined by temporal locatedness and virtual geography or even virtual space.

It is not a coincidence perhaps that the concerns of social sciences have gradually moved from being able to predict the future to being content with simply explaining the present, as the high speed of change leaves little room for the luxury of prediction.\n      If we describe the postmodern condition as a condition where the critical referential distance of identity approaches zero (the contraction of time), then the increase in speed of change can, theoretically at least, lead to a reversal of the orders of reference (see above). This may in fact be conceptualised as a reversal in the order of signification, so that the signifier precedes the signified. Though extremely important for a theory of posthuman identity, the possibility and implications of such reversal are not within the scope of the present paper. Presently applicable, however, is the more-or-less current postmodern predicament, within which self-identification seems to be running short of reference. To imagine a system of meaning wherein the act of self-identification (as traditionally done by humans) is unfeasible is to imagine a constant state of flux, a seamless ocean of meaning, a state traditionally considered pathological and diagnosed schizoid: a \"smooth space,\" which is \"in principle infinite, open, and unlimited in every direction\"; and which \"has neither top nor bottom nor centre\" (Deleuze &amp; Guattari 476). It is not difficult to realise that the self native to this environment cannot be the human self we are familiar with. In the words of Gergen, the postmodern self resides in \"a continuous state of construction and reconstruction\", a fluid landscape where \"each reality of self gives way to reflexive questioning, irony, and ultimately the playful probing of yet another reality\", a reality where \"the centre fails to hold\" (6). While such conception of a posthuman to come may appear fantastic, the undeniable fact is that the postmodern condition is constantly expanding its reach, erasing boundaries, transforming nations, and dissolving temporal horizons. \"Here as elsewhere, in our ordinary everyday life\", writes Virilio, \"we are passing from the extensive time of history to the intensive time of an instantaneity without history made possible by the technologies of the hour\" (24-5).\n      Conclusion \n      As the progression of speed renders space and time as constituents of human reality less inflexible, it becomes imperative for any new theory of identity to accommodate a conception of identity ultimately unconstrained by these grids. Such theoretical argument, however, needs to be accompanied by serious political considerations. Despite the specific philosophical perspective endorsed through the language of this paper, and while accepting Baumans suggestion that \"identity is a name given to the sought escape from uncertainty\" (82), I would insist nonetheless that political and clinical concerns demand certain concepts-to-work-with, certain constructions meant to translate Being into the human reality. True, such translation spells violence, but the fact is that in a final analysis violence appears as the other name for being, and any semiotic construction of the world always already exists through a systemised (if partial) negation of Being. That is to say, a philosophical appreciation of the void behind the term \"identity\" does not necessarily render a conceptualisation of identity futile. The challenge, however, may lie in gradually freeing the concept, so as to move as far as possible from positivistic reification towards the least rigid conceptualisations permitted within the current discourse of a given era. Currently, for example, the notions of change and fluidity championed by postmodern thinkers may provide useful metaphors towards such liberation of the working concept.\n          \n      Footnotes \n      \nThe information on the history of the meter is from the National Institute of Standards and Technology of the Government of the United States, through the Manufacturing Engineering Lab Web Site:  http://www.mel.nist.gov. \n        \nReferences \n      \nBauman, Z.

    "title": "The Fortean Continuity of eXistenZ within a Virtual Environment",
    "abstract": "\n      \n      So then: \nThat all phenomena in our intermediate state, or quasi-state, represent this one attempt to organise, stabilise, harmonise, individualise -- or to positivise, or to become real: \nThat only to have seeming is to express failure or intermediateness to final failure and final success; \nThat every attempt -- that is observable -- is defeated by Continuity, or by outside forces -- or by the excluded that are continuous with the included: \nThat our whole \"existence\" is an attempt by the relative to be absolute, or by the local to be the universal. -- Charles Fort, The Book of the Damned (1919)\n\n      \n      \n      I inspire this essay with outlandish reference from the \"Godfather of the paranormal\" primarily because upon revision of his seminal, often \"disjointed\" tome The Book of the Damned, I am immediately struck by the deeply ironic reciprocity his renegade theory of Continuity shares with expansive sociocultural change effected by global communication technologies, specifically, a growing awareness of interconnections -- or links -- between all things. I am swiftly presented, upon making this observation, with Sony's latest TV ad which, rather than attempting to persuade me to buy a Sony product per se, seems considerably more interested in luring me to buy into the digital world the advertisement illustrates, blending it ambiguously into \"reality\", repetitively informing me that in such an environment, \"we are all connected\". Following suit, I make the link.\n      But from a strictly Fortean perspective, the link was already there, acknowledged or not, since Fort's ontology of Continuity precludes locality in much the same way as, say, the graphic art of M.C. Escher. Much of what Fort catalogued as \"paranormal\" phenomena can be seen as signs (in the semiotic sense) of the universe's non-localised nature. Although he did not frame his own perspective in these terms, Fort's writings subtly imply an explanation of \"existence\" as an assemblage of continuous signs seeking affirmation via exclusion (I am because I am not what I am not), an assemblage read, interpreted and ordered by the exclusive human mind. Mysterious coincidences, apparitions, vanishings, appearances, ESP, telekinesis -- these types of apparently instantaneous phenomena were seen as manifestations of phenomenological connections or mergings where none was believed or known to exist. The role of the Fortean, therefore, has traditionally been both to acknowledge that such phenomena do occur and to elucidate their significance, to explore connections between apparently unconnected phenomena, to make new, illuminating links in an infinitely interlinked universe. \n      Such a role is hardly incompatible, of course, with that of today's average Web surfer. In the virtual environment communication technologies seek to construct, nothing is really local because everything is continuous with, or linked to, everything else. Significantly, these links are of our own making, but were already there, and it is in this sense that the Web is the essence of Forteana electronically virtualised, accounting for cyberspace's prolific production of UFO and conspiracy lore, for example, both traditionally fields of high interest to Forteans. Jodie Dean notes that: \n      With the Internet, conspiracy information has been turned into entertainment ... this is because of the way that the networked society turns all of its citizens into conspiracy theorists: we are all told to search for information and make links. What is interesting about the expansion of conspiracy into mass media is the way that conspiracy thinking comes to define the Zeitgeist, to be synonymous with critical thinking in the networked society. (Pilkington 25) \n      Fortean Continuity has woven itself through much of Western popular culture since Fort's time, obviously underpinning The X-Files and its ilk but surfacing more subtly in Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia, for example, where it in fact formed the crux of that film's \"confusing\" closure: a narratively \"unconnected\" frog fall, a well-documented but poorly understood phenomenon to which Fort attached considerable significance. Seemingly \"unconnected\" events like this happen quite often, Fort discovered, and through his study of their social reception (which historically ranges from ignorance to mythic inspiration) reasoned that all phenomena and events are unexplained and unexpected -- are apparently unconnected -- until we are able to establish a context in which they might plausibly \"make sense\", or be possible, or real. When such a (culturally specific) context is established, often elaborately so in a culture intolerant of randomness, the phenomenon \"explained\" becomes awash in significance, enriching the entire environment in which it is deemed to occur, reminding us of Continuity and the creative power of explanation. Unless, of course, that explanation is primarily concerned with maintaining a dominant social power structure or paradigmatic worldview which, Fort observed, in the West tends to be interested in downplaying Continuity and promoting fragmentation, or \"localisation of the universal\". Further, by \"excluding\" the anomaly altogether (and that includes accepting its presence but maintaining its \"otherness\"), we only limit the scope of our own observation, leaving the most alluring links unexplored. \n      While all this sounds rather antiquated and mystical (it was Fort's way), I still can't help but think he might have been onto something: upon review Magnolia actually contains numerous clear Fortean references (Coleman 49). Granted a context, the frogs actually make sense. \"The message\" is that, even if the links seem at first so obscure as to be nonexistent, we are, in a virtual environment, encouraged to make them. In such an environment, the once staunch division between \"subjective construction\" and \"objective observation\" becomes largely redundant. \n      The Body as Media Sign \n      This redundancy describes a culture in which the medium has become the message. We are now encouraged to make links by transcending locality via the \"technological simulation of consciousness\", which McLuhan saw as symptomatic of the \"electric age, when our central nervous system is technologically extended to involve us in the whole of mankind and to incorporate the whole of mankind in us...\" (4), an age in which media technology essentially elaborates the nonsynthetic interconnective model of biological nature, a model completely inhospitable to notions of \"disconnection\". When our bodies and their perceptual functions become continuous with the form and information relay of technology, \"we\" become undeniably continuous, disembodied via the body. Fort's ontology of Continuity (which lead him to conceive the term \"teleportation\", probably a significant influence on the cosmology of Lovecraft) has become increasingly intrinsic to much horror and science fiction, and especially central to the filmography of Canadian auteur and master of paranoid horror, David Cronenberg. \n      Notably prominent in his first investigation of postmodernity's mediated ontology, Videodrome (1982), the theme of Continuity permeates this often \"disjointed\" film, which suggests the power of mass media operates not through the message, but through an obscure function of the medium which ultimately renders the \"message\" redundant as the medium becomes the message. Videodrome, a snuff TV show that seduces Toronto cable station chief Max Renn (James Woods), is encoded with a subliminal signal, which induces a brain tumour that eventually transforms the viewer's reality into video hallucination (and/or vice versa). The nature of the message does not ultimately matter since this subliminal signal can function through any program, even a test pattern. Steven Shaviro notices the psychedelic, McLuhanesque joke: the boundary between \"inner bodily excitation and outer objective representation\" collapses as the \"new regime of the image abolishes the distance required either for disinterested aesthetic contemplation or for stupefied absorption in spectacle\" (141). In the addictive cybernetic feedback loop of Videodrome, the distance between the medium and the body eventually collapses -- the body becomes the medium itself, the \"New Flesh\", and consequently the message: a sign within the hyperreality of an information system in which there are only signs. \n     In such an all-encompassing system of interconnected signs, in which signification becomes incontrovertibly arbitrary, borders don't so much collapse as blend into one another, forming what Cronenberg presents as eXistenZ (1999), an unresolvable \"quasi-state\" of virtual embodiment. In many ways an elaboration of Videodrome, eXistenZ presents a \"different present\" style future in which technology, biology, the synthetic, the natural, and the real are completely virtualised with the advent of synthesised, organic virtual reality technology. Consisting of \"metaflesh\", the game pods/consoles are living tissue requiring a human body as a power source. Connecting directly with the central nervous system via a port at the base of the spine, they become a working part of the biological body, transforming the individual's reality into a narrative game called eXistenZ, so \"real\" it is ultimately indistinguishable from reality itself, hence its overwhelming appeal. The content of the game is an ambiguous combination of pre-programmed information and the player's own expectations, the objective of the game being to learn why one is playing the game. Progress within the game depends upon saying the right thing to the right person/character, or doing the right thing at the right time, to receive the right information to proceed in the right direction. When progress begins to lag, the player feels an overwhelming urge to do or say something they don't \"want\" to as their game character temporarily takes over to ensure continuation of the game. Initially felt as artificially induced bodily impulses, these urges eventually become acceptable and naturalised as the player \"becomes\" their game character, adopting the prescribed attitude and behaviour required for proficiency within the game, allowing them to \"do the right thing\" more easily, to both \"make the links\" and reconfigure themselves as links. \n      \n      In this sense eXistenZ is a fitting parable for an increasingly interconnected media culture that equates media transgressions of the body/mind with eventual transcendence from the body/mind into a quasi-corporeal \"virtual reality\" of cybernetics in which the individual, like everything else that is deemed to exist, is defined as a sign of its own connection to everything else. Existence as game describes existence within a playful culture of desire in which the pursuit of happiness is equated with the pursuit of pleasurable symbols that speak for our selves, and for which a virtual reality becomes a most logical, desirable future, if not a present. Within such an environment we are all characters in the same game, a game called \"existence\". Our bodies are the game pods which make interaction within existence possible, the vehicular flesh that binds \"us\" to the gaming environment, their provision of \"reality\" becoming ever more indistinguishable from the contexts established by increasingly pervasive electronic media. Literality begins to fade schizophrenically in the wake of hypersignificance. As a sign of and within a media age, the body becomes both a medium for a self-reflexive message and a message for a self-reflexive medium. In other words, as eXistenZ suggests, the body is already so incorporated as both media (information system) and media image that there is nothing non-virtual about its reality, or reality in general, for that matter, hence the analogy of existence as interactive simulation, a game. \n      The Fortean Continuity of eXistenZ, I'd suggest, describes the increasingly anarchic power, ebb and flow of signs within a postmodern, virtual environment. Interestingly, Fort ultimately saw existence itself as reliant upon the processional denial of Continuity in the pursuit of the \"real\", or the Truth, or some kind of localisation of the universal, something that owes no debt to or shares no phenomenological relationship with anything other than itself, something that could only ever be ... self-referential. He argued that, despite our attempts to construct such phenomena, and to define our own lived experience (and our bodies) in these terms, no such phenomena exist in any objective sense because, ultimately, the observer is the observed. Everything is a part of itself, so every attempt to become \"real\" is doomed to fail, since \"real\" for Western culture involves some degree of conceptual disconnection, if only of the \"real\" from the \"unreal\". Fort didn't miss the irony of Intermediateness, the Truth that could never be, deeply appreciating The amazing paradox of it all: \n      That all things are trying to become the universal by excluding other things. That there is only this one process, and that it does animate all expressions, in all fields of phenomena, of that which we think of as one inter-continuous nexus. (Book of the Damned 9)\n      If then, upon the technological realisation of Continuity, there emerges in Western popular culture a deep obsession with the growing elusiveness of Truth (or \"reality\") accompanied by a certain degree of \"paranoia\" -- a veritable Fortean revival -- might this be attributable, at least in part, to the growing inefficacy of Truth and \"reality\" within the virtual environment of an inherently Fortean media form? \n          \n      References \n      \n Coleman, Loren. \"When Frogs Fall...\" Fortean Times 133 (2000): 49.\n              eXistenZ.

    "abstract": "\n      It's the beginning of 2000 and the 21st century is all mapped out. \n       Since we've just had that time at the end of a decade (not to mention the end of the century, as well as the Christian calendar \"millennium\"), when all the pundits came out to review where we had been and forecast where we are going, we should have expected a profundity of future-casting. But neither the familiar prognostications of the coming apocalypse spewing forth from the Religious Right, nor the usual statistical projections made by \"experts\" on such things as population growth, world politics, economic cycles, new products and shifting job markets, etc. will provide any help in reading the map we have already drawn up, or translating the directional signs. \n      The future is now. It occupies the same domain as the past. Both are inhabitants of the present moment. History, memory, desire, imagination, the creative instinct, and the impetus to act, unfold and are realised as the future becomes the present. We cannot help but tinker with the universe. The future is what we make it and there are an infinite number of possible timelines. Or maybe not. \n      It's the beginning of 2000 and the 21st century is all mapped out. The Human Genome Project1 is about to decode our physiology. We are preparing for the next evolution of the species. The battle between the cyberneticists and the geneticists for a new and improved version of homo sapiens version 3.0 has just begun. The question of where it will lead is open-ended. Will the insatiable quest for self-improvement lead to enlightenment -- a world with less suffering, hunger, disease, violence, and greed? Or, will we be the makers of our own extinction, and end up as a version of Star Trek's Borg -- the ultimate consumers, assimilating automatons devouring everything they encounter, and utterly devoid of the qualities that make us human? \n       As an example of a hypothetical biological and social future the Borg are an interesting model -- a synthesis of a utopian socialist dream and the capitalist imperative of acquisition in the information age. As organic/cybernetic humanoid machines with one unified mind, equal and undifferentiated, untroubled by ego or id, individual ambitions, desires or passions, loneliness, alienation, or imagination they are the ultimate homogeneous collective. At the same time they are both the perfect corporate entity -- masters of the merger, the hostile takeover (\"resistance is futile\"), and a mindless population programmed to consume and continually upgrade each and every new technology and product. \n           But the Borg don't invent; they only appropriate. Postmodern androids to the core! And we are presently very busy making new discoveries, creating and inventing, and transforming theories into things which tell us not only what is possible, but probable. One of the determining factors in the course of our future is whether or not our belief in technology over other values turns us into the puppets instead of the puppeteers, slaves to masters of our own invention -- be it HAL, Dr. Frankenstein's monster, or the Terminator. Let us consider some possible future scenarios, based not on fiction, but on what already exists, or is about to do so. \n      Facts \n          No one now disputes that the transformation of stem cells into new body parts, cloning technology, genetic engineering, nanotechnology, and microchip replacements not only could, but will dramatically change medicine and extend life in the coming century. In strictly medical terms, the implementation of all these technologies will bring about extraordinary relief of both the physical and psychological pain and suffering caused by debilitating, disabling, or disfiguring disease or injuries, not to mention the lives saved, and the genetic diseases prevented. \n      Current research has found that not only stem cells taken from human embryos or fetuses could be directed to grow replacements for ailing hearts, livers or other organs, but that some stem cells taken from adult tissue could be converted into other types of cells -- brain cells becoming blood cells, or bone marrow becoming liver. The application of this technology is dazzling -- transformative biology, and it is just over the horizon2. Recently, scientists announced the creation of the first artificial cornea made from human cells. It could help restore the sight of those with certain kinds of eye damage. At the same time cybernetics is playing an equally important part. In development is a mini-computer that essentially takes over damaged visual functions and projects them onto a screen. One model expected to be ready for market within three years is a version of Geordie's visor in Star Trek: Next Generation. Another is a microchip that is inserted behind the eye3. \n      In his newest book Fuzzy Future: From Society and Science to Heaven in a Chip, University of Southern California electrical engineering professor Bart Kosco, author of Fuzzy Thinking (1993), projects his theories onto everything from smart machines, the politics of genomes (who owns you, your genetic material, that is) and the environment (who owns the sea, or for that matter the air) to the problem of human mortality. Kosco foresees the day when we may be able to download our brains onto a microchip, thus achieving digital immortality via a gradual (fuzzy) transformation in which the brain's \"meat\" is replaced piece by piece with nanochips that work ever faster, better, and more creatively than old-fashioned neurons and synapses. The use of microchips to repair or replace damaged cells or portions of the brain is one thing, but as a means to greatly increase mental capacity, and gain everlasting life by \"leaving your gray matter pickled in a jar\" in favour of a computer in your skull is another. Would you still be you? \n      While researchers have currently found new molecules in the brain that play a role in creating memories and learning, it does not ensure wisdom in how we put our knowledge to work. That great benefits await us, in the prevention and treatment of disease and the disintegration due to aging, is not in dispute. Nor is the enhanced capacity of a healthier society in body and mind. What constitutes the latter is. We are still left with ethical questions about the uses of technology, and spiritual and philosophical questions about what it means to be human. What are the political and social ramifications of biotechnology? \n      British television playwright Dennis Potter's last work Cold Lazarus represents the ethical dilemmas of a future world capable of robbing a man's soul against his will. Scientists, whose funding is controlled by one or another governing media megalomaniac, seek to experience the 20th century through the genuine memories of the late Daniel Feeld, whose frozen head they have obtained. Their biochemical experiments are no less despicable than the CEO who wants to broadcast Feeld's \"consciousness\" worldwide twenty-four hours a day. Political opposition exists only in the form of a clandestine \"terrorist\" organization known as R.O.N. (Reality Or Nothing). \n      If we were to base our forecasts on the patterns of history, just such a techno-fascist corporate future awaits us. If we are to judge by the dominant values of the present, the economic priorities of the marketplace will overpower the dissenting voices, placing not only the natural environment at risk, but our social environment as well. What will such a society do about the underclasses when smart machines have taken over their work, and they haven't the means to buy our goods, only consume precious resources; that is, when they are no longer \"necessary\" to the economic system. Will they be technologically phased out or upgraded? \n      Fast Forward \n      Let's not jump too far ahead. Maybe just to 2050. You can grow your own body part replacements, not just internal organs, but muscle, nerve tissue, skin. You can rejuvenate. Living to 120 or longer will not be unusual. The manufacture of body parts will be a big biotech business. Invest now! But will this technology be available to anyone and everyone, or only those who can afford it? Will we have parts kept in cold storage ready and waiting? Organs grown from extractions of our own foetal tissue perhaps. If it is a right not a privilege, how will our society deal with the problems of overpopulation? Will only those over a certain age -- say 80 -- who are viewed as \"contributing\" or \"productive\" members of society be eligible for new organs? Or will your lifestyle and health habits be a factor? No new livers for recalcitrant unreformed alcoholics? Will there be a ranking system of qualifications? Who will decide what they will be? Never mind arms and drugs. Consider this black market in the making! Subterranean high-tech operating rooms, organ factories, contraband stem cells, DNA, \"smart\" nanochips. \n      Fast Forward \n      And what about those microchips for brain functions? Not just for disease but for self-improvement. You might be able to improve your personality the way you can have a face-lift or breast implants. Then again, microchips could replace both pharmacology and psychotherapy in the treatment of mental disease, or merely antisocial or criminally aberrant behaviour, a new form of rehabilitation. As for sheer brain power, there would be no end to your capacity to absorb information, memorize and catalogue it, or to calculate stock market transactions. And just think of the lawsuits bound to jam up the courts, should someone have the misfortune to get a faulty chip, or even one that doesn't live up to expectations. Advertising is bound to promise you the answer to your dreams. The insertion of these parts by choice is one thing, but suppose it is forced on you by a government or a corporation. Or even by a parent while you are too young to fight back, the ones who want their offspring to be a math genius, Olympic athlete, or musical prodigy. Then again, genetic engineering may take care of some of that. Babies to order. By the end of this century you might not even have to have one the old messy way. Or you might not even be allowed to. Your genetically selected child might be grown in a computer-controlled organic womb. No more unwanted pregnancies. No more crack babies, or Downs Syndrome, or spina bifida4. \n      We've been messing around for quite some time with a lot of things we don't know or haven't considered the consequences of in terms of the long term ecological balance of life and all its interdependent systems: cross-species genetic implants in plants and animals; plants altered to kill insects that are food for another creature on the food chain. And so on up the ladder: tomatoes that only look like tomatoes, but aren't really tomatoes any more. A perfect example of surface over substance. While we are so sure of our technological mastery, the actual \"apocalypse\" may well be of our own making when the forces of nature wreak havoc and pay us back for our abuses and arrogance. Or perhaps it will be nature's way of resetting the balance of things by greatly reducing the human population. Or it just might turn out this way. The newly evolved, genetically and cybernetically enhanced humanoids 3.0 survive and adapt (to 3.5), while the great mass of old humans become an endangered species like the Siberian tiger. \n      Present Tense \n      If you think this is all just science fiction, consider this. Already a number of young men in Silicon Valley or at M.I.T. walk around all day every day with one eye and ear always focused on the little headset computer screen that keeps them perpetually \"on-line\", plugged in. Do they look a little like the Borg? Well yes. Or, think about this. About a year ago a bill came up in the California state legislature proposing that a microchip be inserted in all newborn infants, like the ones you can put in your dog so you can track her if she gets lost or stolen. Same principle with babies. The bill was defeated. But very soon we will all be locatable, \"on-line\". No chance of disappearing in the 21st century when the wilderness is about to become another \"theme\" park, and when, at this very moment, you can be traced every time you use a plastic card or make a phone call. What a scary thought for dissidents, revolutionaries, battered women, or anyone who just wants to \"get away from it all\". In the 21st century, Huxley's \"savages\" would have as hard a time surviving or avoiding capture as a wolf in Arizona. How will our civil rights, our human rights be affected at the present rate of invasion into our privacy. Is your body your own? And what about your mind? What exactly will the \"right to your life\" mean? Will \"smart\" machines have that right? How will we define a sentient being? \n      And so here we are. The 21st century is all mapped out. Maps can be misread. Maps can be wrong. The place that has been charted can be changed. By a force of nature, or an act of will. Or better still, by an act of conscience or consciousness, for it is an energy force with transformative powers. We could become better in our hearts and souls. We could use our knowledge with grace. Now go out and draw a new map(s). Happy New Century!\n      \n      Footnotes \n      \nHuge advances in genomics, the science of deciphering the basic genetic pattern of life, were made in 1999, including the complete gene sequence for three microbes, a third of the base pairs in human DNA, along with one complete chromosome, number 22, and a rough draft of the entire human genome is expected by March 2000.

    "abstract": "\n      Memory depends on void,\n      as void depends on memory, to think.\n       -- Anne Carson\n      Sunday, 26th December, 1999\n      It was a peculiar ritual to perform to bring a personal end to the twentieth century. A journey through the snow to visit Egypt, at the Metropolitan Museum in Manhattan. I took two books, the latest New Yorker and the New York Times to keep me company.\n      Ancient Egyptian funeral art fascinates me. How unreadable it is. Perhaps it isn't meant to be read. If it is addressed to anyone, or anything, it isn't human. It addresses otherness itself, eternity. Serenity masks, and faces, nothingness. A reminder of how little a decade, or a century matters, even a millennium, compared to these fragments of monuments that could stare down handfuls of years in their thousands -- and still not blink.\n      As Paul Valery wrote: \"we later civilisations ... we too now know we are mortal. We had long heard tell of whole worlds that had vanished, of empires sunk without a trace, gone down with all their men and all their machines into the unexplorable depths of the centuries...\" (23). Our ancestors may have conquered space, spread ourselves thin across the bread of the earth, but Egypt conquered time. Their empires of the dead will probably still be living when the last of ours are rat food.\n      As Paul Valery wrote: \"we later civilisations ... we too now know we are mortal. We had long heard tell of whole worlds that had vanished, of empires sunk without a trace, gone down with all their men and all their machines into the unexplorable depths of the centuries...\" (23). Our ancestors may have conquered space, spread ourselves thin across the bread of the earth, but Egypt conquered time. Their empires of the dead will probably still be living when the last of ours are rat food.\n      Thanks to universal standard time, everyone could know where they stood in relation to the planet's movement. Thanks to geopositioning, everyone could know the coordinates upon the map that corresponded to the patch of earth under foot. As the world turned, an arc of humans from one latitude to another could experience the arbitrary yet somehow convincing sensation of leaving the twentieth century.\n      As the New Yorker reported: \"in a daring act of multiculturalism, the good people of Tonga rose at midnight to sing the 'Hallelujah Chorus' from Handel's Messiah\" (Lane 24). Meanwhile, in New York, the Caligula of capital George Soros offered his 250-odd guests bronze medallions featuring etched profiles of himself, and the inscription: \"Enlightened by the Past. Embraced by the present. Empowered by the future\" (Cassidy 26).\n      Y2K kept bothering me. It was all a little too much data hitting the sensoria. I tried to ignore it, to think about Egypt. I thought that if I closed my eyes to the world's turning, it would go away. It won't go away. Not any more. There is nowhere left to hide. At twilight, in the desert, your satellite phone rings. It's a telemarketer.\n      Egypt is exhausting, even at the Met. There's so many objects, so much information. I'd brought a book or two, so I could pause for coffee and make some notes. The books were by Harold Innis, that quirky old communication theorist. He's a detour, like Egypt, but he'll get us to where I want to go, to thinking media.\n     Egypt is exhausting, even at the Met. There's so many objects, so much information. I'd brought a book or two, so I could pause for coffee and make some notes. The books were by Harold Innis, that quirky old communication theorist. He's a detour, like Egypt, but he'll get us to where I want to go, to thinking media.\n      \n      A simple observation. Consider what it makes it possible to think: \"empires must be considered from the standpoint of two dimensions, those of space and time, and persist by overcoming the bias of media, which over-emphasise either dimension. They have tended to flourish under conditions in which civilisation reflects the influence of more than one medium and in which the bias of one medium toward decentralisation is offset by the bias of another toward centralisation\" (Empire 7).\n      Consider, for instance, Egypt, where: \"a concern with problems of space and time appears to have marked the beginnings of civilisation... A change from a pre-dynastic to dynastic society, or a precise recognition of time... appears to have coincided with writing, monumental architecture and sculpture\" (Bias 92). Kings and priests colonised time. \"The permanence of death became a basis of continuity through the development of the idea of immortality, preservation of the body, and development of writing in the tombs by which the magical power of the spoken word was perpetuated in pictorial representation of the funeral ritual\" (Bias 93).\n      On the one hand, \"the pyramids were an index to power over time\" (Bias 135). On the other, \"by escaping from the heavy medium of stone, thought gained lightness\" (Empire 16). The papyrus document became the means for scribes and soldiers to colonise space. These different media, with their different properties, were the basis of a flexible continuity and integrity for the empire, but also a source of conflict within it. \"The profound disturbances in Egyptian civilisation involved in the shift from absolute monarchy to a more democratic organisation coincides with a shift in emphasis on stone as a medium of communicating or as a basis of prestige, as shown in the pyramids, to an emphasis on papyrus\" (Empire 15). But it was not to last. Egypt \"failed to establish a stable compromise between a bias dependent on stone in the pyramids and a bias dependent on papyrus and hieroglyphics\" (Bias 96). \n      Failed, and yet succeeded, in replicating itself by virtue of the fascination those of us who, like Valery, see something strikingly different in the shape of this ancient space and time. There's some irony in monuments to eternity being themselves preserved at the Met. \"The emphasis of a civilisation on means of extending its duration as in Egypt accompanied by reliance on permanence gives that civilisation a prominent position in periods such as the present when time is of little significance\" (Bias 66).\n      What can you say about a civilisation that gives itself an early mark and toddles into its second millennium a year early? One in which global empires grow and merge and collapse each week on the lone and level sands of the market. Or where Danny Hillis, Silicon Valley magus, is making a monument to last out the centuries -- and it's a clock. What is to become of it all?\n      Consider this observation, by Innis, of what became of Egypt: \"we can perhaps assume that the use of a medium of communication over a long period will to some extent determine the character of knowledge to be communicated and suggest that its pervasive influence will eventually create a civilisation in which life and flexibility will become exceedingly difficult to maintain and that the advantages of a new medium will become such as to lead to the emergence of a new civilisation\" (Bias 34). The scribes and the priests, between them, ran things, and for centuries kept control of the skills to do so. This very facility became a limit, making the empire vulnerable to stagnation and conquest from without.\n      Consider how this might work out in more recent times, when monopolies guard their source code and battle against open source technologies. Innis writes that \"a simple flexible system of writing admits of adaptation to the vernacular but slowness of adaptation facilitates monopoly of knowledge and hierarchies\" (Bias 4). Microsoft write twentieth century hieroglyphics. It is an empire with an Egyptian approach to source code intended to perpetuate itself through time, even at the risk of arresting flexible and adaptive approaches to creating communication tools anywhere else.\n      Or take the lead story that greeted me over coffee in the Met's cafe: AMERICA ONLINE AGREES TO BUY TIME WARNER FOR $165 BILLION; MEDIA DEAL IS RICHEST MERGER (New York Times 11 Jan 2000). This is the way of things now. Vigorous new empires annex old Egypts in a burst of press release fireworks. Empires that straddle continents but are not built to last much longer than London's Millennium Dome, structures held aloft by tensed steel cables, built to be seen on television by distant cousins by not by any descendants.\n      We may have left the twentieth century, but has it left us? Its ruins lie about us, persisting, insisting. Its miniature monuments lie in the landfill of memory. So many new ways that were discovered, during the century, for impressing the century on memory. Perhaps that's why so little of its architecture is built to last. The great pyramid of Las Vegas is an image preserved in a million snapshots.\n      The monument has become something miniature, even molecular. Exotic pesticide residues now shop up in Antarctic penguins. As Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari write: \"a monument does not commemorate or celebrate something that happened but confides to the ear of the future the persistent sensations that embody the event\" (176). Perhaps Innis is wrong about this civilisation. It looks like its bias is towards the colonising of space, but in its own way it has colonised time, too. It communicates its chaos, its blind will to creative destruction, through the pulverising of every last particle of the earth. The twentieth century's answer to the pyramids, it's ongoing contributions to civilisation, are the death factories of the Holocaust and the negative architecture of the bombing of Hiroshima.\n      And yet, those memories aside, it was also the century in which for the first time one glimpses a possible life outside the monopoly of knowledge by priests and scribes, where no matter how hard they try, empires can no longer control for millennia the flows of information that allow them to colonise space and time. I'm tempted to say that if Egypt lives on in the Book of the Dead, our time will live on as a Book of the Undead. It left its mark by mummifying nothing except change itself. But the book is one of the things the twentieth century changed too. As Friedrich Kittler writes, \"as long as the book was responsible for all serial data flows, words quivered with sensuality and memory\" (10).\n      But the book has lost its sovereignty. The scribes and priests and scholars who monopolised knowledge and prestige through mastery of textual codes are going the way of their Egyptian precursors, into the museums.\n          \n      References  \n      \nCassidy, John. \"The Well-Heeled and the Wonky Toast the Millennium.\" New Yorker 17 Jan. 2000: Deleuze, Gilles, and Félix Guattari.

    "abstract": "\n      Most investigations of language use in the computer-mediated communication (CMC) systems colloquially known as 'chat rooms' are based on studies of chat rooms in which English is the predominant language. This study begins to redress that bias by investigating language use in a Swedish text-based chat room. Do Swedish chat participants just adopt strategies adapted to suit the needs of written online conversation, or is Swedish written language being developed in analogy with adaptations that can be observed in 'international' chat rooms?\n      As is now well known, text-based chat rooms provide a means for people to converse in near real time with very little delay between messages. As a written form of interaction, there is no possibility of sending simultaneous non-verbal information, and while the minimal delay gives the interaction a more conversational feel, the conversants must struggle with the time pressure of combining a slow message production system with rapid transmission-reception.\n      Several strategies have been developed in order to ease the strain of writing and to convey more information than written symbols normally allow (Werry; Witmer &amp; Katzman; Hård af Segerstad, \"Emoticons\"). A number of strategies have been developed to suit the needs of CMC, some of which we recognise from traditional writing, but perhaps use more generously in the new environment. Well known and internationally recognised strategies used to compensate for the lack of non-verbal or non-vocal signals include providing analogies for vocalisations adopted in order to compensate for the effort of typing and time pressure:\n      \n      \nSmileys (or emoticons): Smileys are combinations of keyboard characters which attempt to resemble facial expressions, eg. ;) (or simple objects such as roses). These are mostly placed at the end of a sentence as an aid to interpret the emotional state of the sender; \n        Surrounding words with *asterisks* (or a number of variants, such as underscores (_word_)). As with smileys, asterisks may be used to indicate the emotional state of the sender (eg. *smiles*, *s*), and also to convey an action (*waves*, *jumps up and down*); \n        In some systems, different fonts and colours may be used to express emotions. \n        Capitals, unorthodox spelling and mixing of cases in the middle of words and Extreme use of punctuation marks may all be used to convey analogies to prosodic phenomena such as intonation, tone of voice, emphasis (\"you IDIOT\"); \n        Abbreviations and acronyms: some are traditional, others new to the medium; \n        Omission of words: ellipsis, grammatical function words; and, \n        Little correction of typographical errors -- orthography or punctuation -- and little traditional use of mixed cases (eg. capitals at the beginning of sentences), and punctuation. \n      \nMethod\n      This study compares and contrasts data from a questionnaire and material from a logged chat channel. The investigation began with a questionnaire, inquiring into the habits and preferences of Swedish students communicating on the Internet. 333 students (164 females and 169 males) answered the questionnaire that was sent to five upper secondary schools (students aged 16-18), and two lower secondary schools (students aged 13-15). Subjects were asked for three kinds of information: (a) examples of the strategies mentioned above and whether they used these when chatting online, (b) which languages were used in everyday communication and in chat rooms, and (c) the names of favourite chat rooms. One of the most popular public chat rooms turned out to be one maintained by a Swedish newspaper. Permission was obtained to log material from this chat room. The room may be accessed at: &lt;http://nychat.aftonbladet.se/webchat/oppenkanal/Entren.php&gt;.\n      A 'bot (from 'robot', a program that can act like a user on an IRC network) was used to log the time, sender and content of contributions in the room. In order to get a large data set and to record the spread of activity over the most part of a week, approximately 120 hours of logging occurred, six days and nights in succession. During this period 4 293 users ('unique pseudonyms'), from 278 different domains provided 47 715 contributions in total (410 355 total utterances). The logged material was analysed, using the automated search tool TRASA (developed by Leif Gronqvist -- Dept. of Linguistics, Göteborg University, Sweden).\n      Results\n      The language used in the chat room was mainly Swedish. Apart from loan words (in some cases with the English spelling intact, in other cases adapted to Swedish spelling), English phrases (often idiomatic) showed up occasionally, sometimes in the middle of a Swedish sentence. Some examples of contributions are shown, extracted from their original context. (Note: Instances of Nordic letters in the examples have been transformed into the letters 'a' and 'o' respectively.)\n      \n        Table 1.

However, while these were similar to those observed in international chat rooms, the most interesting finding was that Swedish teenagers do not just copy that behaviour from the international chat rooms that they have visited: the examples of creative and new abbreviations are made up in comparison with the innovative English net-abbreviations, but based on Swedish words. A number of different types of abbreviations emerged:\n      \n      \nAcronyms made up from the first letters in a phrase (eg. \"istf\", meaning \"i stallet for\" [trans. \"instead of\"]); \n        Numbers representing the sound value of a syllable in combination with letters (eg. \"3vligt\" meaning \"trevligt\" [trans. \"nice\"]); and, \n        Letters representing the sound value of a syllable in combination with other letters forming an abbreviated representation of a word (eg. \"CS\" meaning \"(vi) ses\" [trans. \"see (you)\"]). \n      \nThe logged chat material showed that all of the strategies, both Swedish and English, mentioned in the questionnaire were actually used online. The Swedish strategies mentioned in the questionnaire are illustrated in Table 2.\n      \n        Table 2.

Ferrara et al.). They do not just copy behaviour and strategies that they observe in international chat rooms that they have visited, but adapt these to suit the Swedish language. As well as saving time and effort typing, and apart from conveying non-verbal information, it would appear that these communication strategies are also used as a way of signalling and identifying oneself as 'cyber-regulars' -- people who know the game, so to speak. At this stage of research, beyond the use of Swedish language by Swedish nationals, there is nothing to indicate that the adaptations found are significantly different to online adaptations of English or French (cf. Werry). This result calls for further research on the specifics of Swedish adaptations.\n          \n      References\n      \nAllwood, Jens. \"An Activity Based Approach to Pragmatics.\" Gothenburg Papers in Theoretical Linguistics 76.

    "abstract": "\n      For some time, I have been concerned with uses and abuses of the future, how the exchange of temporally loaded language through conversation and text affects the pace, moods and behaviour of individuals, communities, cultures and civilisations. I am equally curious about Christianity which as a narrative structure begins with creation but awaits a conclusion. Whether it is religions announcing ten-point plans to attain paradise quickly, or cults encouraging group passes to heaven through suicide, it is the future end that counts. Whether it be ego-theologists -- as I prefer to call those pastors who proclaim the 'you are/they are god' creed -- scalping spiritual quick-fixes at the local entertainment centre, with a McDonald's-like serving of 'Would you like a blessing with that?', or the visiting soulwinner from New South Wales distributing 'Mark of the Beast' warning pamphlets, the future conclusion of the Christian narrative plays the lead. \n      I cannot disguise my discomfort with the salvation franchises or merchants who market pre-fabricated responses to the Christian apocalyptic narrative, curiously shaped by contemporary circumstances, and who profit excessively from such business. Many times I wonder what dubious purposes their perception of the future is put to. Surviving Armageddon, it appears, can provide a diverse source of mobilisation for many. With such prominence in the everyday topics of public and mainstream dialogue, our age is the first historical period where the marginal phenomenon of apocalyptism has moved from the edge of society to its present-day popular near-centre. Money, I dare say, is made from such a shift. \n      Ego-theologists are keen to boast the vices of contemporary society that are bringing apocalypse while conveniently offering the hefty-priced product that upon purchase will begin the process of surviving the end. \n       It is no accident that the narrower the definition of salvation, the more specialised the rituals for attaining it, the qualifications for distributing it and the exclusivity for keeping it. Such restrictions place the power of salvation into the hands of a small number of people who make available -- upon specialised or ritualised request -- the means to lease it. I use the word lease because salvation is never completely settled. Instead, a symbolic contract is achieved between the franchise and the seeker in which salvation is conveyed to the seeker for a specified period but usually in exchange for membership and often mental and financial obligation. If the seeker breaks the contract, salvation is lost. Jehovah's Witnesses call this act of severance 'disfellowshipping' and the seeker is designated by continuing followers of Watchtower as an 'apostate', as one against the almighty creator. Many ex-witnesses are emotionally scared by this devastating, violent act of seemingly removing salvation. \n           In this sense, a small elite using exclusive language and narrow definitions and who therefore monopolise the forms and the senses of achieving salvation habitually frame salvation and the rituals of being saved from a monstrous future. Who benefits and who is disempowered by the agenda being set in this manner? Why are only selected people able to lease directions to the road of salvation with maps that periodically imply the master planner has changed compass, be it the secular salvation from ecological doom or theological salvation from the damnable mark of the beast? \n          Saving a person from the antichrist has today become a robust industry. Religious entrepreneurs proliferate their scriptural shandies and spiritual quick-fixes to the middle-class disheartened with the expertise of experienced confidence tricksters and the finesse of door-to-door selling. Subscribe to a local salvation franchise of the 'gospel of wealth' variety found marketing in the early morning hours of Australian televangelism and a continual stream of ministrations will arrive in the mail replete with US postage markings and external messages warning you and your postie: 'This envelope contains important information the devil hopes you will never find out!', 'Eight things you need to know before the new millennium', 'Has Y2K plunged us into a countdown to chaos? Don't panic -- prepare and trust God!' or 'Unleash the power of your faith!'. \n      Content will vary across a range of marketable approaches. Two recent postings I received from the same franchise respectively presented a 4-5 page personalised letter requesting I purchase 'dynamic ministry materials' like Your Y2K New Millennium Survival Personal Library Kit for an appropriate 'seed harvest' of $165.99. This reflected fair market value, naturally, on 'powerful' items including The Antichrist: 666 video, a three audio tape set called End Time Signs and the Book of Revelation Comic Book. \n      An explanation sheet was also included for explaining the rituals required to activate an enclosed 'miracle touch' 2-inch square cloth, apparently anointed -- touched in a supernatural way -- by a special class of persons self-identified as 'prayer warriors'. Some packages have reflected telegram-style formatting to 'emphasize the great URGENCY' felt by a pastor 'that many of you may be on the verge of falling apart or feeling absolutely overwhelmed by fear, anger, depression, rejection, worry' and who desperately require a newly-released 'powerful book of wisdom' to overcome personal tribulation and to successfully 'rebuke the devil'. \n      Often, correspondence signed from the pastor displays these excesses of individual concern, claims of divine new revelation blended with unbiblical doses of numerological deduction. The accompanying letter to my Y2K Personal Request Sheet begins: 'Dear Jason, you are now reading a letter that had to be sent to you ... Yes, the Lord told me to prepare this ... He gave me a vivid, supernatural glimpse of the miracle difference this one letter could make in your life ... especially in this year of 1999 ... See it as your year of double fruitfulness'. \n      What role does this type of 'future-thinking' and others play in Australian forms of hope and expectation? Can we establish a discourse of ethics regarding the use or abuse of future mythology? And how might we engage studies of the future in the historical and sociological disciplines which would see the future as itself: a theory with very particular ideological and metaphysical investments; an address to the present, transforming it into the fulfillment of the future we aim to aspire to; and, often, as a tool or weapon which has been waved about for some form of gain? \n      To answer these questions requires us to place ourselves in a position to see something of the design and construction of contemporary futures as an invented thing with specific limitations. \n      George Orwell's famous and relevant exploration of the future in 1984 is the story of Winston Smith's rebellion against the Party, of his hatred towards Big Brother and the thoughtcrime. On page thirty-four, Winston reflects on the perpetual state of war that has existed between Oceania and Eurasia: 'The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliance with Eurasia ... But where did that knowledge exist? Only in his own consciousness ... if all the others accepted the lie which the party imposed if all records told the same tale, then the lie passed into history and became truth. \"Who controls the past,\" ran the Party slogan, \"controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.\" It was quite simple. All that was needed was an unending series of victories over your own memory. \"Reality control,\" they called it; in Newspeak, \"doublethink.\"' \n      Transposing the direction of Orwell's commentary, from a control of knowledge about the past to a monopoly control of future mythology, provides more than just an occasional point. To paraphrase, I would like to suggest that: 'Who controls the future controls the present. And that all is needed is an unending series of victories over your imagination'. In futurespeak, that is, the language and discursive strategies used to talk and think about the future, I call this 'thinkphobia'. \n      Alvin Toffler, in his successful sociological trilogy, describes the cultural fallout from overchoice and the dangerous discrepancies between society's technological accelerative thrust and the pace of our individual adaptive abilities. This peculiar state results in what Toffler defines as future shock; that is, an overload of our individual decision-making processes from the demands of choice that we simply cannot tolerate. Thinkphobia, as an analogy to thoughtcrime, is one step removed: it is the fear we develop of choice, of options in the future and it is not, I suspect, limited to doomsayers. \n      For members of Watchtower (Jehovah's Witnesses), the present is probed only in the interests of the future and they project only one intended and necessary future, squashing coherent, intellectual responses to it, closing alternatives to active public and popular debate. The future as promoted by Watchtower is totalist, monocultural, and biblically sealed, closed to individual modification, to the extent that a handbook 'Reasoning from the Scriptures' can provide the dialogue that accompanies their knock at your door. But, I wonder, are the future-systems of our societies any different in their application? \n      What I'm suggest here is that the secular billions of people today who are either implicitly or explicitly coerced to reckon the future and time in ways they did not choose is highly questionable. While we may scoff at the witness who has their dialogue mapped out and a sense of the future pre-structured for them, should we ourselves spend much time exchanging talk about things called the 'millennium' and the year 2000, encouraging other cultures to share our enthusiasm, much like a cultist would promote their pattern of future for emulating? In other words, when our societies are diversifying culturally, socially and intellectually, why is our concept of the future homogenising, almost, dare I suggest, in cultic mimicry? \n      The approach of the year 2000/2001AD seems to evoke excess response from Christian groups throughout Australia. But can a culture of apocalypse or a cult of the future -- that is, a philosophically sealed community deriving identity from its expectation of doom in the future -- be limited to popular, extra-societal ideas of cult? \n      A 'cult of the future' could be described as a community of people, which embraces a particular system of linear time reckoning as part of its cultural and/or social code, which encourages (either explicitly or implicitly) and sustains specialised activity as supplication to some qualitative or quantitative 'future'. A 'cult of the future', to draw from sociological literature, does not adhere to the possibility of unforeseen occurrence but rather devotes itself to a presumed unalterable and necessary future to which all current activity and thought seems conditional upon it. \n      I wonder whether the term 'cult of the future' can be applied to a whole society and not just to the small evangelical cult based in the outer suburbs, which studiously awaits the end of the world. Can a cult of the future, traditionally applied to an unconventional extra-societal gathering, include society itself? How our societies conceive of the future may be different in content and style to evangelical and theological communities, but could the aim be similar? Whether it is a social reformer or a cult leader, is the process the same in the way future mythology is constructed? Could future-oriented systems conceivably sit alongside the systems of more controversial groups like Heaven's Gate or Jehovah's Witnesses as related efforts of installing pre-organised future-mythology into the mindset of a group of receptive people? \n      To interrogate the monopolisation of future mythology by the leading mythmakers and the salvation merchants, whose greatest tool is the rumour of what we fear and whose largest assets are the hopes of seekers, is to begin reclaiming responsibility about the future. It is to reclaim meaning for an individual long-term present that would otherwise be lonely in the crowd of social, commercial and regulated short-term futures. Futures thinking should encourage us to ponder what part of ourselves goes on to the future and it should initiate a strong sense of responsibility to prospective generations: it should not invite us to consider what books or tapes to purchase in order to survive the various doomsday scenarios marketed at us. \n      To interrogate the monopolisation of future mythology by the leading mythmakers and the salvation merchants, whose greatest tool is the rumour of what we fear and whose largest assets are the hopes of seekers, is to begin reclaiming responsibility about the future. It is to reclaim meaning for an individual long-term present that would otherwise be lonely in the crowd of social, commercial and regulated short-term futures. Futures thinking should encourage us to ponder what part of ourselves goes on to the future and it should initiate a strong sense of responsibility to prospective generations: it should not invite us to consider what books or tapes to purchase in order to survive the various doomsday scenarios marketed at us. \n      \n      Citation reference for this article \n      MLA style:\n      \n Jason Ensor. \"666 Ways to Ambush the Future.\" M/C: A Journal of Media and Culture 2.9 (2000).

    "abstract": "\n      \n        Could we also imagine a language in which a person could write down or\n                give vocal expression to his inner experiences -- his feelings, moods, and\n                the rest -- for his private use? Well, can't we do so in our ordinary\n                language? -- But that is not what I mean. The individual words of this\n                language are to refer to what can only be known to the person speaking; to\n                his immediate private sensations. So another person cannot understand the\n                language.\n                 -- Ludwig Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations par. 243\n\n              I will be using 'audience' in two ways in the following essay: as a\n                phenomenon that produces and is produced by media technologies (readers,\n                hearers, viewers, Internet-users), and as something, audiens, that is\n                essential to language itself, something without which language cannot be. \n                I shall do so in specific references to invented languages. Who, then, are\n                the 'consumers' of invented languages? \n              In referring to invented languages, I am not talking about speakers of\n                Esperanto or Occidental; I am not concerned with the invention of\n                international auxiliary languages. These projects, already well-debated,\n                have roots that go back at least as far as the 17th-century language\n                philosophers who were at pains to undo the damage of Babel and restore a\n                common language to the world. While Esperanto never became what it\n                intended to be, it at least has readers and speakers. \n              I am also not even talking about speakers of Klingon or Quenya. These\n                privately invented languages have had the good fortune to be attached to\n                popular invented cultures, and to media with enough money and publicity to\n                generate a multitude of fans. \n              Rather, I am talking about a phenomenon on the Internet and in a well-\n                populated listserv whereby a number of people from all over the globe have\n                discovered each other on-line. They all have a passion for what Jeffrey\n                Schnapp calls uglossia ('no-language', after utopia, 'no-place'). Umberto\n                Eco calls it 'technical insanity' or glottomania. Linguist Marina\n                Yaguello calls language inventors fous du langage ('language lunatics') in\n                her book of the same title. Jeffrey Henning prefers the term 'model\n                language' in his on-line newsletter: 'miniaturized versions that provide\n                the essence of something'. On CONLANG, people call themselves conlangers\n                (from 'constructed language') and what they do conlanging. By forming\n                this list, they have created a media audience for themselves, in the first\n                sense of the term, and also literally in the second sense, as a number of\n                them are setting up soundbytes on their elaborately illustrated and\n                explicated Webpages. \n              Originally devoted to advocates for international auxiliary languages,\n                CONLANG started out about eight years ago, and as members joined who were\n                less interested in the politics than in the hobby of language invention,\n                the list has become almost solely the domain of the latter, whereas the\n                'auxlangers', as they are called, have moved to another list. An\n                important distinguishing feature of 'conlangers' is that, unlike the\n                'auxlangers', there is no sustained hope that their languages will have a\n                wide-body of hearers or users. They may wish it, but they do not advocate\n                for it, and as a consequence their languages are free to be a lot weirder,\n                whereas the auxlangs tend to strive for regularity and useability. \n              CONLANG is populated by highschool, college, and graduate students;\n                linguists; computer programmers; housewives; librarians; professors; and\n                other users worldwide. The old debate about whether the Internet has\n                become the 'global village' that Marshall McLuhan predicted, or whether it\n                threatens to atomise communication 'into ever smaller worlds where\n                enthusiasms mutate into obsessions', as Jeff Salamon warns, seems\n                especially relevant to a study of CONLANG whose members indulge in an\n                invention that by its very nature excludes the casual listener-in. \n              And yet the audio-visual capacities of the Internet, along with its speed\n                and efficiency of communication, have made it the ideal forum for\n                conlangers. Prior to the Web, how were fellow inventors to know that\n                others were doing -- in secret? J.R.R. Tolkien has been lauded as a rare\n                exception in the world of invention, but would his elaborate linguistic\n                creations have become so famous had he not published The Lord of the Rings\n                and its Appendix? Poignantly, he tells in \"A Secret Vice\" about\n                accidentally overhearing another army recruit say aloud: 'Yes! I think I\n                shall express the accusative by a prefix!'. Obviously, silent others\n                besides Tolkien were inventing languages, but they did not have the means\n                provided by the Internet to discover one another except by chance. \n              Tolkien speaks of the 'shyness' and 'shame' attached to this pursuit,\n                where 'higher developments are locked in secret places'. It can win no\n                prizes, he says, nor make birthday presents for aunts. His choice of\n                title (\"A Secret Vice\") echoes a Victorian phrase for the closet, and\n                conlangers have frequently compared conlanging to homosexuality, both\n                being what conservative opinion expects one to grow out of after puberty. \n                The number of gay men on the list has been wondered at as more than\n                coincidental. In a survey I conducted in October 1998, many of the\n                contributors to CONLANG felt that the list put them in touch with an\n                audience that provided them with intellectual and emotional feedback. \n                Their interests were misunderstood by parents, spouses, lovers, and\n                employers alike, and had to be kept under wraps. Most of those I surveyed\n                said that they had been inventing a language well before they had heard of\n                the list; that they had conceived of what they were doing as unique or\n                peculiar, until discovery of CONLANG; and that other people's Websites\n                astounded them with the pervasive fascination of this pursuit. \n              There are two ways to look at it: conlanging, as Henning writes, may be\n                as common and as humanly creative as any kind of model-making, i.e.,\n                dollhouses, model trains, role-playing, or even the constructed cultures\n                with city plans and maps in fantasy novels such as Terry Pratchett's\n                Discworld. The Web is merely a means to bring enthusiasts together. Or it\n                may provide a site that, with the impetus of competition and showmanship,\n                encourages inutile and obsessive activity. Take your pick. From\n                Hildegard von Bingen's Lingua Ignota to Dante's Inferno and the babbling\n                Nimrod to John Dee's Enochian and on, invented languages have smacked of\n                religious ecstacy, necromancy, pathology, and the demonic. Twin speech,\n                or 'pathological idioglossia', was dramatised by Jodie Foster in Nell. \n                Hannah Green's 'Language of Yr' was the invention of her schizophrenic\n                protagonist in I Never Promised You a Rose Garden. Language itself is the\n                centre of furious theoretical debate. Despite the inventive 'deformities'\n                it is put to in poetry, punning, jest, singing, and lying, human language,\n                our most 'natural' of technologies, is a social machine, used by\n                multitudes and expected to get things done. It is expected of language\n                that it be understood and that it have not only hearers but also\n                answerers. All human production is founded on this assumption. A\n                language without an audience of other speakers is no language. 'Why\n                aren't you concentrating on real languages?' continues to be the most\n                stinging criticism. \n              Audience is essential to Wittgenstein's remark quoted at the beginning of\n                this essay. Wittgenstein posits his 'private languages theory' as a kind\n                of impossibility: all natural languages, because they exist by consensus,\n                can only refer to private experience externally. Hence, a truly private\n                language, devoted to naming 'feelings and moods' which the subject has\n                never heard about or shared with others, is impossible among socialised\n                speakers who are called upon to define subjective experience in public\n                terms. His is a critique of solipsism, a charge often directed at\n                language inventors. But very few conlangers that I have encountered are\n                making private languages in Wittgenstein's sense, because most of them are\n                interested in investing their private words with public meaning, even when\n                they are doing it privately. For them, it is audience, deeply desireable,\n                that has been impossible until now. \n              Writing well before the development of CONLANG, Yaguello takes the stance\n                that inventing a language is an act of madness. 'Just look at the lunatic\n                in love with language', she writes:\n               sitting in his book-lined study, he collects great piles of information,\n  he collates and classifies it, he makes lists and fills card indexes. He\n  is in the clutches of a denominatory delirium, of a taxonomic madness. \n  He\n  has to name everything, but before being able to name, he has to\n  recognize\n  and classify concepts, to enclose the whole Universe in a system of\n  notation: produce enumerations, hierarchies, and paradigms.\n              She is of course describing John Wilkins, whose Real Character and\n                Universal Language in 1668 was an attempt to make each syllable of his\n                every invented word denote its placement in a logical scheme of\n                classification. 'A lunatic ambition', Yaguello pronounces, because it\n                missed the essential quality of language: that its signs are arbitrary,\n                practical, and changeable, so as to admit neologism and cultural\n                difference. But Yaguello denounces auxiliary language makers in general\n                as amateurs 'in love with language and with languages, and ignorant of the\n                science of language'. Her example of 'feminine' invention comes from\n                Helene Smith, the medium who claimed to be channeling Martian (badly\n                disguised French). One conlanger noted that Yaguello's chapter entitled\n                'In Defence of Natural Languages' reminded him of the US Federal 'Defense\n                of Marriage Act', whereby the institution of heterosexual marriage is\n                'defended' from homosexual marriage. Let homosexuals marry or lunatics\n                invent language, and both marriage and English (or French) will come\n                crashing to the ground. \n              Schnapp praises Yaguello's work for being the most comprehensive\n                examination of the phenomenon to date, but neither he nor she addresses\n                linguist Suzette Haden Elgin's creative work on Láadan, a language\n                designed for women, or even Quenya or Klingon -- languages that have\n                acquired at least an audience of readers. Schnapp is less condemnatory\n                than Yaguello, and interested in seeing language inventors as the\n                'philologists of imaginary worlds', 'nos semblables, nos frères, nos\n                soeurs' -- after all. Like Yaguello, he is given to some generalities:\n                imaginary languages are 'infantile': 'the result is always [my emphasis]\n                an \"impoverishment\" of the natural languages in question: reduced to a\n                limited set of open vowels [he means \"open syllables\"], prone to syllabic\n                reduplication and to excessive syntactical parallelisms and symmetries'. \n                To be sure, conlangs will never replicate the detail and history of a real\n                language, but to call them 'impoverishments of the natural languages'\n                seems as strange as calling dollhouses 'impoverishments of actual houses'.\n                Why this perception of threat or diminishment? The critical, academic\n              \"audience\" for language invention has come largely from non-language\n                inventors and it is woefully uninformed. It is this audience that\n                conlangers dislike the most: the outsiders who cannot understand what they\n                are doing and who belittle it. \n              The field, then, is open to re-examination, and the recent phenomenon of\n                conlanging is evidence that the art of inventing languages is neither\n                lunatic nor infantile. But if one is not Tolkien or a linguist supported\n                by the fans of Star Trek, how does one justify the worthwhile nature of\n                one's art? Is it even art if it has an audience of one ... its artist? \n              Conlanging remains a highly specialised and technical pursuit that is, in\n                the end, deeply subjective. Model builders and map-makers can expect\n                their consumers to enjoy their products without having to participate in\n                the minutia of their building. Not so the conlanger, whose consumer must\n                internalise it, and who must understand and absorb complex linguistic\n                concepts. It is different in the world of music. The Cocteau Twins,\n                Bobby McFerrin in his Circle Songs, Lisa Gerrard in Duality, and the new\n                group Ekova in Heaven's Dust all use 'nonsense' words set to music --\n                either to make songs that sound like exotic languages or to convey a kind\n                of melodic glossolalia. Knowing the words is not important to their\n                hearers, but few conlangers yet have that outlet, and must rely on text\n                and graphs to give a sense of their language's structure. To this end,\n                then, these are unheard, unaudienced languages, existing mostly on screen.\n                A few conlangers have set their languages to music and recorded them. What\n                they are doing, however, is decidedly different from the extempore of\n                McFerrin. Their words mean something, and are carefully worked out\n                lexically and grammatically. \n              So What Are These Conlangs Like?\n              On CONLANG and their links to Websites you will find information on\n                almost every kind of no-language imaginable. Some sites are text only;\n                some are lavishly illustrated, like the pages for Denden, or they feature\n                a huge inventory of RealAudio and MP3 files, like The Kolagian Languages,\n                or the songs of Teonaht. Some have elaborate scripts that the newest\n                developments in fontography have been able to showcase. Some, like Tokana\n                and Amman-Iar, are the result of decades of work and are immensely\n                sophisticated. Valdyan has a Website with almost as much information about\n                the 'conculture' as the conlang. Many are a posteriori languages, that\n                is, variations on natural languages, like Brithenig (a mixture of the\n                features of Brythonic and Romance languages); others are a priori --\n                starting from scratch -- like Elet Anta. \n              Many conlangers strive to make their languages as different from European\n                paradigms as possible. If imaginary languages are bricolages, as Schnapp\n                writes, then conlangers are now looking to Tagalog, Basque, Georgian,\n                Malagasay, and Aztec for ideas, instead of to Welsh, Finnish, and Hebrew,\n                languages Tolkien drew upon for his Elvish. \"Ergative\" and \"trigger\"\n                languages are often preferred to the \"nominative\" languages of Europe. \n                Some people invent for sheer intellectual challenge; others for the beauty\n                and sensuality of combining new and privately meaningful sounds. \n              There are many calls for translation exercises, one of the most popular\n                being 'The Tower of Babel' (Genesis 10: 1-9). The most recent innovation,\n                and one that not only showcases these languages in all their variety but\n                provides an incentive to learn another conlanger's conlang, is the\n                Translation Relay Game: someone writes a short poem or composition in his\n                or her language and sends it with linguistic information to someone else,\n                who sends a translation with directions to the next in line all the way\n                around again, like playing 'telephone'. The permutations that the Valdyan\n                Starling Song went through give good evidence that these languages are not\n                just relexes, or codes, of natural languages, but have their own\n                linguistic, cultural, and poetic parameters of expression. They differ\n                from real languages in one important respect that has bearing on my\n                remarks about audience: very few conlangers have mastered their languages\n                in the way one masters a native tongue. These creations are more like\n                artefacts (several have compared it to poetry) than they are like\n                languages. One does not live in a dollhouse. One does not normally think\n                or speak in one's conlang, much less speak to another, except through a\n                laborious process of translation. \n              It remains to a longer cultural and sociolinguistic study (underway) to\n                tease out the possibilities and problems of conlanging: why it is done,\n                what does it satisfy, why so few women do it, what are its demographics,\n                or whether it can be turned to pedagogical use in a 'hands-on', high-\n                participation study of language. In this respect, CONLANG is one of the\n                'coolest' of on-line media. Only time will show what direction conlanging\n                and attitudes towards it will take as the Internet becomes more powerful\n                and widely used. \n              Will the Internet democratise, and eventually make banal, a pursuit that\n                has until now been painted with the romantic brush of lunacy and secrecy?\n                (You can currently download LangMaker, invented by Jeff Henning, to help\n                you construct your own language.) Or will it do the opposite and make\n                language and linguistics -- so often avoided by students or reduced in\n                university programs -- inventive and cutting edge? (The inventor of Tokana\n                has used in-class language invention as a means to study language\n                typology.) Now that we have it, the Internet at least provides conlangers\n                with a place to hang their logodaedalic tapestries, and the technology for\n                some of them to be heard. \n              \n          \n              References\n              \nVon Bingen, Hildegard.

    "abstract": "\n      Different forms of transport have always had different effects on the cityscape, landscape, nationscape and airscape. Modes of moving from A to B have consumed, manipulated and divided this space, often requiring other activities to operate around it. This division is seen most obviously in roads and their effect on community (see for example The Castle), but also in other scapes such as the control of airspace through flight paths which has had a marked effect on, for example, the migratory flight paths of birds. With the adoption of new transport technologies, scapes are manipulated to accommodate the needs of this technology. The bicycle is an interesting example of a technology, which in its popularity last century began to affect the architecture of the landscape, before the automobile left its indelible imprint. With the disenchantment with cars in the Western world, it is interesting to ponder on the effect that bicycles are now having with the resurgence of their popularity. At this point, it must be noted that this is a purely Western orientated study and it would be worthwhile comparing these spatial effects to the scapes in a highly cycle-dominated country such as China.\n      The popularity of bicycles peaked in the 1880-90s (Bardou et al. 7). This craze was partly due to the attraction of the technology, but also due to an associated sense of freedom and escape. This attitude to the bicycle is expressed in H.G. Wells's novella, Wheels of Chance (based in 1895) where the main character, a draper called Mr Hoopdriver, undertakes a cycling tour of the south coast of England. Freedom takes on two meanings -- firstly, Mr Hoopdriver finds a sense of freedom in being able to escape from his mundane life and travel the long distances solo and in a shorter time. He also observes another type of freedom in the form of the Young Lady in Grey who is also on a cycling tour. Mr Hoopdriver is shocked to see a woman exerting herself physically and wearing pants, yet realises that there is no question of women cycling side saddle wearing a skirt. It seems that in this form of transport, the emancipation of women progresses a little further. This freedom led to the enormous popularity of bicycles and as a result, bicycle organisations began to petition for the improvement and expansion of roads which were in a poor state due to the use of horses (Fink 8). And so bicycles began to impose their needs on the landscape and with the expansion of road networks, the landscape was altered markedly. Interestingly enough, these roadworks were one factor which led to the bicycle's demise in popularity and the accelerated manufacture of cars (Bardou et al. 9).\n      At the time that roads were being improved, farmers in the United States were becoming distressed by the railway's monopolised power over mass transport. Due to the improved roads, the agricultural industry pushed towards using these roads for transporting produce. A number of automobiles had been designed and tested since Leonardo da Vinci first sketched the idea. 1860-90 had seen a number of reasonable size steam engines which had reasonable power/weight radio, and an electric car, invented by William Morrison (US) in 1890, had a running time of 13 hours at 14 mph (Fink 9). However, it was the internal combustion engine that revolutionised this form of transport, and it did not take long before the utopia was conceived. Not only could cars move faster than a horse and cart, they were originally deemed cleaner and healthier, according to an 1899 article from the Scientific American:\n      The improvement in city conditions by the general adoption of the motorcar can hardly be overestimated. Streets clean, dustless and odourless, with light rubber tired vehicles moving swiftly and noiselessly over the smooth expanse, would eliminate a greater part of the nervousness, distraction, and strain of modern metropolitan life. (Conyngton 19660)\n      There existed some initial resistance to the introduction of cars. Pedestrians, horse owners and cyclists began to feel that their road space was being impinged upon and speed laws were introduced to attempt to counteract the fanaticism (Flink 25). However, little could be done to dissuade the masses about the benefits of the car. \n      Given the car's enormous popularity and the spatial needs of this vehicle, it is interesting to consider the architectural changes to the city and landscapes necessary to account for the requirements of the car. As the rail trucks needed tracks, so too the cars needed roads. Already existing roads in cities were altered significantly and in particular, enormous amounts of money were injected into building highways to link major cities. Examples of these projects are the now defunct Highway Trust Fund in the United States and the Pacific Highway system in Australia. These roads have always been built with great opposition from people whose homes or land were rezoned for use by governing bodies. The consumption and division of established city scapes to accommodate for the cars' needs has severely altered the spatial priorities. Leavitt (1970) suggests that previously cohesive neighbourhoods have become socially and spatially divided as a result. Small corner stores have closed down due to bypasses, neighbours cannot visit each other on foot due to uncrossable motorways, animals are killed as a result of normal routes being intersected by highways, and the airscape has become dominated by the engine fumes especially in places such as Mexico City.\n      On a larger scale, it may be suggested that cars has had scape-altered effects on a national and transnational level. The rise of the use of motorised transport can be considered in conjunction with the growing popularity of communication systems, more specifically at this time, the telephone. Both the car and the telephone have changed the perception of space between previously distant neighbours. Travelling time and communication time have decreased as a result of the use of these devices, resulting in a greater unification of the nation state. The negative corollary to this is the disintegration of these nation states through war. The use of cars and the expanded and improved highway systems had devastating effects in World War II. The increased mobilisation of soldiers and weaponry increased the efficiency of destruction, resulting in razed city and landscapes and a shift in national borders and nation space.\n      Thus the demands of cars have altered these scapes and subsequently dictate the use of this space. It may be suggested that the car no longer is a tool for humans, but tends to control human activity within the space it dominates. People must use a bypass to drive further for a loaf of bread which was previously bought from the corner shop now closed from a lack of business due to the same bypass. Commuters in Mexico City are forced back into cars to escape the hazardous chemicals now dominating this space. This almost master/servant relationship over space allocation in the land, city and airscapes led to the disenchantment with cars which began in the 70s. One of the results of this disenchantment was to reconsider the bicycle as an alternate, less impinging form of transport.\n     It has taken a number of decades but, in terms of space and scapes, an interesting phenomenon is occurring with the resurgence of the popularity of bicycles in the Western world. Cycling advocate groups are highlighting the advantages of this mode of transport. Cycling is no longer discussed in the 1890 discourses of freedom and adventure, but in terms of the environment and health. The environmental rhetoric, in particular, can be framed in terms of space. For example, it may be suggested that bicycles do not tend to permeate the airscape to the degree that cars do. It is through these types of discourses that advocate groups have been arguing for the right to take back some of the space that cars have since subsumed. A struggle exists over this space. For example, in many European cities, bicycle lanes on the far left of the road (between the footpath and carlanes) have been drawn on many intra-urban roads. In Amsterdam, vehicle access is colour coded, with bikeways being marked by red bricks (Poindexter). The cityscape is not altered as a result, but challenges to the space already filled by cars are made. In Australian capital cities, these bikelanes are less successful. Many of these bike lanes exist where car parking is permitted and a line of parked cars potentially subsumes this designated space, such that it no longer exists. Thus many cyclists resort to using pathways, some specific to cyclists, others shared with pedestrians. Other innovations from the Netherlands, which have perpetuated this challenge to the car's control of space, are traffic lights with special signals for bicycles and right-of-way laws which include specific give way to cyclists rules (Poindexter). These practices question the dominion of cars in travelling spaces and go towards changing this transport paradigm. As natural resources are depleted further and little progress is made on green cars, bicycles may again find their niche. It will be interesting to see another architectural evolution of the city, land, air and nationscapes as this space changes to accommodate another shift in transport trends.\n          \n     References\n     \nBardou, Jean-Pierre, Jean-Jacques Chanaron, Patrick Fridenson and James Laux.

    "title": "The Naturally-Occuring Chat Machine",
    "abstract": "\n      Chat: pretty basic stuff; we can all recognise it and we can all do it. Yet when we come to define chat we have to make decisions about its character. For us, chat is defined by its 'informality' (not that we are capable of defining that), not its modality. Thus it names informal textual interaction as well as informal voiced interaction: holiday postcards, letters to friends and informal emails, along with telephone and dinner table conversation. However, in Conversation Analysis (CA) -- the pre-eminent mode of 'chat analysis' -- textually produced interaction is not considered an altogether appropriate topic, and 'textual CA' remains marginal at best (McHoul; Nelson; Mulkay). \n      According to CA, conversation (or 'talk-in-interaction') is the primordial mode of social interaction. As a practice, ordinary talk is not considered by its practitioners to be particularly skilled (presumably because it is so basic, so pervasive, so ordinary); yet CA shows it to be a precision instrument, wielded by maestros. Subtle, nuanced and highly sensitive; yet structured, normative and accountable; it displays \"order at all points\" (Sacks 22), yet is entirely improvised. Moreover, the doing of talk produces and reproduces all the supposedly 'external' phenomena of the socio-psychological sciences: persons, interaction, groups, membership categories (class/gender/ethnicity), the 'sense of social structure' and ultimately society itself. For CA, 'naturally-occurring ordinary conversation' is at once the most mundane and the most consequential social phenomenon (Boden &amp; Zimmerman; Silverman; Hutchby &amp; Wooffitt). \n      Part of our aim is to provoke a reconsideration of the marginal status of textually conducted interaction as a proper topic for CA. We do this by comparing two forms of CA and their corresponding data -- the CA of face-to-face conversations and the CA of Internet newsgroup messages (for the latter, see Reed, \"Being 'OTP'\"; Reed, \"Newsgroups\"; for other insider commentaries and critiques of CA practices, see Anderson and Sharrock; Bogen).\n      The main axis of comparison between the two forms of analysis is the relevant procedures that each uses to produce its data; and in particular, the subset of these we call 'machinic-productive processes' (see Table 1). \n      \n      If we concentrate on the two heavily outlined boxes which list each mode's machinic-productive processes we can note first that these processes are assigned to different actors: for the CA of conversation, they are the task of the analyst, whereas for the CA of newsgroup messages, they belong to the participants. \n      Newsgroup Messages \n      The machinic-productive processes required to transform newsgroup messages into data for CA are carried out, pre-analytically, by newsgroup participants as an integral part of their practice. Note that the term 'participants' includes many more 'actants' than just message writers. There are other humans, mainly message readers of various kinds (active readers/writers, passive read-only 'lurkers', and, sometimes, policing readers known as 'moderators'). And crucially, there are various nonhumans too (computers, newsreading and archival/retrieval software, electronic networks); see, for the participation of nonhumans in social arrangements, Latour; and for 'actor network theory' generally, Law &amp; Hassard.\n      The threadedness and retrievability process sorts and juxtaposes messages with mutual reference and relevance into interactional streams known as 'threads'. Newsreading and archival/retrieval software produce a visible display of the topical and temporal relations between the messages that comprise a newsgroup. Thus the (human) newsgroup reader, and of course the analyst, is presented with pre-formed sequences of messages. This is how, at the inter-message level, the interactional character of newsgroups is built; without which, they would not be available as potential data for CA with its overriding interest in interaction. A more technical result of this machinic-productive process is the (temporary) preservation of a set of publicly-available messages.\n      The process of textual composition and editing includes the set of co-operative procedures carried out by message writers and message-writing software. For example, messages with a 'conversational' character can be formed by the insertion of new text into edited portions of the prior message(s) automatically generated by the software's 'reply' command (for a detailed analysis of this practice, see Reed, \"Sequential Integrity\"). This, then, is one way that the interactional character of newsgroups is produced at the intra-message level. A further, very basic, product of this second machinic-productive process is, quite simply, text.\n      Conversations \n      The analyst of conversations has more (initial) work to do than has the analyst of newsgroup messages. She has to transform the raw material of some bit(s) of talk in the world into something useable, i.e. data. This involves, among other things, the machinic-productive processes of recording and transcribing. These processes are 'machinic' in that they are technologically mediated, requiring the use of audio/video recording machines and codified transcription systems. They are 'productive' because their use results in something new, something that is qualitatively distinct from the (supposedly) 'naturally-occurring' object that is said to be this novel object's original and model.\n      \n      Recording transforms a private, participants-only piece of talk into one that is overheard: the researcher has conjoined the interested parties; the talk has been bugged. In addition, recording transforms an ephemeral 'been and gone' occasion into a 'frozen moment', preserved out of time. Recording, then, like the machinic practices in newsgroup message production, de-privatises and preserves. These are large and consequential transformations. For example, they enable a continual return to the data for re-listening, re-hearing and possibly re-transcription (for a critique of the 'return to the data' trope, see Ashmore and Reed).\n      Discussions of the practices of recording talk (or of its productive effects) are noticeably absent from the primary and secondary literature of CA (see, for example, Pomerantz and Fehr; Hutchby and Wooffitt; Silverman). This is not accidental. It is one aspect of a distinctive attitude in CA to its materials, as encapsulated by Harvey Sacks in the following, much quoted, comment:\n      I started to work with tape-recorded conversations. Such materials had a single virtue, that I could replay them. I could transcribe them somewhat and study them extendedly. (Sacks 26) \n      \n      \n        Let us simply note the criteria for adequate data implied here:\n      \n      \n\n           the data must be portray-able as 'accidentally', or 'irrelevantly' collected. \n           the data must be record-able and re-playable. \n           the data must be transcribe-able. \n        \n        \n           the data must be re-study-able.\n        \n      \nFor data to be usable for CA, they must become 'independent objects' detached from their specific origins. This is achieved through their (unattended-to) availability to the machinic recording and transcription processes. Adequate data must have this 'machinic potential'.\n      The most basic consequence of transcribing is a shift in modality from sound to text. In itself, a text is more distributable, more publicly-available than a tape. Because the transcript is a result of 'hearing work' done on the tape, it also acts as a public display of the analyst's otherwise private and subjective understandings. The particular practice of transcription used in CA is codified -- indeed, frequently capitalised -- as The [Gail] Jefferson Transcription System. A properly formulated CA transcript is not, to the uninitiated, easy to read, being full of abstruse symbols and replete with details of pauses, overlaps and false starts; the features which are usually written out of other transcriptions of talk. To the cognoscenti, however, it is precisely these elements which not only 'speak CA' but also act to produce and display the naturally-occurring character of the data. The more complex the visual 'look' of a CA transcript, and thus the more worked-up it is, the more we are persuaded of its pristine origin, 'untouched by analyst's hand'.\n      Conclusion\n      For mainstream CA, newsgroup messages look unpromising as material for analysis. This is because, we are arguing, they do not require the analyst to engage in the data-production processes we have outlined in our discussion of the recording and transcription of conversations. That is, the procedures needed to transform newsgroup interaction into data for analysis are less 'radical' than those needed for conversations. Newsgroup messages are, as it were, pre-'recorded' and pre-'transcribed' as an inherent part of their production: they are already public, already preserved and, of course, already text.\n      It is our strong impression that one source of the perceived inadequacy of newsgroup material in and for CA, is a distaste for its evidently 'machinic' character; it seems to lack the stamp of a fully human origin, it seems too 'artificially occurring'. Yet, ironically, in one sense of the 'naturally occurring' criterion, newsgroup data would appear to be clearly superior to conversation. In that their worked-up, machinic character is the result of participants' work, they are considerably less mediated, more 'natural' than recorded and transcribed conversations.\n      For the CA of conversation, we are arguing that, far from having its origin, its model, and its validation in some naturally-occurring, real-time, real-world, locally-specific occasion(s) of talk, its object only becomes recognisable as 'conversation' as a result of the machinic-productive processes we have described. All the things that, for CA, are definitional of conversation -- sequence, turn taking, adjacency pairs and the like -- gain their reality by being worked-up from data made in this way. This is equally true for the CA of newsgroups; in both domains, their respective machinic-productive processes function to manufacture chat. However, in the CA of talk, they produce something else: the myth of an unmediated origin. In formulating conversation as a naturally-occurring phenomenon, their own productive work in so doing is systematically obfuscated. The newly man-and-machine made object erases its original and replaces it with ... itself. \n          \n      References  \n      \nAnderson, R.J., and W.W.

    "title": "Towards an Aesthetics of Navigation",
    "abstract": "\n \n       Introduction \n      Explorations of the multimedia game format within cultural studies have been broadly approached from two perspectives: one -- the impact of technologies on user interaction particularly with regard to social implications, and the other -- human computer interactions within the framework of cybercultures. Another approach to understanding or speaking about games within cultural studies is to focus on the game experience as cultural practice -- as an activity or an event. In this article I wish to initiate an exploration of the aesthetics of player space as a distinctive element of the gameplay experience. In doing so I propose that an understanding of aesthetic spatial issues as an element of player interactivity and engagement is important for understanding the cultural practice of adventure gameplay. \n      In approaching these questions, I am focussing on the single-player exploration adventure game in particular Myst and The Crystal Key. In describing these games as adventures I am drawing on Chris Crawford's The Art of Computer Game Design, which although a little dated, focusses on game design as a distinct activity. He brings together a theoretical approach with extensive experience as a game designer himself (Excalibur, Legionnaire, Gossip). Whilst at Atari he also worked with Brenda Laurel, a key theorist in the area of computer design and dramatic structure. \n      Adventure games such as Myst and The Crystal Key might form a sub-genre in Chris Crawford's taxonomy of computer game design. Although they use the main conventions of the adventure game -- essentially a puzzle to be solved with characters within a story context -- the main focus and source of pleasure for the player is exploration, particularly the exploration of worlds or cosmologies. \n      The main gameplay of both games is to travel through worlds solving clues, picking up objects, and interacting with other characters. In Myst the player has to solve the riddle of the world they have entered -- as the CD-ROM insert states \"Now you're here, wherever here is, with no option but to explore.\" The goal, as the player must work out, is to release the father Atrus from prison by bringing magic pages of a book to different locations in the worlds. Hints are offered by broken-up, disrupted video clips shown throughout the game. In The Crystal Key, the player as test pilot has to save a civilisation by finding clues, picking up objects, mending ships and defeating an opponent. \n      The questions foregrounded by a focus on the aesthetics of navigation are: What types of representational context are being set up? What choices have designers made about representational context? How are the players positioned within these spaces? What are the implications for the player's sense of orientation and navigation? \n      Architectural Fabrication\n      For the ancient Greeks, painting was divided into two categories: magalography (the painting of great things) and rhyparography (the painting of small things). Magalography covered mythological and historical scenes, which emphasised architectural settings, the human figure and grand landscapes. Rhyparography referred to still lifes and objects. In adventure games, particularly those that attempt to construct a cosmology such as Myst and The Crystal Key, magalography and rhyparography collide in a mix of architectural monumentality and obsessive detailing of objects. \n      For the ancient Greeks, painting was divided into two categories: magalography (the painting of great things) and rhyparography (the painting of small things). Magalography covered mythological and historical scenes, which emphasised architectural settings, the human figure and grand landscapes. Rhyparography referred to still lifes and objects. In adventure games, particularly those that attempt to construct a cosmology such as Myst and The Crystal Key, magalography and rhyparography collide in a mix of architectural monumentality and obsessive detailing of objects. \n      The creation of a digital architecture in adventure games mimics the Pompeii wall paintings with their interplay of extruded and painted features. In visualising the space of a cosmology, the environment starts to be coded like the urban or built environment with underlying geometry and textured surface or dressing. In The Making of Myst (packaged with the CD-ROM) Chuck Carter, the artist on Myst, outlines the process of creating Myst Island through painting the terrain in grey scale then extruding the features and adding textural render -- a methodology that lends itself to a hybrid of architectural and painted geometry. Examples of external architecture and of internal room design can be viewed online. \n     In the spatial organisation of the murals of Pompeii and later Rome, orthogonals converged towards several vertical axes showing multiple points of view simultaneously. During the high Renaissance, notions of perspective developed into a more formal system known as the construzione legittima or legitimate construction. This assumed a singular position of the on-looker standing in the same place as that occupied by the artist when the painting was constructed. In Myst there is an exaggeration of the underlying structuring technique of the construzione legittima with its emphasis on geometry and mathematics. The player looks down at a slight angle onto the screen from a fixed vantage point and is signified as being within the cosmological expanse, either in off-screen space or as the cursor. Within the cosmology, the island as built environment appears as though viewed through an enlarging lens, creating the precision and coldness of a Piero della Francesca painting. \n      \n      Myst mixes flat and three-dimensional forms of imagery on the same screen -- the flat, sketchy portrayal of the trees of Myst Island exists side-by-side with the monumental architectural buildings and landscape design structures created in Macromodel. This image shows the flat, almost expressionistic trees of Myst Island juxtaposed with a fountain rendered in high detail. This recalls the work of Giotto in the Arena chapel. In Joachim's Dream, objects and buildings have depth, but trees, plants and sky -- the space in-between objects -- is flat. Myst Island conjures up the realm of a magic, realist space with obsolete artefacts, classic architectural styles (the Albert Hall as the domed launch pad, the British Museum as the library, the vernacular cottage in the wood), mechanical wonders, miniature ships, fountains, wells, macabre torture instruments, ziggurat-like towers, symbols and odd numerological codes. Adam Mates describes it as \"that beautiful piece of brain-deadening sticky-sweet eye-candy\" but more than mere eye-candy or graphic verisimilitude, it is the mix of cultural ingredients and signs that makes Myst an intriguing place to play. \n      The buildings in The Crystal Key, an exploratory adventure game in a similar genre to Myst, celebrate the machine aesthetic and modernism with Buckminster Fuller style geodesic structures, the bombe shape, exposed ducting, glass and steel, interiors with movable room partitions and abstract expressionist decorations. An image of one of these modernist structures is available online. The Crystal Key uses QuickTime VR panoramas to construct the exterior and interior spaces. Different from the sharp detail of Myst's structures, the focus changes from sharp in wide shot to soft focus in close up, with hot-spot objects rendered in trompe l'oeil detail. \n      The Tactility of Objects \n      \"The aim of trompe l'oeil -- using the term in its widest sense and applying it to both painting and objects -- is primarily to puzzle and to mystify\" (Battersby 19). In the 15th century, Brunelleschi invented a screen with central apparatus in order to obtain exact perspective -- the monocular vision of the camera obscura. During the 17th century, there was a renewed interest in optics by the Dutch artists of the Rembrandt school (inspired by instruments developed for Dutch seafaring ventures), in particular Vermeer, Hoogstraten, de Hooch and Dou. Gerard Dou's painting of a woman chopping onions shows this. These artists were experimenting with interior perspective and trompe l'oeil in order to depict the minutia of the middle-class, domestic interior. Within these luminous interiors, with their receding tiles and domestic furniture, is an elevation of the significance of rhyparography. In the Girl Chopping Onions of 1646 by Gerard Dou the small things are emphasised -- the group of onions, candlestick holder, dead fowl, metal pitcher, and bird cage. \n      Trompe l'oeil as an illusionist strategy is taken up in the worlds of Myst, The Crystal Key and others in the adventure game genre. Traditionally, the fascination of trompe l'oeil rests upon the tension between the actual painting and the scam; the physical structures and the faux painted structures call for the viewer to step closer to wave at a fly or test if the glass had actually broken in the frame. Mirian Milman describes trompe l'oeil painting in the following manner: \"the repertory of trompe-l'oeil painting is made up of obsessive elements, it represents a reality immobilised by nails, held in the grip of death, corroded by time, glimpsed through half-open doors or curtains, containing messages that are sometimes unreadable, allusions that are often misunderstood, and a disorder of seemingly familiar and yet remote objects\" (105). Her description could be a scene from Myst with in its suggestion of theatricality, rich texture and illusionistic play of riddle or puzzle. \n      In the trompe l'oeil painterly device known as cartellino, niches and recesses in the wall are represented with projecting elements and mock bas-relief. This architectural trickery is simulated in the digital imaging of extruded and painting elements to give depth to an interior or an object. Other techniques common to trompe l'oeil -- doors, shadowy depths and staircases, half opened cupboard, and paintings often with drapes and curtains to suggest a layering of planes -- are used throughout Myst as transition points. In the trompe l'oeil paintings, these transition points were often framed with curtains or drapes that appeared to be from the spectator space -- creating a painting of a painting effect. Myst is rich in this suggestion of worlds within worlds through the framing gesture afforded by windows, doors, picture frames, bookcases and fireplaces. \n      Views from a window -- a distant landscape or a domestic view, a common device for trompe l'oeil -- are used in Myst to represent passageways and transitions onto different levels. Vertical space is critical for extending navigation beyond the horizontal through the terraced landscape -- the tower, antechamber, dungeon, cellars and lifts of the fictional world. Screen shots show the use of the curve, light diffusion and terracing to invite the player. In The Crystal Key vertical space is limited to the extent of the QTVR tilt making navigation more of a horizontal experience. \n      Out-Stilling the Still \n      Dutch and Flemish miniatures of the 17th century give the impression of being viewed from above and through a focussing lens. As Mastai notes: \"trompe l'oeil, therefore is not merely a certain kind of still life painting, it should in fact 'out-still' the stillest of still lifes\" (156). The intricate detailing of objects rendered in higher resolution than the background elements creates a type of hyper-reality that is used in Myst to emphasise the physicality and actuality of objects. This ultimately enlarges the sense of space between objects and codes them as elements of significance within the gameplay. The obsessive, almost fetishistic, detailed displays of material artefacts recall the curiosity cabinets of Fabritius and Hoogstraten. \n      The mechanical world of Myst replicates the Dutch 17th century fascination with the optical devices of the telescope, the convex mirror and the prism, by coding them as key signifiers/icons in the frame. In his peepshow of 1660, Hoogstraten plays with an enigma and optical illusion of a Dutch domestic interior seen as though through the wrong end of a telescope. Using the anamorphic effect, the image only makes sense from one vantage point -- an effect which has a contemporary counterpart in the digital morphing widely used in adventure games. \n      The use of crumbled or folded paper standing out from the plane surface of the canvas was a recurring motif of the Vanitas trompe l'oeil paintings. The highly detailed representation and organisation of objects in the Vanitas pictures contained the narrative or symbology of a religious or moral tale. (As in this example by Hoogstraten.) In the cosmology of Myst and The Crystal Key, paper contains the narrative of the back-story lovingly represented in scrolls, books and curled paper messages. The entry into Myst is through the pages of an open book, and throughout the game, books occupy a privileged position as holders of stories and secrets that are used to unlock the puzzles of the game. \n      Myst can be read as a Dantesque, labyrinthine journey with its rich tapestry of images, its multi-level historical associations and battle of good and evil. Indeed the developers, brothers Robyn and Rand Miller, had a fertile background to draw on, from a childhood spent travelling to Bible churches with their nondenominational preacher father. \n      The Diorama as System Event \n      The diorama (story in the round) or mechanical exhibit invented by Daguerre in the 19th century created a mini-cosmology with player anticipation, action and narrative. It functioned as a mini-theatre (with the spectator forming the fourth wall), offering a peek into mini-episodes from foreign worlds of experience. The Musée Mechanique in San Francisco has dioramas of the Chinese opium den, party on the captain's boat, French execution scenes and ghostly graveyard episodes amongst its many offerings, including a still showing an upper class dancing party called A Message from the Sea. These function in tandem with other forbidden pleasures of the late 19th century -- public displays of the dead, waxwork museums and kinetescope flip cards with their voyeuristic \"What the Butler Saw\", and \"What the Maid Did on Her Day Off\" tropes. Myst, along with The 7th Guest, Doom and Tomb Raider show a similar taste for verisimilitude and the macabre. However, the pre-rendered scenes of Myst and The Crystal Key allow for more diorama like elaborate and embellished details compared to the emphasis on speed in the real-time-rendered graphics of the shoot-'em-ups. \n      In the gameplay of adventure games, animated moments function as rewards or responsive system events: allowing the player to navigate through the seemingly solid wall; enabling curtains to be swung back, passageways to appear, doors to open, bookcases to disappear. These short sequences resemble the techniques used in mechanical dioramas where a coin placed in the slot enables a curtain or doorway to open revealing a miniature narrative or tableau -- the closure of the narrative resulting in the doorway shutting or the curtain being pulled over again. These repeating cycles of contemplation-action-closure offer the player one of the rewards of the puzzle solution. The sense of verisimilitude and immersion in these scenes is underscored by the addition of sound effects (doors slamming, lifts creaking, room atmosphere) and music. \n      Geographic Locomotion \n      Static imagery is the standard backdrop of the navigable space of the cosmology game landscape. Myst used a virtual camera around a virtual set to create a sequence of still camera shots for each point of view. The use of the still image lends itself to a sense of the tableauesque -- the moment frozen in time. These tableauesque moments tend towards the clean and anaesthetic, lacking any evidence of the player's visceral presence or of other human habitation. \n      The player's navigation from one tableau screen to the next takes the form of a 'cyber-leap' or visual jump cut. These jumps -- forward, backwards, up, down, west, east -- follow on from the geographic orientation of the early text-based adventure games. In their graphic form, they reveal a new framing angle or point of view on the scene whilst ignoring the rules of classical continuity editing. Games such as The Crystal Key show the player's movement through space (from one QTVR node to another) by employing a disorientating fast zoom, as though from the perspective of a supercharged wheelchair. Rather than reconciling the player to the state of movement, this technique tends to draw attention to the technologies of the programming apparatus. The Crystal Key sets up a meticulous screen language similar to filmic dramatic conventions then breaks its own conventions by allowing the player to jump out of the crashed spaceship through the still intact window. \n      The landscape in adventure games is always partial, cropped and fragmented. The player has to try and map the geographical relationship of the environment in order to understand where they are and how to proceed (or go back). Examples include selecting the number of marker switches on the island to receive Atrus's message and the orientation of Myst's tower in the library map to obtain key clues. A screenshot shows the arrival point in Myst from the dock. In comprehending the landscape, which has no centre, the player has to create a mental map of the environment by sorting significant connecting elements into chunks of spatial elements similar to a Guy Debord Situationist map. \n      Playing the Flaneur \n      The player in Myst can afford to saunter through the landscape, meandering at a more leisurely pace that would be possible in a competitive shoot-'em-up, behaving as a type of flaneur. The image of the flaneur as described by Baudelaire motions towards fin de siècle decadence, the image of the socially marginal, the dispossessed aristocrat wandering the urban landscape ready for adventure and unusual exploits. This develops into the idea of the artist as observer meandering through city spaces and using the power of memory in evoking what is observed for translation into paintings, writing or poetry. \n      In Myst, the player as flaneur, rather than creating paintings or writing, is scanning the landscape for clues, witnessing objects, possible hints and pick-ups. The numbers in the keypad in the antechamber, the notes from Atrus, the handles on the island marker, the tower in the forest and the miniature ship in the fountain all form part of a mnemomic trompe l'oeil. A screenshot shows the path to the library with one of the island markers and the note from Atrus. In the world of Myst, the player has no avatar presence and wanders around a seemingly unpeopled landscape -- strolling as a tourist venturing into the unknown -- creating and storing a mental map of objects and places. In places these become items for collection -- cultural icons with an emphasised materiality. In The Crystal Key iconography they appear at the bottom of the screen pulsing with relevance when active. A screenshot shows a view to a distant forest with the \"pick-ups\" at the bottom of the screen. This process of accumulation and synthesis suggests a Surrealist version of Joseph Cornell's strolls around Manhattan -- collecting, shifting and organising objects into significance. \n      In his 1982 taxonomy of game design, Chris Crawford argues that without competition these worlds are not really games at all. That was before the existence of the Myst adventure sub-genre where the pleasures of the flaneur are a particular aspect of the gameplay pleasures outside of the rules of win/loose, combat and dominance. By turning the landscape itself into a pathway of significance signs and symbols, Myst, The Crystal Key and other games in the sub-genre offer different types of pleasures from combat or sport -- the pleasures of the stroll -- the player as observer and cultural explorer. \n          \n      References \n      \n Battersby, M.

Some of the panellists took up a suggestion that they develop ideas arising from a recent piece of work, of their own or others, which might indicate future directions for the field.

    "abstract": "\n      An M/C Event held in the Conference Room of the University of Queensland Library on 12 May 2000\n      The early, mythological phase of digital culture is now rapidly running out of its utopian energies. Law and order are taking command over the last pockets of digital wilderness. The taming of the cyberculture by \"click 'n mortar\" businesses and their willing government executors took only a few years. The time of institutionalization, mega mergers and security paranoia has arrived. These new conditions, driven by the current hyper-growth, have an as yet invisible effect on the cultural new media sector (arts, design, education), which had perceived itself for so long as \"ahead of the wave\". \n      To prevent Internet from turning into a nightmare (from which it then has to awake), neither the utopian vision has to be eliminated, nor do we need to withdraw to the apocalyptic pole, which states that the world and its network will collapse anyhow -- with or without our interference. The conflict between utopia and negativism needs to be played out. The deeper we are drawn into the Virtual, the more there is a need to stage its inherent paradoxes and contradictions. \n      But how ?\n      The recordings from this event are available in RealAudio and Windows Media streaming audio formats.\n       \n      \n\n\n            \"Directions for Cyberculture in the New Economy\"\n            Geert Lovink, Media Scholar and Activist\n        Responses by Greg Hearn and David Marshall\n\n          M/C Event\n      University of Queensland\n      12 May 2000\n        \n\n \n           \n           \n           \n        \n\nIntroduction and Acknowledgements\n          Axel Bruns\n           28k\n           56k\n        \n\n 28k\n           56k\n        \n\n\"Directions for Cyberculture in the New Economy\" \n          Geert Lovink\n           28k\n           56k\n        \n\n 28k\n           56k\n        \n\nFirst Response\n          Greg Hearn\n           28k\n           56k\n        \n\n 28k\n           56k\n        \n\nSecond Response\n          David Marshall\n           28k\n           56k\n        \n\n 28k\n           56k\n        \n\nReply to Respondents\n          Geert Lovink\n           28k\n           56k\n        \n\n 28k\n           56k\n        \n\nAudience Questions &amp; Answers - Part 1\n          Geert Lovink\n      Greg Hearn\n      David Marshall \n           28k\n           56k\n        \n\n 28k\n           56k\n        \n\nAudience Questions &amp; Answers - Part 2\n          Geert Lovink\n      Greg Hearn\n      David Marshall \n           28k\n           56k\n        \n\n 28k\n           56k\n        \n\n\n      Acknowledgements \n      Geert Lovink visited Brisbane as a participant in Alchemy, an International Masterclass for New Media Artists and Curators, which was organised by the Australian Network for Art and Technology in association with the Brisbane Powerhouse - Centre for the Live Arts from 8 May to 9 June 2000.

    "abstract": "\n      Introduction \n      The proliferation of electronic images and audiovisual forms, together with the recent expansion of Internet communication makes me wonder about the adequacy of present theoretical apparatus within the humanities and communication disciplines to explain these new phenomena and their effects on human life. As someone working roughly within a cultural and media studies framework, I have long harboured suspicions about the ability of concepts such as text, discourse and representation to give an account of the new media which does not simply reduce them to another version of earlier media forms. Many of these concepts were established during the 1970s and 80s, in the development of poststructuralism and its linguistic bias towards the analysis of literary and print media text. The application of these concepts to an electronic medium based on the visual image rather than the printed word seems somewhat perverse, and needs to be replaced by the application of other concepts drawn from a paradigm more suited for the purpose. \n      In this brief essay, I want to explore some of the issues involved in thinking about a new cultural paradigm based on the photovisual/electronic image, to describe and critique the transformation of culture currently taking place through the accelerated uptake of new televisual, audiovisual and computer technologies. I am reminded here of the existential philosopher Heidegger's words about technology: 'the essence of technology is by no means anything technological' (Heidegger 4). For Heidegger, technology is part of the 'enframing' of the beingness which humans inhabit in various ways (Dasein). But technology itself does not constitute this beingness. This is good news for those of us (like myself) who have only a general and non-technical knowledge of the new technologies currently sweeping the globe, but who sense their profound effects on the human condition. Indeed, it suggests that technical knowledge in itself is insufficient and even inadequate to formulate appropriate questions about the relationship between technology and human being, and to the capacities of humans to respond to, and transform their technologically mediated situations. We need a new way of understanding human being as mediated by technologies, which takes into account the specific technological form in which mediation occurs today. To do this, we need new ways of conceptualising culture, and the specific kind of human subjectivity made possible within a culture conditioned by electronic media. \n      From Material to Virtual Culture \n      The concept of culture, as it has been predominantly understood in the humanities and associated disciplines, is based on the idea of physical presence. That is to say, culture is understood in terms of the various representations and practices that people experience within social and historical contexts defined by the living presence of one human being to another. The paradigm case here is speech-based linguistics in which all forms of communication are understood in terms of an innate subjectivity, expressed in the act of communicating something to someone else. Although privileging the site and moment of co-presence, this model does not require the speakers to be immediately present to each other in face-to-face situations, but asks only that co-presence be the ideal upon which successful acts of communication take place. As French philosopher Jacques Derrida has consistently argued over the last thirty years, all forms of western discourse, in one way or another, have been based on this kind of understanding of the way meanings and expressions of subject identity take place (Derrida 27ff.). \n      A good case in point is the introductory essay by John Frow and Meaghan Morris to their edited text book Australian Cultural Studies: A Reader, where culture is defined as \"a contested and conflictual set of practices of representation bound up with the processes of formation and re-formation of social groups\" (xx). If culture is defined in terms of the agonistic formation of social groups through practices of representation, then there can be no way of thinking about culture outside the social as the privileged domain of human interaction. Culture is reduced to the social as a kind of paradigm limit, which is, in turn, characterised by the formation of social groups fixed in time and space. Even when an effort is made to indicate that social groups are themselves culturally constituted, as Frow and Morris go on to say, the social is nevertheless invoked again as an underlying presumption: \"the social processes by which the categories of the real and of group existence are formed\" (xx). In this model, social groups are formed by social processes. The task of representation and signification (the task of culture) is to draw the group together, no matter how widespread or dispersed, to make it coherent and identifiably different from other groups. Under these terms, the task of cultural analysis is to describe how this process takes place. \n      This 'material' approach to culture normalises the social at the expense of the cultural, underpinned by a 'metaphysics of presence' whereby meaning and identity are established within a system of differential values (difference) by fixing human subjectivity in space and time. I argue that the uptake of new communication technologies makes this concept of culture obsolete. Culture now has to be understood in terms of 'virtual presence' in which the physical context of human existence is simultaneously 'doubled' and indeed proliferated into a virtual reality, with effective force in the 'real' world. From this perspective, we need to rethink culture so that it is no longer understood in terms of differential meanings, identities, texts, discourses and representational forms, but rather as a new kind of ontology involving the 'being' of human subjects and their relations to each other in deterritorialised fields of mediated co-presence, where the real and the virtual enmesh and interact. In this case, the laws governing physical presence no longer apply since it is possible to be 'here' and 'there' at the same time. We need a new approach and a new set of analytical terms to account for this new phenomenon. \n      Virtual Culture and the Time of Human Presence \n      In his well known critique of modern culture, Walter Benjamin invents the concept of the 'dialectical image' to define the visual concreteness of the everyday world and its effect on human consciousness. Dialectical images operate through an instantaneous flash of vision which breaks through everyday reality, allowing an influx of otherness to flood present awareness in a transformation of the past into the present: \"the past can be seized only as an image which flashes up at the instant when it can be recognized and is never seen again\" (Benjamin, Theses 255). Bypassing discourse, language and meaning, dialectical images invoke the eternal return -- the affirmation of the present as an ever-constant repetition of temporality -- as the 'ground' of history, progress and the future. Modern technology and its infinite power of reproduction has created the condition under which the image separates from its object, thereby releasing materiality from its moribund state in the past (Benjamin, The Work of Art). The ground of temporality is thus rendered virtual and evanescent, involving a 'deterritorialisation' of human experience from its ego-attachment to the present; an experience which Benjamin understands in repressed mythical terms. \n      For Benjamin, the exemplary modern technology is photography. A photograph 'destroys' the originariness of the object, by robbing it of aura, or \"the unique phenomenon of a distance, however close it may be\" (Benjamin, The Work of Art 222). The photographic image is thus dialectical because it collapses the distance between the object and its image, thereby undermining the ontological space between the past and the present which might otherwise grant to the object a unique being in the presence of the viewer. But all 'things' also have their images, which can be separated and dispersed through space and time. \n      Benjamin's approach to culture, where time surpasses space, and where the reproduced image takes priority over the real, now appears strangely prophetic. By suggesting that images are somehow directly and concretely affective in the constitution of human temporality, Benjamin has anticipated the current 'postmodern' condition in which the electronic image has become enmeshed in everyday life. As Paul Virilio argues, new communication technologies accelerate the transmission of images to such a rate that the past is collapsed into the present, creating an overpowering sense of immediacy: \n      \nthe speed of new optoelectronic and electroacoustic milieu becomes a final void (the void of the quick), a vacuum that no longer depends on the interval between places or things and so on the world's very extension, but on the interface of an instantaneous transmission of remote appearances, on a geographic and geometric retention in which all volume, all relief vanish. (33) \n      \n      Distance is now experienced in terms of its virtual proximity to the perceiving subject, in which space is no longer understood in terms of Newtonian extension, but as collapsed or compressed temporality, defined by the speed of light. \n      In this Einsteinian world, human interaction is no longer governed by the law of non-contradiction which demands that one thing cannot be something else or somewhere else at the same time, and instead becomes 'interfacial', where the image-double enmeshes with its originary being as a co-extensive ontology based on \"trans-appearance\", or the effective appearance on a single horizon of two things from different space and time zones: \"the direct transparence of space that enables each of us to perceive our immediate neighbours is completed by the indirect transparence of the speed-time of the electromagnetic waves that transmit our images and our voices\" (Virilio 37). Like the light from some distant star which reaches earth millions of years after its explosive death, we now live in a world of remote and immediately past events, whose effects are constantly felt in real time. In this case the present is haunted by its past, creating a doppelgänger effect in which human being is doubled with its image in a co-extensive existence across space and time. \n      Body Doubles \n      Here we can no longer speak of the image as a representation, or even a signification, since the image is no longer secondary to the thing from which it is separated, nor is it a sign of anything else. Rather, we need to think of the possibility of a kind of 'image-event', incorporating both the physical reality of the human body and its image, stretched through time and space. French theorists Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari have developed an entire theoretical scheme to define and describe this kind of phenomenon. At one point in their magnum opus, A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia, they introduce the concept of haecceity: \n      a body is not defined by the form that determines it nor as a determinate substance or subject nor by the organs it possesses or the function it fulfils. On the plane of consistency, a body is defined by a longitude and a latitude: in other words the sum total of the material elements belonging to it under given relations of movement and rest, speed and slowness (longitude); the sum total of the intensive affects it is capable of at a given power or degree of potential (latitude). (260) \n       \n      This haecceity of the human body, as \"trajectory\", or \"interassemblage\" (262) denies the priority of an originating event or substance from which its constitutive elements could be derived. For instance photographs cease to be 'indexes' of things, and become instead part of an assemblage which includes living bodies and other forms of human presence (speech, writing, expressive signs), linked contingently into assemblages through space and time. A photographic image is just as much part of the 'beingness' of something as the thing itself; things and images are part of a perpetual process of becoming; a contingent linking of bricolage with different and diverging material expressions and effects. \n      Thinking along these lines will get us around the problem of non-contradiction (that something cannot be both 'here' and 'there' at the same time), by extending the concept of 'thing' to include all the elements of its dispersal in time and space. Here we move from the idea of a thing as unique to itself (for instance the body as human presence) and hence subject to a logic of exchange based on scarcity and lack, to the idea of a thing as 'becoming', and subject to a logic of proliferation and excess. In this case, the unique phenomenon of human presence anchored in speech can no longer be used as a focal point to fix human subjectivity, its meanings and forms of expression, since there will be many different kinds of 'presencing' of human being, through the myriad trajectories traced out in all the practices and assemblages through time and space. \n      A Practical Approach \n      By thinking of culture in terms of virtual presence, we can no longer assume the existence of a bedrock foundation for human interaction based on the physical proximity of individuals to each other in time and space. Rather we need to think of culture in terms the emergence of new kinds of 'beingness', which deterritorialises human presence in different ways through the mediating power of photovisual and electronic imagery. These new kinds of beingness are not really new. Recent writers and cultural theorists have already described in detail the emergence of a virtual culture in the nineteenth century with the invention of photography and film, as well as various viewing devices such as the stereoscope and other staging apparatuses including the panorama and diorama (Friedberg, Batchen, Crary). \n      Analysis of virtual culture needs to identify the various trajectories along which elements are assembled into an incessant and contingent 'becoming'. In terms of photovisual and electronic media, this can take place in different ways. By tracing the effective history of an image, it is possible to locate points at which transformations from one form to another occur, indicating different effects in different contexts through time. For instance by scanning through old magazines, you might be able to trace the 'destiny' of a particular type of image, and the kinds of meanings associated with it. Keeping in mind that an image is not a representation, but a form of affect, it might be possible to identify critical points where the image turns into its other (in fashion imagery we are now confronted with images of thin bodies suddenly becoming too thin, and hence dangerously subversive). \n      Another approach concerns the phenomenon known as the media event, in which electronic images outstrip and overdetermine physical events in real time to which they are attached. In this case an analysis of a media event would involve the description of the interaction between events and their mediated presence, as mutually effective in real time. Recent examples here include the Gulf War and other international emergencies and conflicts in the Balkans and the 1986 coup in the Philippines, where media presence enabled images to have a direct effect on the decisions and deployment of troops and strategic activities. In certain circumstances, the conduct of warfare might now take place entirely in virtual reality (Kellner). But these 'peak events' don't really exhaust the ways in which the phenomenon of the media event inhabits and affects our everyday lives. Indeed, it might be better to characterise our entire lives as conditioned to various degrees by media eventness, as we become more and more attached and dependent on electronic imagery and communication to gain our sense of place in the world. An analysis of this kind of everyday interaction is long overdue. \n      We can learn about the virtual through our own everyday experiences. Here I am not so much thinking of experiences to be had in futuristic apparatuses such as the virtual reality body suit and other computer generated digital environments, but the kinds of experiences of the virtual described by Benjamin in his wanderings through the streets of Berlin and Paris in the 1920s (Benjamin, One Way Street). A casual walk down the main street of any town, and a perfunctory gaze in the shop windows will trigger many interesting connections between specific elements and the assemblages through which their effects are made known. \n      On a recent trip to Bundaberg, a country town in Queensland, I came across a mechanised doll in a jewellery store display, made up in the likeness of a watchmaker working at a miniature workbench. The constant motion of the doll's arm as it moved up and down on the bench in a simulation of work repeated the electromechanical movements of the dozens of clocks and watches displayed elsewhere in the store window, suggesting a link between the human and the machine. Here I was presented not only with a pleasant shop display, but also with the commodification of time itself, as an endless repetition of an interval between successive actions, acted out by the doll and its perpetual movement. My pleasure at the display was channelled through the doll and his work, as a fetishised enchantment or \"fairy scene\" of industrialised productivity, in which the idea of time is visualised in a specific image-material form. I can imagine many other such displays in other windows in other towns and cities, all working to reproduce this particular kind of assemblage, which constantly 'pushes' the idea-image of time as commodity into the future, so long as the displays and their associated apparatuses of marketing continue in this way rather than some other way. \n      So my suggestion then, is to open our eyes to the virtual not as a futuristic technology, but as it already shapes and defines the world around us through time. By taking the visual appearance of things as immaterial forms with material affectivity, we allow ourselves to move beyond the limitations of physical presence, which demands that one thing cannot be something else, or somewhere else at the same time. The reduction of culture to the social should be replaced by an inquiry into the proliferation of the social through the cultural, as so many experiences of the virtual in time and space. \n          \n      References \n      \n Bataille, Georges.

    "abstract": "\n        Editors' Introduction \n        \n        There is no question that games have operated as a cultural enigma for media and cultural studies. And there have been many attempts to categorise what is actually going on with electronic games. On a straightforward level with the amount of carnage that is associated with shooter games, the number of \"accidents\" that occur in simulation games from car-racing to jet-fighter pilot activity, and the usual 3 lives of the standard video, arcade, and computer game it seems eminently reasonable to see that the first forays into its study were from those seeking answers and relationships to violent society-ills. Psychologists and criminologists have provided by far the largest pool of literature over the last 20 years about electronic games and have worked on correlations between the simulated gameworld and real-life. Similarly, because the background of so many critical analysts of games is from studies of film and television, it makes sense that there have been many only moderately successful attempts at overlaying theories of the subject and narrative for working out the machinations of gameplay. \n      One of our contributors has tried to write about the frustration of this experience of linking games to past cultural theories, and failed. Instead, he has created a game that isolates on the squarepeg-roundhole quality of games/gameplay and their linkages with theory. Jesper Juul in his \"Game Liberation\" challenges us to identify the uniqueness of the object of study and thereby pushes us to create a new variation that underpins the pleasure/pain repetition of the game experience. The player is a game theorist, tired and true, who like Juul wants to isolate on the special quality of the game for critical analysis and therefore must eliminate the conjectures that might emanate from these past cultural theories and envelope the game. Of course, this reading of the game can't be done while you are playing. You (at least the three \"lives' that constitute \"you\" in the game) have to keep shooting to blast away these imperial theories that try to colonise gameplay; through that process of playing the game you gain an insight into the experiential quality of games. If you ever attain the fourth level you have the ultimate pleasure of eliminating what Juul has called the pathology theories and achieve what everyone wants: their name in lights in the game's \"Hall of Fame\". \n      You are invited in this final \"article\" of the game issue to strip everything back and play the game. \n      Click here to play \"Game Liberation\"...\n          \n      Citation reference for this article  \n      MLA style:\n      \n Jesper Juul. \"Game Liberation.\" M/C: A Journal of Media and Culture 3.5 (2000).

    "abstract": "\n \n       \"On a list concerned with 'media-culture' one would expect the discussion to focus around the way 'media' function\" \n-- Trevor Batten, in a posting to M/C's Media-Culture mailing-list (9 Sep. 2000)\n      If I may begin by speaking personally for a moment: this is my last issue as M/C's Production Editor, a position I've held for the first three volumes of this journal. It's been a wild, sometimes bumpy ride as we worked to establish a new publication on a still-new medium, but I think the results speak for themselves -- M/C is something my fellow contributors and I can be proud of. Overall, I believe we've stayed true to our central aim since preparations for the journal first began in early 1998, an aim expressed in the editorial of the first issue: to be \"a crossover journal between the popular and the academic ... attempting to engage with the 'popular', and integrate the work of 'scholarship' in media and cultural studies into our critical work\" (Marshall b. 4). \n      This divide between the popular and the academic -- two terms frequently posited as opposite poles of a binary system -- maps quite directly also onto the other set of terms that are so central to M/C: at least in popular perception, 'media' and 'culture' (or worse, capital-C 'Culture') similarly exclude one another almost entirely. 'The media', especially their electronic mass-audience forms, pander to the lowest common denominator, while 'Culture' takes place elsewhere, in more interactive personal settings. The discipline of media and cultural studies has long fought against this simplicistic view, of course, but such fundamental perceptions are slow to change. \n      No surprise, then, that the slash in 'M/C', and later the dash in 'Media-Culture' (the name of our public discussion list), have come to create some perceptional difficulties for contributors and audience alike. As the same first editorial noted about the name, \"without grounding its meaning (the dance of meaning is important to us) the slash '/' is to highlight that this is a crossover journal\" (Marshall, b. 4), but the meaning did indeed remain contested: \"1998 is a bit early for the virgule to be designated as 'slash' in even a digital journal\", said a response by reader Gordon Owen to the first issue, and in any way, did this '/' divide or connect M(edia) and C(ulture)? \n      Slashes (or virgules) are wonderful things. The virgule, as the Oxford Dictionary has it, is a \"diagonal mark ... used to separate alternatives (as in and/or)\", but does this mean, then, that 'media' and 'culture' are separate, clearly distinguished and distinguishable, or that they are alternatives, different in certain aspects, but similar enough to be able to stand in for one another? This ambiguity does indeed allow us to avoid 'grounding the meaning' of the name; the choice is yours -- 'Media and/or Culture' indeed. \n      Slashes are also dreadful things -- if you happen to work with computers. The slash, forward as much as backward, is a special character, of course; depending on the circumstance it may indicate a division, function as a mathematical operator, lead to another level in a hierarchical structure, or it may modify the behaviour of a computer command. Slashes won't occur in Web and email addresses, therefore, because they could be misunderstood, and so perhaps the name M/C wasn't the smartest choice for a Web-based journal: there can never be a www.m/c.org.au, for example, and just searching for 'M/C' on the Web might lead to some very unforeseen results (a list of all the sites containing either 'M' or 'C', possibly...). \n      There's more than simply a lesson for budding Web publishers in this, though. The ambiguity and confusion (intended or otherwise) surrounding this and other slashes demonstrates the fundamental tendency of the human mind to categorise, to invent hierarchies of information -- but also indicates the continuous conflict of that tendency with another equally fundamental drive: the drive to connect and associate pieces of knowledge to form the bigger picture. The slash is both dividing line and shared border, much in the same way that the squiggly edges of puzzle pieces are both the source of the problem (they show where the original image was cut up) and the key to its solution (they can be used to connect pieces and reconstruct the image). \n      Getting back to the slash in question, then -- that between Media and Culture: capital-C 'Culture' itself similarly is a product of the hierarchy drive, of course, which values some types of Culture over other types of culture, while the associative drive might lead us to discard such hierarchies in favour of a view that regards all expressions of human thought and creativity as 'cultural' and interconnected. For the media (seen by the associative drive as interconnected, economically as well as communicatively), we could also single out a particular capital-M 'Media' subgroup: those institutions which stand at the top of the hierarchies of scale in their fields, as well as at the centre of attacks from cultural hierarchists for their perceived populism and un-Culturedness. Media and Culture, in their capital-letter forms, might therefore indeed be irreconcilably opposed to one another -- here, the slash clearly translates as 'or', then. In lower case, however, there can be hope for a renewal of the link between media and culture. If 'culture' does mean all expressions of human thought and creativity, and 'media' provide the means for the transmission of these expressions, the two are not only not mutually exclusive, but in fact crucially codependent; media and culture go -- must go -- hand in hand. \n      But which one is it for M/C, then? Well, perhaps there is no need to make a definite choice; perhaps part of the 'crossover' nature of the journal is also the ability to return to a true 'and/or' of Media/media and Culture/culture (enough slashes for you yet?). If this sounds like a cop-out, consider that either view -- media and culture, Media or Culture -- must itself use a medium to be expressed in the first place, and the nature of that medium will affect the message. It's no surprise that Media for which the physical scarcity of transmission bandwidth and similar economic factors dictate a highly hierarchised structure of programme content and publishing institutions (say, television or newspapers) are also common vehicles -- as well as, paradoxically, targets -- for protests about the lack of Culture in the Media, while less hierarchical media which allow the unedited expression of thoughts and ideas (say, the telephone or face-to-face chat) are the main vehicles for as well as participants in the continuation of human culture.\n     The Web, then, sits somewhere in the middle between these two extremes: being an electronic, or more to the point, a digital medium, it allows for the easy imposition of hierarchies, as its myriads of search engines and directory services demonstrate -- but these myriads also show that there is no one hierarchy; there are, rather, so many competing ones that individual users' value judgments fail to combine into one overarching Culture. As much as it can be hierarchical, therefore, the Web is also associative, rhizomatic, since these alternative individual Cultures are in constant negotiation and alteration as users accept or reject the hierarchies they come across online, and as they connect and compare the information they receive from various sources. The Web is neither lower-case medium nor upper-case Medium, therefore, or perhaps it is both at the same time: a combined 'middle-case', if there was such a thing. \n      \n      And this is precisely the reason that the Web is so well suited to 'crossover' publications of all kinds, of course: it is in itself inherently a crossover medium. Crossing over between different types of audiences (from 'popular' to 'academic', once again, but also along other socioeconomic factors) in different geographic locations, as well as different types of publishers (from 'amateur' to 'professional') with different publication formats and philosophies, it allows for the expression of exclusive Cultural as well as inclusive cultural views in contexts which draw from the hierarchical Media as well as free-for-all media, to the point where upper and lower cases become irrelevant, and a new conceptualisation of the link between media and culture (in whatever spelling) emerges. \n      At that point (still only a speck on the horizon), perhaps we must also rethink the slash between the two terms, then. Should M/C find a different typographical symbol for its name -- 'M%C', 'M+C', 'M*C'? You might be aware that our public mailing-list is already called 'Media-Culture', of course (though, to be honest, simply because the mailing-list software didn't like slashes), but from Batten's statement at the beginning of this article it is already evident that the dash simply replaces one ambiguity with another; it joins the terms, but at what price? Rather than the and/or of the slash, the dash in 'media-culture' could allow 'media' to be seen simply as a modifier, as in 'the culture of the media', in which case indeed \"one would expect the discussion to focus around the way 'media' function\" (Batten). That's not our intention, much in the same way that the '/' was more than \"just another graphic pirouette, or ... some awkward bow to the Internet aesthetic of cursors and schizophrenia\" (Marshall b. 4). Slash or dash, media and/or culture -- with renewed spirits, M/C will continue to trace the divisions and connections between them.\n          \n      References  \n      \n Trevor Batten. \"At the Crossroads of Cross Words and Crossed Meanings.\" Posting to M/C's Media-Culture mailing-list. 9 Sep. 2000. &lt;http://www.egroups.com/subscribe/media-culture/&gt;.\n         P.

    "title": "Welfare in the Future -",
    "abstract": "\n      On 29 September 1999, Senator Jocelyn Newman, the Australian Government's Minister for Family and Community Services, delivered a controversial address to the National Press Club in Canberra. The delivery had been delayed a week and it was widely rumoured that the Minister had been forced to remove some of the more controversial proposals (see Senate Question Time on 29 September, for instance). The speech, entitled \"The Future of Welfare in the 21st Century\", announced plans to tackle a supposed trend towards welfare dependency by creating an \"active\" rather than a \"passive\" welfare system set within the Government's policy of \"Mutual Obligation\": a system that focusses on \"capacity and ability\" (Newman para. 42) and \"what people can do\" rather than what they can't do (para. 44). This article, however, questions whether the welfare system projected for the future will be enabling for those who use it, or whether income-based social divisions will become further entrenched. \n      Since taking government in 1996, the Coalition's policies have included privatisation of previously government-run utilities and services and restructuring of the economy and industrial relations to assure Australia's place in 'globalisation'. Restructuring the welfare system is but the next step. Speeches such as this one are typically part of the process by which governments expound their 'vision' for the future, announce policy directions and generate public feedback and, had the speech not been delayed a week, it would normally have attracted considerably less attention. However, with the approaching 'end of the millennium' and increasing evidence that economic restructuring and globalisation are not benefiting everyone, debates about the integration of social and economic policies have been a concern for politicians, press and policy-makers for some time (see for instance reporting of the \"Australia Unlimited\" Conference). While party polling may indicate support for reform (McGregor 28) there is also a perception that society is becoming a \"meaner\" place (Dickens 22-3). \n      My method derives from the work of Teun A. van Dijk on ideological analysis. He maintains that ideologies function to co-ordinate the activities and thinking of group members so that the group's interests are protected and their goals realised (24). Our social identity is formed in part by our membership of particular groups. In talk and writing we promote the interests of our group by highlighting the positive things our group (the ingroup) has done and minimising or mitigating the negative things. Conversely, we highlight the negative aspects of those not in our group (the outgroup) and minimise their positive aspects (van Dijk 33). This type of analysis is designed to uncover group ideologies (26), not personal positions, and so when I attribute something to \"the Minister\" it is in her position as member of a group with social and political power whose interests are served by particular social and economic policies. I do not attribute it to Jocelyn Newman personally. \n      At the most obvious level, the Minister constructs the Government as ingroup and the Opposition as outgroup. She does this by highlighting the achievements of her government while highlighting the failures of the Opposition. For instance, paragraph six says: \n      ... the Howard Government has embarked upon a range of challenging and difficult policy agenda. We have reformed the tax system, so that it supports our new economic and social structures -- not those of the 1930s. We have reformed workplace relations in this country so that it supports the flexible and productive workplaces needed to provide jobs. As a result of our sound economic management, we have enjoyed strong, non-inflationary economic growth with low interest rates, and high employment growth. This is all the more remarkable when considered in the context of the Asian economic crisis. \n      By contrast, she says: \"the Opposition has failed to support responsible economic policy\" and implies that their policies amount to \"empty promises\" which would be damaging if carried through (para. 11). \n      There is ingroup/outgroup definition at a more subtle level also. The Minister uses \"we\" in paragraphs three to five to refer to a broad coalition of Government and community and presents the Government's own interests as being the interests of the broader group, thereby implying that they are really only one interest group when it comes to social and economic policy. Paragraph six reinforces this by showing that \"we\" (the community) have benefitted from the reforms that \"we\" (the Government) have embarked upon. This blurring of group boundaries between Government and community is also a way of shifting responsibility as I shall show shortly below. \n      Before that, it is informative to look at the way welfare recipients are classified. They are not described as doing anything positive. The exception is \"older women who have spent their lives caring for others\" (para. 35), but who are then characterised as \"uncertain\" and \"discouraged\" (para. 35). Caring for others (generally undervalued in our individualistic society) is to be seen as a limited-time option only, with work being the ultimate goal (para. 48-53). \n      Passivity and dependency are both devalued in our society -- praise is generally reserved for people who are active while \"economic security and independence\" (para. 9) are assumed to be everyone's goals. In the speech, however, people receiving welfare payments are defined in terms of: the welfare they receive (e.g. 53, 46, 39, 29, etc); their lack of income (e.g. 46, 15, etc.); their lack of paid work (e.g. 24, 25, 26,31, 33, 35, etc.); their age (e.g. 19, 23, 29, 35, 36, etc.); their family responsibilities (e.g. 24, 25, 26, 27, 35, etc); or their disabilities (e.g. 38, 39, 40, etc.). Even the words used are passive rather than active: \"people on passive welfare assistance\" rather than an active verb like \"claiming\" or even \"receiving\". Again, \"no adult in paid work\" (para. 24), \"out of paid work\" (para. 25), and \"worklessness\" (para. 26) are all attributes implying passivity. If she had used instead the expression 'non-working' it would at least imply the possibility of working, which is active. \n      The term dependency commonly has associations with childhood and addiction which partly carry over to the term \"welfare dependency\" used by the Minister to describe the state of those receiving income support. These people may still be part of the community (para. 31), but they are contrasted with the community proper: the taxpayers (para. 19) and \"hard working men and women of this country\" who underwrite them (para. 32). \n      The new welfare system places people receiving income support under obligation. They are expected to \"help themselves\" (para. 12, 13, 20), contribute to the economy and society (para. 12, 13), and \"use every opportunity to become self-supporting\" (para. 19). It becomes clear that the obligation on these people is to do whatever they can to get themselves into sufficient paid work so that they no longer need income support. The specified social contribution is minimal (para. 18, 48, 47, 37, 50). The duty of the responsible citizen is primarily economic -- to get a self-supporting job (para. 29-30). \n      As we have seen, then, the ingroup consists of the Government and those members of the community who have benefited from the Government's economic reforms. The outgroup consists of those people who, due to low wages or unemployment, are dependent on income support -- i.e. those who have not benefitted from the Government's economic reforms. \n      I now want to return to the matter of responsibility and the blurred boundaries between Government and community referred to above. The policies, reforms and initiatives are credited to the government (para. 15, 16, and 19 for example), but the responsibilities lie with \"the community\" and \"the individual\" (para. 17). \"The community\" is not a clearly defined entity, yet the Minister says that it \"must and should provide income support\" for those who cannot get a job despite their best efforts in the case of a genuine failure of the labour market (para. 31) -- a situation she has already claimed does not exist (para. 6). \n      Throughout the sections on \"People with disabilities\" and \"Parenting Payment\", the Minister uses \"we\" inclusively (Government and community) when talking about what should be done for 'them' and non-inclusively (Government only) when talking about specific programs (50). The effect, as mentioned above, is to assert that the interests of one are the interests of both, but also to transfer the responsibility for doing something for 'them' to the broader community group. Together with the statement that \"the community needs to think carefully and thoroughly\" about \"our\" approach to income support and assistance (38), this blurring of boundaries prepares for the announcement of a Reference Group to \"guide the development of a comprehensive Green Paper on welfare reform\" (54). This \"high-level\" group will be \"seeking submissions from interest groups and the broader community\" (56), but the terms of reference and ultimate policies will be set by the government. I would suggest that \"we\" is used strategically in this speech to create in ordinary community members a sense of inclusion, ownership and responsibility for policies in which they ultimately will have little say. But by transferring the sense of responsibility in this way, the government removes from itself total responsibility when those policies fail. \n      Will welfare in the coming years really be about enabling people to develop their capacities? I would suggest this is not possible while the people concerned are still conceptualised in terms of passivity and deficiency, and are regarded as not being part of 'our' group, not sharing 'our' interests. Rather, this speech projects a future where those who are self-supporting are encouraged to assume a position of superiority to those who are not, while their own interests are subsumed in the economic and social agendas of the Government. This speech also suggests a society where the only capacity that counts is the capacity to earn an income and people's responsibility to one another is limited to these terms. It seems clear that while the Government will continue to set the rules, it will continue to shirk provision of services, instead handing that responsibility to an ill-defined \"community\" and increasing the community's sense that those who receive welfare are somehow responsible for their own situation because they have not accepted their \"responsibility\" and \"obligation\" to help themselves. Is an economically driven, socially divided society what we want to create as we enter a new century? \n      \n      References \n      \n\"Australia Unlimited.\" Special Liftout.

    "abstract": "\n        The Issue of Gaming in Contemporary Culture \n        \n        \"Are we still in the game?\" This banal phrase gains a terrifying meaning in the last scene of Cronenberg's film eXistenZ, when a puzzled character, on the verge of being murdered, asks his potential killer if they are still inside a virtual reality game. The scene denotes the crucial place the issue of gaming is occupying in contemporary culture. If we take sci-fi movies less as an exercise of future divination and more as symptom of our current feelings projected into the future, we can easily see how games are becoming a frequent metaphor that sums up our fear of a world dominated by technology. Matrix, eXistenZ and quite a few other films draw on this haunting idea that technology can be evil and that reality may be just a high-tech game of which we are not aware. \n      In fact, life has often been thought of as a kind of 'divine play', with God either playing dice to decide our destiny or acting almighty over millions of voodoo dolls. The key difference in contemporary imaginary is that it is no longer God, but human beings (or machines and creatures designed by them) in charge of the game. Moreover, it is interesting to notice that this attachment of nightmarish meanings to games is happening exactly at a time when computers are becoming more than an ubiquitous tool for any purpose, and are acquiring an astonishing ability to accurately describe our environments and convincingly reproduce our bodily senses. The prospect of having a full, working, machinic simulation of the now-called 'real world', no matter how unattainable it might be, is giving a new face to the old free will dilemma: to what extent is life predeterminate and what is our space for creativity inside God's plot? In this context, the otherwise ancient and apparently innocent cultural activity of playing games has turned into this biased metaphor, in which the blurring of the borderline between life and game becomes a sinister menace. \n      The Nature of Games, Their Cultural Role and the Four Categories of Games \n      The question that crops up is why games were chosen to re-enact this ever-present human fear before the mysteries of the given world of nature. We know for sure that there is a convergence between game and culture, and that game principles are at the foundation of social institutions, as Huizinga has shown (46). He does not propose that culture is derived from games, but maintains that play is a key element at the beginning of culture, and continues to be an important feature as culture develops. But it is the French sociologist Roger Caillois who has devised a framework in which to approach play and games that can help us, contemporary gamers, to shed light on this question. \n      Caillois proposed four categories in which every known game can fit: games of chance, where the outcome results from fate rather than player's skills; games of vertigo, that aim to impose a disorder in the bodily senses; games of competition, in which adversaries are provided with an artificial equality at the outset and compete to show their superiority; and games of simulation, in which players create an imaginary universe and see themselves as someone else. However, games don't have to fit into one category only. Several games present a combination between the different types, though they always present one fundamental aspect that overshadows the others. These four categories can easily be extended to the field of computerised games: \n      \n      \ngames of chance -- random devices are simulated in the computer (dice, roulette etc); \n         games of vertigo -- games that draw on the use of metaphors such as the labyrinth and detective role-play, in which the player has to pursue a task through winding ways. Browsing and surfing are also frequent metaphors for this type of game; \n         games of competition -- the usual fighting and 'shoot-and-kill' games; \n         games of simulation -- use of development and management metaphor scenarios in which the player can nurture and manage the development of a system such as a town, a civilisation, or even a child as in some Japanese games.\n      \nA psychoanalytic interpretation of these four categories helps to get an even clearer picture of the role of games in contemporary culture. According to this theory, playing is a response to unconscious motivations, and games could fulfil a function similar to that of dreams, slips of the tongue and actions alike. Abadi proposes a direct psychoanalytic correlation for Caillois's categories: games of chance symbolise the death drive since it is a bet against destiny; games of vertigo, by pushing the senses to a radical level of disarrangement and ecstasy, denote the symbolisation of sexual intercourse; games of competition are related to the Oedipus complex -- the rivalry between parents and children, or amongst siblings; and games of simulation refers to the construction of identity, an occasion when players work out a way to shape their own identity roles (Abadi 85-93). \n      While Caillois's classification organises games in a more legible way, to read them through a psychoanalytic framework is to bring them into the realm of desire, or we could say, to the realm of language, or yet to be more precise, to the realm of language as the discourse of a desiring subject. But as an inhabitant of language \"the subject is not; he makes and unmakes himself in a complex topology where the other and his discourse are included\" (Kristeva 274). So as game and language converge, with this underlying presence of the Other, we can paraphrase Julia Kristeva and consider games as a signifying system in which, through demarcation, signification and communication, the player makes and unmakes him- or herself; in other words, a kind of radical rehearsal terrain where players can experiment with a playful reinvention of themselves. \n      In this light it is no surprise that games in general, and more specifically games of simulation, have acquired such a paramount role in our 'electronic age'. Confronted with a strange new technology, which is hard to understand because it works mainly at a microscopic level, and which brings up uneasy concepts such as 'virtual reality' and 'cyberspace' (a quasi-mythical ethereal space -- Wertheim 18), we seem to be going through an identity crisis. In the wilderness of this technological 'newfoundland', an uncomfortable paradise of simulation and cloning, the very essence of human identity, our free will, seems to be mercilessly seized in uncontrolled games, since we are unable to differentiate between computers as the Other and computer as a means to the Other. \n      Games as Scenarios for the Interplay of Determinism and Non-Determinism \n      However, the same metaphor of game can shift this scenario and revert itself into a tool to rethink the identity problem within our technological daily life, for what is at stake in a game is always the question of free will. The game is essentially a framework for uncertainty, allowing the co-existence of determinism and non-determinism: games of chance by definition include the idea of indeterminacy; games of vertigo deal with indeterminacy by inducing an uncontrollable confusion of the senses; games of competition include indeterminacy in the form of the unpredictable abilities of the competitors; games of simulation present a particular type of interplay between rule and indeterminacy, where the gap between the scripts/rules and the interpretation/gaming provides the sense of uniqueness each time it is performed/played. \n      Thus, if games and their probabilistic features are put to work in our favour, it would be an answer to a much searched metaphor, a theoretical ground to pervade contemporary culture allowing for creativity in a pre-determined technological environment. Then, the idea of life as gaming, instead of inspiring fear, can serve as a way to escape the false tyranny of a machine based on logic algorithms, without falling into the nihilism of a romantic refusal of a true information age. Precisely because computers are based in coherent and logical algorithms, coupled with game principles they can be a milieu for the delicate and complex interplay of determinism and non-determinism (Bijl). Computers would cease being this monstrous 'big Other', and simply would stand as an ethical tool, a technological mediated way for touching the Other (Cabral Filho and Szalapaj). \n      We then may be compelled not simply to rebuild or re-shape our identity, but to experiment and question the very idea of such a concept. By exploring the ambiguous and intricate gap between life as gaming and gaming as life, identity can be something that deals with the unknown, based on the always challenging idea of Otherness. As we leave the duty of coherence anchored in non-desiring machines (as Baudrillard has called computers), we are liberated to wander in auspicious new territories. Then, personality, gender, race, colour, and other aspects that were formerly associated with an ideal and immutable image, can become rather playful zones of experimentation. As an open field, identity may be just a nuance in a multitude of flipping horizons. Yet, as freedom is never an easy place to dwell, a disturbing question arises: will it after all be less scary? \n          \n      References \n      \n Abadi, Mauricio. \"Psychoanalysis of Playing.\" Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics 15 (1967): 85-93.      \n        Baudrillard, Jean.

    "abstract": "\n      If we consider learning as a meaning-making process where people construct shared knowledge, it becomes a social dialogical activity in which knowledge is the result of an active process of articulation and reflection within a context (Jonassen et al.). An important element of this belief is that conversation is at the core of learning because knowledge is language-mediated. Within this context, what makes a conversation worthwhile and meaningful is how it is structured, how it is managed by the participants, and most importantly, how it is understood. In particular, conversation is essential in learning situations where the main goal is to generate a new understanding of the world (Bruner). Thus, if conversations can be seen as support for learning processes, the question then becomes how synchronous textual spaces mediate conversation and how chat affects learning.\n      Experienced Teachers Learning in a Collaborative Virtual Environment\n      We studied two different groups of experienced teachers from Kindergarten to Grade 12 (K-12) attending a Master of Education course entitled \"Curriculum and Instruction\". They communicated through a collaborative virtual environment (CVE) designed to enhance teachers' professional development: TAPPED IN™ (TI). We recorded their on-line conversations over six weeks. The teachers met twice a week for a two hour session and the data collected consisted of approximately 350-400 pages of text from transcripts. The following concerns, gleaned from an ongoing analysis of on-line conversations are of interest for this paper:\n      \n      \nThe first concern has to do with the ability of teachers to concentrate on a task while managing multiple simultaneous conversations. The question is how to maintain the focus on the purpose of the goal oriented task.  The second concern is related to the technical characteristics of a CVE and the teachers' feelings of being lost, too slow, or not understanding the point of the discussion. The question is how to deal with this confusion when the aim is to construct meanings from online discussion? \n        The third concern is related the preceding points. It is concerned with the importance of a leader coaching and guiding experienced teachers online. \n      \nWe examined these three concerns, using TI during the teachers' on line discussions. Our primary goal in the analysis was to determine i) whether the teachers could conduct their learning activities through TI and ii) how goal-oriented conversations might be affected by the constraints of TI. The following examples come from a personal recorder. Messages are numbered in order to show their position in the session and to show the distance between the messages sent.\n      Implications of Multitasking in Learning Sessions\n      In CVEs, participants have the possibility of performing several tasks simultaneously (Holmevik). This is especially true when participants hold more than one conversation at a time. Participants can talk to one person or to the whole group while also chatting privately with people in the same CVE's room, in the same CVE or even in other CVEs. But the possibility of being able to participate in multiple conversations becomes potentially confusing and disorienting for teachers wanting to achieve a specific task.\n      Let us give an example of how a main task (e.g. to share notes of pedagogical projects -- task 1) fragments into different tasks (e.g. learning a command -- how to create a note -- task 2; and socialise, express feelings and play with cows -- task 3).\n      (Note that the students are in fact experienced teachers and a teacher is leading the session. The goal of the on-line session is to read and discuss the different educational projects that the students should have written in virtual notes.)\n      \n      The goal of the task became difficult to accomplish for teachers who were suddenly involved in more than one task at a time. In order to understand what is going on in this situation, participants had to accomplish extra work. They needed to filter messages and rank them to make the main objective of the session clear. In a goal-oriented session such as this, it is extremely important to keep track of the task as well as to concentrate on one activity at time. This entails a necessity to understand current threads in order to contribute to the object of interest for them as individuals and as a group member.\n      Implications of Multi Threads and Floor-Taking in Goal-Oriented Conversations\n      Perseverance with each message creates a parallelism that can become extremely disorienting to participants who intend to produce new understandings and not just maintain an awareness during on-line conversations.\n      \n      The larger the number of participants in a conversation, the more likely it is for fragmentation to occur. The jumbled and quickly scrolling screen can be quite disconcerting. Yet as mentioned by Mynatt et al., even between two participants, multi-threading is common due to the overlapping composition of conversational turns. Participants write simultaneously and the host computer sends the messages out sequentially. Under these conditions, competing conversational threads emerge continuously. It becomes difficult to know who actually holds the floor at the time.\n      Here is an example showing a teacher -- student 2 -- looking for attention and trying to read and understand others' answers to his questions:\n      \n      Student 2 did not read message 26 sent from the teacher with care. In fact, the teacher did explain that there is a part in the assignment where students have to meet in order to exchange ideas about individual projects. Yet although S2's question was answered, S2 still did not understand. A possible reason is that S2 could have been focussed on writing the next question.\n      \n      Again, the teacher answered the question asked in message 29. However, S2 still did not understand in spite of S15 and S6 confirming that the teacher had already covered the question.\n      \n      Student 2 finally understood when the teacher addressed him directly and repeated what the other students had said before. In order to be heard, the students repeated their questions until they had the answer from the teacher. With more than a handful of participants, this attention seeking strategy may make on-line conversations confusing. Goal-oriented conversations then easily degenerate, as mentioned by Colomb and Simutis. These authors point out that one of the most common problems in using CMC is keeping students on task. Even experienced teachers do not escape from the possibility of converting from an instrumental discussion to a social one due to different misunderstanding between interlocutors.\n      To be able to 'send' a message is not equivalent to claiming the 'floor'. An important extra task that teachers have to do in CVEs before sending a message is to think about how it meets the goal of the discussion. Looking for coherence and understanding is a must in learning situations and this becomes a great challenge in online learning sessions.\n      On the other hand, different modalities of communication in CVEs may add richness and depth to online conversations when participants can anticipate constraints. Consider another group of teachers. They are discussing readings, and make great use of multiple modalities, such as gestures, to reframe misunderstandings. These gestures provide back channel information and other visual signs.\n      Here is one example of what a group of teachers does in order to avoid embarrassing situations.\n      \n      As Mynatt et al. express, \"the availability of multiple modalities gives complexity to the interactional rhythm, because people have choices about what modality to use at any particular moment and for any set of conversation partners\" (138).\n      Given these pros and cons of CVEs, the challenge of holding an on-line educational discussion requires the teachers to reestablish the context and control the underlying the sense of the conversation. This challenge could be also regarded as an exigency of the medium that 'invites' teachers to structure their conversations in order to encourage meaningful discussions.\n      Importance of a Teacher of Teachers\n      The problems mentioned earlier may be solved more easily when there is a leader at hand. Since these difficulties mainly arise at the start of learning the communication environment, it might be proposed that a leader is most critical in this phase. A comparison of two groups' interactions with and without a leader supports the intuition that a leader is crucial for keeping the learning on track even though the participants are experienced teachers.\n      In this example, the task that the group performed was the same: \"learning to attach an icon to their ellipses representing their presence in the system\".\n      Table 1. Data related to groups with and without a teacher \n      \n\nGroups\n          Learners\n          Icons attached\n          Messages produced\n          Time employed\n        \n\n1. Without leader \n          12\n          0\n          549\n          56 min 8 sec\n        \n\n\n             \n            2. With leader\n\n          9\n          4\n          644\n          1h 27min 52 sec \n        \n\n\n\nFig. 1 Comparing flow and categories of the messages sent by the groups\n    These frequencies confirm that teachers without a leader have more problems than the group with a leader. The number of successful icons attached by the groups (0 and 4 icons) demonstrates this claim. What happens is that the number of messages related to 'Task' decrease and those related to 'Relation' increase when there is no leader present -- a result which would be unsurprising among most people who have worked in 'real' classrooms. Messages produced and coded as 'Playing' and 'Feedback' also show a considerable difference between groups. Finally, categories such as 'Whisper' and 'Artifact' present in comparison to the others minimal differences between groups.\n    A leader is a must for the smooth development of on-line conversation. The leader is a sort of mediator between the pedagogical task of the on-line conversation and what appears on the screen. The leader's task is to show which threads are important to follow or not and how messages should be read on the screen. Like an orchestra conductor, the leader coordinates tasks and makes sense of individual actions which are part of a common product and the quality of the on-going conversation.\n    Discussion \n    This ongoing research has demonstrated three important concerns surrounding experienced teachers' professional use of CVE.\n    First, teachers chatting online have to anticipate the lack of assurance \"that what gets sent gets read\" and that gaining the floor in a CVE is \"that one's message draws a response and in some way affect the direction of a current thread\" (Colomb and Simutis). Teachers have to learn to negotiate turn-taking sequences behind the screen. When chatting, a person's intention to speak is not signalled. Overlapping and interruptions do not exist and non-verbal communication requires knowledge of gesture commands. Negotiating turns in online conversations is concerned with how people express information and what they express. In educational discussion, turns are generally taken when messages either present a good formulation of ideas, express controversial thinking, raise an issue that allows someone else to participate, or provide knowledge on the topic at hand.\n    Second, teachers should learn to collaborate in online conversations. It is essential to be aware that people are writing a text while they discuss. The quality of the conversation will depend on one hand, how teachers manage the discussion and, on the other hand, the opinions they elaborate together. \n    Third, teachers need leaders in online discussions. A leader has to be able to anticipate the text that the participants are writing. The leader has the responsibility of meeting pedagogical goals with a participant's messages. The leader has to show the coherence or incoherence of the discussion and raise issues that improve the level of the written interaction. \n    These issues are extremely important in a context where people learn through conversations.\n    As Laurillard has mentioned, \"academic knowledge relies heavily on symbolic representation as the medium through which it is known. ... Students have to learn to handle the representations system as well as the ideas they represent\" (27). Therefore, it is necessary that learners know and think about the rules of online discussion in order to adapt technical commands and effects to their needs. But these rules are in contrast to what participants expect from online conversations. Teachers want to perform their tasks with support of a computer program; they do not want to learn the computer program per se. \n    CMC in learning activities must be based, not on visionary claims about technology as an all-purpose tool for automatic teaching/learning, but on specific accounts of how and why the technology affects the user's achievement of specific goals.\n          \n    Acknowledgements\n    This study has been supported by a grant from the Swedish Transport &amp; Communication Research Board. We wish to express our gratitude to Judi Fusco, who, in several ways, has been a bridge between the TI community and us. We also want to thank the teachers, CharlesE and FlorenceE, for having the courage of letting Tessy 'sit in' on the sessions. The 'expert' session was lead by TerryG, whom we also want to thank for her generosity. Susan Wildermuth came to us in the final spurt, and we owe her much for the reliability check, structuring of ideas, and hints about related research.

    "abstract": "\n        1. Introduction: How the word 'chat' can be demeaning \n        \n        I think the editors mean the word 'chat' to be something of a tease. They remind us that to call something 'chat' might be to strip it of anything more serious or substantial it might be doing and, by extension, to weaken pretty well all talk. It joins 'mere talk', 'rhetoric', 'chatter' and of course 'gossip', with the pungent flavouring of sexism as an added extra. It seems that chat is limp, directionless, passive. Whoever gets to call something 'chat' has scored a win in a battle.\n      Let's just stay with this image for a moment. Suppose it is a rhetorical victory. Scored for which side? In a battle against who or what? Well, for a commonsense view of the world that rates objects over practices, things over their descriptions, and facts over the discovery of facts. And that commonsense view, of course, is the high street version of tangled scholars' web of philosophies -- realism, materialism and essentialism. But breathe easy, because I'm not going to get us stuck in that web. All I want to do is point out -- as has long been pointed out before, especially by feminists taking a cool look at 'female language' - that some uses of the word 'chat' betray a very old-fashioned view of language. To call this edition of M/C 'Chat' is to examine that attitude. The editors want to rate practices over objects, descriptions over what they describe, and the act of discovery over what is discovered. Or at least, even if one doesn't all want to go that far, to redress the balance a little in each case. \n      The attitude the editors want to correct is a rather complacent one. It takes people's exchange of talk as just that; as a means of transmitting what's in one person's head into the head of the other person, more or less. Inefficient, noisy and unreliable, but fixable by technology. This is, of course the 'conduit' metaphor so devastatingly unmasked by Reddy in 1979. But it would be good to see some actual examples of real people really using the word; all this has been rather hypothetical so far. In fact, what we shall find is a bit of a paradox. It turns out, if I can prefigure the action, that when people use the word 'chat' to decribe some stretch of talk, what they want to do (at least in the data I have) is not to sneer at it -- quite the contrary. \n      But it is nevertheless highly rhetorical. It does a job. The speaker tends to use it to promote a description of a warm, informal and above all blameless event, just when there might be reason to believe that in fact something rather different would be more accurate. \n      2. How to analyse talk as consequential? \n      Let me pause for a moment. Soon I shall be doing a quick survey of some examples of actual live usage of the word. I should say, in parenthesis, that M/C offered me the wonderful opportunity of actually having a link to an audio sample of these extracts, and had the data come from public sources (say from talk radio or a political speech) then I would have jumped at the chance. That way you would have been able yourself to catch the flavour of the talk undiluted by transcription conventions and the overwhelming blandness of print. But all the extracts I shall use in the article are from private conversations, the participants in which didn't give permission for their voices to be broadcast, so I'm afraid that opportunity must be passed up. \n      But given I have transcripts, what now? How to think about language-in-use? Obviously, I have to put my money where my mouth is and treat them not like 'chat' in that demeaning, inconsequential caricature I mentioned at the beginning (and against which this whole issue of M/C is dedicated). What are the broad alternatives available? There are, loosely speaking, two sorts of things one could do, familiar to all students of language. A couple of images will be helpful, if a bit crude. \n      The first is the pearl necklace. Here, the interesting things about the talk are its content (pearls or ivory pieces?) and its setting (one string? two?). Less fancifully, the interest is in asking: what words, what speakers, what occasion? You can trace that from William Labov and his street-level sociolinguistics (1972), or further back if you want to. What you get is a thorough rejection of the words + settings = chat. You discover, by empirical comparison of what words in what settings, such thorough non-'chat' states of affairs as social location, social discourses and social power. \n      If the pearl necklace doesn't appeal -- it seems a bit static perhaps -- then how about the origami bird? In its prior life as undistinguished flat sheet of paper it fails to command much attention. It's the transformation that fascinates. You have to fold it up to produce it, and you have to fold it up in a certain way if you don't want it to produce an aeroplane or a hat or just a disaster. The interesting things, of course, are the details (which side do you fold first? where do you tuck?) and how that produces the beautiful end result. Or, less fancifully, the sequential structure of talk in interaction, how one part supports and constrains the next and how a stretch of it achieves social goals (beautiful or otherwise). \n     Now for the rest of the paper I'm going to try a bit of origami, or rather, some origami-in-reverse. I'm going to try and get across the spirit of Conversation Analysis and, without spraying around too many technical terms (indeed, any, if I can help it) I'm going to take a stretch of talk and see how it folds and tucks together to make it what it is. Doing that will, I hope, show up things about it that might pass unnoticed otherwise). Readers whose fancy is tickled for this sort of thing might well want to have a look at the references at the end of the article to take it all further. \n     3. Example 1. \"about two years ago I came round an':: (..) spent some time chattin' didn't we\" \n     Let's make a start with this case. Here we have an encounter between a psychologist and a person he is about to interview. The interview proper hasn't actually started yet, and we can read the lines below as the interviewer 'working up to' the start of the interview proper. Part of it is to remind MA that the psychologist had seen him before. Notice how the psychologist uses the word 'chatting' to describe that earlier encounter.\n     \n     In line 11, MR describes his previous encounter as involving \"chattin'. Maybe it did, maybe it didn't. I know I shouldn't be calling in evidence which the reader can't get hold of, but Mark Rapley, the psychologist involved (and with whom I worked on the analysis; see Rapley and Antaki) pointed to that line and said to me that ('in fact') his previous dealings with MA, far from being 'chatting', had been a formal administration of a questionnaire, with all the paraphernalia of paper and pencil, and strict question and answer rights and obligations, all going down on the record. \"Chattin'\"? \n      Calling it \"chattin'\" obliterates all that in favour of something altogether more homely and friendly. Look at what team of players it's sent out onto the field with: he \"came round\" (rather, than, say, 'paid an official visit') and \"spent some time\" (rather than 'completed my business'. They did it together -- hence the \"didn't we?\" The psychologist was \"jus' (..) watchin' what was going on\" -- not intervening, merely casually watching the world go by; note also the dropped g's. Now he's back to \"see how you were gettin' on\" (rather than 'administer a standardised assessment questionnaire'\"). What an assembly. \n      I'm trying to leave off any guess at what the interviewer's intentions or motives are -- we just can't know such things. But we can certainly have something to say about the effects his words give off. The origami structure that emerges from the folding is one of the 'chat' having been an interaction off the record, personal and friendly; all hearably at odds with the business the interviewer is officially prosecuting. \n      4. Example 2: \"what Tim does (.) which is come and chat\" \n      Here is a very similar case, this time in a committee meeting: \n      \n      Again, I'll briefly gloss the scene (based on the previous talk, and visible in such terms as 'matters arising', the thanks expressed by one speaker to another, and the \"we turn to\" topic change in line 19/20). A committee meeting is in session, and AC is touting for new names to replace a member who is leaving. Committee membership is, by definition, something that is carefully regulated in standing orders and by convention, and is quite capable of being described in the most off-putting bureaucratic language (as it might be, say, were an errant member being disciplined for some infraction or other, and the thing became legalistic). Here it isn't. How does AC fold it up? \n      AC in lines 1 to 9 is working up a request for other to nominate candidates to replace Tim Brown (all names are of course pseudonyms). We leave aside consideration of how he folds his talk so as to make the request as he does (rather than, say, deliver it as a petulant blast against his colleagues for not having provided him with any names so far). Our interest is in how the folds involve the description 'chat'. Like the psychologist interviewer in extract [1], AC bundles the 'chat' word into a description of the whole scene -- that the postgraduate representative will \"come and chat,\" and that the interviewer \"came round an':: (..)spent some time chattin'\". \n      To bundle up the description with the act of arrival is an elegantly efficient way of implying that this is the person's interest and motive in the interaction -- what they're there for. This way any candidate member can be reassured that the thing is much less onerous, official and formal than it would have sounded had AC used the bureaucratic description buried away in the Committee statutes. 'Chat', in this fold of the talk, works to eliminate the consequentiality and offputtingness of the event -- even though, of course, when the new member is inducted onto the Committee, he or she will be subject to all the dread rules and regulations that lurk in the other, hidden bureaucratic description. \n      5. Example 3: \"we sat and chatted til about eleven\" \n      Here is another case, where, probably because the setting is not as institutional as in the first two, working out what 'chat' is doing will take us a bit more work. \n      \n      First the gloss. Gordon is on the phone to Danielle and talking about what he was doing the other night - we could dwell a little on his description of his guitar performance ('it went down really well') but we'll skip straight to where \"chatted\" appears. Unlike the previous two cases, it isn't bundled up with arrival at the scene (\"come and chat\" and \"I came round an':: (..)spent some time chattin'\"), but it does still get bundled with something -- sitting -- which parcels it up nicely as a combination-verb, something done while doing something else. Gordon and the others had no plans here; the food and wine had been consumed, then \"we sat (0.3) an:' chatted (0.4) til: about eleven\". \n      Now what does such a description do for his then being struck by the thought that he'd go home and 'just phone her' (\".hh then I thought (0.3) I'll come back (0.3) an' I'll jus' jus' phone you t'say that uh I'd like t'see you\")? It's a magnificent play of accountability -- it holds off a collection of implications which might damage the tender sentiment presumably involved in wanting to tell someone you'd like to see them. Sitting and chatting is (notwithstanding the wine) not being drunk; it's with other people, so it's not sad-sack lonely rumination; still less is it insistent, stalking, recriminative or even violent obsession. Thinking of Danielle after (merely) being with others sitting and chatting till eleven disarms all of those possibilities; as the discursive psychologists have it (Edwards and Potter 1992) , this is a piece of 'stake management'. Gordon is inoculating himself against being seen to have the wrong sort of motivations. 'Chat' here is used as a part of a positive rhetorical strategy to have sentiments, but of the right sort. \n      6. Example 4: \"I said to him, you know, come down 'n have a chat with me\" \n      One last example to see us out. This time we are in a marital counselling session, and the husband's ('Jeff') exams have been part of the topic of conversation, which I will gloss as being about the attention each partner pays to the other. 'Mary' now speaks. \n      \n      Once again the speaker is exploiting the pleasantly unspecific glow that 'chat' can have. Mary wanted Jeff to come down from 'upstairs' and 'have a chat' with her. Against this she puts words in his mouth: \"I've gotta start my revising,\" and then her own commentary -- it was the same \"every ni:ght, (.) for o:hh ye:ars.\", regular as clockwork and at decidedly antisocial hours. She \"never had anyone to ta:lk to\" as a consequence. So the hearer is faced with Jeff's choice -- to come down from upstairs (remote, cold) and have a chat with Mary; or pursue his mechanical, laborious, self-centred and inconsiderate regime. There is, in her description, no contest; hence Jeff comes out looking something of a cold fish. Here is a lovely example of 'chat' once again being a good thing, loading the dice in the speaker's favour. \n      7. Concluding comments \n      I started out saying that the word 'chat' was something of an insult. That certainly might apply when the word is used (or might be used, or is allegedly used) in a discussion about human action, and someone who wants to push the 'real', the 'material' and the 'consequential' might use 'chat' to dismiss an opponent who wants words to be responsible for some rather substantial things: reality, materiality and consequentiality. \n      But there's a nice paradox. When you do take words seriously as doing things, and you look for what 'chat' does in people's actual usage, you find that it isn't an insult. Far from it. In the four cases we looked at the speaker was using 'chat' as a basically pleasant, socially positive and blameless description. Of course, they were doing so for rhetorical purposes, as words always are. But nevertheless there's a paradox there. In the abstract, nasty; in actuality, nice. The one thing that's constant is the fact that, in our analyses, both the hypothetical insulters and our actual glossers are using the word. \n      In the mouths of both parties 'chat' is an interested description, as the discursive psychologists have it, following the tradition established by Garfinkel and, especially, Harvey Sacks (see, for example, the compendious Lectures on Conversation). It is always heard as a contrast (implicit or not) with something else, and does its work that way. Like it or not, 'chat' is no polite cipher. If you look at how it's folded and manipulated into the interaction, you see how it will smooth a potentially difficult interview, naturalise a possibly unwelcome encounter or set up a loaded distinction againt something mechanical and self-interested. All human life is here. If anyone needed persuading that 'chat' isn't chat, then the examples we've looked at here might have gone some way to doing so. \n          \n      References  \n\n      \nAtkinson, J. M., and J.

    "abstract": "\n      In \"Speed and Information: Cyberspace Alarm!\", Paul Virilio claims that telecommunications are ushering in the \"invention of a perspective of real time\" which results in \"some kind of choking of the senses, a loss of control over reason\". As users of this new technology, as the receptors of the stream of computer-mediated information, we need to figure out the terms and conditions of our acceptance of cyberspace as a space and realtime as a form of time, to understand the implications of this new mode of communication, for \"no information exists without dis-information\".\n      In \"Speed and Information: Cyberspace Alarm!\", Paul Virilio claims that telecommunications are ushering in the \"invention of a perspective of real time\" which results in \"some kind of choking of the senses, a loss of control over reason\". As users of this new technology, as the receptors of the stream of computer-mediated information, we need to figure out the terms and conditions of our acceptance of cyberspace as a space and realtime as a form of time, to understand the implications of this new mode of communication, for \"no information exists without dis-information\".\n      Even Virilio proclaims apocalyptically that \"our history will happen in universal time, itself the outcome of instantaneity -- and there only\". In fact, time also governs narrative choices: their availability, viability, desirability, relevance. Despite the hype surrounding the instantaneity of virtual travel, narrative in cyberspace is inherently subordinate to connection speed and loadtime. This is why the \"loading screen\" has become the standard welcome on Shockwave-heavy sites, developing into a kind of mini-genre of low-bandwidth animation. The possiblity of using temporality as a narrative catalyst has been exploited in cinema, as in classic Hollywood dissolves and fades. Metaphors of the passing of time are a familiar cliche: the pages of a daily calendar fluttering away, the changing of the seasons. Stanley Kubrick's bold cut from a spinning bone to a space station in orbit in 2001: A Space Odyssey is an extreme and unusual example of this sort of metaphor. These all function as temporal ellipses. \n      The passage of time can also function as plot, as in Warhol's Blow Job and Richard Linklater's Slacker, both of which are ostensibly about merely the passage of time. Slacker lacks a traditional narrative and instead progresses through a series of vignettes, each one following seemingly random characters through seemingly random events (an idea developed further by the recent Magnolia). The change from one vignette to the next is motivated simply by the camera's movement from one character or event to another. The camera is like a nosy passerby, a voyeur, showing noncommittal interest in one thing, then another, and the viewer must give up interest in each vignette without the satisfaction of narrative closure. As the filmmaker tells the cabdriver in the beginning, each turn of events, each decision made, results in all possibilities going on to live out their potential realities. We, the viewers, in turn, follow the camera's gaze with the frustrating knowledge that other, unresolved realities are continuing without that gaze. The recent Timecode uses the same hypertext-type approach with four simultaneous screens, each a single shot capturing one part of an interlocked world. These are all extreme, overt examples of Deleuze's time-image. \n      Online, similar moves have been made in Mark Napier's Shredder and Maciej Wisniewski's Netomat interfaces. Both function as alternatives to conventional browsing, Netomat even labelled an \"anti-browser\" that engages \"an Internet that is an intelligent application and not simply a large database of static files\". \n      The above-mentioned devices for manipulating the perception and understanding of time as represented in film (fade, dissolve, et al.) exploited an inherently filmic problem: simply put, that there is a serious discrepancy between time as it happens and its perception, much like the time it takes to enjoy a Website's multimedia content and the length of its download. In the case of the fade, for instance, an inherent problem of the medium has been internalised in a non-transparent way and used overtly to further the narrative meaning. Likewise, the \"loading screen\" offers a morsel of content typically focussed on its function (\"loading... 5 seconds to go...\"). The existence of these filmic conventions makes us aware of when they are broken, as in the \"realtime\" films Nick of Time, Blow Job, and Timecode, and also in instances of extended time, as in the classic shower scene in Hitchcock's Psycho. Think, too, of the last time you had to wait before you saw any of a Website's content. \n      Just as filmic time is typically compressed for the sake of appearing real, navigational movement on the Web is in fact constrained while seeming free, and delayed while seeming instantaneous. The promise of instant access has instead been fulfilled by erratic connection speeds and server problems. Because Web time ostensibly passes almost in an instant (this is, after all, the industry in which a product might become passé while still at the beta phase), information ages just as quickly: \"404 File not found\" is a familiar sight, telling us that the link we followed may have been coded, not last year, but maybe even last week, or yesterday. Information loses relevance, even disappears, often in no time at all. These problems have been exploited by JODI, whose experimental online work foregrounds the nuts and bolts (and kinks) of the Web, instead of hiding it beneath a clean \"other\" design. The desirability of information over time is also the focus of Rhizome's Starry Night interface which, utilizing Java, shifts over time to emphasise popular links, eventually eradicating unpopular ones. \n      In The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, Walter Benjamin writes that \"even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be\" (220). But what of the Web art project, whose existence on a server somewhere does not need to be known for the work to be understood, whose duplication yields a copy that is indistinguishable from the original? What of the work that is both static and temporal, which is inherently mediated through time, including time (as in server and connection speed) which cannot be completely accounted for by the author? He goes on to say that technical reproduction \"enables the original to meet the beholder halfway\" (220), but what is the Website's point of departure? Its creator's computer? The server on which it lives? The end user's computer? How can we map the path from the \"original\" to its \"reproduction\" when the two are indistinguishable, when, in fact, there is no confirmable original? \n     As if in response to Benjamin, Paul Virilio writes in \"Speed and Information: Cyberspace Alarm!\" that \"the specific negative aspect of these information superhighways is precisely this loss of orientation regarding alterity (the other), this disturbance in the relationship with the other and with the world\". Virilio is concerned with the problem of orientation, that is, of the lack of geographical, historical, and temporal specificity and point of reference when experiencing a Web-based narrative. Compare that to Deleuze's claim that, in the time-image, \"the brain has lost its Euclidean co-ordinates, and now emits other signs\" (278), a notion similar to the \"loading screen\", a bit of content which exists merely to inform that content is forthcoming. Virilio sees this as a crucial problem facing us today and adds that \"there is talk of substituting the term 'global' by 'glocal,' a concatenation of the words local and global\". \n      \n      The Internet yields both seeming temporal instantaneity and spatial compression. We can be everywhere all at once, all the time; but what of the inevitable slippage of time involved? The World Wide Web has created a life of dead moments, of moments spent waiting for the instantaneous to happen. \n          \n      References\n      \n Baudrillard, Jean. \"Radical Thought.\" Trans.

    "abstract": "\n        Introduction -- Making Sense of the (Virtual) World\n        Computer games are never \"just games\". Computer games are models of reality and if they were not, we would never be able to understand them. Models serve three functions; they capture important, critical features of that which is to be represented while ignoring the irrelevant, they are appropriate for the person and they are appropriate for the task -- thereby enhancing the ability to make judgements and discover relevant regularities and structures (Norman 1993). \n      Despite the inherently unvisualisable nature of computer code -- the flexible material of which all software constructs are built -- computer code is still the most \"salient\" ingredient in computer games. Less salient are those assumptions that are \"built into\" the software. By filtering out those parts of reality that are deemed irrelevant or unnecessary, different sorts of assumptions, different sorts of bias are automatically built into the software, reified in the very computer code (Friedman 1995, Friedman and Nissenbaum 1997). \n      Here I will analyse some of the built-in structures that constitute the fabric of a special sort of game, a MUD. A MUD is an Internet-accessible \"multi-participant, user-extensible virtual reality whose user interface is entirely textual\" (Curtis, 1992). The specific MUD in question is a nine-year old Swedish-language adventure MUD called SvenskMUD (\"SwedishMUD\") that is run by Lysator, the academic computer club at Linköping University, Sweden. I have done field studies of SvenskMUD over a period of three and a half years (Pargman, forthcoming 2000). \n      How is the SvenskMUD adventure world structured and what are the rules that are built into the fabric of this computer game? I will describe some of the ways in which danger and death, good and evil, courage, rewards and wealth are handled in the game. I will conclude the paper with a short analysis of the purpose of configuring the player according to those structures. \n      \n      Revocable Deaths \n      Characters (personae/avatars) in SvenskMUD can be divided into two categories, players and magicians. Making a career as a player to a large part involves solving quests and killing \"monsters\" in the game. The magicians are all ex-players who have \"graduated\" and gone beyond playing the game of SvenskMUD. They have become the administrators, managers and programmers of SvenskMUD. A watchful eye is kept on the magicians by \"God\", the creator, owner and ultimate custodian of SvenskMUD. \n      My own first battle in the game, in a sunlit graveyard with a small mouse, is an example of a bit-sized danger suitable for newcomers, or \"newbies\". I correctly guessed that the mouse was a suitably weak opponent for my newborn character, but still had to \"tickle\" the mouse on its belly (a euphemism for hitting it without much force) 50 times before I managed to kill it. Other parts of this epic battle included 45 failed attempts of mine to \"tickle\" the mouse, 39 successful \"tickles\" of the mouse and finally a wild chase around the graveyard before I caught up with the mouse, cornered it and managed to kill it and end the fight. Although I was successful in my endeavour, I was also more than half dead after my run-in with the mouse and had to spend quite some time engaged in more peaceful occupations before I was completely healed. It was only later that I learned that you can improve your odds considerably by using weapons and armour when you fight... \n      Should a SvenskMUD player fail in his (or less often, her) risky and adventurous career and die, that does not constitute an insurmountable problem. Should such a thing pass, the player's ghost only has to find the way back to a church in one of the villages. In the church, the player is reincarnated, albeit with some loss of game-related abilities and experience. \n      The way the unfortunate event of an occasional death is handled is part of the meta-rules of SvenskMUD. The meta-rules are the implicit, underlying rules that represent the values, practices and concerns that shape the frame from which the \"ordinary\" specific rules operate. Meta-rules are part of the \"world view that directs the game action and represents the implicit philosophy or ideals by which the world operates\" (Fine 1983, 76). Despite the adventure setting with all its hints of medieval lawlessness and unknown dangers lurking, SvenskMUD is in fact a very caring and forgiving environment. The ultimate proof of SvenskMUD's forgiveness is the revocable character of death itself.\n      Fair Dangers \n      Another SvenskMUD meta-rule is that dangers (and death) should be \"fair\". This fairness is extended so as to warn players explicitly of dangers. Before a dangerous monster is encountered, the player receives plenty of warnings: \n      \n      You are standing in the dark woods.\n       You feel a little afraid. \n       East of you is a small dark lake in the woods. \n      There are three visible ways from here: east, north and south.\n      It would be foolish to direct my character to go east in this situation without being adequately prepared for encountering and taking on something dangerous in battle. Those preparations should include a readiness to flee if the expected danger proves to be superior. If, in the example above, a player willingly and knowingly directs a character to walk east, that player has to face the consequences of this action. But if another player is very cautious and has no reason to suspect a deadly danger lurking behind the corner, it is not considered \"fair\" if that player's character dies or is hurt in such a way that it results in damage that has far-reaching consequences within the game.\n      The dangerous monsters that roam the SvenskMUD world are restricted to roam only \"dangerous\" areas and it is considered good manners to warn players in some way when they enter such an area. Part of learning how to play SvenskMUD successfully becomes a matter of understanding different cues, such as the transition from a safe area to a dangerous one, or the different levels of danger signalled by different situations. Should they not know it in advance, players quickly learn that it is not advisable to enter the \"Valley of Ultimate Evil\" unless they have reached a very high level in the game and are prepared to take on any dangers that come their way. \n      As with all other meta-rules, both players and magicians internalise this rule to such an extent that it becomes unquestionable and any transgression (such as a dangerous monster roaming around in a village, killing newbie characters who happen to stray its way) would immediately render complaints from players and corresponding actions on behalf of the magicians to rectify the situation. \n      Meta-Rules as \"Folk Ideas\" \n      Fine (1983, 76-8) enumerates four meta-rules that Dundes (1971) has described and applies them to the fantasy role-playing games he has studied. Dundes's term for these meta-rules is \"folk ideas\" and they reflect existing North American (and Western European) cultural beliefs. Fine shows that these folk ideas capture core beliefs or central values of the fantasy role-playing games he studied. Three of Dundes's four folk ideas are also directly applicable to SvenskMUD. \n      Unlimited Wealth \n      The first folk idea is the principle of unlimited good. There is no end to growth or wealth. For that reason, treasure found in a dungeon doesn't need a rationale for being there. This folk idea is related to the modernist concept of constant, unlimited progress. \n      \"Some referees even 'restock' their dungeons when players have found a particular treasure so that the next time someone enters that room (and kills the dragon or other beasties guarding it) they, too, will be rewarded\" (Fine 1983, 76). To restock all treasures and reawaken all killed monsters at regular intervals is standard procedure in SvenskMUD and all other adventure MUDs. The technical term is that the game \"resets\". The reason why a MUD resets at regular intervals is that, while the MUD itself is finite, there is no end to the number of players who want their share of treasures and other goodies. The handbook for SvenskMUD magicians contains \"design guidelines\" for creating quests: \n      You have to invent a small story about your quest. The typical scenario is that someone needs help with something. It is good if you can get the story together in such a way that it is possible to explain why it can be solved several times, since the quest will be solved, once for each prospective magician. Perhaps a small spectacle a short while after (while the player is pondering the reward) that in some way restore things in such a way that it can be solved again. (Tolke 1993, my translation) \n      Good and Evil \n      The second folk idea is that the world is a battleground between good and evil. In fantasy literature or a role-playing game there is often no in-between and very seldom any doubt whether someone encountered is good or evil, as \"referees often express the alignment [moral character] of nonplayer characters through stereotyped facial features or symbolic colours\" (Fine 1983, 77). \n      \"Good and evil\" certainly exists as a structuring resource for the SvenskMUD world, but interestingly the players are not able to be described discretely in these terms. As distinct from role-playing games, a SvenskMUD player is not created with different alignments (good, evil or neutral). All players are instead neutral and they acquire an alignment as they go along, playing SvenskMUD -- the game. If a player kills a lot of mice and cute rabbits, that player will turn first wicked and then evil. If a player instead kills trolls and orcs, that player first turns good and then saint-like. \n      Despite the potential fluidity of alignment in SvenskMUD, some players cultivate an aura of being good or evil and position themselves in opposition to each other. This is most apparent with two of the guilds (associations) in SvenskMUD, the Necromancer's guild and the Light order's guild. \n      Courage Begets Rewards \n      The third folk idea is the importance of courage. Dangers and death operate in a \"fair\" way, as should treasures and rewards. The SvenskMUD world is structured both so as not to harm or kill players \"needlessly\", and in such a way that it conveys the message \"no guts, no glory\" to the players. In different places in the MUD (usually close to a church, where new players start), there are \"easy\" areas with bit-sized dangers and rewards for beginners. My battle with the mouse was an example of such a danger/reward. A small coin or an empty bottle that can be returned for a small finder's fee are examples of other bit-sized rewards:  \n      The third folk idea is the importance of courage.

My battle with the mouse was an example of such a danger/reward. A small coin or an empty bottle that can be returned for a small finder's fee are examples of other bit-sized rewards:  \n      More experienced characters gain experience points (xps) and rise in levels only by seeking out and overcoming danger and \"there is a positive correlation between the danger in a setting and its payoff in treasure\" (Fine 1983, 78). Just as it would be \"unfair\" to die without adequate warning, so would it be (perceived to be) grossly unfair to seek out and overcome dangerous monsters or situations without being adequately rewarded. And conversely, it would be perceived to be unfair if someone \"stumbled over the treasure\" without having deserved it, i.e. if someone was rewarded without having performed an appropriately difficult task. Taken from the information on etiquette in an adventure MUD, Reid's quote is a good example of this: \n      It's really bad form to steal someone else's kill. Someone has been working on the Cosmicly Invulnerable Utterly Unstoppable Massively Powerful Space Demon for ages, leaves to get healed, and in the interim, some dweeb comes along and whacks the Demon and gets all it's [sic] stuff and tons of xps [experience points]. This really sucks as the other person has spent lots of time and money in expectation of the benefits from killing the monster. The graceful thing to do is to give em [sic] all the stuff from the corpse and compensation for the money spent on healing. This is still a profit to you as you got all the xps and spent practically no time killing it. (Reid 1999, 122, my emphasis)\n      The User Illusion \n      An important objective of the magicians in SvenskMUD is to describe everything that a player experiences in the SvenskMUD world in game-related terms. The game is regarded as a stage where the players are supposed to see only what is in front of, but not behind the scenes. A consistent use of game-related terms and game-related explanations support the suspension of disbelief and engrossment in the SvenskMUD fantasy world. The main activity of the MUD users should be to enter into the game and guide their characters through a fascinating (and, as much as possible and on its own terms, believable) fantasy world. The guiding principle is therefore that the player should never be reminded of the fact that the SvenskMUD world is not for real, that SvenskMUD is only a game or a computer program. From this perspective, the worst thing players can encounter in SvenskMUD is a breakdown of the user illusion, a situation that instantly transports a person from the SvenskMUD world and leaves that person sitting in front of a computer screen. Error messages, e.g. the feared \"you have encountered a bug [in the program]\", are an example of this. \n      If a magician decides to change the SvenskMUD world, that magician is supposed to do the very best to explain the change by using game-related jargon. This is reminiscent of the advice to \"work within the system\": \"wherever possible, things that can be done within the framework of the experiential level should be. The result will be smoother operation and greater harmony among the user community\" (Morningstar and Farmer 1991, 294). If for some reason a shop has to be moved from one village to another, a satisfactory explanation must be given, e.g. a fire occurring in the old shop or the old shop being closed due to competition (perhaps from the \"new\", relocated shop). Explanations that involve supernatural forces or magic are also fine in a fantasy world. Explanations that remind the player of the fact that the SvenskMUD world is not for real (\"I moved the shop to Eriksros, because all magicians decided that it would be so much better to have it there\"), or even worse, that SvenskMUD is a computer program (\"I moved the program shop.c to another catalogue in the file structure\") are to be avoided at all costs.  \n      Part of socialising magicians becomes teaching them to express themselves in this way even when they know better about the machinations of SvenskMud. \n      There are several examples of ingenious and imaginative ways to render difficult-to-explain phenomena understandable in game-related terms: \n      There was a simple problem that appeared at times that made the computer [that SvenskMUD runs on] run a little slower, and as time went by the problem got worse. I could fix the problem easily when I saw it and I did that at times. After I had fixed the problem the game went noticeably faster for the players that were logged in. For those occasions, I made up a message and displayed it to everyone who was in the system: \"Linus reaches into the nether regions and cranks a little faster\". (Interview with Linus Tolke, \"God\" in SvenskMUD) \n      When a monster is killed in the game, it rots away (disappears) after a while. However, originally, weapons and armour that the monster wielded did not disappear; a lucky player could find valuable objects and take them without having \"deserved\" them. This specific characteristic of the game was deemed to be a problem, not least because it furthered a virtual inflation in the game that tended to decrease the value of \"honestly\" collected weapons and loot. The problem was discussed at a meeting of the SvenskMUD magicians that I attended. It was decided that when a monster is killed and the character that killed it does not take the loot, the loot should disappear (\"rot\") together with the monster. But how should this be explained to the players in a suitable way if they approach a magician to complain about the change, a change that in their opinion was for the worse? At the meeting it was suggested that from now on, all weapons and shields were forged with a cheaper, weaker metal. Not only would objects of this metal \"rot\" away together with the monster that wielded them, but it was also suggested that all weapons in the whole game should in fact be worn down as time goes by. (Not to worry, new ones appear in all the pre-designated places every time the game resets.) \n      Conclusion -- Configuring the Player \n      SvenskMUD can easily be perceived as a \"blooming buzzing confusion\" for a new player and my own first explorations in SvenskMUD often left me confused even as I was led from one enlightenment to the next. Not everyone feels inclined to take up the challenge to make sense of a world where you have to learn everything anew, including how to walk and how to talk. On the other hand, in the game world, much is settled for the best, and a crack in a subterranean cave is always exactly big enough to squeeze through... \n      The process of becoming part of the community of SvenskMUD players is inexorably connected to learning to become an expert in the activities of that community, i.e. of playing SvenskMUD (Wenger 1998). A player who wants to program in SvenskMUD (thereby altering the fabric of the virtual world) will acquire many of the relevant concepts before actually becoming a magician, just by playing and exploring the game of SvenskMUD. \n      Even if the user illusion succeeds in always hiding the computer code from the player, the whole SvenskMUD world constitutes a reflection of that underlying computer code. An implicit understanding of the computer code is developed through extended use of SvenskMUD. The relationship between the SvenskMUD world and the underlying computer code is in this sense analogous to the relationship between the lived-in world and the rules of physics that govern the world. All around us children \"prepare themselves\" to learn the subject of physics in school by throwing balls up in the air (gravity) and by pulling carts or sledges (friction). By playing SvenskMUD, a player will become accustomed to many of the concepts that govern the SvenskMUD world and will come to understand the goals, symbols, procedures and values of SvenskMUD. \n      This process bears many similarities to the \"primary socialisation\" of a child into a member of society, a socialisation that serves \"to make appear as necessity what is in fact a bundle of contingencies\" (Berger and Luckmann 1966, 155). This is the purpose of configuring the player and it is intimately connected to the re-growth of SvenskMUD magicians and the survival of SvenskMUD itself over time. However, it is not the only possible outcome of the SvenskMUD socialisation process. The traditional function of trials and quests in fantasy literature is to teach the hero, usually through a number of external or internal encounters with evil or doubt, to make the right, moral choices. By excelling at these tests, the protagonist shows his or her worthiness and by extension also stresses and perhaps imputes these values in the reader (Dalquist et al. 1991). Adventure MUDs could thus socialise adolescents and reinforce common moral values in society; \"the fantasy hero is the perfectly socialised and exemplary subject of a society\" (53, my translation). \n      My point here is not that SvenskMUD differs from other adventure MUDs. I would imagine that most of my observations are general to adventure MUDs and that many are applicable also to other computer games. My purpose here has rather been to present a perspective on how an adventure MUD is structured, to trace the meaning of that structure beyond the game itself and to suggest a purpose behind that organisation. I encourage others to question built-in bias and underlying assumptions of computer games (and other systems) in future studies. \n          \n      References \n      \n Berger, P., and T. Luckmann.

In this article I examine the conditions upon which hate speech has been posited as performative speech in order to consider how virtual environments trouble existing understandings of hate speech. In particular, this article seeks to show how cyberspace may in fact create the conditions for a more immediate and radical recontextualisation and recirculation of hate speech where speed operates as a potential source of resistance. \n      In foregrounding the performative character of hate speech, legal scholars and activists have sought to demonstrate why hate speech should be prohibited not only on the basis of what it says but on the basis of what it does. In this article I examine the conditions upon which hate speech has been posited as performative speech in order to consider how virtual environments trouble existing understandings of hate speech. In particular, this article seeks to show how cyberspace may in fact create the conditions for a more immediate and radical recontextualisation and recirculation of hate speech where speed operates as a potential source of resistance. \n      Judith Butler maintains that \"speech is always in some ways out of our control\" (15). This is not to suggest that our speech is bound to misfire. Instead, Butler's claim draws attention to the range of possibilities located precisely within the failed speech act, revealing how such misfires offer the possibility that certain words which carry the potential to injure may eventually become \"disjointed from their power to injure and recontextualised in more affirmative modes\" (15). Whereas Langston suggests that such speech events inevitably work to silence intended victims, Butler recognises how the subject may also be inaugurated through such linguistic injuries. She maintains that to be injured through language is to \"suffer a loss of context, that is, not to know where you are\" (4). The \"loss of context\" or disorientation she claims might result from hate speech not only suggests that hate speech is context-specific but also that hate speech, understood as a performance, might transform or even produce a speaker's social location. In this view, the very words used to \"put someone in their place\" may also enable people to speak up from their position on the margins of power. Thus, the repetition of hate speech does not necessarily reinforce certain words' power to injure but may result in a pattern of \"slippages\" which enables the meaning and force of such speech to eventually come undone. \n      In order to understand the impact of hate speech in virtual environments, it is useful to consider how the spatial and temporal character of cyberspace affects the repetitions to which Butler refers. While we typically speak of cyber-space, the emergence of cyberspace has arguably resulted in an increased preoccupation with time. For Virilio, the shift from space to time appears to be most visible in cyberspace, which he maintains does not represent a space so much as a particular temporal dimension where speed, not territory, holds the most strategic value. However, he further maintains that we have also reached a moment when humans, who have already surpassed the sound and heat barriers, are left with nothing to race against but speed of light -- something which can never be surpassed. And, as he warns, like other technological revolutions, this one is bound to result in an accident, this time not a physical one but instead one which will throw history itself into a disarray. \"Cyberspace looms up like a transfer accident in substantial reality\", he warns, \"what gets damaged is no longer the substance, the materiality of the tangible world, it is the whole of its constitution\" (Open Sky 131). Thus, cyberspace not only appears to give rise to an accelerated sort of time but to create the conditions under which we run the risk of suffering a \"fundamental loss of orientation\" (Speed and Information). I would like to consider how the speed and subsequent loss of orientation Virilio associates with virtual environments may in fact be the very condition which opens up the possibility for a more immediate and radical recontextualisation of hate speech in such spaces. \n      In positing cyberspace as a radically discontinuous space, Virilio implies that cyberspace may represent a break with history itself. One need only consider how quickly existing forms of inequity have become entrenched in cyberspace to understand the extent to which it is not an entirely new or autonomous space. It follows then that the pattern of perlocutionary effects which apparently enables certain words to injure is not disrupted simply because such words are circulating in a virtual space. However, this is not to suggest that subordinate speech necessarily acts identically on line and off. If to be injured through language is to \"suffer a loss of context, that is, not to know where you are\" (Butler 4), what might it mean to suffer a loss of context in cyberspace? What might it mean to become disoriented in a space where one's context is always and already destabilised? And, what sorts of possibilities are created in cyberspace when one is thrust into an ill-fitting or undesirable social location? I maintain that in cyberspace the potential to suffer a loss of context as a result of a linguistic injury is always partially foreclosed by the fact that one never knows precisely where one is to begin with. It follows that in cyberspace the intended victim of a verbal assault is also at least less likely to become disarmed, debilitated, and silenced. Without overemphasising the agency one gains in virtual environments, is it not possible that one's ability to \"talk back\", while not guaranteed, may be made significantly more likely, if only due to the fact that one's rhetorical skills are unlikely to be rendered worthless in the face of physical threats? \n      To illustrate the extent to which the illocutionary force of hate speech may be undermined by the spatial and temporal character of virtual environments, I draw attention to Reverend Phelps's \"godhatesfags.com\" site. Once you move past the yellow construction sign reading \"Warning -- Gospel Preaching Ahead\", you discover a list of Bible Passages which apparently confirm the site's claim that \"god hates fags\". The site also contains a list of so-called \"fag churches\" and a variety of news items that draw attention to the supposed dangers of the growing global gay agenda. However, while the Website is clearly offensive, it also seems to produce the possibility for politically promising misinterpretations. The Website's editorials on subjects as diverse as Canada's \"gay Mafia\" and Finland's allegedly lesbian Prime Minister and news about Phelps's intention to carry out \"missionary work\" in both of these demonic nations seems more likely to amuse than offend many of the site's visitors. The site's tendency to misinterpellate everyone from lesbians to P-FLAG mothers as \"fags\" may be read as another amusing misfire, another failed attempt on the part of Phelps to demonise gays, lesbians, and their supporters. \n      While Phelps's claims are bound to misfire in any context, the ability to find Phelps's claims immediately humourous appears to be at least partially linked to their context. People who seek to prohibit hate speech not only on the basis of what it says but also on the basis of what it does typically maintain that the effects of hate speech are immediate, final, and ultimately, debilitating (Langston; MacKinnon; Matsuda et al.). In cyberspace, such claims appear to be even less easily established than in the material world. As previously argued, the speed associated with virtual environments seems to produce a disorienting effect, making the potential to suffer a \"loss of context\" in the face of a linguistic \"attack\" at least less likely. In addition, in contrast to the material world, where an encounter with hate speech is likely to lead to a feeling of entrapment if not complete debilitation, cyberspace invests people with an unprecedented degree of mobility. As a result, in sharp contrast to the experience one might have encountering Phelps's message in a public space near their home, the person who encounters Phelps's message online, where neither proximity nor distance hold their traditional values, can escape both quickly and with little effort. \n      However, it is also important to consider the extent to which the speed associated with virtual spaces may also affect the pace at which potentially injurious words, images, and ideas are recirculated and recontextualised. Building on Butler, I have emphasised that hate speech is always repeatable speech. If we take for granted the fact that cyberspace not only increases the amount of speech generated but also the rate at which such speech is recontextualised and redeployed, it would appear as if the potential exists both for the amount of hate speech in circulation to increase and for such speech to be repeated more often and more rapidly. If we further accept the claim that the repetition of hate speech is always an imperfect one, bound to result in some loss of meaning or minor transgression, it becomes possible to see how this highly indeterminable context may also enable hate speech to be reclaimed more quickly. Once again, \"godhatesfags.com\" serves as a useful example. \n     Shortly after Phelps's Website appeared, online monitoring organisations, including Hate Watch, established direct links to the site. The link between Hate Watch and \"godhatesfags.com\" not only serves to place Phelps's online activities under surveillance but also to recontextualise the site. Viewed through their link, Phelps's site is quite literally framed by the Hate Watch site, and subsequently, recontextualised by their anti-hate discourse in a surprisingly direct manner. In addition, various features of Phelps's site have also been parodied and appropriated. \"Godhatesfigs.com\", which among other features includes a list of bible passages which allegedly confirm the Website's claim that \"god hates figs\", is one such example. The creators of \"Godlovesfags.com\" gained notoriety when they managed to steal Phelps's domain name and redirect all \"godhatesfags\" visitors to their counter site for seventy-two hours. \"Godhatesphelps\" is another site that seeks to parody and repeat aspects of Phelps's message in an effort to reveal the absurd nature of Phelps's claims. \n      \n      Shortly after Phelps's Website appeared, online monitoring organisations, including Hate Watch, established direct links to the site.

    "abstract": "\n      Sitting in near darkness about eighteen inches from the screen, he turned the channel selector every half minute or so, sometimes much more frequently. He wasn't looking for something that might sustain his interest. Hardly that. He simply enjoyed jerking the dial into fresh image-burns. He explored content to a point. The tactile visual delight of switching channels took precedence, however, transforming even random moments of content into pleasing territorial abstractions.\n-- Don DeLillo (16)\n      DeLillo captures in a few lines key aspects of a cultural narrative concerning how technology has sped up human lives. The speeds at which forms are transmitted and affect the ways we apprehend the world. Speed is enjoyable. Speed abstracts. Speed is visceral. Speed fragments. We are both agents of its processes and subject to its force. Like DeLillo's channel surfer then you may explore the content of this 'speed' issue of M/C with a certain mobility, and yet you are constrained to pass through at some speed. If you're interested please hang around for a while... \n      This issue acknowledges the reification of speed, its elevation into a mysterious quality continuous with general cultural conditions. It has ceased to be a variable among and equal to others, or one that gains its value from local happenings. It is a cultural dominant. And in this usage speed has, of course, come to stand for high speed, not slow or any speed. Virilio, the founder of dromology, is perhaps the outstanding contemporary theorist of inherent speed culture. He urges that political analysis must start from a recognition of speed, viewing it as intertwined with current conditions of technology and capitalism. The force of speed needs thinking through though. Is it Virilio's generalised tyranny, a global accident? What is at stake? \n      One possible answer to this question can be drawn from the very definition of 'speed': as anyone who has ever rushed to make a date they were late to would know, speed expresses a relationship between space and time, between a distance covered and a time elapsed. As the noted Polish sociologist Zygmunt Bauman writes, \"'distance' is a social product; its length varies depending upon the speed with which it may be overcome (and, in a monetary economy, on the cost involved in the attainment of that speed\" (12). The higher the speed, the greater the distance covered in any given time period -- and the secret to attaining the speed is the ability to pay the price. For those who can meet the price, space is dematerialised: communication, movement, the satisfaction of desires, is instantaneous. The residents of the first world who are empowered by the new economic processes, who can pay for the speed, \"live in a perpetual present, ... are constantly busy and perpetually 'short of time'\". For those who -- for whatever reason -- cannot afford the speed, time is decomposed by space, trapped by and in space. As Bauman argues, those without the access to speed are \"marooned in the opposite world ... crushed under the burden of abundant, redundant and useless time they have nothing to fill with\" (88). \n      As Bauman succinctly and pithily puts it: \"rather than homogenising the human condition, the technological annulment of temporal/spatial distances tends to polarise it\" (18). Speed is a cultural dominant because its possession -- or the lack thereof -- defines people's social and economic future: it marks one's cards, determines one's destiny, more precisely, more forcefully and more thoroughly than any genetic sequence identified by the Human Genome Project ever could. \n      In this light, our contributors take us through an excursus of the range, limits and functions of speed. Our feature writer, Esther Milne, takes a historical perspective on the perceptual reconfigurations of space and time that come with changes in communications and transport technologies. She observes how twentieth-century commentators including Marinetti, Harvey and Castells have heralded the arrivals of new temporal regimes on the basis of technological and economic changes. However, by examining eighteenth- and nineteenth-century English reactions to the use of the mail coach, train and telegraph to relay messages, she identifies a longer tradition of commentary on communication technologies, which sets up themes -- such as the possible alienation of messages from physical bodies -- that are still applied today.\n      Claudia Mesch, in her contribution \"Racing Berlin: the Games of Run Lola Run\", takes us into the Berlin of Tom Tykwer's recent movie Run Lola Run. Playfully using the multiple narrative style of the movie, Mesch alternately discusses the film's narrative and visual form to comment upon its characterisations; its physical and spatial location to comment upon its intra- and extra-diagetic textualities; and its filmic tropes and conventions to comment upon the historical, geo-political and mythic existence of Berlin as a lived space. \n      In a timely review article of Virilio's latest book The Information Bomb, John Armitage reflects upon Virilio's current thinking about speed, digital technologies and the state of the world. He outlines the metaphors of the militarisation of information that Virilio is using to describe the social and political effects of an explosively fast technoculture, and contrasts Virilio's thinking with that of Negroponte and Baudrillard.\n      Sadeq Rahimi explores the shrinking of time and the virtualisation of space to question how identity is redefined in the postmodern condition. Utilising the work of Helga Nowotny, Paul Virilio, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, amongst others, Rahimi argues that the self-identity constructed by these changing social conditions can no longer be described as human -- bound as this is by both space and time -- and calls for the theoretical and philosophical development of a new, posthuman theory of identity. \n     Writing at the time of millennium fever McKenzie Wark takes a 'detour' away from the incessant media multiplication of a single moment by contemplating the enduring architectural media of ancient Egypt. Wark is thereafter able to put into relief how the twentieth century mummified change itself and in doing so has created new media empires designed to extend their dominion through momentary saturations of space. The tour stops by Valery, Innis, Microsoft, Time-Warner and the London Millennium Dome.\n      \n      Brian Ward draws our attention to the social and cultural experience of speed, and the ways to which speed is the result of an obsession, under capitalist rationalities, with notions of progress, advancement and unique sensation. Discussing the function of speed within the proto-Fascist philosophy of the Italian Futurist movement, Ward points to the way its overt fascination with speed foregrounds a more latent, yet no less obsessive, preoccupation with speed and progress within contemporary Western metaphysics.\n      In \"Fleshing Out the Maelstrom\" Paul Taylor shows how the recent Biopunk fiction of Jeff Noon and Michael Marshall Smith plays out a contemporary ontological confusion between the physical and the informational. Going beyond Cyberpunk's exaggeration of digital abstractions, Biopunk metaphorises information's colonisation of the physical world as a \"an alarming maelstrom of biological uncertainty\" in which a fecund capitalism breeds mergers, images, and a smorgasbord of private products that overrun social life.\n      In \"Waiting for Instantaneity\" Maya Drozdz reflects upon the temporal paradoxes of cyberspace. She questions Virilio's and Baudrillard's suppositions of realtime mediation arguing that movement in cyberspace is \"subordinate to connection speed and loadtime\", which means all online content is mediated by the temporalities of its transmission. She outlines online narratives that have arisen to accommodate and investigate the discrepancy between transmission time 'as it happens' and its perception and draws parallels with filmic techniques for creating temporal continuity.\n      Kate Eichhorn also examines speed of the Net applying it to arguments about the effectivity of hate speech. She shows how the \"speed and subsequent loss of orientation\" that Virilio associates with virtual environments may actually prove the grounds for its recuperation. While cyberhate may still injure, the speed at which it may be recontextualised by parody, critique and the mobility of the reader disrupt its perlocutionary effects. \n      In contrast to Ward, Gwendolyn Stansbury argues against the speed of contemporary life. Extrapolating the Slow Food movement's critique of fast food, she posits the negative effect that the modern pace of life has on the communal experience of preparing and eating food together. \n      Finally, as a special feature this issue, we bring you a recording of a seminar recently presented by the noted Dutch media activist and theorist Geert Lovink at the Media and Cultural Studies Centre at the University of Queensland. Entitled \"Directions for Cyberculture in the New Economy\", it reprises a paper he presented at the \"Tulipomania\" conference held not long ago in Amsterdam, exploring the changes and potential of online activism and culture as it speeds headlong towards complete commercialisation. Greg Hearn and David Marshall respond to Lovink's views, and a lively audience discussion, ranging from AOL users to cyberwarriors, follows. Geert Lovink visited Brisbane as a participant in Alchemy, an International Masterclass for New Media Artists and Curators, which was organised by the Australian Network for Art and Technology in association with the Brisbane Powerhouse -- Centre for the Live Arts from 8 May to 9 June 2000. M/C and the Media and Cultural Studies Centre are highly grateful to ANAT and Geert Lovink as well as the Australian Key Centre for Cultural and Media Policy for making this event possible.\n      Guy Redden\n&amp;  Sean Aylward Smith -- \n  'Speed' Issue Editors\n          \n      References  \n      \nBaudrillard, Jean. \"The Ecstasy of Communication.\" The Anti-Aesthetic.

    "abstract": "\n      In the Futurist imagination, speed is the essence itself of the existence of modernity: both as the indispensable mechanism in the relationship with contemporary life and as the guiding factor in relationships of the psyche and thought with reality, shaping new individual and collective relations, which were by then projected into the future.\n-- La Fondazione Antonio Mazzotta\n      Speed, Modernity, and Post-Modernity\n      The concept of speed is prevalent in, and has many implications for, contemporary western society. Speed is simultaneously a form of behaviour required of individuals in their professional lives as the electronic workplace becomes faster and faster, and an experience that many people crave as a form of release from the slow pace of personal or recreational life as this is defined by our physical limitations.\n      In his recent book Faster: The Acceleration of Just About Everything, popular science writer James Gleick discusses instances of where speed functions as a social mechanism that pushes people to function with the speed and efficiency of machines. He describes how speed has become embedded physically, mechanically, and psychologically into almost every aspect of social behaviour, often overwhelming our mental and physical ability to cope with its effects. Speed has become a necessity, a desperation, and a desire to fulfil.\n      The concept of speed is explicitly identified with Modernism, yet it continues to be a focal concept in what may be termed the Postmodern present. Does this mean that speed has surpassed Modernity, that it has sped ahead of its own origins, or does it indicate that Postmodernity is merely the speeding-up of Modernity?\n      This paper does not attempt, in dry academic fashion, to proclaim universal knowledge and provide all the answers to all the questions that could be raised in relation to this topic. The author invites readers to consider the various representations of speed introduced here as the product of a collective western obsession with progress, novelty, and rapid sensationalism.\n      Speed in Futurist Philosophy\n      The Futurist movement has been discussed widely elsewhere, so I will not offer a repetitive description here. It is sufficient for the scope of this paper to refer to the fundamentals of Futurist philosophy as it is defined by F.T. Marinetti in 'The Founding and Manifesto of Futurism', Le Figaro (Paris), 20 February 1909:\n      \n      \n\n\n           We affirm that the world's magnificence has been enriched by a new beauty: the beauty of speed. A racing car whose hood is adorned with great pipes, like serpents of explosive breath -- a roaring car that seems to ride on grapeshot is more beautiful than the Victory of Samothrace.\n        \n        \n          We want to hymn the man at the wheel, who hurls the lance of his spirit across the Earth, along the circle of its orbit. \n        \n      \nWithout condoning or embracing the fascist, anti-intellectual, multi-anti-ism elements of Futurist philosophy; I draw attention to this evocative pronouncement of its obsession with speed in order to provide a thematic basis for the material that follows. Speed is defined as a form of great mechanical accomplishment and as an immense intellectual, emotional, and spiritual force that is symbolic of the ideal or progress and human achievement.\n      Speed and Contemporaneity\n      Milan Kundera in his novel Slowness employs the concept of speed to characterise a frenetic ecstasy of the present, which he disparagingly views as archetypally modern:\n      \n       ... the man hunched over his motorcycle can focus only on the present instant of his flight; he is caught in a fragment of time cut off from both the past and the future; he is wrenched from the continuity of time; he is outside time; in other words he is in a state of ecstasy. In that state he is unaware of his age, his wife, his children, his worries, and so he has no fear, because the source of fear is in the future, and a person freed of the future has nothing to fear. (3-4)\n\n      The 'progress' of the technical revolution, so  worshipped by the Futurist thinkers, is for Kundera an experience that is more mental and psychological than it is physical, due to the inability of the human body to produce the thrill of speed to the extent that machines can. He contrasts mechanically-induced speed to that produced by our own bodies:\n      \n      As opposed to a motorcyclist, the runner is always present in his body, forever required to think of his blisters, his exhaustion; when he runs he feels his weight, his age, more conscious than ever of himself and of his time of life. This all changes when man delegates the faculty of speed to a machine: from then on, his own body is outside the process, and he gives over to a speed that is non-corporeal, non-material, pure speed, speed itself, ecstasy speed. (4)\n      For Kundera, \"Speed is the form of ecstasy the technical revolution as bestowed on man.\" This statement accords with the Modernist vision of speed as the motif of industrial and social progress, but it does not really elucidate what characteristics the speed itself possesses.\n      The Characteristics of Technologically Enabled Speed\n      \n        Interpreting from Kundera's thoughts on speed, it is possible to surmise that:\n   \n      \n\n           The speed produced must be significantly beyond that capable of being produced by the unaided human body; \n        \n         The technical production of speed and the reliance on sophisticated equipment to do this paradoxically produces a purely non-corporeal, metaphysical or psychological experience that is outside time and beyond immediate physical consequences; and\n         Speed is a form of ecstatic experience that is comparable to other forms of ecstasy, such as sexual or religious experience, or the use of psychotropic drugs.\n  \n      \nIn contemporary society the experience of speed is determined by these three concepts.\n      The Personal\n      I know of no better way to experience speed in a raw, immediate, and sensory-fulfilling way than to ride a motorcycle faster than is legally permitted. Unlike other forms of mechanical travel -- cars, aircraft, trains -- motorbikes offer a direct way to really feel speed. The image of the motorcyclist in Slowness is evocative for me because Kundera's language (even in translation) gives my immediate experience a lyrical context.\n      In other forms of transport, the traveller is too far removed from many of the sensations of speed, even when travelling at greater speeds than a bike can manage. Cars are safe, and you can speed in them more safely than on a bike. The relative distance from the road and the wind is greater, however, and the traveller is thus further removed from the elements that make the sensation of speed so intoxicating. When riding a motorcycle, the wind hits you roughly at higher speeds, gently at lower speeds, and moves around you unpredictably, pushing the bike in different directions.\n      In other forms of transport, the traveller is too far removed from many of the sensations of speed, even when travelling at greater speeds than a bike can manage.

When riding a motorcycle, the wind hits you roughly at higher speeds, gently at lower speeds, and moves around you unpredictably, pushing the bike in different directions.\n      Racing\n      The rebellious, renegade idea of driving or riding illegally fast on public roads is examined and discussed at the Flat Out Website (not that this article condones breaking the law). A far safer and less costly alternative is watching motor-racing on television (or better still actually at the track).\n      In Formula 1, the ultimate form of international motor-racing, speed is sought and worshipped in many forms, from the speed of the cars and the drivers themselves to the speed of the associated technologies used by the teams. What fascinates most spectators, however, is the desire of the drivers to take risks in order to go faster than anyone else, and go faster than they have ever gone before. Legendary drivers like Stirling Moss, Gilles Villeneuve, Nigel Mansell, Ayrton Senna, and Michael Schumacher have earnt respect and admiration in relation to the intensity of the experience of speed that they are able to share with their fans. The number of races they win is immaterial in relation to the style with which they drive. Villeneuve, for example, only won 6 races, yet he is worshipped more than drivers who have won many more than that because his style of driving demonstrated the purity of speed. He desired the thrill of speed more than the glory of victory.\n      Vicariously, spectators of speed share in the glory and sensationalism it creates. Speed is meant to be fun for both the participant and the spectator; it does not have to mean anything more than this. Visualise a Bullet Train or TGV slicing through glorious Japanese or French countryside. Marvel at a 500cc GP rider like Mick Doohan sliding his bike through a smooth fast corner to the adulation of thousands.\n      There is only one appropriate response. As Lt. Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell, Tom Cruise's character in the hit 1980s film Top Gun, says, \"I feel the need, the need for speed!\"\n          \n      References\n      \nGleick, James.

    "abstract": "\n      We are enslaved by speed and have succumbed to the same insidious virus: Fast Life, which disrupts our habits, pervades the privacy of our homes and forces us to eat Fast Foods.\n-- Manifesto of the Slow Food movement\n      In Australia, we like our food fast. We spend more than a third of our average weekly household budget eating out or on takeaway food, a figure that may jump to 50% in the next five years (Macken). An ever increasing proportion of the food we do prepare at home has been processed for convenience, so that now we manage to spend just an hour and a half eating and drinking each day, or less time than we spend watching television (ABS, How Australians). If the sharing of food fosters family and social ties, and strong family and social relationships are an integral part of civil society, statistics such as these should give us pause. While it is beyond the scope of this article to give this topic the full attention it deserves, the article will nonetheless briefly examine some of the implications of life on the fast-food track.\n      But first, why have we become so reliant on convenience foods? One reason is that significant numbers of women have entered the workforce during the last few decades and today, more than 60 percent of Australian women who are married work outside the home (ABS, Labour Force). As the value of women's labour in the market increases, their time becomes a more precious commodity and they seek ways to use it more efficiently (Bourdieu). Because women have traditionally been responsible for the preparation of family meals, and continue to shoulder most of the responsibility regardless of their role in the workforce, they naturally look for ways to save time buying and cooking food. However, this is not a trend confined solely to working women with families, but rather one that crosses many demographic and economic lines. We all seem to feel our time is at a premium, even though we are actually working less (ABS, Social Trends). That is because we are increasingly placing a greater value on our leisure time, and although we have more of it because of the shorter hours we work and the multitude of time-saving devices we use, we do not want to spend our free time shopping for food (Cheeseman &amp; Breddin) or cooking it. Instead, our preferred activities are watching television and videos, socialising and talking, listening to the radio and reading (ABS, Social Trends). Interestingly, we have placed socialising and the family meal into completely separate categories.\n      But first, why have we become so reliant on convenience foods? One reason is that significant numbers of women have entered the workforce during the last few decades and today, more than 60 percent of Australian women who are married work outside the home (ABS, Labour Force). As the value of women's labour in the market increases, their time becomes a more precious commodity and they seek ways to use it more efficiently (Bourdieu).

Instead, our preferred activities are watching television and videos, socialising and talking, listening to the radio and reading (ABS, Social Trends). Interestingly, we have placed socialising and the family meal into completely separate categories.\n      While the nutritional benefits derived from 'replaced' meals may be questionable, there are more important considerations at stake. People who have come to feel they do not have time to cook are not likely to feel they can spare much time to eat, either. 'Eating on the run' has now become part of our lexicon. And truthfully, who would want to linger over a meal made from reconstituted foods? But more importantly, what message do meals such as these impart to those who eat them? The social engagement, for example, that occurs over a frozen dinner \"is very different to that which occurs over a long meal that has been carefully prepared and is shared with family or friends\" (Finkelstein). The message inherent in quickly prepared or purchased foods that are in turn quickly consumed, often at different times by different members of the family or household, is that the family or communal meal is not an occasion worthy of much attention.\n      Nothing can be farther from the truth. According to Claude Lévi-Strauss, food is at the very core of sociality. Humans evolved as food-sharing animals (van den Berghe), and the origin of the family can be traced in large part to the necessity of sharing meals. Today, meal times not only serve to strengthen family and social ties, but also to acculturate children into the norms of 'civilised' behaviour\" (Lupton). Yet, they are under attack as family members are increasingly left to forage for food on their own. We need to consider what social and emotional skills our children are developing as they nibble on leftover pizza by the kitchen sink or unwrap their microwaved meal in front of the television. In an interview with Psychology Today, Ruth Reichl, renowned food writer and current editor of Gourmet magazine, said that the trend for family members to eat five-minute meals on their own will have a profound psychological impact on future generations of children, who will have missed out on a vital part of the socialisation process (Toufexis).\n      Perhaps the Slow Food movement, then, has hit upon something. Its manifesto states, \"a firm defense of quiet material pleasure is the only way to oppose the universal folly of Fast Life... . Our defense should begin at the table with Slow Food. Let us rediscover the flavors and savors of regional cooking and banish the degrading effects of Fast Food\" (Slow Food). \n      The movement was founded in Italy in 1986 by Carlos Petrini as a reaction to the establishment of a McDonald's near Rome's historic Spanish Steps. While global fast food colonisation is certainly a rallying point, the movement also encourages members to eat seasonal foods, support and protect regional cuisines, reinstate the ritual of family dining and educate children's palates. Mostly, however, Slow Food is about taking the time to enjoy a meal, to value the ingredients that go into it, and to share it with friends and family. It is appropriate, then, that the movement's symbol is a snail, \"a talisman against speed\" (Slow Food).\n      While speed may be exciting, fast foods are not, and the idea of slowing down to savour meals with family and friends is one that is gaining momentum. The Slow Food movement, which started with a few delegates from 15 countries just over a decade ago, has now grown to 60,000 members in 35 countries, complete with 400 convivia, or local branches. Australia hosts eight of these chapters. \n     Maggie Beer, the well-known Barossa Valley chef, entrepreneur and food writer, is also a Slow Food member. Her solution to the daily dinner dilemma is simple: by planning ahead and keeping a well-stocked pantry, it is possible for time-constrained cooks to have at hand many of the ingredients they need to make simple and nutritious meals in as much time as it takes to go get takeaway food (Beer). Nonetheless, keeping the pantry well-stocked with quality foods instead of dinners-in-a-packet means deciding that meals matter, that they are worthy of consideration and of time spent in preparation and consumption, and that the long-term rewards of Slow Food are worth far more than the short-term benefits of Fast Food.\n      \n      As the training grounds for future generations and important sites of reconnection for current ones, meals should be welcomed as opportunities for interaction rather than chores to be completed as quickly as possible. They should make people want to linger, while enjoying the company, the conversation and the food. As the French gastronome Jean-Anthelme Brillat-Savarin wrote in the early nineteenth century:\n      One may find round a single table all the modifications which extreme sociability has introduced into our midst: love, friendship, business, speculation, influence, solicitation, patronage, ambition, intrigue; that is why conviviality affects every aspect of human life, and bears fruits of every flavour. (Brillat-Savarin).\n      Reviving the ritual of a family meal does not mean returning to 'traditional' 1950s household dynamics, but rather, adopting a modern view that meals are important, even vital, and that all members of a family should contribute to making them special. The preparation of a meal can become part of the social process; Italo-Australians, for example, have turned the making of tomato sauce into a very communal and social event that draws friends and family closer together. It is a type of meal preparation that can be replicated on a far smaller scale by simply involving family members, housemates and partners in the making of a meal, which can be accomplished in a myriad of ways by people of varying ages and skills. However, it means periodically suspending time, for a good meal that satisfies body and soul cannot be rushed.\n      The evidence suggests, however, that many of us are not yet able to jump off the treadmill, even though the current trend toward faster and faster foods may have a significant impact on the structure of the family and the nature of our relationships with each other. If we continue to eat on the run, if we consistently eat meals that do not make us want to linger, then we may find ourselves in danger of losing that uniquely human ritual of sharing food, which is a cornerstone of our sociality, the bedrock of family life and a building block of our collective spirit. Much does, indeed, depend on dinner.\n          \n      References\n      \nAustralian Bureau of Statistics. How Australians Use Their Time.

    "abstract": "\n      Metaphors of 'game' and 'play' are increasingly popular in academic writing, partly because games themselves are becoming increasingly important to media experience, and partly because something in the 'game' idea seems to describe the post-modern experience. However, the metaphor sometimes forgets what games can be like in practice. What I want to do, then, is go a round or two with the term, to question what the metaphor invokes.\n      Round I: 'Game'? \n      Games are played on a dedicated field -- a board, a screen, a playing-ground -- which is marked off so that in some sense it becomes a separate 'space', Huizinga's \"magic circle\". Play begins, and then, Huizinga argues, it is over, its effects lost (13). Players choose to play, agreeing to arbitrary rules controlling the game 'world'; goals and penalties are agreed in advance. Thus the gameworld provides an oasis of order in a chaotic, unruly world (Huizinga again); despite (sometimes) volumes of rules, games themselves are less complex and more clearly defined than \"the casual and confused reign of everyday existence\" (Berger, qtd. in Holquist 122).\n      The sanctity of the game-space offers something more than mere order. The construction of order through arbitrary rules temporarily dissolves the significance of the outside world. Players concentrate wholly on the game -- on the dice or the puck or the pawn; good gameplay (to use Banks's expression) makes you forget yourself and the passage of time, not operating consciously but going with the flow. Play, writes Csikszentmihalyi, \"is going. It is what happens after all the decisions are made -- when 'let's go' is the last thing one remembers\" (45). It is a difficult state to attain but it seems valuable, from academia's overly rationalistic perspective, to get out of our heads and let some other sense drive for a while. \n      Games engage different senses. Players use skills not ordinarily valued, striving for self-fulfilling perfection. Mundane time is linear, but games are full of diversionary, goal-deferring loops -- \"the movement which is play has no goal which brings it to an end; rather it renews itself in constant repetition\" (Gadamer 93). Gameplay is unpredictable; it shuttles back and forth, unsettled, dynamic, open to chance. You cannot surely predict the outcome. And then you play again.\n      We like, too, the superficiality of games. They are useless, wilfully inefficient, pursued solely for the pleasures they provide. Games can be seen as representative -- of power struggles, of unspeakable impulses -- but the action is distanced from the self. Imbued in an (in)animate piece or a disguised self, games license performance, freedom from the mundane self. Most importantly, game goals aren't 'really' important; we don't 'really' care; \"no chains of causes and effects, means and ends, are supposed to connect the isolated area of play with the real world or ordinary life (Riezler 511).\n      Thus, reasons the theorist, the gameworld is a privileged space. Having freely chosen to play and consented to pre-determined constraints, players slip the controlling lead of the superego in pursuit of mastery. Difficult impulses are exorcised -- cathartically, if you like -- in the safety of the gamespace, the temporary \"otherwhere\" of experience where nothing really matters; no lives are actually sacrificed; no deaths are permanent; no loss is irreversible. Games are interactive, simultaneously controlled and risky. If one excels, one is celebrated; if one loses -- ah well, it was only a game. Afterwards it ceases to matter: handshakes all round and down to the pub.\n       \n      \n        Or so the theorists tell us.\n        Round II: The Magic Circle\n      \n      My brother and his friends liked to play Skirmish. But afterwards, they were stiff and sore, with bruises lasting for months or longer. Players are regularly injured, permanently maimed, or even killed while playing those games we call 'sport'. True, you might forget yourself while playing, but what about afterwards? The embodiedness of players -- the constancy of muscle memory, bruises and scars -- imprints lasting effects on minds and flesh, inextricably binding the game world to the mundane. Besides physical injuries, however, are the continuity of memory and the excess of feelings (affect).\n      Games, after all, are played by people, \"who only indirectly and ambiguously share in the perfect order of their games\" (Holquist 115), stuck as we are with irrational feelings. Losers feel sore, disgruntled; someone else has proven cleverer or faster or trickier; they never quite got in the flow; it wasn't fun. So when Stephenson writes, \"play is enjoyed, no matter who wins\" (46) -- well, no. People sulk, they cry, they become vengeful: people don't like losing -- witness the origins of football hooliganism. Perhaps the cost of being rationally detached from the outcome of a game, of leaving the mundane, ratiocinatic world behind, is an irrational, affective investment that sometimes matters when it shouldn't.\n     To describe games as discrete, then, assumes that people are disembodied, completely rational and extremely forgetful: these are the only terms under which gameplay can be \"detached\". Huizinga and Caillois posit such players when they describe games as 'separate', 'unproductive', 'unreal'. They let the metaphor take over, mistaking form for practice. Somewhat extremely, Gadamer argues, \"the real subject of the game ... is not the player, but instead the game itself\" (95). No game, however, exists prior to or without players, and no players are free from the 'irrational' of their bodies and senses.\n     Round III: Representation\n     John Banks's \"Controlling Gameplay\" reminds us of the 'other senses' invoked in play. Games, he argued, are never simply representational. Gameplay is a forward momentum, engrossing and unselfconscious. He was right, but I want to recall, momentarily, the representativeness of games. It is, after all, partly their commitment to symbols that makes people willing to (be) hurt in a game, even to risk their lives.\n      Besides the irrational commitment to the symbol engendered by the affective gameworld, is the representational content. The violence debate hinges around the detachment of the gameworld: theorists argue that in gamespace, it's 'not real; we're 'just playing'; \"things within this area mean what we order them to mean. They are cut off from their meanings in the so-called real world or ordinary life\" (Riezler 511). The game frame theoretically negates commitment to content and underlying meanings (see Bologh). Fink reminds us, though, that content always draws on the world of experience: it \"is always partly, but never wholly, the creation of fantasy. It always has to do with real objects [or ideas], which fantasy transforms into play objects\" (qtd. in Anchor 92). Hodge and Tripp argue that, although play modality undermines or inverts meanings, symbols retain their mundane meaning: \"the surface content of the image coexists as part of the content. An image of violence is still an image of violence, and viewers who enjoy it are still endorsing those impulses in themselves\" (117). Games invoke the imaginary, the symbolic and the sensual in ways beyond ordinary 'consciousness', but that never makes it insignificant. Memory and affect again.\n      Structural anthropology provides ample evidence that games represent society (see, for example, Cheska). Clifford Geertz showed how games structurally reflect (often backwards) the values of a society. The game, he argued, reminds players of the overlap between their own and their society's values (27). Thus games function as social ritual (see Bakhtin, Caillois or Huizinga). But ritual, Handelman shows, is \"how society should be\" (189) -- in which case he is arguing that society should be ordered, rigidly rule-bound, oriented towards arbitrary goals and values, competitive, and simplistically representational. People -- and indeed, existence -- are complex, messy, defiant and irrational. \"Not recognising the bounds between stylised game and causal reality is to do violence to the complexity of existence\" (Holquist 121).\n      Round IV: Structure \n      Another remove from content, is structure. In Western society games are agonistic. Huizinga explicitly argued that their value lay in striving for glory over one's fellows, in proving oneself superior: that is what winning is. Although theorists now value the process more than the goals, gameplay nevertheless consists in trying to beat your opponent. Games are about conquest. Even those games featuring teamwork only require cooperation to vanquish opponents -- to inflict on them the humiliation, disappointment and (however infinitesimally) diminished social status that inevitably accompany losing.\n      Moreover, there are hierarchies within teams. A good point guard is never as well paid as a good forward; the Dungeon Master or GM determines the 'fate' of the other players. Just as players and teams are hierarchised, so are leagues, reflecting Western society's valorisation of hierarchy. Many must be conquered for the individual to triumph. While players may freely accede to rules, they don't decide them -- they are governed conservatively. Rules may evolve organically but become reified, regulated top-down, detailed knowledge itself becoming a source of hierarchical authority. Game rules are not folk-knowledge; they are dictated, published, refereed: another source of contest.\n      Time\n      The game metaphor has its uses. Certainly what happens when one disappears or is lost in gameplay is worth serious attention. But to pretend that games are microcosmic, free, without affect, effect or meaning, and that they end with the final bell, is to forget the player, who lives on in the society reflected by the game.\n          \n      References\n      \nAnchor, Robert. \"History and Play: Johan Huizinga and his Critics.\" History and Theory 17 (1966): 63-93.          \n        Banks, John. \"Controlling Gameplay.\" M/C: A Journal of Media and Culture 1.5 (1998). 15 Oct. 2000 &lt;http://www.api-network.com/mc/9812/game.php&gt;.          \n        Bologh, Roslyn Wallach. \"On Fooling Around: A Phenomenological Analysis of Playfulness.\" The Annals of Phenomenological Sociology 1 (1976): 1113-25.          \n        Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly, and Stith Bennett. \"An Exploratory Model of Play.\" American Anthropologist. 44 (1974): 45-58.          \n        Gadamer, Hans-Georg. \"The Ontology of the Work of Art and Its Hermeneutical Significance.

    "title": "Renewing Cultural Studies",
    "abstract": "\n      Renew is an awkward word. Its prefix seems to make its idea of something 'new' impossible. And everyday experience further underlines the contradiction. My first memory of using the word 'renew' was related to the anxiety of library overdue books: renewing those books was a pragmatic way to avoid the impending fines.\n      This is a useful starting point for pondering any cultural moment of renewal. Renew describes the impetus towards change while acknowledging the past's weighted effect on producing any transformation. It articulates a challenged continuity rather than a break or discontinuity with a particular past. Where I would like to take this idea of renewal is into the realm of cultural studies and its continuing intellectual project through two efforts or essays.\n      Essay 1: Recombinant Culture\n      There are no doubt many ways to characterise the value of cultural studies. What I want to emphasise here is how cultural studies worked to transform the basic conceptualisation of culture itself. These are familiar paths but to identify some of the principal intellectual traits for rethinking and fundamentally renewing the definition of culture:\n      \n      \n\n\n          the contested terrain of the popular;\n          the hegemonic restructuring of culture through winning and building of consent as a moving and transforming force; and \n        \n        \n          the concentration on the making of the \"other\" and the \"other's\" process of piecing together cultural sense\n        \n      \nThrough all these paths the real power of cultural studies has been its ability to migrate into disciplines and work to renew their internal directions through challenge. Although naturalised homes for cultural studies have been found in media and communication programmes, this has been partly possible through their roughly contemporaneous emergence and partly through this sister intellectual project's capacity to deal seriously with popular culture. Where renewal has been more brazenly articulated is in sites such as geography and its turn to culture and space issues, English and its transformation of its object of study, or musicology with its rereading of popular music and its cadence of cultural meaning and, to a lesser extent sociology and history. What cultural studies has been is a migrating source of renewal across the humanities and social sciences.\n      The core of cultural studies, which is much more difficult to define except in a listing of key concepts and strategies of cultural engagement through intellectual work (of which I provided only a partial list above), has not necessarily gone through this same pattern of renewal over the last 20 years.\n      What I would like to propose here is a moment of rethinking what constitutes cultural studies. This goes beyond Richard Johnson's historical reading of what is cultural studies. Using a new metaphor to describe its approach may begin this renewal of the core. Cultural studies can be rearticulated in terms of its capacity at recombining. As I have indicated, cultural studies has worked to juxtapose its redefinitions of the cultural against and over these 19th century disciplines and has produced quite dramatic shifts in approaches within the disciplines and across the disciplines.\n      Recombining then is the intellectual practice of cultural studies. It generally analyses the form of recombinations that emerge on the contemporary scene. Some have labelled this process hybridisation -- the work of Iain Chambers and Lydia Curti identifies the movements through borders and boundaries both physical and psychical. As a practice, cultural studies can debate and discuss the moments of rupture of the continuous (what previous approaches might call the ideological and naturalised veneer of historical continuity), but with the comprehension of how the rupture negotiates with the past and its ideological weight. In other words, cultural studies' practice is one of perpetual renewal through its study of recombinant culture. \n     These moments of recombination can be seen in the structure of identity and cultural politics, where the stable structures of identity serve as much as political tactics as structures. Most visibly, recombinant culture can be the way to understand how new technologies are used and reformed through use by different cultural communities. Popular music provides a model for this continuous flow of recombining for both renewal and a shifted cultural significance. Sounds are sampled; past songs are layered into a significantly different music and use in current dance music. Recombinant culture may also be studied from the perspective of cultural industries and their efforts to incorporate new technologies into different forms in order to reconstitute audiences in ways that in their distinctiveness produce value that is exchangeable as capital. Understanding the constant negotiation of recombinant culture is where cultural studies should relocate its energies and renew its vitality.\n     Essay 2: Refocussing on Cultural Production\n     One of the successes of cultural studies is its well-developed reading of the practices of reception. The active audience approach has led to understanding how audiences use and contextualise cultural forms. Specifically studies in television, popular music and, to a lesser degree, film have benefitted from this rereading of popular culture and audiences.\n      Clearly underdeveloped in cultural studies is an analysis of production. Yet the massive work on the active audience approach is fundamentally a study of cultural production, albeit in the terminology of reception. What is embedded in the active audience reading of cultural forms is the audience's will to produce the text. This reproduction of the text by the audience not only transforms the text, but also points to the very desire (by cultural studies' research itself in the same way that the researcher's reading of a subculture's political and cultural will was refracted through sartorial style and a cultural politics of street appropriation) for the will to produce in the audience.\n      There is a moment in our recombinant culture that certain technologies have intensified the will to produce, if not production itself. The Internet and the World Wide Web have provided cultural studies a clear shift towards a production ethos that has altered the formal boundaries of what constitutes production. The user of the Internet actively plays the role of producer and audience, not just in terms of a heightened pattern of interactivity but in the regularity and routineness with which Websites appear as part of the general system of cultural production. Because all Websites are distributed and disseminated in one system or network the delineations that used to give television networks their nearly exclusive voice and image of authority are not as easily made via the Internet. This moment of production flux and the cultural politics it has generated is already contested as large media corporations work to differentiate content and \"quality\" so that websites are hierarchised into different registers of cultural value.\n      What I am arguing for here is a renewal of study that now looks at a different starting point in the cycles of production and consumption for cultural studies. Production in this recombinant culture always implies a process of reception and recontextualisation of the past meanings into current objectives and directions. Cultural studies needs to investigate this current blending of production and consumption more vigorously. For instance, how does Napster shift the play of the production outwards into a myriad of possible recombining producer/consumers who make their music available for others? How is the large music publisher Bertelsmann engaging in a process of capitalising in some way on this process of dissemination through their negotiations with Napster? We are seeing enacted in this one case the changing landscape of cultural production  and cultural consumption where the product, the property and the service are no longer clearly defined in either industrially or culturally agreed-upon standards.\n      New media culture in general is operating on different criteria of cultural production and cultural consumption: products seem to be continually in process and in that process include their consumers into the process of production. This is clearly evident in the development of computer games as they include their core \"audience\" in transforming and improving their \"product\". The digitalisation of cultural forms has permitted the development of \"soft-products\": that is, products that can be changed and recombined and are therefore not so easily end-products but as entities are continually in process.\n      Because cultural studies has such a well-developed understanding of the process of the transformation of meaning through its study of active reception, it is particularly valuable in interpreting how this recombinant culture is operating in and through new technologies. In a sense, cultural studies can be deployed in making sense of this transformed cultural economy. Through a shift in focus from consumption to production (but fundamentally working with the same insights about cultural meaning, activity and production), the intellectual project of cultural studies can successfully renew itself.\n          \n      Citation reference for this article  \n      MLA style:\n      \n P.

    "abstract": "\n      Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a text-based computer-mediated communication (CMC) service in which people can meet and chat in real time. Most chat occurs in channels named for a specific topic, such as #usa or #linux. A user can take part in several channels when connected to an IRC network. For a long time the only major IRC network available was EFnet, founded in 1990. Over the 1990s three other major IRC networks developed, Undernet (1993), DALnet (1994) and IRCnet (which split from EFnet in June 1996). Several causes led to the separate development of IRC networks: fast growth of user numbers, poor scalability of the IRC protocol and content disagreements, like allowing or prohibiting 'bot programs. Today we are experiencing the development of regional IRC networks, such as BrasNet for Brazilian users, and increasing regionalisation of the global networks -- IRCnet users are generally European, EFnet users generally from the Americas and Australia. All persons connecting to an IRC network at one time create that IRC network's user space. People are constantly signing on and off each network. The total number of users who have ever been to a specific IRC network could be called its 'social space' and an IRC network's social space is by far larger than its user space at any one time.\n      Although there has been research on IRC almost from its beginning (it was developed in 1988, and the first research was made available in late 1991 (Reid)), resources on quantitative development are rare. To rectify this situation, a quantitative data logging 'bot program -- Socip -- was created and set to run on various IRC networks. Socip has been running for almost two years on several IRC networks, giving Internet researchers empirical data of the quantitative development of IRC.\n      Methodology\n      Any approach to gathering quantitative data on IRC needs to fulfil the following tasks:\n      \nStore the number of users that are on an IRC network at a given time, e.g. every five minutes; \n        Store the number of channels; and, \n        Store the number of servers. \n      \nIt is possible to get this information using the '/lusers' command on an IRC-II client, entered by hand. This approach yields results as in Table 1.\n      \n        Table 1: Number of IRC users on January 31st, 1995\n      \n      \n\nDate\n          Time\n          Users\n          Invisible\n          Servers\n          Channels\n        \n\n31.01.95\n          10:57\n          2737\n          2026\n          93\n          1637\n        \n\nDuring the first months of 1995, it was even possible to get all user information using the '/who **' command. However, on current major IRC networks with greater than 50000 users this method is denied by the IRC Server program, which terminates the connection because it is too slow to accept that amount of data. Added to this problem is the fact that collecting these data manually is an exhausting and repetitive task, better suited to automation. Three approaches to automation were attempted in the development process.\n      The 'Eggdrop' approach\n      The 'Eggdrop' 'bot is one of the best-known IRC 'bot programs. Once programmed, 'bots can act autonomously on an IRC network, and Eggdrop was considered particularly convenient because customised modules could be easily installed. However, testing showed that the Eggdrop 'bot was unsuitable for two reasons. The first was technical: for reasons undetermined, all Eggdrop modules created extensive CPU usage, making it impossible to run several Eggdrops simultaneously to research a number of IRC networks. The second reason had to do with the statistics to be obtained. The objective was to get a snapshot of current IRC users and IRC channel use every five minutes, written into an ASCII file. It was impossible to extend Eggdrop's possibilities in a way that it would periodically submit the '/lusers' command and write the received data into a file. For these reasons, and some security concerns, the Eggdrop approach was abandoned.\n      IrcII was a UNIX IRC client with its own scripting language, making it possible to write command files which periodically submit the '/lusers' command to any chosen IRC server and log the command's output. Four different scripts were used to monitor IRCnet, EFnet, DALnet and Undernet from January to October 1998. These scripts were named Socius_D, Socius_E, Socius_I and Socius_U (depending on the network). Every hour each script stored the number of users and channels in a logfile (examinable using another script written in the Perl language).\n      There were some drawbacks to the ircII script approach. While the need for a terminal to run on could be avoided using the 'screen' package -- making it possible to start ircII, run the scripts, detach, and log off again -- it was impossible to restart ircII and the scripts using an automatic task-scheduler. Thus periodic manual checks were required to find out if the scripts were still running and restart them if needed (e.g. if the server connection was lost). These checks showed that at least one script would not be running after 10 hours. Additional disadvantages were the lengthy log files and the necessity of providing a second program to extract the log file data and write it into a second file from which meaningful graphs could be created. \n     The failure of the Eggdrop and ircII scripting approaches lead to the solution still in use today.\n     Perl script-only approach\n     Perl is a powerful script language for handling file-oriented data when speed is not extremely important. Its version 5 flavour allows a lot of modules to use it for expansion, including the Net::IRC package. The object-oriented Perl interface enables Perl scripts to connect to an IRC server, and use the basic IRC commands.\n     The Socip.pl program includes all server definitions needed to create connections. Socip is currently monitoring ten major IRC networks, including DALnet, EFnet, IRCnet, the Microsoft Network, Talkcity, Undernet and Galaxynet. When run, \"Social science IRC program\" selects a nickname from its list corresponding to the network -- For EFnet, the first nickname used is Socip_E1. It then functions somewhat like a 'bot. Using that nickname, Socip tries to create an IRC connection to a server of the given network. If there is no failure, handlers are set up which take care of proper reactions to IRC server messages (such as Ping-pong, message output and reply). Socip then joins the channel #hose (the name has no special meaning), a maintenance channel with the additional effect of real persons meeting the 'bot and trying to interact with it every now and then. Those interactions are logged too. Sitting in that channel, the script sleeps periodically and checks if a certain time span has passed (the default is five minutes). After that, the '/lusers' command's output is stored in a data file for each IRC network and the IRC network's RRD (Round Robin database) file is updated. This database, which is organised chronologically, offers great detail for recent events and more condensed information for older events. User and channel information younger than 10 days is stored in five-minute detail. If older than two years, the same information is automatically averaged and stored in a per-day resolution.\n     In case of network problems, Socip acts as necessary. For example, it recognises a connection termination and tries to reconnect after pausing by using the next nickname on the list. This prevents nickname collision problems. If the IRC server does not respond to '/luser' commands three times in a row, the next server on the list is accessed. Special (crontab-invoked) scripts take care of restarting Socip when necessary, as in termination of script because of network problems, IRC operator kill or power failure. After a reboot all scripts are automatically restarted. All monitoring is done on a Linux machine (Pentium 120, 32 MB, Debian Linux 2.1) which is up all the time. Processor load is not extensive, and this machine also acts as the Sociology Department's WWW-Server. \n     Graphs creation\n     Graphs can be created from the data in Socip's RRD files. This task is done using the MRTG (multi router traffic grapher) program by Tobias Oetiker. A script updates all IRC graphs four times a day. Usage of each IRC network is visualised through five graphs: Daily, Weekly and Monthly users and channels, accompanied by two graphs showing all known data users/channels and servers. All this information is continuously published on the World Wide Web at http://www.hinner.com/ircstat.\n     Figures \n     The following samples demonstrate what information can be produced by Socip. As already mentioned, graphs of all monitored networks are updated four times a day, with five graphs for each IRC network. \n     Figure 1 shows the rise of EFnet users from about 40000 in November 1998 to 65000 in July 2000. Sampled data is oscillating around an average amount, which is resulting from the different time zones of users.\n     Fig. 1: EFnet - Users and Channels since November 1998\n     \n     Figure 2 illustrates the decrease of interconnected EFnet servers over the years. Each server is now handling more and more users. Reasons for taking IRC servers off the net are security concerns (attacks on the server by malicious persons), new payment schemes, maintenance and cost effort.\n     Fig. 2: EFnet - Servers since November 1998 \n     \n     A nice example of a heavily changing weekly graph is Figure 3, which shows peaks shortly before 6pm CEST and almost no users shortly after midnight.\n     Fig. 3: Galaxynet: Weekly Graph (July, 15th-22nd, 2000)     \n     \n     The daily graph portrays usage variations with even more detail. Figure 4 is taken from Undernet user and channel data. The vertical gap in the graph indicates missing data, caused either by a net split or other network problems.\n     Fig. 4: Undernet: Daily Graph: July, 22nd, 2000\n          \n     \n     The final example (Figure 5) shows a weekly graph of the Webchat (http://www.webchat.org) network. It can be seen that every day the user count varies from 5000 to nearly 20000, and that channel numbers fluctuate in concert accordingly from 2500 to 5000.\n     Fig. 5: Webchat: Monthly graph, Week 24-29, 2000     \n     \n     Not every IRC user is connected all the time to an IRC network. This figure may have increased lately with more and more flatrates and cheap Internet access offers, but in general most users will sign off the network after some time. This is why IRC is a very dynamic society, with its membership constantly in flux. Maximum user counts only give the highest number of members who were simultaneously online at some point, and one could only guess at the number of total users of the network -- that is, including those who are using that IRC service but are not signed on at that time. To answer these questions, more thorough investigation is necessary. Then inflows and outflows might be more readily estimated.\n     Table 2 shows the all time maximum user counts of seven IRC networks, compared to the average numbers of IRC users of the four major IRC networks during the third quarter 1998 (based on available data).\n     \n       Table 2: Maximum user counts of selected IRC networks\n       \n     \n     \n     \n     \n\n \n         DALnet\n         EFnet\n         Galaxy Net\n         IRCnet\n         MS Chat\n         Undernet\n         Webchat\n       \n\n\n            \n           Max. 2000 \n\n         64276\n         64309\n         15253\n         65340\n         17392\n         60210\n         19793\n       \n\n3rd Q. 1998\n         21000\n         37000\n         \n            \n           n/a \n         24500\n         n/a\n         24000\n         n/a\n       \n\nCompared with the 200-300 users in 1991 and the 7000 IRC-chatters in 1994, the recent growth is certainly extraordinary: it adds up to a total of 306573 users across all monitored networks. It can be expected that the 500000 IRC user threshold will be passed some time during the year 2001.\n     As a final remark, it should be said that obviously Web-based chat systems will be more and more common in the future. These chat services do not use standard IRC protocols, and will be very hard to monitor. Given that these systems are already quite popular, the actual number of chat users in the world could have already passed the half million landmark.\n          \n     References\n       \nReid, Elizabeth. \"Electropolis: Communications and Community on Internet Relay Chat.\" Unpublished Honours Dissertation.

    "abstract": "\n      Introduction\n              Media scholars operating within a Marxist framework view the penetration\n                of mass media into Fourth World cultures as a form of oppression enacting\n                a colonialist agenda upon helpless spectators. Proponents of cultural\n                studies, however, argue that television audiences actively and creatively\n                construct their own meanings rather than passively absorb pre-packaged\n                meanings imposed upon them (Ang 243). \n              In this article, I will posit an alternative approach. I will argue that\n                Fourth World people are forced to ask not only \"Who are 'we'?\" but also\n              \"Who are 'they'?\" The answer to the second question shapes and informs\n                the answer to the first question, as Fourth World people are forced to\n                negotiate their identity upon exposure to First World television. The\n                result is a transformative process whereby Fourth World viewers reassign\n                the roles of \"self\" and \"other\" in order to defend, preserve, and re-\n                construct their own selfhood. \n              An Anthropology of Television\n              Studies on audience reception have been virtually ignored within\n                anthropology. Spitulnik bemoans the fact that there is as yet no\n              \"anthropology of mass media\" as anthropologists have largely managed to\n                neglect the centrality of mass media in 20th-century life (293).\n                Anthropologists in industrial countries have paid scant systematic\n                attention to the production, distribution, and consumption of mass media\n                in their own societies and even less to mass media in non-industrial\n                societies (A. Lyons 432). While there are emerging wide-scale debates on\n                the subject of anthropology and film current within the field of visual\n                anthropology, discussions concerning anthropology and television are\n                scarce (Weicker 273). \n              The glaring lack of reception studies reflects the unacknowledged\n                assumption that all viewers process information in the same manner. \n                Studies have shown, however, that there is an intrinsic link between\n                culture and communication and that each culture socialises its members in\n                its own viewing habits and interpretive strategies. Simply stated, the\n                media do not affect all equally or in the same fashion. The dynamics of\n                image interpretation are magnified when the producer of the image and the\n                consumer of the image come from different cultures. Messages encoded in\n                the First World may be aberrantly decoded wholly or partially in Fourth\n                World countries, or they may not be fully acceptable (A. Lyons 442). \n              Although television attracts a tremendous amount of popular interest,\n                serious criticism is relegated to the margins of film or communication\n                studies if it enters into academia at all (Joyrich 21). Anthropologists\n                are only beginning to consider the rich cultural forms of television that\n                are so pivotal in the development of national sentiments (Abu-Lughod 493).\n                Most TV impact studies done so far are generally limited to the First\n                World and tend to focus on a limited target group (i.e., children) and\n                range of effects (i.e., violence) (Kottak 11). \n              This is unfortunate considering television's huge cultural significance\n                as one of the most important parts in society's mass communication. In\n                many parts of the world, television is the most popular and ubiquitous\n                public medium, offering a diversity and availablity unmatched by the print\n                media (Abu-Lughod 509). Mass media, and television in particular, are\n                forces which provide audiences with ways of seeing and interpreting the\n                world -- ways which ultimately shape their very existence and\n                participation within society. \n              Television must be viewed with a wider lens. Framed by the discourses of\n                television, contemporary formations of identity have shifted in ways that\n                radically alter the epistemological, aesthetic, and ideological space of\n                cultures (Joyrich 22). Television is the site of convergence that joins\n                the private world of the home with the larger public worlds beyond the\n                front door (Moores 9). \n              The \"Global Village\"\n              In Understanding Media, Marshall McLuhan prophesied the worldwide\n                coalescence of human awareness into a single community that he would\n                ultimately call the \"global village\". According to McLuhan, the developed\n                world is experiencing a transformative convergence of computing and\n                communications technology whose impact will rival that of the replacement\n                of muscle power by machines (Wright 84). \n              Over 30 years later, Hillary Rodham Clinton remarked on the \"frantic and\n                fragmented\" lifestyle brought about by this new technology. She echoes\n                the African proverb (which is also the title of her bestselling book) that\n              \"it takes a village to raise a child\" (13). The \"village\" she refers to\n                can no longer be defined as a place on a map, or a list of people or\n                organisations, but its essence remains the same: it is the network of\n                values and relationships that support and affect our lives (Clinton 13). \n                Although the American President's wife uses the concept of a \"village\"\n                differently from her unwitting predecessor, the notion of\n                interconnectedness remains the same. \n              The Threat of Homogenisation\n              Amid the social, territorial, and cultural developments of the 20th\n                century, the landscapes of cultural identity -- \"ethnoscapes\" -- around\n                the world are no longer familiar anthropological objects, insofar as\n                groups are no longer tightly territorialised or spatially bounded\n                (Appadurai 191). In this culture-play of diaspora, the familiar line of\n                demarcation separating \"self\" from \"other\" has become increasingly\n                blurred. According to Meyrowitz, the media have created new \"communities\n                across spaces of transmission, bringing together otherwise disparate\n                grounds around the common experience of television, thereby resulting in\n                the cultural 'homogenization of here and there'\" (cited in Morley 12). \n              As electronic tools have proliferated, Halleck &amp; Magnan argue, the\n                variety of views has lessened in mainstream media: \"Coca-Cola says they\n                need not make commercials for specific national markets anymore: everyone\n                likes the same music, understands the same images and yes, everyone drinks\n                Coca-Cola\" (155). The global popularity of American transnational culture\n                has made it impossible to get a tabula rasa, if one ever existed. This\n              \"westernisation\" of the entire world has serious repercussions for how\n                people in non-Western countries, and the Fourth World in particular,\n                grapple to preserve their ethnic and cultural identity amidst a whirlwind\n                of McDonald's, Coca-Cola, and Pamela Lee. \n              When McLuhan first coined the term \"global village\" in the 1960s, his\n                view of such a world was optimistic. As years passed, however, he grew\n                increasingly wary of the communications \"implosion\" (Wright 89). In The\n                Global Village, which his friend and collaborator Bruce Powers published\n                posthumously, the authors devote nine pages to the \"satisfactions\" of\n              \"Global Robotism\" and 38 pages to its \"dissatisfactions\". They claim that\n                the salient issue of the information age will be the need to exclude\n                information as the average global villager will be bombarded by an\n                onslaught of media messages. \n              In 1984, George Orwell warned that society would be controlled by an\n                externally imposed oppression. In Alduous Huxley's vision, presented in\n                Brave New World, people will come to love their oppression and to adore\n                the technologies that undo their capacities to think (Postman vii;\n                emphasis added). In Amusing Ourselves to Death, Postman argues that there\n                are two ways by which the spirit of a culture may be shriveled. In the\n                first -- the Orwellian -- culture becomes a prison, whereas in the second -\n                - the Huxleyan -- culture becomes a burlesque:\n               In the age of advanced technology, spiritual devastation is more likely\n  to come from an enemy with a smiling face than from one whose countenance\n  exudes suspicion and hate. In the Huxleyan prophecy, Big Brother does\n  not\n  watch us, by his choice. We watch him, by ours. (Postman 155)\n              By ushering in the Age of Television, Postman contends that America has\n                brought the Huxleyan prophecy to fruition. \n              The Cultural Imperialism Thesis\n              Media scholars operating in a Marxist theoretical framework like Postman\n                have deplored the consequences for cultural autonomy of the global reach\n                of First World television programs. Electronic media can potentially\n                color, distort, and even degrade an entire cultural world view, they\n                argue, by presenting images of the world suited to the agenda of the media\n                (Funkhouser &amp; Shaw 86). This theory is generally referred to as \"cultural\n                imperialism\", which Sarmela defines as\n               the economic, technological, and cultural hegemony of the industrialized\n  nations which determines the direction of both economic and social\n  progress, defines cultural values and standardizes the civilization and\n  cultural environment throughout the world. (13)\n              In Make-Believe Media, Parenti portrays the media as an insidious\n                juggernaut controlling every thought of a mass of mindless zombies. He\n                contends that films and television programmes have propagated images and\n                ideologies that perpetuate the \"isms\": imperialism, anti-communism,\n                capitalism, racism, sexism, militarism, and vigilantism, to name but a few\n                (2). Prolonged exposure results in the surrender of a critical capacity. \n                In fact, consumers of mass media \"become active accomplices in [their] own\n                indoctrination\" (6). This is the only thing viewers actively do, because\n                in Parenti's estimations, media render their victims little more than\n                passive spectators. \n              Herbert Schiller is perhaps most closely associated with the cultural\n                imperialism thesis. In Mass Communications and American Empire, he claims\n                that American television exports are part of a general effort by the\n                American military industrial complex to subject the world to military\n                control, electronic surveillance, and homogenised American commercial\n                culture (cited in Tunstall 38). The export of cheap American television\n                programs, Schiller speculates, was deliberately undertaken by American\n                political interests in order to convert subaltern populations to American\n                cultural and political values, thereby maintaining American political\n                dominance and securing a market for American products (A. Lyons 441). \n              Schiller may get a bit carried away but the impact of television on\n                Fourth World cultures is irrefutable. In their article, \"Why Do The\n                Indians Wear Adidas?\", Arnould &amp; Wilk describe the influence of\n                globalisation upon subaltern cultures:\n               Peruvian Indians carry around small, rectangular rocks painted to look\n  like transistor radios ... Bana tribesmen in Kako, Ethiopia pay a hefty\n  price to look through a view-master at 'Pluto Tries to Become a Circus\n  Dog' ... When a Swazi princess weds a Zulu king, she wears red touraco\n  wing feathers around her forehead and a cape of windowbird feathers and\n  oxtails. He wears a leopard skin cloak. Yet all is recorded with a Kodak\n  movie camera, and the band plays 'The Sound of Music' ... Veiled noble\n  Tuareg men carry swords modelled after the Crusaders' weapons and sport\n  mirrored sunglasses with tiny hearts etched into the lenses. (748)\n              Every culture in which television appeared has experienced a reduction in\n                the diversity of activities. Kent found that Navajo families without\n                television, for example, performed a wide array of activities such as\n                family discussions, butchering, weaving baskets and blankets, jewelry\n                making -- which were generally absent in Navajo households with television\n                (124). Similarly, in a rural city in Nigeria, H. Lyons discovered that\n                the introduction of the new and highly popular evening activity, conducted\n                largely within private family quarters, has markedly reduced evening\n                social life by \"keeping them indoors\" (413). This same pattern of\n                disrupting and monopolising leisure activity appears everywhere television\n                penetrates Fourth World cultures. \n              For this reason, cultural imperialism theorists have decried the\n              \"contamination\" of traditional culture by mass media, recognising a clear\n                difference between those with access and those without (Aufderheide;\n                Mankekur). The logical conclusion to be drawn is that Western media are\n                fundamentally incompatible with notions of cultural autonomy and\n                diversity. \n              The Active Audience\n              Proponents of cultural studies see the cultural imperialism thesis as\n                problematic. In their view, cultural imperialists reduce societies\n                penetrated by electronic media to a simple juxtaposition of two worlds: a\n                pristine \"before\" and a degenerate \"after\". Television thus becomes a\n                cultural and historical watershed allowing people to create a mythical\n                past (Wilk 237). While there have certainly been changes since the\n                introduction of television, there have always been changes. Cultural\n                studies advocates argue that the media constitute only part of the process\n                of actual and alleged cultural loss. \n              Rather than creating massive cultural homogeneity on a global scale,\n                societies who have recently gained access to television are replacing one\n                diversity with another (Hannerz 555). The popular perception among\n                cultural imperialism theorists that globalisation threatens cultural\n                identity is, according to Ang, a misnomer (252). The desire to keep\n                national identity and culture wholesome and pristine is not only\n                unrealistic but oblivious to the contradictions condensed in the very\n                concept of national identity. Defining identity in static terms ignores\n                the fact that identity is a site of struggle -- a fundamentally dynamic,\n                complex, and unstable phenomenon. \n              Cultural studies scholars have responded by portraying people of the\n                Fourth World not as passive objects to be dominated at will but as active\n                subjects capable of making their own decisions. Katz &amp; Liebes, for\n                example, argue that television viewing is a negotiation process involving\n                the story on the screen, the culture of the viewers, and the interpersonal\n                exchanges among the viewers (101). The audience is not a \"sponge\" which\n                will automatically soak in Western culture for good or evil. Rather, it\n                picks and chooses what it likes and interprets what it chooses. \n              TV viewing is, first and foremost for cultural studies scholars, an\n                active and social process. Television audiences actively and creatively\n                construct their own meanings rather than passively absorbing pre-packaged\n                meanings imposed upon them (Ang 243). In fact, Lembo &amp; Tucker argue that\n                audiences engage with television images and interpret them in accordance\n                with their life situations, struggling to redefine meanings of media\n                objects in ways consistent with their own cultural values (98). Viewers'\n                active interaction with television texts turns reception into a site of\n                struggle and not simply a site of domination. \n              This argument is repeated ad nauseam in cultural studies. I agree with\n                Silverstone that there is a danger in pursuing the active audience too far\n                (177). While cultural studies properly emphasises the significance of\n                understanding audience decodings, it neglects the contexts and pressure\n                that influence those interpretations (Carragee 87). More specifically, it\n                has failed to examine how media content expresses dominant ideological\n                meanings. \n              Here, I posit an alternative approach to television reception among\n                Fourth World audiences. Television is neither homogenising, as cultural\n                imperialism theorists advocate, nor simply a terrain for active\n                interpretation, as proponents of cultural studies argue, but revolves\n                around the negotiation for identity rooted in a negotiation of power\n                relations. \n              Negotiation for Identity\n              As the world becomes increasingly mass-mediated, the study of how\n                audiences manage contradictions between the specificities of their own\n                lives and the imposed generalities of a homogenised mass culture becomes\n                central (Silverstone 173). Institutions of mass cultural dissemination\n                provide the cultural field on which fragmented identities are formed and\n                reformed (Garnham 253). Television, in particular, plays a crucial role\n                in the formation and maintenance of cultural and social identities. \n              Recent trends in anthropology reflect a growing acknowledgment of the\n                significance of mass media to processes of identity construction\n                (Mankekar). Viewers' interpretations are profoundly influenced by broader\n                social discourses in which they are interpellated. In an increasingly\n                integrated world system, there is no such thing as an independent cultural\n                identity; rather, every identity must define and position itself in\n                relation to the cultural frames affirmed by the world system (Ang 253). In\n                this way, the global and local are inextricably linked in a dialectical\n                relationship: what people watch is mediated by, and simultaneously helps\n                illuminate, developments in their lives. More specifically, I contend that\n                the question \"Who are 'they'?\" directly shapes and informs the question\n              \"Who are 'we'?\" \n              Who Are \"They\"?\n              According to Katz &amp; Dayan, the viewing of television is a liminal\n                activity in which masses of people routinely -- even ritualistically --\n                disconnect themselves from their everyday concerns, enter into a protected\n              \"time out\", and allow themselves to be transported symbolically elsewhere\n                (305). This liminal phase exists between the real world and an imaginary\n                world or what Funkhouser &amp; Shaw term \"real experience\" and \"synthetic\n                experience\" (80). \n              Until the advent of electronic media, for most people actual experience\n                was limited to events within reality. But with the emergence of the\n              \"global village\", people gain access to an information environment of\n                unreal and synthetic events -- an experience akin to \"viewing life through\n                a one-way mirror\" (Funkhouser &amp; Shaw 79) As Postman writes: \"there is no\n                more disturbing consequence of the electronic and graphic revolution than\n                this: that the world as given to us through television seems natural, not\n                bizarre\" (79). \n              Horton &amp; Wohl argue that media and media performers deliberately create\n                an illusion which they call a \"para-social relationship\" -- the implicit\n                agreement between performer and viewer of an interpersonal relationship\n                (33). The pattern and structure of the television medium breeds a comfort\n                and familiarity which foster a close, social relationship between the\n                viewer and viewed. Caughey calls the intimate involvement with large\n                numbers of unmet media figures through media consumption \"synthetic social\n                relations\" (33). Despite the lack of actual contact, viewers tend to feel\n                strongly about media figures. \n              The question \"Who are 'they'\"? consists of an individual's \"real social\n                world\" -- the people with whom he or she actually interacts -- and\n              \"artificial social world\" -- all beings known through the media (usually\n                numbering several times more \"persons\"). The television viewer becomes\n                familiar with a throng of other beings with whom he or she never engages\n                in actual contact. In the developed world, people devote considerably\n                more time to artificial rather than real relationships. At the time of\n                Caughey's writing, mass media consumption occupied 50% of leisure time\n                (Caughey 73). With the advent of the Internet, I estimate that figure to\n                be much higher today. \n              The situation is different, however, for Fourth World viewers. While\n                direct interaction can correct or disprove media stereotypes for American\n                viewers, this is less likely for Fourth World viewers who are more apt to\n                believe what they see on television because they generally lack any frame\n                of reference to think otherwise. Because they rarely, if ever, come into\n                actual physical contact with the types of people represented on the\n                screen, their experience is limited to synthetic representations. If\n                television consumption determines how one perceives the world and, in\n                particular, how one views \"others\", this power is amplified for Fourth\n                World audiences. \n              Who Are \"We\"?\n              Notions of \"who are 'they'\"? directly shape and inform an understanding\n                of \"who are 'we'?\" because of the tendency to apply what viewers see on\n                screen to their own personal experiences. In his article \"Fiction as\n                Truth: Viewer Use of Fiction Films as Data About the 'Real' World\", Custen\n                investigated the ways viewers in peer groups discussed a feature film\n                after its screening and found that events or objects within the cinematic\n                frame are discussed in terms of their congruence not with the auteur's\n                world, but with the extra-cinematic world of the viewer (29). In other\n                words, the fictive material is used as data or evidence in discourses\n                concerning the world outside the film frame. \n              The real social world and the artificial social world seem to overlap. \n                The verbal responses to the film are constructed using data from the \"real\n                life\" of viewers rather than the fictive world defined by the film and\n                filmmaker. Custen's findings indicate that viewers tend to discuss how\n                the film is meaningful to them in some real life context by employing\n                markers from their own lives: \"viewers organize the symbolic world in\n                terms that are 'common' to them through a selection process that holds the\n                film up to a mirror of their shared, familiar realities\" (35). In this\n                way, \"who are 'they'?\" mirrors \"who are 'we'?\" \n              This phenomenon is not limited to film, as it is also evident in Reid's\n                study of the television viewing habits of black women in London. Reid\n                found that criticisms voiced about the portrayal of blacks on British\n                television revolved around how far such representations were from their\n                own experiences. As an example, the black women largely disparaged The\n                Cosby Show for depicting an idealised and thus unrealistic portrayal of\n                blacks while similarly condemning documentaries because they reinforced\n                negative images of blacks. \n              Likewise, Seiter et al. discovered that soap opera viewers tended to\n                permit the fiction of the shows to spill over into their real lives and\n                social worlds (235). All of the informants in one study felt so connected\n                to the characters on the shows that they viewed the soaps as relevant to\n                their own social reality. As one informant stated: \"they [the soap\n                operas] do set moral standards\" (Seiter et al. 236). The relationship is,\n                in fact, reciprocal: viewers evaluate the characters according to their\n                own values while, at the same time, learning values from the characters. \n                In other words, \"Who are 'they'?\" informs \"Who are 'we'?\" and vice versa. \n              Despite the recognition that the characters are fictional, all informants\n                treated the characters as social beings. Viewers in these studies\n                interacted with media figures because they are part of the same social\n                world. What if the characters are a part of a different social world, as\n                in the case of Fourth World viewers? \n              Negotiation of Power Relations\n              Identity formation is embedded in the negotiation of perceived power\n                relations. Most audience studies ignore the fact that discourses of\n                individual viewers and those of television have different levels of power\n                (Carragee 92). The capacity of viewers to negotiate meanings does not\n                match the power of a centralised storytelling institution such as\n                television. For Fourth World viewers watching First World television, the\n                answer to \"Who are 'they'?\" is always more powerful than the answer to\n              \"Who are 'we'?\" \n              Idealising the \"Self\"\n              When the Fourth World (\"other\") views the First World (\"self\") through\n                the medium of television, it is exposed to a strange world most know very\n                little about. Initially, Fourth World viewers are overwhelmed by the\n                disparity of the two worlds and struck by what they do not have in\n                comparison. Television generally provides Fourth World viewers with an\n                elaborately extended sense of \"otherness\". As a result, the admiration of\n                the represented First World \"selfhood\", and the concomitant inadequacy of\n                their own \"otherness\", are magnified. \n              For example, in \"The 'Other' as Viewer\", Adra records and describes the\n                initial audience reactions to television in a small rural community in\n                Yemen. What happens when Western filmic representations are shown to\n                people whose assumptions about human nature, intentionality, and the\n                nature of society are almost exactly opposite to those in the West? (Adra\n                263). Predictably, perceptions of the nature of the world outside Yemen\n                altered radically. Before television, they were justly proud of their\n                civilisation. However, after seeing images ranging from skyscrapers and\n                factories to blenders and the daily operation of a bank, some began to\n                question the adequacy of their own lifestyle (Adra 260). \n              Disparaging the \"Other\"\n              After this initial phase of idealisation, envy evolves into disparagement\n                as Fourth World peoples are forced to assert their own identity. Kuehnast\n                describes this phenomenon as \"the export of prejudice\", by which she\n                refers to the dissemination of a dominant ideology which results in the\n                perpetuation of myths, prejudices, or limited understandings about other\n                peoples (184). In Kuehnast's estimation, the \"export of prejudice\"\n                results when the \"self\" views the \"other\". I contend that this also\n                happens when the \"other\" views the \"self\". \n              The \"export of prejudice\" is essentially another name for ethnocentrism,\n                which Segall et al. define as \"the view of things in which one's own group\n                and customs are unconsciously used as the standard for all judgments, as\n                the center of everything, with all other peoples and customs scaled and\n                rated accordingly\" (9-10). I agree with Crawford that television \"is\n                intrinsically ethnocentric\" because, as a mass audience medium, it must\n                always try to relate \"their\" societies to \"ours\" (75). \n              Among television audiences, ethnocentrism usually takes the form of a\n              \"love/hate\" relationship with media figures. In Seiter et al.'s soap\n                opera study, for example, the relationship between viewer and character\n                typically oscillated between hostility and admiration (237). In the case\n                of Erica Kane, a popular soap opera villain, one of the informants envied\n                her but (or as a result) also felt the need to disparage her (Seiter et\n                al. 238). Perhaps fuelled by the recognition of gaping class differences\n                between the extravagant lifestyles of the characters and the more domestic\n                lifestyles of most of the informants, viewers put the characters \"down\" so\n                they could feel \"up\". \n              The export of prejudice goes hand in hand with the import of pride. Many\n                members of the Benin audiences in Nigeria, for example, criticise the lack\n                of filial piety displayed by children on American television (H. Lyons). \n                This strong opposition is predictable in a society that prides itself on\n                having retained more reliable family values than the perceived norm in\n                Europe or North America (H. Lyong 419). The Benin audience highlights the\n                negatives of the television representation in relation to their own\n                positives. This interpretation is based on ethnocentrism. \n              Transformative Process\n              Viewers can rearrange the textual encodings of ideology without\n                necessarily articulating an oppositional ideological stance (Lembo &amp;\n                Tucker 111). The homogeneity of television is never complete because\n                people interpret what they see in ways different from, and often opposed\n                to, the ideological encoding preferred by élites (Fiske 61). The Fourth\n                World audience rearranges the textual encodings in television by\n                reconstructing its sense of \"self\" and \"other\". \n              In dialogism, the very capacity to have consciousness is based on\n                otherness (Holquist 18). \"Self\" can never be a self-sufficient construct\n                but is dialogic, or defined in relation, to the \"other\":\n               I get my self from the other; it is only from the other's categories that\n  will let me be an object for my own perception ... In order to forge a\n  self, I must do so from outside. In other words, I author myself. \n  (Bahktin cited in Hoquist 28; emphasis added)\n              Dialogism argues that all meaning is relative in that it is the result of\n                a relation between two bodies occupying simultaneous but different space. \n                Reality is always experienced from a particular position. \n              Thus, I contend that the Fourth World television audience undertakes a\n                transformative process whereby it reassigns the roles from the \"other\"\n                viewing the \"self\" to the \"self\" viewing the \"other\". After initially\n                idealising the First World, Fourth World viewers embark on the process of\n              \"otherising\" the First World through an export of prejudice and import of\n                pride. \"Otherising\" is not negative, as is commonly perceived. In fact,\n                in the context of Fourth World viewers of First World television, it is\n                necessary for self-defence, self-preservation, and self-construction. \n              Conclusion\n              Depending on who you ask, awareness of the outside world through\n                television can lead to anything from enlightenment to damnation. But\n                above all, images on the electronic box radically transform not only an\n                understanding of the outside world but also the way Fourth World peoples\n                define themselves and their relationship to each other. By presenting\n                subaltern audiences with an objectified \"other\", television prompts the\n                emergence of an objectified \"self\". \n              People who are heavily exposed to the media use it as their main raw\n                material for perceiving and understanding the outside world. In this way,\n                television determines how Fourth World peoples see and interact with\n                others. In Brazil, for example, television trains villagers in national\n                norms and teaches them how to deal with non-Brazilians (Kottak). As a\n                facilitator of social interaction, television plays an integrative role in\n                creating a pan-Brazilian identity. Thus, television also determines how\n                Fourth World peoples see themselves. \n              The intimate awareness of otherness, presented by television images, has\n                led Fourth World peoples to create a new concept of culture. In Fourth\n                World cultures after television, people talk about \"culture\" in ways that\n                were not possible before its arrival (Wilk 240). \"Who are 'we'?\" would\n                not have been asked, or asked in the same way, were it not for the \"Who\n                are 'they'?\" necessitated by the introduction of television. \n                Paradoxically, contrary to most fears, television actually serves to\n                create rather than destroy a national identity by forcing Fourth World\n                peoples to re-define themselves. \n              \n          \n              References\n              \nAbu-Lughod, Lila. \"Finding a Place for Islam: Egyptian Television\n                  Serials and the National Interest.\" Public Culture 5.3 (1993): 493-514.\n                Adra, Najwa. \"The 'Other' as Viewer: Reception of Western and Arab\n                  Televised Representations in Rural Yemen\".

    "abstract": "\n      In the beginning, the editors were brought together by science fiction, the popular cultural form most devoted to thinking about the future. The world though is too complex to produce a straight line from academic work on science fiction to editing a journal issue on the future, so the sf we started with was science fiction about the past. It's taken us a while to get to the future, but here, to a certain extent, we are. \n      Thinking about the future is never easy, never really free of fiction, and the only strong chance is that you'll get it wrong (as innumerable prognostications from space ships with punch cards driving them to Government transport planning can testify). \n      It became apparent as we worked through the submissions that there was a strange inhibition at work. Even though contributors knew that the publication date for the issue was 2000, not one had been able to project themselves into such a significant future time. Piece after piece talked of here in 1999 and what it would be like in the 21st century without actually trying to be there. Was it those millennial fears that stopped people writing 'here in 2000' or daring 'this century' for the 21st? Actually we don't think we've found many references anywhere at all to 'this century' yet; perhaps we're still recovering from the surprise at the uneventfulness of our entering it. Although we had been saying there was nothing special about the shift from one lot of numbers to another and that the fuss was a lot of marketing hype, actually believing it seems to have been more difficult.\n      It became apparent as we worked through the submissions that there was a strange inhibition at work.

Although we had been saying there was nothing special about the shift from one lot of numbers to another and that the fuss was a lot of marketing hype, actually believing it seems to have been more difficult.\n      Daniel Palmer discusses the ways that one of the most interesting and provocative science fiction films of the last few years, Luc Besson's The Fifth Element, represents its future and what this can say about historicity. Given how very much the recent prognostication pieces in popular print media drew on stills from this film in preference to alternative images, we think his choice is a wise one. He doesn't mention the differential reception of the film inside and outside the US, but its role in displaying the ability of non-US film-makers to do big-budget sf as well as the thoughtful kind is worth noting. Andrew M. Butler continues the sf line with a light-hearted bid for power in the world of terminology in narrative theory. \n      We move from Butler's parody to one of the most serious of the areas where attempts are made to regulate the future - welfare policy. Lisa Gunders specifically talks of the Australian situation but raises issues of global currency. Jacki Apple's contribution steers clear of parody in her consideration of what be the case in fifty years time in the light of recent developments in fields like nano-technology and genetic engineering. Our final contributor, Jason Ensor, takes us to religious prophecy -- for many the antithesis of where we began with science fiction. \n      \n      Citation reference for this article \n      MLA style:\n      \n Frances Bonner, Paul Starr. \"Editorial: 'Future'.\" M/C: A Journal of Media and Culture 2.9 (2000).

Maybe they need good financial\n                information, but I don't think people know what good information is when\n                you get into culture, society, and politics.\"\n                -- Steven Brill,Chairman and Editor-in-chief, Brill's Content\n              \n                \n              Once upon a time, not very long ago, advertisements were easy to\n                recognise. They had simple personalities with goals not much more\n                complicated than selling you a bar of soap or a box of cereal. And they\n                possessed the reassuring familiarity of old friends or relatives you've\n                known all your life. They were Pilgrims who smiled at you from Quaker Oats\n                boxes or little tablets named \"Speedy\" who joyfully danced into a glass of\n                water with the sole purpose of giving up their short life to help lessen\n                your indigestion from overindulgence. Yes, sometimes they could be a\n                little obnoxious but, hey, it was a predictable annoyance. \n              And once, not very long ago, advertisements also knew their place in the\n                landscape of popular culture, their boundaries were the ad space of\n                magazines or the commercial time of television programs. When the ads got\n                too annoying, you could toss the magazine aside or change the TV channel.\n                The ease and quickness of their dispatch had the abruptness of slamming\n                your front door in the face of an old door-to-door salesman. \n              This all began to change around the 1950s when advertisements acquired a\n                more complex and subtle personality and began straying outside of their\n                familiar media neighborhoods. The social observer Vance Packard wrote a\n                best-selling book in the late 50s called The Hidden Persuaders which\n                identified this change in advertising's personality as coming from hanging\n                around Professor Freud's psychoanalysis and learning his hidden,\n                subliminal methods of trickery. \n              Ice cubes in a glass for a liquor ad were no longer seen as simple props\n                to help sell a brand of whiskey but were now subliminal suggestions of\n                female anatomy. The curved fronts of automobiles were more than aesthetic\n                streamlined design features but rather suggestive of a particular feature\n                of the male anatomy. Forgotten by the new subliminal types of ads was the\n                simple salesmanship preached by founders of the ad industry like David\n                Ogilvy and John Caples. The word \"sales\" became a dirty word and was\n                replaced with modern psychological buzzwords like subliminal persuasion. \n              The Evolution of Subliminal Techniques\n              The book Hidden Persuaders made quite a stir at the time, bringing about\n                congressional hearings and even the introduction of legislation. Prominent\n                motivation researchers Louis Cheskin and Ernest Dichter utilised the new\n                ad methods and were publicly admonished as traitors to their profession.\n                The life of the new subliminal advertising seemed short indeed. Even Vance\n                Packard predicted its coming demise. \"Eventually, say by A.D. 2000,\" he\n                wrote in the preface to the paperback edition of his book, \"all this depth\n                manipulation of the psychological variety will seem amusingly old-\n                fashioned\". \n              Yet, 40 years later, any half-awake observer of popular culture knows\n                that things haven't exactly worked out the way Packard predicted. In fact\n                what seems old-fashioned today is the belief that ads are those simpletons\n                they once were before the 50s and that products are sold for features and\n                benefits rather than for images. Even Vance Packard expresses an amazement\n                at the evolution of advertising since the 50s, noting that today ads for\n                watches have nothing to do with watches or that ads for shoes scarcely\n                mention shoes. Packard remarks \"it used to be the brand identified the\n                product. In today's advertising the brand is the product\". Modern\n                advertising, he notes, has an almost total obsession with images and\n                feelings and an almost total lack of any concrete claims about the product\n                and why anyone should buy it. Packard admits puzzlement. \"Commercials seem\n                totally unrelated to selling any product at all\". Jeff DeJoseph of the J.\n                Walter Thompson firm underlines Packard's comments. \"We are just trying to\n                convey a sensory impression of the brand, and we're out of there\". \n              Subliminal advertising techniques have today infiltrated the heart of\n                corporate America. As Ruth Shalit notes in her article \"The Return of the\n                Hidden Persuaders\" from the 27 September 1999 issue of Salon magazine,\n              \"far from being consigned to the maverick fringe, the new psycho-\n                persuaders of corporate America have colonized the marketing departments\n                of mainstream conglomerates. At companies like Kraft, Coca-Cola, Proctor &amp;\n                Gamble and Daimler-Chrysler, the most sought-after consultants hail not\n                from McKinsey &amp; Company, but from brand consultancies with names like\n                Archetype Discoveries, PsychoLogics and Semiotic Solutions\". \n              Shalit notes a growing number of CEOs have become convinced they cannot\n                sell their brands until they first explore the \"Jungian substrata of four-\n                wheel drive; unlock the discourse codes of female power sweating; or\n                deconstruct the sexual politics of bologna\". The result, as Shalit\n                observes, is a \"charmingly retro school of brand psychoanalysis, which\n                holds that all advertising is simply a variation on the themes of the\n                Oedipus complex, the death instinct, or toilet training, and that the goal\n                of effective communications should be to compensate the consumer for the\n                fact that he was insufficiently nursed as an infant, has taken corporate\n                America by storm\". \n              The Growing Ubiquity of Advertising\n              Yet pervasive as the subliminal techniques of advertising have become,\n                the emerging power of modern advertising ultimately centres around \"where\"\n                it is rather than \"what\" it is or \"how\" it works. The power of modern\n                advertising is within this growing ubiquity or \"everywhereness\" of\n                advertising rather than the technology and methodology of advertising. The\n                ultimate power of advertising will be arrived at when ads cannot be\n                distinguished from their background environment. When this happens, the\n                environment will become a great continuous ad. \n              In the process, ads have wandered away from their well-known hangouts in\n                magazines and TV shows. Like alien-infected pod-people of early science\n                fiction movies, they have stumbled out of these familiar media playgrounds\n                and suddenly sprouted up everywhere. The ubiquity of advertising is not\n                being driven by corporations searching for new ways to sell products but\n                by media searching for new ways to make money. \n              Traditionally, media made money by selling subscriptions and advertising\n                space. But these two key income sources are quickly drying up in the new\n                world of online media. Journalist Mike France wisely takes notice of this\n                change in an important article \"Journalism's Online Credibility Gap\" from\n                the 11 October 1999 issue of Business Week. France notes that subscription\n                fees have not worked because \"Web surfers are used to getting content for\n                free, and they have been reluctant to shell out any money for it\".\n                Advertising sales and their Internet incarnation in banner ads have also\n                been a failure so far, France observes, because companies don't like\n                paying a flat fee for online advertising since it's difficult to track the\n                effectiveness of their marketing dollars. Instead, they only want to pay\n                for actual sales leads, which can be easily monitored on the Web as\n                readers' click from site to site. \n              Faced with the above situation, media companies have gone on the prowl\n                for new ways to make money. This search underpins the emerging ubiquity of\n                advertising: the fact that it is increasingly appearing everywhere. In the\n                process, traditional boundaries between advertising and other societal\n                institutions are being overrun by these media forces on the prowl for new\n              \"territory\" to exploit. \n              That time when advertisements knew their place in the landscape of\n                popular culture and confined themselves to just magazines or TV\n                commercials is a fading memory. And today, as each of us is bombarded by\n                thousands of ads each day, it is impossible to \"slam\" the door and keep\n                them out of our house as we could once slam the door in the face of the\n                old door-to-door salesmen. \n              Of course you can find them on the matchbook cover of your favorite bar,\n                on t-shirts sold at some roadside tourist trap or on those logo baseball\n                caps you always pick up at trade shows. But now they have got a little\n                more personal and stare at you over urinals in the men's room. They have\n                even wedged themselves onto the narrow little bars at the check-out\n                counter conveyer belts of supermarkets or onto the handles of gasoline\n                pumps at filling stations. The list goes on and on. (No, this article is\n                not an ad.) \n              Advertising and Entertainment\n              In advertising's march to ubiquity, two major boundaries have been\n                crossed. They are crucial boundaries which greatly enhance advertising's\n                search for the invisibility of ubiquity. Yet they are also largely\n                invisible themselves. These are the boundaries separating advertising from\n                entertainment and those separating advertising from journalism. \n              The incursion of advertising into entertainment is a result of the\n                increasing merger of business and entertainment, a phenomenon pointed out\n                in best-selling business books like Michael Wolf's Entertainment Economy\n                and Joseph Pine's The Experience Economy. Wolf, a consultant for Viacom,\n                Newscorp, and other media heavy-weights, argues business is becoming\n                synonymous with entertainment: \"we have come to expect that we will be\n                entertained all the time. Products and brands that deliver on this\n                expectation are succeeding. Products that do not will disappear\". And, in\n                The Experience Economy, Pine notes the increasing need for businesses to\n                provide entertaining experiences. \"Those businesses that relegate\n                themselves to the diminishing world of goods and services will be rendered\n                irrelevant. To avoid this fate, you must learn to stage a rich, compelling\n                experience\". \n              Yet entertainment, whether provided by businesses or the traditional\n                entertainment industry, is increasingly weighted down with the \"baggage\"\n                of advertising. In a large sense, entertainment is a form of new media\n                that carries ads. Increasingly, this seems to be the overriding purpose of\n                entertainment. \n              Once, not long ago, when ads were simple and confined, entertainment was\n                also simple and its purpose was to entertain rather than to sell. There\n                was money enough in packed movie houses or full theme parks to make a\n                healthy profit. But all this has changed with advertising's ubiquity. \n              Like media corporations searching for new revenue streams, the\n                entertainment industry has responded to flat growth by finding new ways to\n                squeeze money out of entertainment content. Films now feature products in\n                paid for scenes and most forms of entertainment use product tie-ins to\n                other areas such as retail stores or fast-food restaurants. Also popular\n                with the entertainment industry is what might be termed the \"versioning\"\n                of entertainment products into various sub-species where entertainment\n                content is transformed into other media so it can be sold more than once.\n                A film may not make a profit on just the theatrical release but there is a\n                good chance it doesn't matter because it stands to make a profit in video\n                rentals. \n              Advertising and Journalism\n              The merger of advertising and entertainment goes a long way towards a\n                world of ubiquitous advertising. Yet the merger of advertising and\n                journalism is the real \"promised land\" in the evolution of ubiquitous\n                advertising. This fundamental shift in the way news media make money\n                provides the final frontier to be conquered by advertising, a final\n              \"promised land\" for advertising. As Mike France observes in Business Week,\n                this merger \"could potentially change the way they cover the news. The\n                more the press gets in the business of hawking products, the harder it\n                will be to criticize those goods -- and the companies making them\". \n              Of course, there is that persistent myth, perpetuated by news\n                organisations that they attempt to preserve editorial independence by\n                keeping the institutions they cover and their advertisers at arm's length.\n                But this is proving more and more difficult, particularly for online\n                media. Observers like France have pointed out a number of reasons for\n                this. One is the growth of ads in news media that look more like editorial\n                content than ads. While long-standing ethical rules bar magazines and\n                newspapers from printing advertisements that look like editorial copy,\n                these rules become fuzzy for many online publications. Another reason\n                making it difficult to separate advertising from journalism is the growing\n                merger and consolidation of media corporations. Fewer and fewer\n                corporations control more and more entertainment, news and ultimately\n                advertising. It becomes difficult for a journalist to criticise a product\n                when it has a connection to the large media conglomerate the journalist\n                works for. \n              Traditionally, it has been rare for media corporations to make direct\n                investments in the corporations they cover. However, as Mike France notes,\n                CNBC crossed this line when it acquired a stake in Archipelago in\n                September 1999. CNBC, which runs a business-news Website, acquired a 12.4%\n                stake in Archipelago Holdings, an electronic communications network for\n                trading stock. Long-term plans are likely to include allowing visitors to\n                cnbc.com to link directly to Archipelago. That means CNBC could be in the\n                awkward position of both providing coverage of online trading and\n                profiting from it. France adds that other business news outlets, such as\n                Dow Jones (DJ), Reuters, and Bloomberg, already have indirect ties to\n                their own electronic stock-trading networks. \n              And, in news organisations, a popular method of cutting down on the\n                expense of paying journalists for content is the growing practice of\n                accepting advertiser written content or \"sponsored edit\" stories. The\n                confusion to readers violates the spirit of a long-standing American\n                Society of Magazine Editors (ASME) rule prohibiting advertisements with\n              \"an editorial appearance\". But as France notes, this practice is thriving\n                online. This change happens in ever so subtle ways. \"A bit of puffery\n                inserted here,\" notes France, \"a negative adjective deleted there -- it\n                doesn't take a lot to turn a review or story about, say, smart phones,\n                into something approaching highbrow ad copy\". He offers an example in\n                forbes.com whose Microsoft ads could easily be mistaken for staff-written\n                articles. \n              Media critic James Fallows points out that consumers have been swift to\n                discipline sites that are caught acting unethically and using \"sponsored\n                edits\". He notes that when it was revealed that amazon.com was taking fees\n                of up to $10,000 for books that it labelled as \"destined for greatness\",\n                its customers were outraged, and the company quickly agreed to disclose\n                future promotional payments. \n              Unfortunately, though, the lesson episodes like these teach online\n                companies like Amazon centres around more effective ways to be less\n              \"revealing\" rather than abstention from the practice of \"sponsored edits\". \n              France reminds us that journalism is built on trust. In the age of the\n                Internet, though, trust is quickly becoming an elusive quality. He writes\n              \"as magazines, newspapers, radio stations, and television networks rush to\n                colonize the Internet, the Great Wall between content and commerce is\n                beginning to erode\". In the end, he ponders whether there is an\n                irrevocable conflict between e-commerce and ethical journalism. When you\n                can't trust journalists to be ethical, just who can you trust? \n              Transaction Fees &amp; Affiliate Programs - Advertising's Final Promised Land?\n              The engine driving the growing ubiquity of advertising, though, is not\n                the increasing merger of advertising with other industries (like\n                entertainment and journalism) but rather a new business model of online\n                commerce and Internet technology called transaction fees. \n              This emerging and potentially dominant Internet e-commerce technology\n                provides for the ability to track transactions electronically on Websites\n                and to garner transaction fees. Through these fees, many media Websites\n                take a percentage of payment through online product sales. In effect, a\n                media site becomes one pervasive direct mail ad for every product\n                mentioned on its site. This of course puts them in a much closer economic\n                partnership with advertisers than is the case with traditional fixed-rate\n                ads where there is little connection between product sales and the\n                advertising media carrying them. \n              Transaction fees are the new online version of direct marketing, the\n                emerging Internet technology for their application is one of the great\n                economic driving forces of the entire Internet commerce apparatus. The\n                promise of transaction fees is that a number of people, besides product\n                manufacturers and advertisers, might gain a percentage of profit from\n                selling products via hypertext links. Once upon a time, the manufacturer\n                of a product was the one that gained (or lost) from marketing it. Now,\n                however, there is the possibility that journalists, news organisations and\n                entertainment companies might also gain from marketing via transaction\n                fees. \n              The spread of transaction fees outside media into the general population\n                provides an even greater boost to the growing ubiquity of advertising.\n                This is done through the handmaiden of media transaction fees: \"affiliate\n                programs\" for the general populace. Through the growing magic of Internet\n                technology, it becomes possible for all of us to earn money through\n                affiliate program links to products and transaction fee percentages in the\n                sale of these products. \n              Given this scenario, it is not surprising that advertisers are most\n                likely to increasingly pressure media Websites to support themselves with\n                e-commerce transaction fees. Charles Li, Senior Analyst for New Media at\n                Forrester Research, estimates that by the year 2003, media sites will\n                receive $25 billion in revenue from transaction fees, compared with $17\n                billion from ads and $5 billion from subscriptions. \n              The possibility is great that all media will become like great direct\n                response advertisements taking a transaction fee percentage for anything\n                sold on their sites. And there is the more dangerous possibility that all\n                of us will become the new \"promised land\" for a ubiquitous advertising.\n                All of us will have some cut in selling somebody else's product. When this\n                happens and there is a direct economic incentive for all of us to say nice\n                things about products, what is the need and importance of subliminal\n                techniques and methods creating advertising based on images which try to\n                trick us into buying things? \n              A Society Without Critics?\n              It is for these reasons that criticism and straight news are becoming an\n                increasingly endangered species. Everyone has to eat but what happens when\n                one can no longer make meal money by criticising current culture? \n              Cultural critics become a dying breed. There is no money in criticism\n                because it is based around disconnection rather than connection to\n                products. No links to products or Websites are involved here. Critics are\n                becoming lonely icebergs floating in the middle of a cyber-sea of\n                transaction fees, watching everyone else (except themselves) make money on\n                transaction fees. The subliminal focus of the current consultancies is\n                little more than a repackaging of an old theme discovered long ago by\n                Vance Packard. But the growing \"everywhereness\" and \"everyoneness\" of\n                modern advertising through transaction fees may mark the beginning of a\n                revolutionary new era. Everyone might become their own \"brand\", a point\n                well made in Tim Peters's article \"A Brand Called You\". \n              Media critic James Fallows is somewhat optimistic that there still may\n                remain \"niche\" markets for truthful information and honest cultural\n                criticism. He suggests that surely people looking for mortgages, voting\n                for a politician, or trying to decide what movie to see will continue to\n                need unbiased information to help them make decisions. But one must ask\n                what happens when a number of people have some \"affiliate\" relationship\n                with suggesting particular movies, politicians or mortgages? \n              Orville Schell, dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the\n                University of California at Berkeley, has summarised this growing ubiquity\n                of advertising in a rather simple and elegant manner saying \"at a certain\n                point, people won't be able to differentiate between what's trustworthy\n                and what isn't\". Over the long run, this loss of credibility could have a\n                corrosive effect on society in general -- especially given the media's\n                importance as a political, cultural, and economic watchdog. Schell warns,\n              \"if people don't trust their information, it's not much better than a\n                Marxist-Leninist society\". \n              Yet, will we be able to realise this simple fact when we all become types\n                of Marxists and Leninists? Still, there is the great challenge to America\n                to learn how to utilise transaction fees in a democratic manner. In\n                effect, a combination of the technological promise of the new economy with\n                that old promise, and perhaps even myth, of a democratic America. America\n                stands on the verge of a great threshold and challenge in the growing\n                ubiquity of advertising. In a way, as with most great opportunities or\n                threats, this challenge centres on a peculiar paradox. On the one hand,\n                there is the promise of the emerging Internet business model and its\n                centre around the technology of transaction fees. At the same time, there\n                is the threat posed by transaction fees to America's democratic society in\n                the early years of the new millennium. \n              Yes, once upon a time, not very long ago, advertisements were easy to\n                recognise and also knew their place in the landscape of popular culture.\n                Their greatest, yet silent, evolution (especially in the age of the\n                Internet) has really been in their spread into all areas of culture rather\n                than in methods of trickery and deceit. Now, it is more difficult to slam\n                that front door in the face of that old door-to-door salesman. Or toss\n                that magazine and its ad aside, or switch off commercials on television.\n                We have become that door-to-door salesman, that magazine ad, that\n                television commercial. The current cultural landscape takes on some of the\n                characteristics of the theme of that old science fiction movie The\n                Invasion of the Body Snatchers. A current advertising campaign from RJ\n                Reynolds has a humorous take on the current zeitgeist fad of alien\n                abduction with copy reading \"if aliens are smart enough to travel through\n                space then why do they keep abducting the dumbest people on earth?\" \n              One might add that when Americans allow advertising to travel through all\n                our space, perhaps we all become the dumbest people on earth, abducted by\n                a new alien culture so far away from a simplistic nostalgia of yesterday.\n              (Please press below for your links to a world of fantastic products which\n                can make a new you.) \n              \n          \n              References\n              \nBrill, Steven.

    "abstract": "\n      Bracketed by a quotation from famed 1950s West German soccer coach S. Herberger and the word \"Ende\", the running length of the 1998 film Run Lola Run, directed by Tom Tykwer, is 9 minutes short of the official duration of a soccer match. Berlin has often been represented, in visual art and in cinematic imagery, as the modern metropolis: the Expressionist and Dadaist painters, Walter Ruttmann, Fritz Lang and Rainer Werner Fassbinder all depicted it as the modernising city. Since the '60s artists have staged artworks and performances in the public space of the city which critiqued the cold war order of that space, its institutions, and the hysterical attempt by the German government to erase a divided past after 1990. Run Lola Run depicts its setting, Berlin, as a cyberspace obstacle course or environment usually associated with interactive video and computer games. The eerie emptiness of the Berlin of Run Lola Run -- a fantasy projected onto a city which has been called the single biggest construction site in Europe -- is necessary to keep the protagonist Lola moving at high speed from the West to the East part of town and back again -- another fantasy which is only possible when the city is recast as a virtual environment. In Run Lola Run Berlin is represented as an idealised space of bodily and psychic mobility where the instantaneous technology of cyberspace is physically realised as a utopia of speed.\n      The setting of Run Lola Run is not a playing field but a playing level, to use the parlance of video game technology. Underscored by other filmic devices and technologies, Run Lola Run emulates the kinetics and structures of a virtual, quasi-interactive environment: the Berlin setting of the film is paradoxically rendered as an indeterminate, but also site specific, entertainment complex which hinges upon the high-speed functioning of multiple networks of auto-mobility. Urban mobility as circuitry is performed by the film's super-athletic Lola.\n      Lola is a cyber character; she recalls the 'cyberbabe' Lara Croft, heroine of the Sega Tomb Raider video game series. In Tomb Raider the Croft figure is controlled and manipulated by the interactive player to go through as many levels of play, or virtual environments, as possible. In order for the cyber figure to get to the next level of play she must successfully negotiate as many trap and puzzle mechanisms as possible. Speed in this interactive virtual game results from the skill of an experienced player who has practiced coordinating keyboard commands with figure movements and who is familiar with the obstacles the various environments can present. As is the case with Lara Croft, the figure of Lola in Run Lola Run reverses the traditional gender relations of the action/adventure game and of 'damsel in distress' narratives. Run Lola Run focusses on Lola's race to save her boyfriend from a certain death by obtaining DM 100,000 and delivering it across town in twenty minutes. The film adds the element of the race to the game, a variable not included in Tomb Raider. Tykwer repeats Lola's trajectory from home to the location of her boyfriend Manni thrice in the film, each time ending her quest with a different outcome. As in a video game, Lola can therefore be killed as the game unwinds during one turn of play, and on the next attempt she, and also we as viewers or would-be interactive players, would have learned from her previous 'mistakes' and adjust her actions accordingly. The soundtrack of Run Lola Run underscores the speed and mobility of Berlin by means of the fast/slow/fast rhythm of the film, which proceeds primarily at the pace of techno music. This quick rhythm is syncopated with pauses in the forward-moving action brought on by Lola's superhuman screams or by the death of a protagonist. These events mark the end of one turn of 'play' and the restart of Lola's route. \n      Tykwer visually contrasts Lola's linear mobility and her physical and mental capacity for speed with her boyfriend Manni's centripetal fixity, a marker of his helplessness, throughout the film. Manni, a bagman-in-training for a local mafioso, has to make his desperate phone calls from a single phone booth in the borough of Charlottenburg after he bungles a hand-off of payment money by forgetting it on the U-Bahn (the subway). In a black and white flashback sequence, viewers learn about Manni's ill-fated trip to the Polish border with a shipment of stolen cars. In contrast to his earlier mobility, Manni becomes entrapped in the phone booth as a result of his ineptitude. A spiral store sign close to the phone booth symbolizes Manni's entrapment. Tykwer contrasts this circular form with the lines and grids Lola transverses throughout the film. Where at first Lola is also immobilised after her moped is stolen by an 'unbelieveably fast' thief, her quasi-cybernetic thought process soon restores her movement. Tykwer visualizes Lola's frantic thinking in a series of photographic portraits which indicates her consideration of who she can contact to supply a large sum of money. Lola not only moves but thinks with the fast, even pace of a computer working through a database. Tykwer then repeats overhead shots of gridded pavement which Lola follows as she runs through the filmic frame. The grid, emblem of modernity and structure of the metropolis, the semiconductor, and the puzzles of a virtual environment, is necessary for mobility and speed, and is performed by the figure of Lola. The grid is also apparent in the trajectories of traffic of speeding bikes, subway trains,and airplanes passing overhead, which all parallel Lola's movements in the film. The city/virtual environment is thus an idealised nexus of local, national and global lines of mobility and communication.:\n      -- OR -- \n      Tykwer emphasised the arbitrariness of the setting of Run Lola Run, insisting it could easily have been set in any other urban centre such as New York City or Beijing. At no point does the film make explicit that the space of action is Berlin; in fact the setting of the film is far less significant than the filmic self-reflexivity Tykwer explores in Run Lola Run. Berlin becomes a postmodernist filmic text in which earlier films by Lang, Schlöndorff, von Sternberg and Wenders are cited in intertextual fashion. It is not by chance that the protagonist of Run Lola Run shares the name of Marlene Dietrich's legendary character in von Sternberg's The Blue Angel. The running, late-20th-century Lola reconnects with and gains power from the originary Lola Lola as ur-Star of German cinema. The high overhead shots of Run Lola Run technologically exceed those used by Lang in M in 1931 but still quote his filmic text; the spiral form, placed in a shop window in M, becomes a central image of Run Lola Run in marking the immobile spot that Manni occupies. Repeated several times in the film, Lola's scream bends events, characters and chance to her will and slows the relentless pace of the narrative. This vocal punctuation recalls the equally willful vocalisations of Oskar Matzerath in Schlöndorff's Tin Drum (1979). \n      Tykwer's radical expansions and compressions of time in Run Lola Run rely on the temporal exploitation of the filmic medium. The film stretches 20 minutes of 'real time' in the lives of its two protagonists into the 84 minutes of the film. Tykwer also distills the lives of the film's incidental or secondary characters into a few still images and a few seconds of filmic time in the 'und dann...' [and then...] sequences of all three episodes. For example, Lola's momentary encounter with an employee of her father's bank spins off into two completely different life stories for this woman, both of which are told through four or five staged 'snapshots' which are edited together into a rapid sequence. The higher-speed photography of the snapshot keeps up the frenetic pace of Run Lola Run and causes the narrative to move forward even faster, if only for a few seconds.\n      Tykwer also celebrates the technology of 35 mm film in juxtaposing it to the fuzzy imprecision of video in Run Lola Run. The viewer not only notes how scenes shot on video are less visually beautiful than the 35 mm scenes which feature Lola or Manni, but also that they seem to move at a snail's pace. For example, the video-shot scene in Lola's banker-father's office also represents the boredom of his well-paid but stagnant life; another video sequence visually parallels the slow, shuffling movement of the homeless man Norbert as he discovers Manni's forgotten moneybag on the U-Bahn. Comically, he breaks into a run when he realises what he's found. Where Wim Wenders's Wings of Desire made beautiful cinematographic use of Berlin landmarks like the Siegessäule in black and white 35 mm, Tykwer relegates black and white to flashback sequences within the narrative and rejects the relatively meandering contemplation of Wenders's film in favour of the linear dynamism of urban space in Run Lola Run.\n      -- OR -- \n      Tykwer emphasised the arbitrariness of the setting of Run Lola Run, insisting it could easily have been set in any other urban centre such as New York City or Beijing. Nevertheless he establishes the united Berlin as the specific setting of the film. While Run Lola Run does not explicitly indicate that the space of action is Berlin, viewers are clear of the setting: a repeated establishing shot of the Friedrichstrasse U-Bahn stop, a central commuting street near the Brandenburg Gate in the former East Berlin which has undergone extensive reconstruction since 1990, begins each episode of the film. The play between the locality of Berlin and its role as the universal modernist metropolis is a trope of German cinema famously deployed by Fritz Lang in M, where the setting is also never explicitly revealed but implied by means of the use of the Berlin dialect in the dialogue of the film1. The soundtrack of Run Lola Run underscores the speed and mobility of Berlin by means of the fast/slow/fast rhythm of the film which proceeds primarily at the pace of techno music. Techno is also closely identified with the city of Berlin through its annual Techno Festival, which seems to grow larger with each passing year. Quick techno rhythm is syncopated with pauses in the forward-moving action brought on by Lola's superhuman screams or by the death of a protagonist. Berlin is also made explicit as Tykwer often stages scenes at clearly-marked street intersections which identify particular locations or boroughs thoughout east and west Berlin. The viewer notes that Lola escapes her father's bank during one episode and faces Unter den Linden; several scenes unfold on the banks of the river Spree; Lola sprints between the Altes Museum and the Berlin Cathedral. Manni's participation in a car-theft ring points to the Berlin-focussed activity of actual Eastern European and Russian crime syndicates; the film features an interlude at the Polish border where Manni delivers a shipment of stolen Mercedes to underworld buyers, which has to do with the actual geographic proximity of Berlin to Eastern European countries. \n     Tykwer emphasised the arbitrariness of the setting of Run Lola Run, insisting it could easily have been set in any other urban centre such as New York City or Beijing.

Chance must therefore be minimised in the pursuit of urban speed, mobility, and commications access. In the globalised Berlin, Tykwer compresses chance encounters into individual snapshots of visual data which are viewed in quick succession by the viewer. Where artists such Christo and Sophie Calle had investigated the initial chaos of German reunification in Berlin, Run Lola Run rejects the hyper-contemplative and past-obsessed mood demanded by Christo's wrapping of the Reichstag, or Calle's documentation of the artistic destructions of unification3. Run Lola Run recasts Berlin as a network of fast connections, lines of uninterrupted movement, and productive output. It is therefore perhaps not surprising that Tykwer's idealised and embodied representation of Berlin as Lola has been politically appropriated as a convenient icon by the city's status quo: an icon of the successful reconstruction and rewiring of a united Berlin into a fast global broadband digital telecommunications network4.\n          \n      Footnotes \n      \nSee Edward Dimendberg's excellent discussion of filmic representations of the metropolis in \"From Berlin to Bunker Hill: Urban Space, Late Modernity, and Film Noir in Fritz Lang's and Joseph Losey's M.\" Wide Angle 19.4 (1997): 62-93. \n        This is despite the fact that the temporal parameters of the plot of Run Lola Run forbid the aimlessness central to spazieren (strolling).

The mayor of Berlin sported Lola-esque red hair in a poster which imitated the one for the film, but legal intercession put an end to this trendy political statement.

    "abstract": "\n      The computer game is perhaps the fastest growing and most quickly evolving cultural leisure technology in the western world. Invented as a form just under 40 years ago with the creation of Space War at MIT, computer and video games collectively account for hundreds of billions of dollars in sales across the world. And yet critical analysis of this cultural form is still in its infancy. Perhaps the sheer speed of the development of games may account for this. Thirty years ago, strategy games were screens of text instructions and a prompt where you could type a weather forecast. Today pretty much all games are flawlessly shaded and rendered polygons. The technology of film has barely changed at all in the same period. In any case, the critical study of games began in the eighties. The focus initially was on the psychology of the gamer. Most game players were children and teenagers during this period, and the focussing of their leisure time on this new and strange computer technology became a source of extreme moral panic for educators, parents and researchers alike. Later, research into the cultures of gaming would become more nuanced, and begin to detail the semiotics and narrative structures of games. It is in that kind of frame that this article is positioned. I want to look closely at a particular strategy game series, The Settlers. \n      Firstly, however, a description of the strategy game genre. Strategy games put the player into a simulated inhabited environment and give the player almost total control over that environment and its simulated inhabitants. The strategy game has many genres, including the simulation game and the god game, but the sub-genre I will focus on in this paper is the real-time strategy game. The game requires the player to develop a functioning economy, geared around the production of weapons and armies, which are sent out to combat neighbouring tribes or armies. Real-time games typically give greater tactical control of the armies to the player, and slightly less detailed economic control. The aim is basically to amass as much gold or whatever as possible to buy as many troops as possible. However, the game I am about to discuss is, in addition to being a simple game of war, a very interesting simulation of economic and logistical constraints. \n      The Settlers is series of fantasy computer strategy games developed by the German game design firm Blue Byte. The three extant Settlers games can be considered an evolution of game design rather than a continuing narrative, so, given the time constraints, for the purposes of this paper I will address only one game in the series, the most recently released title, The Settlers 3. \n      The Settlers 3 tells the story of three expansionist empires, the Romans, the Egyptians, and the Asians, who have been thrust onto an uninhabited continent by the gods of their peoples to determine who is the fittest to survive. In other words, the game is founded from the beginning on a socio-Darwinian premise. \n      In each level of the game, the settlers of each tribe must, under their player's direction, build an efficient and well maintained colony with a fully operating economy in order to achieve a set objective, which is usually to wipe out the opposing tribes by building up a large army, though it may be also to amass a predetermined level of a particular resource. \n      Each level begins with about twenty settlers, a small guard hut to define the limits of the borders and a barely adequate supply of wooden planks, stone slabs and tools with which to begin to construct the economy. The player chooses building types from a menu and places them on the screen. Immediately the appropriate number of settlers walk across the landscape, leaving visible tracks in their wake, to pick up tools and supplies in order to construct the building. Typically, the player will order the construction of a woodcutter's hut, a sawmill, a stone cutter and a forester to ensure the steady flow of the basic construction materials to the rest of the colony. \n      From this point more guard huts and towers are constructed to expand into new territory, and farms are built to feed the miners. Once constructed, the mine produce coal, gold and ore, which is sent down to the smelters to make iron bars (to make swords and tools) and gold bars (to pay the troops). Luxuries such as beer and wine are produced as a sacrifice to the gods. This results in rewards such as magical spells and promotion of the soldiers. Occasionally, incursions of enemy troops must be dealt with -- if they take a guard tower in battle, the borders, represented by lines of coloured flags, shrink, leading to the collapse and destruction of any building outside the boundaries. Finally, sufficient swords, bows and spears are produced, the soldiers are promoted, and they set off to pillage and destroy their neighbours' territory. If the previously mentioned enemy incursions were frequent enough, the final conflict where the player's warriors brutally annihilate the enemy is tremendously satisfying. The problematics of that particular game construct are left as an exercise for the audience. \n      When territory is taken, the villages of the enemy go up in smoke and their resources are left lying on the ground, for the settlers to pick up and use for the benefit of the player. \n     One of the things that make the game so fascinating to play is the complexity of the simulation. It must be said right away that the game employs many abstractions to make it playable and not utterly boring. For instance, only the miners out of all the settlers actually need food, and the mechanism by which new settlers are actually created is a bit vague (you construct a building called a \"residence\", and when it's completed, new setters simply troop out. And there only seem to be male settlers, unless you play the Amazons). Nonetheless, the game still quite explicitly details things most games of its type gloss right over. Unlike most games, pulling out all the stops in production just leads to bottlenecks where the transportation infrastructure can't get the goods to their destinations. Production levels have to be carefully monitored and throttled back where necessary to ensure the smooth flow of resources from A to B, C and D. Resources themselves -- coal lumps, gold bricks, fish, loaves of bread, swords --are modelled individually: you can actually track the process whereby an individual sheaf of wheat is harvested, picked up by a settler, carried off to the mill, turned into flour, sent to the bakery, made into a loaf of bread, and delivered to the coal miner for consumption. With its attention to the gritty detail of getting stuff from one place to the next, The Settlers is one of the very few truly logistically precise strategy games. \n      \n      Before I begin the analysis proper, I want to introduce some key terms that I'll be using a bit idiosyncratically in this paper. I'll be talking about gameplay quite a bit. Gameplay is a bit of a sliding signifier in the discourse of gaming theory -- loosely speaking it's that indefinable something that gets a player heated up about a game and keeps them playing for days on end. But here I want to be more precise. I'll offer a strategic definition. Gameplay is a way of quantifying the operations of a kind of economy of desire that operates between the player and the game itself. This economy has, as its constitutive elements, such factors as attention span, pleasure, ratio of novelty to repetition. These elements are in constant circulation in a game and the resulting economy is responsible for a good deal of the dynamism of the experience: in other words, the gameplay. \n      What I want to focus on in this paper is what comes from the precise moment where two, quite central impulses of gameplay are in perfect balance, just before the first surrenders its grasp and the second takes over. The first impulse of play consists of two elements -- the visual presentation of the game, i.e. the pretty pictures that draw you in, and the narrative pretext of the story, the thing that gives what you are doing some kind of sense. It is on these two elements that classical ideological analysis of gameplay is typically founded. For instance, the archetypal platform game where all the female characters are helpless maidens who only exist as a way of getting the masculine protagonist into the action. \n      The second impulse of gameplay is what might be called the \"process\", the somewhat under-theorised state where the visual trappings of the game and the motivating story line have slipped into the background, leaving only the sense of seamless integration of the player into the game's cybernetic feedback loop. \n      The visual presentation and narrative pretext of The Settlers draws the player into a familiar fantasy of pre-modern existence. Presented to the player is a beautifully rendered virgin wilderness, filled with rolling hills, magnificent mountain ranges and vast forests, resounding with the sounds of the stream and brook, and the rustling of the wildlife. Into this wilderness the player must project an empire. \n      That empire will consist of an elaborately detailed network (and I use the term deliberately) of cottage industries, labourers, paths, commodities, resources, defensive structures and places of worship. Real-world economic activities are consummately simulated as complex flows of information. The simulation is always fascinating to watch. Each node in this network, be it a fisherman's hut, a bakery, or a smelter, is exquisitely rendered, and full of picturesque, yet highly functional, animation. For instance, the process of a fisherman leaving his hut, going to a stream, setting his line, and catching a fish is visually expressive and lively, but it also is a specific bottleneck in the production process -- it takes a finite time, during which the carrier settlers stand around waiting for produce to deliver. \n      This, then, is the game's crucial dialectic. What is depicted is a visually sumptuous, idyllic existence, but on closer inspection is a model of constant, uninterrupted, backbreaking labour. There are not even demarcations of day and night in the game -- life is perpetually midday and the working day will last forever. To put it less simply, perhaps, the game purposefully reifies the human social condition as being a reflexively structured mechanism of economic production under the guise of an ideologically idyllic pastoral paradise. It positions the player as not merely complicit in this mechanism but the fundamental point of determination within it.\n      The balancing moment then is the point where the player begins to ignore or take for granted the visual lushness of the game's graphics and to focus instead on the underlying system, to internalise the lessons of the game -- the particular ideological and discursive assumptions about how economic and political systems successfully operate -- and to apply these lessons to the correct playing of the game, almost like a transition between REM dream-state sleep and deep sleep. And the analogy to sleep is not entirely specious -- critics and players alike have noted the way time stops when you play a game, with whole nights and days seemingly swallowed up in seconds of game time. \n      The type of focus I am describing is not an interpretative one -- players are not expected to gain new insights of meaning from the act of playing at this new level of intensity, instead they are simply to blend their thoughts, actions and reactions with the dynamic processes of the game system. In a sense, a computer game is less a textual form than it is a kind of tool: in the same way proficient word processor users becomes so fluent in the operations of their software that the trappings -- toolbars, menus, mouse -- become secondary to the smooth continuous process of churning out words. Such a relationship does not exactly inspire thoughtful contemplation about the repressive qualities of Microsoft's hegemonic domination of office software, and the similar relationship with the computer game makes any kind of reflexivity about the gameplay's cultural referents seem simply counterproductive. \n      It's an interesting dilemma for the theorist of gaming -- the point at which the underlying structure comes most clearly into focus during the state of play/analysis is also the moment when one is most resistant to the need to draw the wider connections. \n      In this paper, I've tried to take a suggestive approach, to point out some of the ways that ideological assumptions about culture and production can be actualised in a simulated environment. And hopefully, I've also pointed out some of the pitfalls in a purely ideological analysis of games. Games are never just about the ideology. A nuanced analysis from a cultural studies point of view must also take into account the quite complex ways games not only articulate certain ideologies but they also complicate them. Beyond that, analysis must take into account the ways that games go beyond the paradigm of textuality and begin to take on the aspect of being whole systems of symbolic manipulation and transmission. It is only at this point that any kind of comprehensive and theoretically precise engagement with games as cultural texts and processes can be seriously begun. \n          \n      References  \n      \nCrawford, Chris.

    "abstract": "\n      The Language in the Workplace project, based in the School of Linguistics and Applied Language Studies at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, has for most of its history concentrated on oral interaction in professional and manufacturing organisations. Recently, however, the project team widened its scope to include an introductory investigation of e-mail as a mode of workplace interaction. The ultimate intention is to extend the project's purview to encompass all written modes, thereby allowing a fuller focus on the complex interrelationships between communication media in the workplace.\n      The Problems of Communication\n      In an illuminating recent study, John Durham Peters explores problems that have dogged the notion of 'communication' (the term in this sense originating only in the late nineteenth century) from the time of Plato. The overarching historical problem he discusses is the recurrent desire for complete communication, the illusionary dream of transferring completely and without modification any idea, thought, or intention from one mind to another. There are two further and related problems that are particularly germane to my purposes here.\n      \n      \n A belief, at one extreme, that communication 'technologies' will interfere with the 'natural' processes of oral face-to-face interaction; together with its obverse, that communications plural (new technologies) will solve the problems of communication singular (self-other relations).\n         A notion that dissemination (communication from one to many)1 is an inferior and distorting mode, inherently deterministic, compared with the openness of (preferably one-on-one) dialogue. Perhaps first formulated in Plato's Phaedrus, this lament has reverberated ever since, radio providing the instance par excellence.2\n\n      \nYet another problem are the oppositions creating and sustaining these perceived problems, and their resultant social polarisations. Peters argues eloquently that technologies will never solve the differences in intention and reception amongst socially and therefore differentially positioned interlocutors. (Indeed, he counts it as a benefit that human beings cannot exempt themselves from the recognition and negotiation of individual and collective difference.) And he demonstrates that dialogue and dissemination are equally subject to imperfections and benefits.\n      However, the perceptions remain, and that brings its own problems, given that people continue to act on the basis of unrealistic assumptions about communication. Looked at in this context, electronic mail (which Peters does not include in his historical studies) is a particularly fruitful site of investigation. I will focus on discussing the two problems enumerated above with reference to some of the academic and business literature on e-mail in the workplace; a survey conducted in part of a relatively large organisation in Wellington; and a public e-mail forum of primarily scientists and business people concerning New Zealand's future development.\n      Communicative Distortion\n      The first communication technology to be extensively critiqued for its corruption of social intercourse was writing (by Socrates in Phaedrus). Significantly, e-mail has often been characterised, not unreasonably, as a hybrid of speech and writing, and as returning written communication in the workplace toward the 'immediacy' and 'simplicity' of speech. In fact, as many practitioners do not sufficiently appreciate, informality and intimacy in e-mail communication have to be worked at. Efforts are made by some to use friendly salutations; a chatty, colloquial style; typographical representations of body language; and to refrain from tidying up errors and poor expression (which backfires on them when addressing sticklers for correctness, or when, as often happens, the message is full of obscurities and lacunae). When these attempts are not made, receivers impute to the messages the coldness and impersonality of the most functional letters and notes -- and this is only enhanced by the fact that so much e-mail in the workplace is used for directives (instructions and requests) or announcements (more specifically, proclamations; see below).\n      In contrast to the initial reception of some earlier communication technologies, e-mail was widely welcomed at first. It was predicted to usher in a new egalitarian and democratic order of communication by flattening out or even by-passing hierarchical relations (Sproull and Kiesler; any issue of Wired magazine [see Frau-Meigs]). The realisation that other commercial factors were also contributing to this flattening out no doubt helped to dispel the utopian view (Casey; Gee)3. Subsequent literature has given more emphasis to the sinister aspects of e-mail -- its deployment by managers in the surveillance, monitoring, and performance measurement of employees, its capacity to support convenient and efficient reporting regimes, its durability, and its traceability (Brigham and Corbett; Corbett).\n      This historical trajectory in attitudes towards, and uses of, e-mail, together with the potential variation in the readers' interpretations of the writer's feelings, means that people are quite as likely to conceive of e-mail as cold and impersonal as they are to impute to it more positive feelings. This is borne out in the organisational survey carried out as a part of this research. Of the respondents working in what I will call a professional capacity, 50 percent (the same proportion for both male and female) agreed that e-mail creates a friendlier environment, while only a small percentage of the remainder were neutral. Most disagreed. Interestingly, only a third of clerical staff agreed. One can readily speculate that the differences between these two occupational classes were a significant factor with regard to the uses e-mail is put to (more information sharing as equals on the part of professionals).\n     Those who felt that e-mail contributed to a less friendly environment typically referred to the 'loss of personal contact', and to its ability to allow people to distance themselves from others or 'hide behind' the technology. In a somewhat paradoxical twist of this perceived characteristic, it appears that e-mail can reinforce the prevailing power relations in an organisation by giving employees a way of avoiding the (physical) brunt of these relations, and therefore of tolerating them. Employees have the sense that they can approach a superior through e-mail in a way that is both comfortable for the employee (not have to physically encounter their superior or, as one informant put it, \"not have to cope with the boss's body language\"), and convenient for the superior.4\n      \n      At the same time, interestingly, respondents to our surveys have generally been adamant that e-mail is not the medium for conflict resolution or discussion of significant or sensitive matters pertaining to a manager's relationship with an individual employee. In the large Wellington service organisation surveyed for this study, 70% of the sample said they never or almost never used e-mail for these purposes. It was notable, however, that for professional employees, where a gender distinction used in the survey, 80% of women were of this view, compared with 60% of men. Indeed, nearly 10% of men reported using e-mail frequently for conflict resolution purposes.\n      In sum, there is the potential in e-mail for a fundamental distortion; one that is seemingly the opposite of the anti-technologists' charge of corruption of communication by writing (but arguably with the same result), and one that very subtly contradictory, appearing to support, the utopianism of the digerati. The conventions of e-mail can allow employees to have a sense of participation and equality while denying them any real power or influence over important matters or directions of the organisation.\n      E-mail, in other words, may allow co-workers to communicate across underlying tensions and conflicts by effectively suppressing conflict. This may have advantages for enabling an organisation's work to continue in the face of inevitable personality differences. It may also damage the chances of sustaining effective workplace relationships, especially if individuals generalise their use of e-mail, rather than selecting strategically from all the communicational resources available to them.\n      Dialogue and Dissemination \n      Notwithstanding the point made earlier in relation to radio about the flexibility of technology as a societal accomplishment (see note 2), e-mail, I suggest, is unique in the extent of its inherent ability to alternate freely between both poles of the dialogue -- dissemination dichotomy. It is equally adept at allowing one to broadcast to many as it is at enabling two or more people to conduct a conversation.\n      What complicates this ambidexterity of e-mail is that, as Peters points out, in contradistinction to the contemporary tendency to valorise the reciprocity and interaction of dialogue, \"dialogue can be tyrannical and dissemination can be just\" (34). Consequently, one cannot make easy assumptions about the manner in which e-mail is being used.\n      It is tempting, for example, to conclude from the preponderance of e-mail being used for announcements and simple requests that the supposed benefits of dialogue are not being achieved. This conclusion is demonstrably wrong on two related counts:\n      \n      \n If e-mail is encouraging widespread dissemination of information which could have been held back (and arguably would have been held back in large organisations lacking e-mail's facilitative qualities), then the workforce will be better informed, and hence more able -- and more inclined! -- to engage in dialogue.\n         The uses to which e-mail is put must not be viewed in isolation from the associated use of other media. If communication per se (including dialogue) is increasing, it may be that e-mail (as dissemination) is making that possible.\n      \nIndeed, our research showed a considerable unanimity of perception that communication overall has significantly increased since the introduction of e-mail. This is not to necessarily claim that the quality of communication has increased (there is a degree of e-mail communication that is regarded as unwanted). But the fact that a majority of respondents reported increases in use or stability of use across almost all media, including face-to-face interaction, suggests that a more communicative climate may be emerging.\n      We need then to be more precise about the genre of announcements when discussing their organisational implications. Responses in focus group discussions indicate that the use of e-mail for homilies or 'feel good' messages from the CEO (rather than making the effort to talk face-to-face to employees) is not appreciated. Proclamations, too, are better delivered off-line.\n      Similarly, instructions are better formulated as requests (i.e. with a dialogic tone). As I noted earlier, clerical staff, who are more likely to be on the receiving end of instructions, were less inclined to agree that e-mail creates a friendlier environment.\n      Similarly, instructions are better formulated as requests (i.e. with a dialogic tone). As I noted earlier, clerical staff, who are more likely to be on the receiving end of instructions, were less inclined to agree that e-mail creates a friendlier environment.\n      Even more than face-to-face, group interaction by e-mail allows certain voices to be ignored. Where, as often, there are multiple responses to a particular message, subsequent contributors can use selective responses to strongly influence the direction of the discussion. An analysis of a lengthy portion of the corpus reveals that certain key participants -- often effectively in alliance with like-minded members who endorse their interventions -- will regularly turn the dialogue back to a preferred thread by swift and judicious responses. The conversation can move very quickly away from a new perspective not favoured by regular respondents.\n      It is also possible for a participant sufficiently well regarded by a number of other members to leave the discussion for a time (as much as two or three weeks) and on their return resurrect their favoured perspective by retrieving and responding to a relatively old message. It is clear from this forum that individual reputation and status can carry as much weight on line as it can in face-to-face discussion.\n      Conclusion\n      Peters points out that since the late nineteenth century, of which the invention of the words 'telepathy' and 'solipsism' are emblematic, 'communication' \"has simultaneously called up the dream of instantaneous access and the nightmare of the labyrinth of solitude\" (5).\n      The ambivalence shown towards e-mail by many of its users is clearly the result of the history of responses to communications technology, and of the particular flexibility of e-mail, which makes it an example of this technology par excellence. For the sake of the development of their communicational capabilities, it would be a pity if people continued to jump to the conclusions encouraged by dichotomous conceptions of e-mail (intimate/impersonal, democratic/autocratic, etc.), rather than consciously working to develop a reflexive, open, and case-specific relationship with the technology.\n          \n      Footnotes \n      \nThis does not necessarily exclude oral face-to-face: Peters discusses Jesus's presentation of parables to the crowd as an instance of dissemination.\n        The point is not as transparent as it can now seem. As Peters writes: \"It is a mistake to equate technologies with their societal applications. For example, 'broadcasting' (one-way dispersion of programming to an audience that cannot itself broadcast) is not inherent in the technology of radio; it was a complex social accomplishment ... . The lack of dialogue owes less to broadcasting technologies than to interests that profit from constituting audiences as observers rather than participants\" (34). \n        That is, post-Fordist developments leading to downsizing of middle management, working in teams, valorisation of flexibility ('flexploitation'). \n        There is no doubt an irony here that escapes the individual employee: namely, every other employee is e-mailing the boss 'because it is convenient for the boss', and meanwhile the boss is gritting his or her teeth as an avalanche of e-mail descends. \n      \nReferences  \n\n      \nBrigham, Martin, and J.

    "abstract": "\n      This paper seeks to situate 'chat' in the context of an evolving media-scape. I will argue that for at least a century and half new media have been expanding the spatial scale of communications, and in so doing altering the local contexts in which individuals communicate. This development is closely aligned with the genesis and evolution of an urban form that is itself significantly reliant on these new types of mediated communication. Individuals pursuing their everyday life in this environment must, as a matter of course, negotiate a complex array of media and communications. In doing so, they must also move through a range of media spaces on a continuum from the local to the global. \n      Chat -- defined here as informal face-to-face conversation conducted in the familiarity of a shared context1 -- is a form of communication that seems to have persisted despite the changes noted above. Chat, then, provides a point of comparison from which to assess the effect of mediated communication. It also provides a link to a local communications space. I will argue that this local communications space is where individuals 'make sense' of a communications environment that operates primarily on a scale well beyond the local and well beyond that which most of us can hope to affect. \n      The Rise of the Global, the Decline of the Local \n      Carey (1981) argues that in the United States during the 19th century, as local communications were supplanted by a centralised national communications grid, local cultures and local politics were also supplanted. For Carey, the example of the telegraph is particularly relevant. He notes that the telegraph enabled communication to move faster than transportation for the first time (Communications as Culture 204-5). Giving the example of the trading of commodities, Carey argues that this property made the telegraph a powerful agent of decentralisation. The speed with which the telegraph could deliver business information allowed it to eliminate spatial differences by connecting all places within its network on an equal basis. In his words, \"the telegraph puts everyone in the same place for the purposes of trade; it made geography irrelevant\" (Communications as Culture 217). \n      Yet despite this property of the medium of telegraphy, the establishment of a telegraph system in the United States only served to reinforce the dominance of New York as the central hub in the national network of transport and communications. The predominance of New York was established as early as the 1840s with the development of significant canal and railroad systems and although: \n      this pattern of information movement has been importantly altered since the 1840s, its persistence, at least in outline, is even more striking ... despite the enormous size of the United States, a particular pattern of geographic concentration developed that gave inordinate power to certain urban centres. This development undercut local and regional culture. (Carey, \"Culture, Geography, and Communications\" 82)2\n      Thus the new medium of telegraphy expanded the scale of communication, bringing with it both the capacity to extend the individual beyond his or her own locality and the ability to make a particular locality and the individuals in it irrelevant. Carey concludes that the way electronic communications were initially deployed in the United States intensified the strength of the central communications hub. This increased the spatial extension and power of some at the hub, but with powerful and negative consequences for many local communities. \n      McLuhan similarly emphasised the transformative power particularly of electronic communications, as illustrated in his now famous statement: \n      In a culture like ours, long accustomed to splitting and dividing all things as a means of control, it is sometimes a bit of a shock to be reminded that the medium is the message. This is merely to say that the personal and social consequences of any medium -- that is, of any extension of ourselves -- result from the new scale that is introduced into our affairs by each extension of ourselves, or by any new technology. (McLuhan 15) \n     The Rise of the Urban and a More Mediated Local Context \n     Baldastry's study The Commercialisation of News in the Nineteenth Century shows a similar triumph of a medium able to command an expanded spatial reach over a more localised medium. It also demonstrates the changing role of media in the social relations of an increasingly urbanised population. Baldastry contrasts an earlier and more local partisan press with what was, then, an emergent large scale, fully commercial press (Baldastry 139). While the partisan newspapers of the earlier part of the 19th century needed to raise money to publish, their primary motivation was politics. The partisan press expressed strong views and assumed an already existing stock of knowledge embedded in the small community which formed its readership: \n     The prototypical partisan newspaper of the Jacksonian era had a small circulation (a few hundred), appeared weekly, and circulated within its own region. Its readers were the inhabitants of small villages and towns, and local farmers. Word of mouth supplied the everyday news. (Baldastry 49) \n      Increased urbanisation during the 19th century created a large, more easily accessible and more literate mass market for newspapers and their advertisers. By the 1850s, virtually every family in New York City was buying a newspaper. By 1880, six cities consumed 50% of the country's daily sheets (Baldastry 49). At the same time urban dwellers had a greater need for the news of events in their cities because the greater complexity of social organisation and weakened face-to-face ties meant it could not be provided in the traditional way. It could be said that urbanisation created new roles for the newspaper as the surveyor and synthesiser of large and dispersed urban populations (Baldastry 142). \n      Following Berland, it can also be argued that the mass circulation commercial newspaper was also a constituent element in this urban form.3 The new media space provided by the mass circulation newspaper can be seen as an enabling element in the new form of social and spatial organisation present in the city. From this perspective, the evolution of the mass circulation press was both a response to and an agent in the rapid expansion of large metropolitan centres. \n      Local News Mediating the Global in Local Terms \n      There is little doubt that the complexity, scale and amount of mediation has increased significantly since these times. It is, then, interesting to reflect on the role that chat, particularly face-to-face chat, continues to play in a more intensely mediated society. In a world where so much social interaction occurs through communications media, chat may be a subversive element to a certain extent. Its happenstance form is 'other' to mediated communications. It produces its own communicative space in a random and ad-hoc manner. It lies outside the market and the state. However, mediated communications form an important context for chat. In particular, I believe that the role that chat may play in empowering individuals as they traverse this increasingly complex media scape will be reinforced by the availability of local media, with news media being a critical example of local media. \n      The local news, weather, sport and advertising carried by local newspapers and the local windows of radio and television are all important contexts for chat. One of the reasons for this is that we can assume some level of shared knowledge or interest about these topics. At one level, a globalised media may bring us all together; for example, United States produced film and television programming might provide something to chat about for people of many nations and across most localities within Australia. However, for most of us, the realm of our personal effectivity -- what we can hope to influence and what affects us -- is highly local in character. \n      As the preceding discussion points out, and as supported by analysis of Australian media4, the economics of media mean that continued viability of local news can not be guaranteed. In contemplating the absence of local news media it is instructive to think of the gap this creates between the places where the big decisions are made -- the State, national and global metropoles -- and the reporting of the effects of these decisions in our various locales. While it is easy enough to criticise local media for being parochial (what media isn't?) such a gap is profoundly dis-empowering. Also absent is any active construction of the local; that is, the binding together which comes from near universal access to media with a local context. \n      One example of how local news media can work to both construct a local identity and to act as an intermediary between the local and the global is provided by Richardson in her analysis of Tamworth's local newspaper. She argues that by constructing a local 'world view' the local newspaper exerts a strong influence on how people make sense of global phenomena. While not necessarily cohering with the reality of life in Tamworth, this local 'world view' significantly influences the way local people deal with a world beyond the town which is in many ways threatening. Thus, through the pages of the local news \"the country has actually appropriated even assimilated many of the notions that are most often associated with change [globalisation] in today's society, it also seems that this assimilation is on the country's terms\" (Richardson 4). \n      Unmediated chat may then be viewed as a sort of micro-local communication5. It operates on a much smaller scale than even local news media. However, local media may well be a significant resource used by people chatting about, trying to make sense of and seeking to act in a world in which communications media are becoming increasingly global. Chat is then one aspect of a complex communications environment where individuals routinely navigate through a range of media spaces -- from the most local through to the most global -- in the course of a day. It can also be seen as a potential site for subversion, appropriation and assimilation of communications and media operating on larger scales. The notion of 'transition discourse', introduced by Wills, may be a productive way of beginning to think about this issue. \n      Transition discourses are the processes of temporary cultures that are essential to explain change. Thus, transition discourses are also temporary mannerisms and body techniques of 'habitus'. \"Habitus refers to specialised techniques and ingrained knowledges which enable people to negotiate the different departments of existence\" (Wills 3, qtd. in Craik). \n      Both chat and local media may then serve as transition discourses, helping us to assimilate a constantly changing media-scape. \n          \n      Footnotes \n      \nCommunications media such as the telephone and e-mail support types of chat that do not fit this definition. These contexts are worthy of separate investigation.\n        It is relevant to note that Carey's (1981) work is in turn influenced by the Canadian communications theorist, Harold Innis. Innis was not only a seminal communications theorist in his own right but also a major influence on the more famous Marshall McLuhan. In particular, Carey's argument that technological innovation in the medium of communications is central to social change draws on Innis's binary opposition between space binding and time binding media. Here any given medium is biased in terms of control of time or of space. Importantly for this discussion, time-binding media are associated very closely with oral culture, while space-binding media such as the telegraph are associated with demise of oral culture. For example, stone tablets are difficult to transport but durable and thus time-biased; while paper is easy to transport, but far less durable and thus space-biased. This bias will affect the type of social organisation possible and promote the growth of some types of institutions at the expense of others. Space-binding media facilitate the growth of empire because they \"encourage a concern with expansion and the present ... the growth of the state, the military, and decentralised and expansionist institutions\" (Carey, \"Harold Innis and Marshall McLuhan\" 275). On the other hand, time-binding media are said to encourage a concern with cultural maintenance, the past, religion, hierarchical organisation and contractionist institutions (Carey, \"Harold Innis and Marshall McLuhan\" 275). \n        Berland's argument is based on the example of the spatial impact of television on the suburban form of cities in the post World War Two era. \n        See O'Regan and Frankland for discussions of the impact of changes within broadcast television on locality specific content in regional Australia and in the capital cities. \n        It is, in part, dependent upon the way we move through the physical space of our towns and suburbs. \n      \nReferences  \n      \n Baldastry, Gerald.

    "abstract": "\n      Introduction\n        Television has become more and more restricted within the past few years.\n          Rating systems and \"family programming\" have taken over the broadcast\n          networks, relegating violent programming, often some of the most cutting\n          edge work in television, to pay channels. There are very few people\n          willing to stand up and say that viewers -- even young children -- should\n          be able to watch whatever they want, and that viewing acts of violence can\n          actually result in more mature, balanced adults. \n        Jib Fowles is one of those people. His book, The Case For Television\n          Violence, explores the long history of violent content in popular culture,\n          and how its modern incarnation, television, fulfils the same function as\n          epic tragedy and \"penny dreadfuls\" did -- the diverting of aggressive\n          feelings into the cathartic action of watching. Fowles points out the\n          flaws in studies linking TV violence to actual violence (why, for example,\n          has there been a sharp decline in violent crime in the U.S. during the\n          1990s when, by all accounts, television violence has increased?), as well\n          as citing overlooked studies that show no correlation between viewing and\n          performing acts of violence. The book also demonstrates how efforts to\n          censor TV violence are not only ineffective, but can lead to the opposite\n          result: an increase in exposure to violent viewing as audiences forsake\n          traditional broadcast programming for private programming through pay TV\n          and videocassettes.\n        The revised excerpt below describes one of the more heated topics of\n          debate -- the V-Chip. \n        Television Violence and You\n        Although the antiviolence fervor crested in the US in the first half of\n          the 1990s, it also continued into the second half. As Sissela Bok\n          comments: \"during the 1990s, much larger efforts by citizen advocacy\n          groups, churches, professional organizations, public officials, and media\n          groups have been launched to address the problems posed by media violence\"\n          (146). \n        It continues as always. On the one side, the reformist position finds\n          articulation time and again; on the other side, the public's incessant\n          desire for violent entertainment is reluctantly (because there is no\n          prestige or cachet to be had in it) serviced by television companies as\n          they compete against each other for profits. \n        We can contrast these two forces in the following way: the first, the\n          antitelevision violence campaign, is highly focussed in its presentation,\n          calling for the curtailment of violent content, but this concerted effort\n          has underpinnings that are vague and various; the second force is highly\n          diffused on the surface (the public nowhere speaks pointedly in favor of\n          violent content), but its underpinnings are highly concentrated and\n          functional, pertinent to the management of disapproved emotions. \n        To date, neither force has triumphed decisively. The antiviolence\n          advocates can be gratified by the righteousness of their cause and sense\n          of moral superiority, but violent content continues as a mainstay of the\n          medium's offerings and in viewers' attention. Over the longer term,\n          equilibrium has been the result. \n        If the equilibrium were upset, however, unplanned consequences would\n          result. The attack on television violence is not simply unwarranted; it\n          carries the threat of unfortunate dangers should it succeed. In the US,\n          television violence is a successful site for the siphoning off of unwanted\n          emotions. The French critic Michel Mourlet explains: \"violence is a major\n          theme in aesthetics. Violence is decompression: Arising out of a tension\n          between the individual and the world, it explodes as the tension reaches\n          its pitch, like an abscess burning. It has to be gone through before there\n          can be any repose\" (233). \n        The loss or even diminishment of television violence would suggest that\n          surplus psychic energy would have to find other outlets. What these\n          outlets would be is open to question, but the possibility exists that some\n          of them might be retrogressive, involving violence in more outright and\n          vicious forms. It is in the nation's best interest not to curtail the\n          symbolic displays that come in the form of television violence. \n        Policy\n        The official curbing of television violence is not an idle or empty\n          threat. It has happened recently in Canada. In 1993, the Canadian Radio-\n          Television and Telecommunications Commission, the equivalent of the\n          Australian Broadcasting Authority or of the American FCC, banned any\n        \"gratuitous\" violence, which was defined as violence not playing \"an\n          integral role in developing the plot, character, or theme of the material\n          as a whole\" (Scully 12). Violence of any sort cannot be broadcast before 9\n          p.m. Totally forbidden are any programs promoting violence against women,\n          minorities, or animals. Detailed codes regulate violence in children's\n          shows. In addition, the Canadian invention of the V-chip is to be\n          implemented, which would permit parents to block out programming that\n          exceeds preset levels for violence, sexuality, or strong language\n          (DePalma). \n        In the United States, the two houses of Congress have held 28 hearings\n          since 1954 on the topic of television violence (Cooper), but none has led\n          to the passage of regulatory legislation until the Telecommunications Act\n          of 1996. According to the Act, \"studies have shown that children exposed\n          to violent video programming at a young age have a higher tendency for\n          violent and aggressive behavior later in life than children not so\n          exposed, and that children exposed to violent video programming are prone\n          to assume that acts of violence are acceptable behavior\" (Section 551). \n        It then requires that newly manufactured television sets must \"be\n          equipped with a feature designed to enable viewers to block display of all\n          programs with a common rating\" (Telecommunications Act of 1996, section\n          551). The V-chip, the only available \"feature\" to meet the requirements,\n          will therefore be imported from Canada to the United States. Utilising a\n          rating system reluctantly and haltingly developed by the television\n          industry, parents on behalf of their children would be able to black out\n          offensive content. Censorship had passed down to the family level. \n        Although the V-chip represents the first legislated regulation of\n          television violence in the US, that country experienced an earlier episode\n          of violence censorship whose outcome may be telling for the fate of the\n          chip. This occurred in the aftermath of the 1972 Report to the Surgeon\n          General on Television and Social Behavior, which, in highly equivocal\n          language, appeared to give some credence to the notion that violent\n          content can activate violent behavior in some younger viewers. Pressure\n          from influential congressmen and from the FCC and its chairman, Richard\n          Wiley, led the broadcasting industry in 1975 to institute what came to be\n          known as the Family Viewing Hour. \n        Formulated as an amendment to the Television Code of the National\n          Association of Broadcasters, the stipulation decreed that before 9:00 p.m.\n        \"entertainment programming inappropriate for viewing by a general family\n          audience should not be broadcast\" (Cowan 113). The definition of\n        \"inappropriate programming\" was left to the individual networks, but as\n          the 1975-1976 television season drew near, it became clear to a production\n          company in Los Angeles that the definitions would be strict. The producers\n          of M*A*S*H (which aired at 8:30 p.m.) learned from the CBS censor assigned\n          to them that three of their proposed programs -- dealing with venereal\n          disease, impotence, and adultery -- would not be allowed (Cowan 125). The\n          series Rhoda could not discuss birth control (131) and the series Phyllis\n          would have to cancel a show on virginity (136). Television writers and\n          producers began to rebel, and in late 1975 their Writers Guild brought a\n          lawsuit against the FCC and the networks with regard to the creative\n          impositions of the Family Viewing Hour. Actor Carroll O'Connor (as quoted\n          in Cowan 179) complained, \"Congress has no right whatsoever to interfere\n          in the content of the medium\", and writer Larry Gelbert voiced dismay (as\n          quoted in Cowan 177): \"situation comedies have become the theater of\n          ideas, and those ideas have been very, very restricted\". The judge who\n          heard the case in April and May of 1976 took until November to issue his\n          decision, but when it emerged it was polished and clear: the Family\n          Viewing Hour was the result of \"backroom bludgeoning\" by the FCC and was\n          to be rescinded. According to the judge, \"the existence of threats, and\n          the attempted securing of commitments coupled with the promise to\n          publicize noncompliance ... constituted per se violations of the First\n          Amendment\" (Corn-Revere 201). The fate of the Family Viewing Hour may have\n          been a sort of premoniton: The American Civil Liberties Union is currently\n          bringing a similar case against proponents of the V-chip -- a case that\n          may produce similar results. \n        Whether or not the V-chip will withstand judicial scrutiny, there are\n          several problematic aspects to the device and any possible successors. Its\n          usage would appear to impinge on the providers of violent content, on the\n          viewers of it, and indeed on the fundamental legal structure of the United\n          States. \n        To confront the first of these three problems, significant use of the V-\n          chip by parents would measurably reduce the audience size for certain\n          programmes containing symbolic violence. Little else could have greater\n          impact on the American television system as it is currently constituted. A\n          decrease in audience numbers quickly translates into a decrease in\n          advertising revenues in an advertising system such as that of the United\n          States. Advertisers may additionally shy away from a shunned programme\n          because of its loss of popularity or because its lowered ratings have\n          clearly stamped it as violent. The decline in revenues would make the\n          programme less valuable in the eyes of network executives and perhaps a\n          candidate for cancellation. The Hollywood production company would quickly\n          take notice and begin tailoring its broadcast content to the new\n          standards. Blander or at least different fare would be certain to result.\n          Broadcast networks may begin losing viewers to bolder content on less\n          fastidious cable networks and in particular to the channels that are not\n          supported and influenced by advertising. Thus, we might anticipate a shift\n          away from the more traditional and responsible channels towards the less\n          so and away from advertising-supported channels to subscriber-supported\n          channels. This shift would not transpire according to the traditional\n          governing mechanism of television -- audience preferences. Those to whom\n          the censored content had been destined would have played no role in its\n          neglect. Neglect would have transpired because of the artificial\n          intercession of controls. \n        The second area to be affected by the V-chip, should its implementation\n          prove successful, is viewership, in particular younger viewers. Currently,\n          young viewers have great license in most households to select the content\n          they want to watch; this license would be greatly reduced by the V-chip,\n          which can block out entire genres. Screening for certain levels of\n          violence, the parent would eliminate most cartoons and all action-\n          adventure shows, whether the child desires some of these or not. A New\n          York Times reporter, interviewing a Canadian mother who had been an early\n          tester of a V-chip prototype, heard the mother's 12-year-old son\n          protesting in the background, \"we're not getting the V-chip back!\" The\n          mother explained to the reporter, \"the kids didn't like the fact that they\n          were not in control any longer\" (as quoted in DePalma C14) -- with good\n          reason. Children are losing the right to pick the content of which they\n          are in psychological need. The V-chip represents another weapon in the\n          generational war -- a device that allows parents to eradicate the\n          compensational content of which children have learned to make enjoyable\n          use. The consequences of all this for the child and the family would be\n          unpleasant. The chances that the V-chip will increase intergenerational\n          friction are high. Not only will normal levels of tension and animosity be\n          denied their outlet via television fiction but also so will the new\n          superheated levels. It is not a pleasant prospect. \n        Third, the V-chip constitutes a strong challenge to traditional American\n          First Amendment rights of free speech and a free press. Stoutly defended\n          by post-World War II Supreme Courts, First Amendment rights can be voided\n        \"only in order to promote a compelling state interest, and then only if\n          the government adopts the least restrictive means to further that\n          interest\" (Ballard 211). The few restrictions allowed concern such matters\n          as obscenity, libel, national security, and the sometimes conflicting\n          right to a fair trial. According to legal scholar Ian Ballard, there is no\n        \"compelling state interest\" involved in the matter of television violence\n          because \"the social science evidence used to justify the regulation of\n          televised violence is subject to such strong methodological criticism that\n          the evidence is insufficient to support massive regulatory assault on the\n          television entertainment industry\" (185). Even if the goal of restricting\n          television violence were acceptable, the V-chip is hardly \"the least\n          restrictive means\" because it introduces a \"chilling effect\" on programme\n          producers and broadcasters that \"clearly infringes on fundamental First\n          Amendment rights\" (216). Moreover, states Ballard, \"fear of a slippery\n          slope is not unfounded\" (216). If television violence can be censored,\n          supposedly because it poses a threat to social order, then what topics\n          might be next? It would not be long before challenging themes such a\n          feminism or multiculturalism were deemed unfit for the same reason. \n        Taking all these matters into consideration, the best federal policy\n          regarding television violence would be to have no policy -- to leave the\n          extent of violent depictions completely up to the dictates of viewer\n          preferences, as expertly interpreted by the television industry. In this,\n          I am in agreement with Ian Ballard, who finds that the best approach \"is\n          for the government to do nothing at all about television violence\" (218). \n        \n          \n        Citation reference for this article\n          MLA style:\n\n            Jib Fowles. \"Television Violence and You.\" M/C: A Journal of Media and\n            Culture 3.1 (2000).

    "title": "Three Cultures from the \"Inside\"",
    "abstract": "\n      Prologue \n      It's not what I am but what I do. Or is it? The relationship between doing and being is the theme of these three explorations of cultural \"identity\". The first is a search for the ways in which the Jewish preoccupation with eating, talking, and talking-about-eating, works to create, embody, enact, and/or produce Jewishness. Felicity provides an example of the formation of identities through one specific practice: \"eating\". Tracey questions the use of identity in a particular site: law. She replaces the notion of identity with something ostensibly different which is based on a collection of practices. The concept of a collection of practices is picked up by Reece as a way of doing something other than (the usual understanding of) \"identity politics\" with sexual subjectivities. \n      If a conclusion can be taken away from these three related pieces, it would be that one can't help but fall into cultural or collective subject positions, regardless of the problematic of essentialised identities, but that these are derived from common (ordinary, everyday) cultural practices. It is the doing that gives rise to the being. These remain crucial sites of investigation. \n      The Jew: Felicity \n      It's nauseating really, the clamour to claim an identity: ethnicity is particularly fashionable. But then I can say that, because I'm ethnic, even if \"impossibly\" (as Jon Stratton puts it). Suddenly everyone is searching the attic; ethnicities which were once millstones have now become markers. I'm not so sure how much otherness I can claim, though. After all, where I grew up, in Bondi, being Jewish was de rigeur and consequently mundane. Removing myself made me different. It was only after leaving Bondi that I experienced anti-semitism. Living without Jews I have become very Jewish, if fraudulently. Certainly, I'm seen to be ethnic, and academia embraces means 'authentic'. But I have known \"real\" Jews, so I know myself to be \"not them\", and this still doesn't displace my suspicion of the concept of authenticity because, after all, I don't say \"there is an authentic\", I say \"I'm not it\". I eat ham on Saturday. My parents were not Holocaust survivors. I'm not married, let alone to a Jew. Even so, I have a mezzuzah on my door. It lives comfortably with my pantheism. My child is Jewish. I cook matzo balls that are fluffy everytime. \n      Of course, we could say, it's \"globalisation\" and that \"postmodern\" blurring of boundaries that's behind it all. As we intermarry, eat each other's food and become more alike, we desperately search for ways of inscribing difference. Jewish food may not be as sexy as Thai, but it too has been appropriated. Just think of the bagel. \n      Jewish food, the ways of eating it and the talk which goes on about it, and while eating it, are what have made me feel Jewish. I use Jewish food and foodways to introduce my child to the notion of being Jewish in an even more secular world than the one I inhabited as a child. I once asked my mother why she cut the claws off chicken wings before cooking them.\n       -- Because we're Jewish, that's what we do. \n      I have never forgotten; I always cut the claws off, even if I'm only making stock. I never even asked why again, and I don't think she could have told me anyway. \n      Jewish foodways serve to make Jews conscious of their difference when performing the most mundane of everyday acts. We're talking about creating certain kinds of (perhaps \"docile\") bodies here, bodies whose every act reinscribes their cultural identity. Eating ham makes me feel Jewish because I shouldn't do it. When I do, I am not just anybody eating a ham sandwich; I am Jew eating ham -- it is an abomination and I know this even if I don't believe it. \n      So what does it mean to be Jewish and how does it show? Are there any necessary and sufficient parameters of Jewishness (and I mean this in a cultural rather than a strictly religious sense)? Because there's \"being Jewish\" and there's \"being recognised as being Jewish\". I recently ran into a woman, an academic I'd met several times before, only this time I was wearing my Magen David. \n      -- Oh! she said, you are Jewish, I thought so... . I am too, but it's not the sort of thing you ask somebody. \n        We both laughed, then I said: \n        -- Yes, but our mothers would! \n      \n      Jews recognise each other as such, when gentiles might not, and this is probably true of many groups linked by cultural practices. How does this happen, how do you learn to become Jewish? \n      My answer is that it's all about food, and the ultimate expression of the importance of food to Jews is the Seder, an occasion when story and food combine in such a way that the meal tells a story, the story of Exodus. And just to give it a little extra cachet, that meal has also become a defining moment for Christianity. I employ the Seder as my vehicle for the exploration of Jewishness; as a metaphor for Jewish foodways. Passover is a lot like Christmas, because even the most secular of Jews will pay lip-service, even if it's just the purchase of a box of matzo. My mission appears to find out how it is that this preoccupation with eating, talking and talking-about-eating works to create Jewishness. \n      The Lawyer: Tracey \n      My colleagues speak here of \"identities\". Such a sexy tag. But describing myself as \"a lawyer\" doesn't exactly feel too sexy. It feels a little fraudulent as well, since I do law but I don't practice law in the conventional sense. I don't own a briefcase; playing dress-ups is donning my Spice Girls boots. If I were to wear a wig, it wouldn't be grey. And the closest I get to St Georges Terrace (aka \"Law Suit Drive\") is the Perth Myers store. So what is the marker of authenticity for these other identity groups, vis-à-vis my own? How is that I \"do\" law (probably as well as Reece does lesbian and Felicity does Jewish) and yet I'm not counted as lawyer? \n      The difference might be the degree to which \"identity\" touches upon one's soul, one's sense of being. And while \"doing law\" might connect me to a fraternity of other people who do law in a variety of ways, it's not what I am when I wake up on a non-work morning. It's what I do, but it isn't what I am. Law may have a culture, but it isn't a culture. \n      This isn't to say that studying law and taking on the professional mantle of law doesn't affect me outside of work. Clearly, to engage with any discipline, even on a purely \"academic\" level, I must establish that I can engage with it discursively. I'd have to consult with my learned friends on this one, but I submit that the flow between this particular work life and home life is not transparent to those who knew me BL (before law) and AL (after law). But it only touches my identity on the fringes. It's not centrally a part of my being. There might be radars that are alerted from Jew to Jew, or from lesbian to lesbian without a word being spoken. But take a lawyer out of the space of work and I doubt that you'd recognise her as one. No law-person-to-law-person \"wink\" or tilt of the head; no \"I know what you do, so do I\" sort of look. \n      And yet clearly there are ways in which those doing law, whether through practising, studying or teaching, do form alliances and adopt markers of community, apart from the driving of quite posh cars (perhaps there's even a signature car for successful law people, a community of which I'm patently not a part). There are cultural associations. However, these aren't necessarily attached simply to law as a broad category. Instead, I think the attachments exist in the ways in which one engages with the law; they're loose groupings formed on the basis of what it is one wishes to achieve with and through that institution. \n      This might be what permits a parallel between my \"community\" -- or whatever it is one wishes to call their social organisation -- and the communities (aka \"identities\") of my co-writers. That is, while my identity might not be constructed with a view to law-ing, I will at times come into play with others who read law, becoming part of a community of people who read law in a particular (for example, legalistic) fashion. At other times, I might do law in other ways with other people; for example with feminist lawyers, thereby becoming part of a different community. It's about the practices upon which we hang these relationships. It's what is done and for what purpose. Isn't this what one does when coming together with others under a single \"identity\", or when they form alliances within that identity grouping? \n      In short, I might not have a sexy identity but, no doubt, I have something that looks like identity in the formation of communities of practices. I might not walk proud, but at different times, for different reasons, I belong -- and at other times, I don't. \n      The Dyke: Reece \n      Who are we and how does that relate to politics? Having spent a futile decade or more trying to get the answer right, many of us gave up and argued that the question was wrong. Insisting that it's 'our' party (organisation, collective, music festival, nightclub, Mardi Gras, Pride parade...) didn't help because the next round of questions always returned -- or at least threatened to -- to questions like: \"Who do we mean when we say 'ours'?\" \"Who don't we mean?\" \"Who makes the guest list, and who gets to spend the evening in the 'bin' (repository of undesirables)?\" Besides, \"Who decides anyway?\" \n      Not having recourse to a \"proper\" answer -- the sort of answer one could give a quick press and pop on for any occasion -- one strategy has been to depend on a sort of tactical vagueness when drawing up the guest list. \"Not straight\" will do. But, given that straight is taken as \"heteronormative\" (the \"two point two kids, one spouse, good suburb, lights on, no fantasy, pervert free\" model in which sex/gender/sexuality are not only true, but line up, utterly), such a move makes for a potentially exhaustive list. So \"queer\" becomes the statistical norm. And who, except the Rev Fred and the WA Liberal government front bench, would elect to be seen dead in a yesterday category like \"heteronormative\"? \n      A related, and much stronger version of this, is to argue that identity, as in identity politics, is neither possible nor desirable. The problem, it seems, is not the content of GLBTQ or whatever identity categories, but our understanding of identity per se. In some wild and woeful accounts, however, a lack of absolute identity slides into an absolute lack of identity (no essential identity, therefore, essentially, no identity), making any claim to an \"us\" necessarily futile. Post \"identity politics\" becomes \"post-identity\" politics. And even if identity were possible, the story goes, it is a regulatory regime. As such, it creates a \"bin\", an anathema to an anti-oppressive politic. If sexuality is fluid, mobile, partial, not reducible to the homo/heterodivide etc., then the most useful project would be to destabilise the regulatory regimes by which the logic of identity (and the bin) is held in place. \n      These moves, simultaneously, mobilise an all-inclusive category (queer), retain specificities (G,L,B,T,Q) and undo the whole edifice (queer as critique of all \"identity\"). Another move is, of course, to avoid the mistake of slipping between \"no absolute truth\" and \"absolutely no truth\" and, instead, to ask how we go about making up what we do, including who we are, (à la Sedgwick, Halberstram, etc.), what purpose it serves, and for whom. My question then is how \"same-sex\" has been used, by what \"communities of sign users\", in the formation of which subject positions, and with what effects. Sometimes the \"community of sign users\" is the same as \"queer community\" (\"queer community\" may be an oxymoron in some quarters, but there are no signs of its immanent withdrawal from \"community\" circulation, regardless of contamination or logical impossibility). In other instances, the \"community of sign users\" is not so readily identified in terms of our existing identity markers (maybe we need Eve's nonce taxonomies?), like \"pro- and anti-gay law reformists\" for instance. And sometimes the subjectivities in question are marked \"queerly\" (G,L,B,T,Q, for example(s)). Others are not necessarily marked as \"sexual\" at all, yet are brought into being by and for their relation to queer (in the extended sense). The \"Average West Australian\", for instance, bears a very specific relation to \"same-sex\" when used by Peter Foss (W.A. Attorney-General) to argue for continuing legalised discrimination on the grounds of sexuality. Critiques of \"identity politics\" rightly focus on the nonsense that what we do, unproblematically, is who or what we are. Nevertheless, some sense of 'who or what', some sense of identity, remains crucial to the ways in which we (and they) negotiate the world, even if that identity, like the \"Average West Australian\", is not necessarily understood as such. \n          \n      Citation reference for this article  \n      MLA style:\n      \n Felicity Newman, Tracey Summerfield &amp; Reece Plunkett. \"Three Cultures from the \"Inside\": or, A Jew, a Lawyer and a Dyke Go into This Bar...\" M/C: A Journal of Media and Culture 3.2 (2000).

    "abstract": "\n \n      \n         The object of mapping is to produce a \"correct\" relational model of the terrain. Its assumptions are that the objects in the world to be mapped are real and objective, and that they enjoy an existence independent of the cartographer; that their reality can be expressed in mathematical terms; that systematic observation and measurement offer the only route to cartographic truth; and that this truth can be independently verified. -- J. B. Harley, \"Deconstructing the Map\"\n      \n      \n      Cartography, in its pragmatic operation under these assumptions, avoids almost all of the problems of representation with which cultural studies is only too familiar. Maps are representations, and all representations, even \"scientific\" ones, are cultural signs rather than truths produced in an ideological vacuum. The notion that mathematics, as a tool of Renaissance rationality, allowed real, objective detachment from an object of study was slowly absorbed into the cartographic tradition of Europe about four hundred years ago. \"From at least the seventeenth century onward there was an epistemic break in activities such as cartography and architecture, and European map makers increasingly promoted what we would describe today as a standard scientific model of knowledge and cognition\" (Harley 234). This model, in its increasing reliance upon mathematics and mathematical probability, essentially avoids or denies the objection that scientific observation and interpretation, and especially the technological gaze of its lens, produce anything other than objective, \"real\" knowledge. Through a mathematical detachment from the world, aided by the gaze of the lens, we see not the world itself (which includes us in its unmappable flux) but the numbers, straight lines and generalisations (which do not) that modern maps, including photographs, must employ to give the world fixed form and meaning. \n      We find this model of cartography most impressively represented today in NASA's Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) probe, not merely as a sign of the technical success of mathematics, but also of its conceptual failure to provide the \"true\" representations of terrain to which a truly scientific cartography must aspire. MGS's 1998 attempt to \"solve\" the controversy surrounding a particularly contentious area on Mars, called Cydonia, with newer, \"truer\" images of the infamous Face on Mars was, contrary to popular opinion, an unsuccessful one; unsuccessful because NASA failed to remove all reasonable doubt that the Face was a natural geological formation. Not that this was particularly evident from media coverage of the image's release and reception -- the maverick researchers who comprised the protest were given a less than admirable hearing at the trial. Australian headlines reported that the Mars \"romantics\" (The Australian) had their Face theory \"scuttled\" (Courier-Mail). Professor Stanley V. McDaniel was demoted to \"Mr McDaniel\" in the The Australian, someone who wants NASA to continue re-imaging Cydonia to document other nearby features because \"he believes [they] are further evidence of a Martian civilisation\" (6). Also misrepresented was the like-minded, if slightly more adventurous researcher, Richard Hoagland, author of the underground classic, The Monuments of Mars: A City on the Edge of Forever (1987). Hoagland carelessly became (in both newspapers) Richard \"Hoaglund\", \"leader of the movement\" that believes the face is a monument left in Mars's Cydonia region by an ancient civilisation. The Australian, in line with the rest of the Earth's media, was apparently closing the door on the annoyingly persistent research into the Artificial Origin at Cydonia (AOC) hypothesis, which actually \"does not claim that there is proof of artificial features on Mars, but that the probability of there being artificial features is strong enough to make new high-resolution photographs a top priority for any future mission to that planet\" (McDaniel 2). Rather than confront the hypothesis itself, The Australian merely reminded us that \"despite the image being 10 times better than the Viking photograph [a simplified qualification of the imaging process], it seems that some people still want to dream about ancient Martians building huge monuments to themselves\" (The Australian). Dr. Mark J. Carlotto, a widely published specialist in the areas of digital image processing, pattern recognition, and computer vision, apparently still wants to dream that dream. An advocate of the AOC hypothesis, he notes that \n      close examination of the image reveals the formation to be rough and highly eroded. Many have therefore concluded that the Face is natural. But others contend that if the Face is artificial it must certainly be very old and highly eroded. Thus the question remains as to how to distinguish an eroded artificial feature from a natural one. (Carlotto) \n      This interestingly portentous question is one which NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and their contracted image processors, the privately owned Malin Space Science Systems (MSSS) have been somewhat reluctant to confront since the image of the Face was first captured in Viking frame 35A72. NASA's inaugural public statement on the Cydonia issue, for example, was handled ... \"clumsily\". As McDaniel reports: \n      Upon the discovery of the Face in July, 1976, a Viking Project Scientist held up Viking frame 35A72, containing the Face, and announced to the assembled press corps that in a picture taken a few hours later \"it all went away; it was just the way the light fell on it\" -- but with a significant omission: the alleged later photograph, in which the facial features were supposed to have disappeared, was not shown for comparison [because] the statement could not possibly have been true. Frame 35A72 was taken in the early evening at approximately 6pm local time (sun angle 10 degrees). The object was in darkness a few hours later; the spacecraft, with an orbital period of about 24 hours, was no longer in a position to re-photograph the site; nor would it return to the site for many more orbits to come. Thus NASA's first official response to this strange object was an inexplicable misstatement based upon an apparent impossibility. (McDaniel 11-2) \n      Things did not improve from there. NASA was never able to produce the elusive second photograph, yet continued to maintain that it both existed and conclusively disproved that the landform in question could possibly be artificial. In May 1993 the paradox attracted the attention of Senator John Glenn, who received (along with at least ten other members of the House and the Senate) a copy of the NASA document \"Information on NASA's Re-Photographing of the Cydonia Region of Mars\", which still held that the Face disappeared in the different lighting angles of a separate frame, which it did not reference. Finally in June 1993, after another inquiry by Senator Dianne Feinstein, a revised draft was issued which omits reference to the mysterious \"real\" photograph of the Face (McDaniel 12-3). NASA's next attempt to re-image Mars, including Cydonia, was the Observer probe, which failed to observe much at all and was declared lost in space. In conjunction with the recent mysterious failure of the Russian Phobos probe, and NASA's constant public relations blunders, conspiracy theories abounded. Was there something lurking at the threshold? The answer came in 1998 through the MGS, from which MSSS had produced a newer, clearer, \"truer\" image of the contentious feature which seemed to confirm Dr. Michael Malin's own earlier (and strangely self-contradictory) evaluation of 35A72: \"it's simply a funny looking hill -- there is nothing unusual about it\" (McDaniel 55). The MGS image certainly appeared, at least to the \"naked eye\" perusing the newspaper, to be just that. The wilderness had been tamed, and the coals cooled, temporarily. We had melted the witch. \n      But exorcisms are never \"final\". Although NASA had apparently relegated the monstrous Face back to the realm of nature, restoring it within the parameters of conventional geology, McDaniel, Carlotto and others have maintained that NASA's conclusions were drastically premature, noting, as mentioned previously, that if the Face is artificial it must certainly be very old and, considering the Martian environment, highly eroded (Carlotto). According to their independent research, detailed analysis of the MGS image (which NASA appears not to have commissioned), does not invalidate the hypothesis that the Face may be artificial. Rather, it confirms many of the facial features recorded by the Viking, provides further evidence for the formation's high degree of lateral symmetry, and illuminates more anomalous internal detail (Carlotto). The Face on Mars, like the classical monsters of history, will not die easily. \n      Ironically, perusal of Carlotto's dense research is an entry into the latent but undeniable plasticity of numbers, which itself is the quality of the monster that haunts modern cartographic representation. Mathematics, in almost every field of application, is finding it increasingly difficult to keep its disordering unknowns at bay. Geographer Erol Torun, for example, examined the angles formed by the facets of the two-mile long \"D &amp; M pyramid\" (named after its discoverers, Vincent DiPietro and Gregory Molenaar). As Brian O'Leary writes, he subsequently found that the ratios between the five principal angles at the pyramid apex \"express the universal mathematical constants of the square roots of 2,3,5,6, e, and pi ... . These constants should be known by any civilisation possessing Egyptian level technology (or greater) ... . The constants themselves are universal because they exist regardless of the number of the base being used\". Regarding the other angles, Torun continued to find mathematically significant numbers \"no matter how I looked at the object\" (O'Leary 210). \n     As the Cydonia controversy seems to clearly demonstrate, rather than revealing obvious, fixed truths about the world, mathematics and the observational tools they inspire require us to learn to see an approximation of the object they construct and represent as \"real\". We are thus compelled to draw the Other closer, but not \"really\", through the technological gaze of the artificial lens, a gaze that works to mask its own latent epistemic crisis. Indeed, this very compulsion inspired the growth of popular microscopy in the mid-eighteenth century, which required a new mode of seeing that could only very generously be termed \"observation\". Captain Basil Hall vividly recalls a meeting of the Geological Society, when \n      \n      a bottle was produced which was said to contain certain zoophytes. It was handed round, in the first instance, among the initiated on the foremost benches, who commented freely with one another on the forms of the animals in the fluid; but, when it came to our hands, we could discover nothing in the bottle but the most limpid fluid, -- without any trace, so far as our optics could make out, of animals dead or alive, the whole appearing absolutely transparent. The surprise of the ignorant at seeing nothing was only equal to that of the learned who saw so much to admire; nor was it till we were specifically instructed what we were to look for, and the shape, size, and general aspect of the zoophytes pointed out, that our understandings began to co-operate with our eyesight in peopling the fluid, which, up to that moment, had seemed perfectly uninhabited. The wonder then was, how we could possibly have omitted seeing objects now so palpable. (Mantell 8) \n      Indeed, as Harley indicates, the relationship between the geographic and microscopic gaze is fundamental to the modern cartographic tradition. He cites Monmonier and Schnell's Map Appreciation (1988) as a recent example: \n      Geography thrives on cartographic generalisation. The map is to the geographer what the microscope is to the microbiologist, for the ability to shrink the earth and generalise about it ... the microbiologist must choose a suitable objective lens, and the geographer must select a map scale appropriate to both the phenomenon in question and the \"regional laboratory\" in which the geographer is studying it. (in Harley 245) \n      Importantly for this discussion, through both microscopy and cartography, \"photography has also played a large role in twentieth-century ethnological representation\", writes James Duncan. \n      What better way to assert the primacy of the visual, produce a \"true\" representation of the place in question and establish presence than through the use of photography? But the mimetic claims of photography can also be called into question. A camera is a machine constructed to produce an image based upon artificial perspective. Only if one accepts the claims of the naturalness of Renaissance artificial perspective can we accept photography as a mimetic representation of the world. Such claims can be cast in doubt, for example, by the failure of peoples unfamiliar with photographs to be able to \"read\" them. (43) \n      At the end of the day, though, it all may have more to do with down-to-earth economics than Martian \"geopolitics\". For many researchers, McDaniel among them, NASA's evasive treatment of the Face and surrounding features (variously labelled the Tholus, the D&amp;M pyramid, the Fort, and the City Square) suggests a cover-up. Specifically, a cover-up of NASA's own inexplicable lack of investigation into apparently artificial structures on the Martian surface. Since the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's data imaging is contracted to a private company legally unaccountable to the public, McDaniel has confronted the somewhat disheartening possibility that financial motives may be obscuring investigation into what seem to be the most intriguing features of the Martian surface. He \"does not personally believe in the conspiracy theory\", but simply suggests that the Cydonia controversy may demonstrate that the financial interests of Malin Space Science Systems have assumed higher priority than the search for extraterrestrial artefacts: \n      The contract for the Mars Observer (now MGS) involved close to 10 million dollars for Malin Space Science Systems ... . If it became clear that the probability of artificial structures on Mars is very high [or even that such a probability existed], it seems the focus of investigation would shift radically. The emphasis would fall to an accelerated manned mission to Mars. Archaeologists and perhaps biologists would assume an increasingly important role. It would be the manned mission (Johnson Space Flight Centre), not JPL, that takes the driver's seat. (McDaniel 1999) \n      In other words, by producing results which indicated that the Cydonia region was worthy of closer attention, MSSS would jeopardise the future of its own multi-million dollar contract with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory -- hardly a wise business venture, regardless of their geopolitical stance. But whatever the \"true\" source of the Martian controversy (it is, after all, the mythic planet of war), it seems undeniable that the Face on Mars is at once both an appropriately postmodern enigma and a genuine cartographic anomaly. For we find embodied within its monstrous form (through the lens), the message that our gaze is destined to be returned by ourselves. From the stars to the quarks, \"we\" seem to forever inhabit the very wilderness our technological gaze functions to both distance and draw closer; to abject. \n          \n      References \n      \nBerland, Jody. \"Mapping Space: Imaging Technologies and the Planetary Body.\" Technoscience and Cyberculture.

    "abstract": "\n              Introduction\n              Over the past thirty years media activism has expanded dramatically. Like\n                never before, individuals and groups have access to personal computers,\n                publishing software, fax, telecommunications, the Internet, community\n                radio and television that enable them to participate in forms of cultural\n                production previously reserved for an intellectual and political élite.\n                Independently produced media among those who feel excluded from, even\n                oppressed by, the dominant social order provides a means of raising\n                awareness among oppressed or marginalised communities while at the same\n                time challenging the meanings conveyed by social institutions like the\n              mass media and the state. \n            The use of media for the purposes of activism has occurred, by in large,\n                in the context of new social movements. The AIDS movement in North America\n                has provided an organisational and ideological infrastructure through\n                which those infected have become involved in media production. This paper\n                focusses on the development of media projects by AIDS activists for the\n                purposes of sharing information about the treatment and management of HIV\n                infection. Specifically I am interested in how the changing the needs of\n                people with HIV/AIDS -- the intended audience -- as perceived by activists\n              have shaped the evolution of treatment information projects. \n            Community-Based Media\n              Media projects designed as a forum for people with HIV/AIDS have been\n                guided by the need to be and remain community-based. What constitutes\n                community-based media has been taken up, in several different ways, in the\n                literature on media activism. Downing, for instance, has examined the\n                experiences of those involved in \"self managed\" media projects. In this\n                analysis he illustrates how control over production is crucial to media\n                projects that focus on challenging or resisting forms of political\n                oppression. External influence or control only threatens to subvert\n                collective efforts directed at achieving self representation. Smith looks\n                at this issue in a different way, arguing that it is important to make the\n                distinction between print media for women and feminist print media.\n                According to Smith, the former tend to reflect the dominant gender order,\n                contributing to the social forces that oppress and marginalise women, in\n                part, because they do not focus on addressing or advancing the needs and\n                concerns of women. Feminist media, in contrast, tends to be informed by a\n                political analysis of gender: they are created and produced by and for\n                women; they provide a forum for the voices of women who have been silenced\n                through oppression or marginalisation; and they challenge and seek to\n                transform patriarchal social relations. Trend takes this point further in\n                his critique of media projects that have been informed by Leftist\n                politics. The problem, he argues, has been that the media created or\n                influenced by Leftist politics have been dominated by an intellectual\n              élite that have ignored or chastised the voices and opinions of those who\n                are oppressed or marginalised by the dominant social order. As an\n                alternative, Trend looks to recent efforts among gay and lesbian media\n                activists who have turned to new media technologies and their own\n                experiences as the basis for subverting and challenging homophobia and\n                hetrosexism. For each of these scholars, community-based media follow what\n                might be called a peer model of communication: a specific group using\n                media to speak for themselves and in doing so achieving some degree of\n                self representation. A key issue raised in this work is how those involved\n                in media projects understand the role that their audience plays in\n              establishing and sustaining this community-based status. \n            Treatment Information Projects as Community-Based Media Activism\n              Political organizing around the treatment of HIV infection (what has been\n                called AIDS treatment activism) has been a central component of the\n                community-based response to HIV/AIDS (Ariss). Treatment activism among\n                groups like ACT UP and AIDS ACTION NOW! have focussed on influencing those\n                power structures (government and pharmaceutical companies) in control of\n                the development and approval of medications (Carter; Carter &amp; Watney).\n                Treatment activism also refers to the creation of advocacy, support, and\n                education programs for people living with HIV/AIDS. The development of\n                forums which enable people with HIV/AIDS to share information about\n                treatments and health care generally has been an important aspect of\n              treatment activism in North America. \n            A significant part of this type of treatment activism has been the\n                production and dissemination of information about treatments and health\n                management. Indeed, the importance of \"staying informed\" has always been\n                high on the list of survival strategies for people with HIV/AIDS. Early in\n                the epidemic, in the 1980s, the problem that people with HIV/AIDS faced\n                was a lack of information about new and potentially beneficial treatments.\n                In response, people with HIV/AIDS formed social networks, often in close\n                proximity to AIDS organizations, in order to share strategies to promote\n                their health and manage their infection. Eventually, such forums were\n                expanded and became, or were integrated into, print media projects. In the\n                United States, the most notable and enduring example is AIDS Treatment\n                News. In Canada similar publications like The Positive Side and the\n                Treatment Information Flash were started by people with HIV/AIDS with the\n                support of grassroots, but increasingly government funded, AIDS service\n                organizations. During this period media products like The Positive Side\n                and Treatment Information Flash were produced by politically involved HIV-\n                positive gay men who sought to provide information to all people with\n                HIV/AIDS but also realised that their primary audience was gay men who\n              were HIV infected or affected. \n            With developments in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, the main issue for people\n                with HIV/AIDS became gaining access to information rather than a lack of\n                information. Pressure from the organised HIV/AIDS community eventually led\n                to the development of and greater support (from government and private\n                foundations) for treatment information organisations. In the United\n                States, groups like Project Inform (PI) were established which focussed\n                exclusively on interpreting medical information and making it available to\n                people with HIV/AIDS. In Canada, a similar organisation was started, the\n                Community AIDS Treatment Information Exchange (CATIE), initially a\n                subcommittee of AIDS ACTION NOW! and then as an autonomous organisation.\n                Treatment-specific organisations meant that existing media projects were\n                given more resources and a broader scope in meeting the information needs\n              of people with HIV/AIDS. \n            Media projects that began earlier in the epidemic were faced with the\n                challenge of adapting to changes in the AIDS epidemic and to the treatment\n                of HIV/AIDS. Efforts were made, for instance, in treatment information\n                projects in Canada with varying levels of success to include the voices of\n                a more diverse range of people with HIV/AIDS. Also, a greater emphasis was\n                placed on providing material that would be accessible to people with\n                varying educational, cultural, and social backgrounds. In the case of The\n                Positive Side and the Treatment Information Flash despite efforts\n                effectively reaching a more diverse audience of people with HIV/AIDS,\n                while remaining relevant to gay men with HIV/AIDS, was an ongoing\n                challenge that called into question the effectiveness and relevancy of\n              such media as a forum for all people with HIV/AIDS. \n            In more recent years, with the rise of new medications and the use of\n                combination therapy or treatment cocktails, as well as the rise in use and\n                legitimacy of complementary therapies, the health care information needs\n                of people with HIV/AIDS have grown exponentially. To meet the changes\n                needs of people with HIV/AIDS, organisations like PI and CATIE have turned\n                away from print media and instead embraced the phone, fax, and the\n                Internet as an alternative means of disseminating treatment information.\n                Also, the availability of information in currently less of a problems as\n                it was in the 1980s and early 1990s (although accessibility continues to\n                be a serious problem). Instead, people with HIV/AIDS were becoming\n                overwhelmed by an overabundance of information. Treatment information\n                projects had to go beyond simply making information available and\n                understandable; people with HIV/AIDS needed to learn how to make sense of\n                the wealth of information available in order to make informed decisions\n              about their health. \n            Print media projects like The Positive Side and the Treatment Information\n                Flash were eventually incorporated into broader electronic media based\n                projects that were more oriented toward provided a broad amount of\n                treatment information to a diverse audience of people with HIV/AIDS. Early\n                print media projects were unable to extend beyond their grassroots in the\n                gay HIV-positive community. In this sense in the pursuit of becoming\n                general media they no longer were \"community-based\" and as a result could\n              no longer sustain themselves. \n            Conclusion\n              What community-based meant for those involved in projects like The\n                Positive Side and the Treatment Information Flash revolved around ensuring\n                that the media actively engaged an audience of people with HIV/AIDS and\n                that the material in the publication was grounded in the experiences of\n                people with HIV/AIDS.\" This understanding of community-based had two\n                components. First, it was an attempt to remain accountable to the needs\n                and concerns of those HIV-infected and affected. And, second, it was an\n                effort to privilege and foster the opinions, views, and expertise of those\n                living with HIV/AIDS. Achieving this required a political analysis that\n                identified the dominant social order as working against, or simply\n                ignoring, the best interests of those HIV-infected and affected. In\n                response, people with HIV/AIDS needed to take control of the production\n                and representation of information about managing HIV infection. As a\n                result, becoming and remaining \"community-based\" was for a period of time\n                an ongoing process that was negotiated between the audience and those\n                involved in the media projects. This negotiation was seen as essential to\n                providing an alternative forum for health care information that looked\n                critically and pragmatically at dominant discourses about managing HIV\n                infection. However, in recent years, the realisation that it is not\n                possible to address people with HIV/AIDS as a unified, politically aware\n                audience has called into question the viability of treatment information\n                projects. As a result, early treatment publications have been replaced by\n                large government funded treatment information organisations that provide\n                general information through a variety of media which are intended for a\n                diverse range of people with HIV/AIDS. The result is a greater gap between\n                producer and consumer and a shift away from a consideration of the\n                audience as an essential, potentially political entity in the production\n                of AIDS treatment information. \n            \n          \n            References\n              \nAriss, R.

    "abstract": "\n \n        Introduction\n        \n        Many anthropologists and other academics have attempted to argue that the spread of technology is a global homogenising force, socialising the remaining indigenous groups across the planet into an indistinct Western \"monoculture\" focussed on consumption, where they are rapidly losing their cultural distinctiveness. In many cases, these intellectuals - people such as Jerry Mander -- often blame the diffusion of television (particularly through new innovations that are allowing it to penetrate further into rural areas, such as satellite and cable) as a key force in the effort to \"assimilate\" indigenous groups and eradicate their unique identities. Such writers suggest that indigenous groups can do nothing to resist the onslaught of the technologically, economically, and aesthetically superior power of Western television. Ironically, while often protesting the plight of indigenous groups and heralding their need for cultural survival, these authors often fail to recognise these groups abilities to fend for themselves and preserve their cultural integrity.\n      On the other side of the debate are visual anthropologists and others who are arguing that indigenous groups are quickly becoming savvy to Western technologies, and that they are now using them for cultural revitalisation, linguistic revival, and the creation of outlets for the indigenous voice. In this school of thought, technology is seen not so much as a threat to indigenous groups, but instead as a remarkable opportunity to reverse the misfortunes of these groups at the hands of colonisation and national programmes of attempted assimilation. From this perspective, the rush of indigenous groups to adopt new technologies comes hand-in-hand with recent efforts to assert their tribal sovereignty and their independence. Technology has become a \"weapon\" in their struggle for technological autonomy. As a result, many are starting their own television stations and networks, and thus transforming the way television operates in their societies - away from global monocultures and toward local interests. \n      I hypothesise that in fact there is no correlation between television viewing and acculturation, and that, in fact, the more familiar people are with the technology of television and the current way the technology is utilised, the more likely they are to be interested in using it to revive and promote their own culture. Whatever slight negative effect exists depends on the degree to which local people can understand and redirect how that technology is used within their own cultural context. However, it should be stated that for terms of this investigation, I consider the technologies of \"video\" and \"television\" to be identical. One is the recording aspect, and the other the distribution aspect, of the same technology. Once people become aware that they can control what is on the television screen through the instrumentality of video, they immediately begin attempting to assert cultural values through it. And this is precisely what is going on on the Cheyenne River Reservation. \n      This project is significant because the phenomenon of globalisation is real and Western technologies such as video, radio, and PCs are spreading throughout the world, including the \"Fourth World\" of the planets indigenous peoples. However, in order to deal with the phenomenon of globalisation, anthropologists and others may need to deal more realistically with the phenomenon of technological diffusion, which operates far less simply than they might assume. Well-meaning anthropologists seeking to \"protect\" indigenous groups from the \"invasion\" of technologies which will change their way of life may be doing these groups a disservice. If they turned some of their effort away from fending off these technologies and toward teaching indigenous groups how to use them, perhaps they might have a better result in creating a better future for them. I hope this study will show a more productive model for dealing with technological diffusion and what effects it has on cultural change in indigenous societies. \n      There have been very few authors that have dealt with this topic head-on. One of the first to do so was Pace (1993), who suggested that some Brazilian Indians were acculturating more quickly as a result of television finally coming to their remote villages in the 1960s. Molohon (1984) looked at two Cree communities, and found that the one which had more heavy television viewing was culturally closer to its neighboring white towns. Zimmerman (1996) fingered television as one of the key elements in causing Indian teenagers to lose their sense of identity, thus putting them at higher risk for suicide. Gillespie (1995) argued that television is actually a weapon of national states everywhere in their efforts to assimilate and socialise indigenous and other ethnic minority groups.\n      In contrast, authors like Weiner (1997), Straubhaar (1991), and Graburn (1982) have all critiqued these approaches, suggesting that they deny subjectivity and critical thinking to indigenous TV audiences. Each of these researchers suggest, based on their field work, that indigenous people are no more likely than anybody else to believe that the things they see on television are true, and no more likely to adopt the values or worldviews promoted by Western TV programmers and advertisers. In fact, Graburn has observed that the Inuit became so disgusted with what they saw on Canadian national television, that they went out and started their own TV network in an effort to provide their people with meaningful alternatives on their screens. \n      Bell (1995) sounds a cautionary note against studies like Graburns, noting that the efforts of indigenous New Zealanders to create their own TV programming for local markets failed, largely because they were crowded out by the \"media imperialism\" of outside international television. Although the indigenous groups there tried to put their own faces on the screen, many local viewers preferred to see the faces of J.R. Ewing and company, and lowered the ratings share of these efforts. Salween (1991) thinks that global media \"cultural imperialism\" is real - that it is an objective pursued by international television marketers - and suggests a media effects approach might be the best way to see whether it works. Woll (1987) notes that historically many ethnic groups have formed their self-images based on the way they have been portrayed onscreen, and that so far these portrayals have been far from sympathetic. In fact, even once these groups started their own cinemas or TV programmes, they unconsciously perpetuated stereotypes first foisted on them by other people. \n      This study tends to side with those who have observed that indigenous people do not tend to \"roll over\" in the wake of the onslaught of Western television. Although cautionary studies need to be examined carefully, this research will posit that although the dominant forces controlling TV are antithetical to indigenous groups and their goals, the efforts of indigenous people to take control of their TV screens and their own \"media literacy\" are also increasing. Thus, this study should contribute to the viewpoint that perhaps the best way to save indigenous groups from cultural eradication is to give them access to television and show them how to set up their own stations and distribute their own video programming. In fact, it appears to be the case that TV, the Internet, and electronic 'new media' are helping to foster a process of cultural renewal, not just among the Lakota, but also among the Inuit, the Australian aborigines, and other indigenous groups. These new technologies are helping them renew their native languages, cultural values, and ceremonial traditions, sometimes by giving them new vehicles and forms. \n      Methods\n      The research for this project was conducted on the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation headquartered in Eagle Butte, South Dakota. Participants chosen for this project were Lakota Sioux who were of the age of consent (18 or older) and who were tribal members living on the reservation. They were given a survey which consisted of five components: a demographic question section identifying their age, gender, and individual data; a technology question section identifying what technologies they had in their home; a TV question section measuring the amount of television they watched; an acculturation question section determining their comparative level of acculturation; and a cultural knowledge question section determining their knowledge of Lakota history. This questionnaire was often followed up by unstructured ethnographic interviews.\n      \n      Thirty-three people of mixed age and gender were given this questionnaire, and for the purposes of this research paper, I focussed primarily on their responses dealing with television and acculturation. These people were chosen through strictly random sampling based on picking addresses at random from the phone book and visiting their houses. The television section asked specifically how many hours of TV they watched per day and per week, what shows they watched, what kinds of shows they preferred, and what rooms in their home had TVs. The acculturation section asked them questions such as how much they used the Lakota language, how close their values were to Lakota values, and how much participation they had in traditional indigenous rituals and customs. To assure open and honest responses, each participant filled out a consent form, and was promised anonymity of their answers. \n      To avoid data contamination, I remained with each person until they completed the questionnaire. For my data analysis, I attempted to determine if there was any correlation (Pearsons coefficient r of correlation) between such things as hours of TV viewed per week or years of TV ownership with such things as the number of traditional ceremonies they attended in the past year, the number of non-traditional Lakota values they had, their fluency in the Lakota language, their level of cultural knowledge, or the number of traditional practices and customs they had engaged in in their lives. Through simple statistical tests, I determined whether television viewing had any impact on these variables which were reasonable proxies for level of acculturation. \n      Findings\n      Having chosen two independent variables, hours of TV watched per week, and years of TV ownership, I tested if there was any significant correlation between them and the dependent variables of Lakota peoples level of cultural knowledge, participation in traditional practices, conformity of values to non-Lakota or non-traditional values, fluency in Lakota, and participation in traditional ceremonies (Table 1). These variables all seemed like reasonable proxies for acculturation since acculturated Lakota would know less of their own culture, go to fewer ceremonies, and so on. \n      The cultural knowledge score was based on how many complete answers the respondents knew to fill in the blank questions regarding Lakota history, historical figures, and important events. Participation in traditional practices was based on how many items they marked in a survey of whether or not they had ever raised a tipi, used traditional medicine, etc. The score for conformity to non-Lakota values was based on how many items they marked with a contrary answer to the emic Lakota value system (\"the seven Ws\".) Lakota fluency was based on how well they could speak, write, or use the Lakota language. And ceremonial attendance was based on the number of traditional ceremonies they had attended in the past year.\n      There were no significant correlations between either of these TV-related variables and these indexes of acculturation. \n      Table 1.

But even that correlation was pretty weak, and nowhere near the r-score of other linear correlations, such as between their age and the number of children they had. How much television Lakota people watched did not seem to have any influence on how much cultural knowledge they knew, how many traditional practices they had participated in, how many non-Lakota values they held, how well they spoke or used the Lakota language, or how many ceremonies they attended.\n      Even though there does not appear to be anything unusual about their television preferences, and in general they are watching the same shows as other non-Lakota people on the reservation, they are not becoming more acculturated as a result of their exposure to television. Although the Lakota people may be losing aspects of their culture, language, and traditions, other causes seem to be at the forefront than television.\n      I also found that people who were very interested in television production as well as consumption saw this as a tool for putting more Lakota-oriented programs on the air. The more they knew about how television worked, the more they were interested in using it as a tool in their own community. And where I was working at the Cultural Center, there was an effort to videotape many community and cultural events. The Center had a massive archive of videotaped material, but unfortunately while they had faithfully recorded all kinds of cultural events, many of them were not quite \"broadcast ready\". There was more focus on showing these video programmes, especially oral history interviews with elders, on VCRs in the school system, and in integrating them into various kinds of multimedia and hypermedia. \n      While the Cultural Center had begun broadcasting (remotely through a radio modem) a weekly radio show, Wakpa Waste (Good Morning CRST), on the radio station to the north, KLND-Standing Rock, there had never been any forays into TV broadcasting. The Cultural Center director had looked into the feasibility of putting up a television signal transmission tower, and had applied for a grant to erect one, but that grant was denied. The local cable system in Eagle Butte unfortunately lacked the technology to carry true \"local access\" programming; although the Channel 8 of the system carried CRST News and text announcements, there was no open channel available to carry locally produced public access programming. The way the cable system was set up, it was purely a \"relay\" or feed from news and channels from elsewhere. Also, people were investing heavily in satellite systems, especially the new DBS (direct broadcast satellite) receivers, and would not be able to pick up local access programmes anyway. \n      The main problem hindering the Lakotas efforts to preserve their culture through TV and video was lack of access to broadcast distribution technology. They had the interest, the means, and the stock of programming to put on the air. They had the production and editing equipment, although not the studios to do a \"live\" show. Were they able to have more local access to and control over TV distribution technology, they would have a potent \"arsenal\" for resisting the drastic acculturation their community is undergoing. TV has the potential to be a tool for great cultural revitalisation, but because the technology and know-how for producing it was located elsewhere, the Lakotas could not benefit from it. \n      Discussion\n      I hypothesised that the effects if TV viewing on levels of indigenous acculturation would be negligible. The data support my hypothesis that TV does not seem to have a major correlation with other indices of acculturation. Previous studies by anthropologists such as Pace and Molohon suggested that TV was a key determinant in the acculturation of indigenous people in Brazil and the U.S. - this being the theory of cultural imperialism. However, this research suggests that TVs effect on the decline of indigenous culture is weak and inconclusive. In fact, the qualitative data suggest that the Lakota most familiar with TV are also the most interested in using it as a tool for cultural preservation. Although the CRST Lakota currently lack the means for mass broadcast of cultural programming, there is great interest in it, and new technologies such as the Internet and micro-broadcast may give them the means.\n      There are other examples of this phenomenon worldwide, which suggest that the Lakota experience is not unique. In recent years, Australian Aborigines, Canadian Inuit, and Brazilian Kayapo have each begun ambitious efforts in creating satellite-based television networks that allow them to reach their far-flung populations with programming in their own indigenous language. In Australia, Aboriginal activists have created music television programming which has helped them assert their position in land claims disputes with the Australian government (Michaels 1994), and also to educate the Europeans of Australia about the aboriginal way of life. In Canada, the Inuit have also created satellite TV networks which are indigenous-owned and operated and carry traditional cultural programming (Valaskakis 1992). Like the Aborigines and the Inuit, the Lakota through their HVJ Lakota Cultural Center are beginning to create their own radio and video programming on a smaller scale, but are beginning to examine using the reservation's cable network to carry some of this material. \n      Since my quantitative survey included only 33 respondents, the data are not as robust as would be determined from a larger sample. However, ethnographic interviews focussing on how people approach TV, as well as other qualitative data, support the inferences of the quantitative research. It is not clear that my work with the Lakota is necessarily generalisable to other populations. Practically, it does suggest that anthropologists interested in cultural and linguistic preservation should strive to increase indigenous access to, and control of, TV production technology. Protecting indigenous groups from new technologies may cause more harm than good. Future applied anthropologists should work with the natives and help teach them how to adopt and adapt this technology for their own purposes. \n      Although this is a matter that I deal with more intensively in my dissertation, it also appears to me to be the case that, contrary to the warnings of Mander, many indigenous cultures are not being culturally assimilated by media technology, but instead are assimilating the technology into their own particular cultural contexts. The technology is part of a process of revitalisation or renewal -- although there is a definite process of change and adaptation underway, this actually represents an 'updating' of old cultural practices for new situations in an attempt to make them viable for the modern situation. Indeed, I think that the Internet, globally, is allowing indigenous people to reassert themselves as a Fourth World \"power bloc\" on the world stage, as linkages are being formed between Saami, Maya, Lakota, Kayapo, Inuit, and Aborigines. \n      Further research should focus on: why TV seems to have a greater acculturative influence on certain indigenous groups rather than others; whether indigenous people can truly compete equally in the broadcast \"marketplace\" with Western cultural programming; and whether attempts to quantify the success of TV/video technology in cultural preservation and revival can truly demonstrate that this technology plays a positive role. \n      In conclusion, social scientists may need to take a sidelong look at why precisely they have been such strong critics of introducing new technologies into indigenous societies. There is a better role that they can play - that of technology broker. They can cooperate with indigenous groups, serving to facilitate the exchange of knowledge, expertise, and technology between them and the majority society.\n          \n      References \n      \n Bell, Avril. \"'An Endangered Species: Local Programming in the New Zealand Television Market.\" Media, Culture &amp; Society 17.1 (1995): 182-202.      \n        Gillespie, Marie.

    "abstract": "\n      Audiences are a contested domain with Ang and others desperate to\n                analyse, anatomise, understand and describe them. They are particularly\n                important for the commercialisation of any medium since advertisers like\n                to know what they are getting for their money and, in the famous aphorism,\n                'the role of the commercial media is to deliver audiences to advertisers'.\n                Marshall's concept of 'audience-commodity' continues this intellectual\n                interrogation of the audience and its production by individual practices\n                of media consumption. Mass media audiences have consumed much research\n                attention over most of the past century with major consideration being\n                paid to the displacement of other activities arising from the consumption\n                of newly-introduced media, effects of the media and a succession of moral\n                panics. It has only been in recent years that 'the audience' has been\n                researched on (essentially) its own terms -- in the branch of media and\n                culture studies enquiry called, conveniently, 'audience studies'. Well-\n                known Australian examples of such studies often concern children and\n                adolescents and include: Hodge &amp; Tripp, Noble, and Palmer (now Gillard). \n              Audience studies assumes that audience participants are sufficiently\n                insightful and sufficiently cognisant of their various pleasures, desires\n                and frustrations to be able to discuss their media consumption patterns\n                with interested researchers. The paradigm takes as read that people have\n                reasons for their behaviours, and sets out to uncover what these are\n                through (often) a variety of interview and observation techniques. It\n                accords audience membership an importance in people's lives. The nature of\n                the 'general' audience is illuminated by specific comments and examples\n                offered during the research process by specific audience members --\n                analysed and interpreted by the research team. What is clear from a\n                cursory glance at the literature is that audiences do not talk about\n                'broadcasting' per se, they talk about specific programs and have a\n                tendency to compare programs with others of the same type. Audiences\n                perceive broadcasting as divided into genred broadcasting streams. Unless\n                asked to do so, an audience member (and I've formally interviewed over two\n                hundred such people) is unlikely to compare Home and Away with the ABC\n                Evening News. Comparisons between Home and Away and Neighbours are\n                commonplace, however. \n              What genre is the Internet? A silly question, I know -- but one that is\n                begged by the repeated discussions of Internet culture, Internet\n                communications and information and Internet communities as 'the Internet'.\n                It's a long time since media studies and popular culture academics have\n                discussed 'broadcasting' generically because concern for the specifics of\n                genred broadcasting (both in television and radio) have rendered\n                generalised discussion ridiculously global and oversimplified. In\n                broadcasting we talk about television and radio as if they were (since\n                they are) significantly different. We recognise that the production values\n                for soap opera, drama, sport, news and current affairs and light\n                entertainment are dissimilar. It's only silly to ask 'what genre is the\n                Internet' because, when we think about it, the Internet is multiply\n                genred. \n              Audiences that consume broadcast programmes can be differentiated from\n                each other in terms of age, gender and socioeconomic status, and in terms\n                of viewing place, viewing style, motivation and preferred programme\n                genres. As Morley indicates in his 1986 treatise, Family Television:\n                Cultural Power and Domestic Leisure, the domestic context is central to\n                the everyday consumption of TV. He argues that \"the social dimensions of\n                'watching television' -- the social relationships within which viewing is\n                performed as an activity -- have to be brought more directly into focus if\n                we are properly to understand television audiences' choices of, and\n                responses to, their viewing\" (15). That focus upon social relationships as\n                the domestic context within which television is consumed is the substance\n                of his book. Holmes suggests that much of the appeal of the Internet is a\n                spurious one, viz. by selling \"a new kind of community to those who have\n                been disconnected from geographical communities\" (35). He claims that\n                society has been divided into a multitude of separate domestic spheres\n                within which television is consumed, creating an isolation which the\n                Internet is marketed as solving. \"The Internet offers to the dispossessed\n                the ability to remove some of the walls for brief periods of time in\n                return for a time-charged fee\" (35). \n              A key to understanding the domestic consumption of television, however,\n                is an understanding of the specifics of genre, and the pleasures\n                associated with the consumption of the genre. Uses to which the broadcast\n                material is put in daily life in interpersonal settings are essentially\n                related to the broadcast material consumed. Discussion of soaps, and of\n                finance reporting, may both be used to develop interpersonal networks and\n                to display current knowledge, but these discussions are likely to occur in\n                different domestic/work contexts. Have we had enough of generalised\n                discussion of the global Internet? Can we move onto addressing whether it\n                is genred; and if so, in which ways? \n              Faced with the cacophony which is the Internet today -- let alone the\n                projected manifestation of the Internet tomorrow -- we are forced to\n                conclude that the Internet has the potential to mimic the features of all\n                the media and genres that have preceded it, and more. It can operate as a\n                mass medium, as a niche medium, and as one-to-one discrete communication --\n                Dayan's 'particularistic' media (103-13). Within all these categories it\n                can (or has the potential to) work in audio, visual, audiovisual, text and\n                data. On top of this complexity, it offers a variety of degrees of\n                interactivity from simple access to full content creation as part of the\n                communication exchange. You thought Media Studies was big? Watch out for\n                the disciplinary field of Internet Studies! \n              The concept of the active audience has been a staple of audience studies\n                theory for a generation. Here the activity recognised in the 'active'\n                audience is one of the audience actively engaging with programme content --\n                resisting, reformulating and recirculating the messages and meanings on\n                offer. This is a different level of interactivity compared with that\n                implicit in some aspects of the Internet (online community, for example).\n                Internet interactivity recognises that the text is produced as part of the\n                act of consumption. Have the audience activity characteristics of online\n                community members been sufficiently differentiated from -- say -- the\n                activity of accessing Encyclopaedia Britannica online? Are online\n                community members more of a 'www.participants' than an 'audience'; should\n                we see audiences as genred too? \n              Television audiences (as my anonymous reviewer has helpfully remarked)\n                are typically constituted via essentialising experiences' \"generally\n                domestic/familial setting, generally in the context of other activities,\n                generally ritualised in terms of the serialisation of these experiences\n                etc.\" We know that this is the case from detailed investigations into the\n                consumption of television. Less is known about the experience of online\n                participation, although Wilbur discusses \"the strangely solitary work that\n                many CMC [computer-mediated communications] researchers are engaged in,\n                sitting alone at their computers, but surrounded by a global multitude\"\n                (6). He goes on to suggest seven definitions of 'virtual community' before\n                concluding that the \"multi-bladed, critical Swiss army knives\" might offer\n                an appropriate metaphor for the many uses of the Internet. 'Participation'\n                in this culture is similarly hard to define, and (given that it is so\n                individual and spatially private) expressive of individual difference.\n              \"For those who doubt the possibility of online intimacy, I can only speak\n                of ... hours sitting at my keyboard with tears streaming down my face, or\n                convulsed with laughter\" (Wilbur 18). I wait for the ethnographic research\n                before I venture further into definitions of 'www.participants'. \n              Online community, I would argue, is a specifically genred stream of\n                Internet activity. Further, it is particularly interesting to audience\n                researchers because it has no clear precursor in the audiences and\n                readerships of the traditional mass media. Holmes (32) has usefully\n                differentiated between 'Communities of broadcast' (using the generic term,\n                to offer an exception to the rule!) and 'Communities of interactivity',\n                but he does so to highlight difference -- not to argue great similarity.\n                The community of interest brought into being by the shared consumption and\n                social circulation of elements of broadcast programming differs from the\n                community of interactivity made visible through online community\n                membership -- and both differ from Anderson's notion of the imagined\n                community. Online communities are particularly problematic for audience\n                studies theorists because the audience is the content producer. There is\n                no content apart from the interactions and creativity of community\n                members, and the contributions of new/casual online participants. For\n                sites where 'hits' are enumerated, the simple act of access is also\n                content production, and creates value and interest for others. \n              Clearly the research is yet to be done in these areas. If we are to\n                theorise cogently and in depth about people's activities and\n                production/consumption patterns on the Internet, we need to identify\n                genres and investigate specific audience/community members. Interactions\n                with online community members suggest that age may offer a critical nexus\n                of audience/participant distinction (Palandri &amp; Green). Community members\n                of 35+ have had to deliberately choose to learn the conventions of\n                Internet interaction. They have experienced specific motivations. In\n                affluent societies such as ours, on the other hand, for many people under\n                20, the required Internet skills and competencies have been normalised as\n                part of an everyday social repertoire, in the same way that almost all of\n                us have learned the conventions of television viewing. An understanding of\n                the specifics of difference, and of congruence, will make discussions of\n                Internet audiences/participants/content providers/community members that\n                much more useful. \n              Such research has an added frisson. I started this article with an\n                acknowledgement of Ang's book Desperately Seeking the Audience. The\n                research to be undertaken in the Internet genre of online community\n                includes the need to seek desperately for the audience; the individual\n                audience member; and (in many cases) the individual audience member's\n                multiple identities -- each of which offers specific and different value\n                to the researched community member. Identity is a key issue for Internet\n                researchers, and a signal difference between communities of broadcast and\n                communities of interactivity. As Holmes has usefully pointed out:\n              \"broadcast facilitates mass recognition ... with little reciprocity while\n                the Internet facilitates reciprocity with little or no recognition\" (31).\n                We need to acknowledge, recognise and explore these differences in the\n                next generation of audience studies research. \n              \n          \n              References\n              \nAnderson, B.

    "abstract": "\n      In an article entitled \"Palming the Planet\", Ron Jasper, a marketing executive, is quoted describing his car trip from Seattle to Vancouver: \"'The whole way up,' he says with glee ... 'I had my laptop [wirelessly connected to the office]. I was reading my e-mail. At the same time I checked my stock on this' -- he waves a new smart phone, sleek and easily palmed. 'At one point, I was talking on the phone, checking my stock on the laptop and steering with my knee'\", he confided, \"slightly embarrassed\" by his admission. He concludes with the observation: \"'These devices are making it possible for everyone to work in ways they never imagined before'\". \n      Leaving aside the obvious concerns over highway safety, I want to register the observation that Jasper's enthusiasm for the possibilities offered by his new phone and his elation over his ability to get more work done faster, are not in fact 'never-imagined' ways of working. Visions of efficiency and connectivity have been integral to the representations of communication technologies, especially the telephone, since the beginning of the twentieth century. Looking back on the images and descriptions of the telephone in the early 1900s reveals a similar fascination with the ability to transcend the mundane realities of time and space. The idea that 'faster is better' is not one born of our times, it is one that emerged and evolved out of the preoccupations of an earlier era. The contemporary obsession with faster connections and multiple function technologies is an amplification of a century-old preoccupation with speed and efficiency; just as the passion for \"multi-tasking\" is today's version of what a 1909 AT&amp;T advertisement referred to as \"the multiplication of power\". The recurrence of similar utopic and dystopic themes seems to suggest that our hopes and fears about the possibilities of telephonic communication are regenerated with each technological advance. In this paper I explore some of the concepts which inform these representations and suggest that they function simultaneously as a critique and a celebration of the renewal of capitalism that seems to accompany technological progress. \n      Capitalist Reveries\n      In a speech to the New York Electric Club in 1889, Erastus Wiman, president of the Canadian telegraph system remarked: \"if to accomplish things quickly, close transactions promptly, and generally to get through with things is a step toward a business man's millennium, then we must be nearing that heavenly expectation\". He praises electricity, the telegraph, and the \"most marvelous\" telephone for making the businessman \"almost divine in what he can achieve\". Throughout the twentieth century, technology and technological developments have been embraced because they provided the means to radically improve speed, efficiency, and connectivity. As Wiman makes clear though, these attributes were not, and are not now, neutral or arbitrary values. Their worth is located in their application to the flow of goods, information, and ultimately to the circulation of capital. They are valuable because they facilitate a renewal of capitalism itself: the tremendous expansion of both capital and markets occurring at the end of both the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries is not unrelated to the technological developments of these eras. In the Grundrisse, Marx writes that \"Capital by its nature drives beyond every spatial barrier. Thus the creation of the physical conditions of exchange -- of the means of communication and transport -- the annihilation of space by time -- becomes an extraordinary necessity for it\". Improvements in the speed and flexibility of communication 'renew' capitalism because they overcome the temporal disadvantages associated with distance and facilitate the expansion of markets in geographic space. \n      Perhaps more than any other communication technology, the telephone has encouraged and anticipated capitalism's utopic fantasies. It is no coincidence that in early advertisements, its promoters referred to the telephone as the \"annihilator of time and space\". Whatever other benefits the telephone came to be seen as offering, its ability to instantaneously transfer information and credit was perceived and promoted as its most perfect attribute. Linking together buyers and sellers in cities all across the country, the telephone re-organised the 'playing field' of capitalism. By making distance an increasingly irrelevant factor in the transaction of business, the telephone rearranged space and distance \"to fit the rather strict temporal requirements of the circulation of capital\".\n      Time and Money\n      According to Marx, \"economy of time, to this all economy ultimately reduces itself\". Wiman's celebration of the telegraph and the telephone at the New York Electric Club in 1889 is not much different than Jasper's delight with his smart phone and laptop computer as he careens down the highway towards Vancouver. Simply understood, the ability to save time translates into a saving of money but the relationship between time and money is not a straightforward one. Time and money appear as commensurate albeit inverse values because of the effect of the velocity of circulation on the accumulation of capital. They had come to be linked with the rise of wage labour and the practice of paying workers by the hour and in this sense, \"money appears as measure\". When in the mid-1700s Benjamin Franklin proclaimed that \"time is money\", and went on to explain their enigmatic relationship, he was describing more than a simple ratio. \n      He that can earn ten shillings in a day by his labour, and goes abroad, or sits idle, one half of that day, though he spends but sixpence during his diversions or idleness, ought not to reckon that the only expense; he has really spent, or rather thrown away, five shillings besides.\n      Franklin not only equates time spent working with money, but also proposes a conception of unproductive time as a negative cost, a tangible loss against potential profit. Following the logic of his formula, if misspent time is perceived as a deficit, time saved can be counted as a profit. This way of thinking counts all time as potentially profitable in an economic sense and confers a speculative value on time. Telephone advertising in the first decades of the twentieth century made explicit use of this formula and, in so doing, not only asserted the value of the instrument but also provided a way of imagining time in terms of its market value. The text of a 1909 advertisement reads: \n      The mere item of time actually saved by those who use the telephone means an immense increase in the production of the nation's wealth every working day in the year ... just counting the time alone, over $3,000,000 a day is saved by the users of the telephone! Which means adding $3,000,000 a day to the nation's wealth. (Italics in original)\n     Contemporary representations of the telephone continue to employ the idea that savings of transaction time can be accumulated and converted into working capital. In a 1990 article on mobile offices in the financial magazine Money, a Los Angeles attorney is quoted as saying that his cell phone and mobile fax machine have \"added two hours to my day and 25% to my annual gross\". A 1993 survey of cell phone users by Motorola reported its findings in similar terms. Those canvassed claimed that a cellular phone \"added 0.92 hours to their productive working day [and] increased their own or their company's revenues by 19 percent\". This kind of temporal accounting involves two basic conceptual manoeuvres which can only occur if time is 'emptied' of its social value or meaning, leaving it available to take on a new and purely economic significance. First, in order to calculate time in terms of both its actual and speculative monetary value, it must be conceived in abstract terms, the value of each minute standardised and conceived as a unit of measurement. Second, and following from the first, because now each minute of the day has the same relative monetary value, the entire 24-hour day, not just the traditional 8-hour workday, comes to be imagined as zone for commercial activity.\n      \n      Prior to the telephone, the partition of the day into work and family time was safeguarded by the physical separation of the business and the domestic spheres. Even the telegraph, because its use was largely restricted to the workplace, did little to challenge the partition between public and private domains. The telephone, as it became increasingly ubiquitous in both offices and homes, disturbed these boundaries and expropriated time previously reserved for rest, relaxation and social activities for all manner of commercial uses. AT&amp;T's declaration in an ad entitled \"The Always-on-Duty Telephone\" (1910) that \"the whole Bell System is on duty 1440 minutes a day\" also must have stirred anxiety with its conclusion that \"if any of these minutes are not used, their earning power is irrevocably lost\". As the \"1440 minute\" day expanded the potential for profit, it also increased competition and established new expectations. \n      Social Anxieties\n      The logic of capital's never-ending drive to renew itself dictates that time saved by technology is perceived not as \"free time\" but as potential profit, which must be reinvested or lost. Booster though he was of modern communication technologies, Wiman could not help but observe: \n      One would think that the ability ... to talk freely over the telephone would so facilitate business pursuits and close up transactions so quickly that it would beget leisure, rest and quiet, but such is not the case. The thirst for achievement is so great ... that the more we do, the more we seek to do.\n      We are no more encouraged to use the extra two or .92 hours gained by the cellphone for play or relaxation than we were when the telephone first began to speed up the tempo of our lives. Anxieties about the social effects of communications technologies are not new although they rarely manifest themselves in business discourse. Today, as business and technology publications celebrate each new communications innovation, general interest and women's magazines are more often questioning the impact of cell phones, pagers, palm pilots, and portable computers on family life and mental health. It is somehow both ironic and appropriate that during both periods, concerns about the social effects of telephone -- a medium of disembodied communication -- should manifest as anxieties about its negative corporeal effects. \n      In 1889, an account in the British Medical Journal reported a new medical condition called \"aural overpressure\", an affliction suffered by those who used the telephone for extended periods of the work day. The \"constant strain of the auditory apparatus\" by prolonged telephone use was said to be responsible for \"nervous excitability, buzzing in the ear, giddiness, and neuralgic pains\". The Electrical Review recounted cautionary tales of individuals driven mad by the telephone's \"constant ringing\". In 2000, we find Scientific American and Time investigating the possible links between cellphone use and brain tumors. Despite the consistently inconclusive findings of multiple scientific studies, the British government ruled that cellphones sold in the United Kingdom must carry health notices that warn \"people to be careful about where and how long they use them\", and American cellphone retailers have voluntarily begun to include \"a one page health-and-safety bulletin\" with all cellphones they sell. \n      Warren Susman suggests that examining the anxieties associated with any given technology can provide useful insight into the cultural values at stake for its users. According to the scientific experts of their day, both \"aural overpressure\" and brain tumors are avoided by reducing the amount of time spent on the telephone, perhaps less time working and possibly more time in the pursuit of other more socially oriented activity. It is possible to look at these panics around physical and mental well-being as a reassertion of the social, of the body, a sort of return of the repressed, at those historical moments the alienating effects of capitalism are being exacerbated by the uses to which we put technology. \n      If, as Marx writes, the \"circulation of capital constantly ignites itself anew\" then it seems logical that the discourses which circulate around the telephone and communications technologies will continue to renew themselves at key historical moments. Advances in telecommunications at the end of both the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have inspired similar desires and elicited comparable anxieties because they have been driven by a common motive: the search for the competitive advantage that drives both capital and technological development alike.\n          \n      References \n      \n Adam, B.

    "abstract": "\n              The audience gets a lot of attention and little understanding. It is the\n                object of solicitous attention on the part of moralists and of\n                exploitation on the part of industry. Social scientists and commentators\n                greet it with equal parts of anxiety, derision, and theoretical reduction.\n                Producers and performers subject it to constant interrogation. The\n                audience is variously the result of bad manipulation, of societal forces,\n        of an innate herd instinct, of industrial pandering, etc. \n            The particular concerns and interests raised by these various parties ebb\n                and flow with the cultural and political climate. What remains consistent\n                throughout is the difficulty of defining audiences and their practices.\n                Its greatest failing is that it never fully lives up to any description. \n                As a result, we tend to find not the description but the audience itself\n              lacking. \n            Understanding the audience has grown increasingly troublesome during the\n                past two decades. New communication technologies -- in both production and\n                reception -- have put greater control over media experience in the hands\n                of consumers. Narrowcasting has superseded broadcast in many contexts --\n                generating fragmented, disparate communities of consumers. No less\n                significant is the increasing awareness and sophistication of audiences.\n                Knee-deep in a media-saturated environment, consumers have become adept at\n              locating and interpreting content. \n            While critics and academics struggle to grasp audience activity, the most\n                significant conception of the audience may be those made by individual\n                consumers. Individual perceptions of who constitutes the audience for a\n                given film, television programme or Website goes a long way towards\n                determining the value and status of the content. Consumers use these\n                perceptions to define themselves in association with, and in relation to\n                other audiences. While such perceptions may often be wholly inaccurate,\n              they flavour the way in which audiences interpret and relate to the text. \n            Additionally, the audience for one medium usually consists of the\n                audience -- or parts of audiences -- for other media. Media trade\n                audiences amongst themselves and audiences trade media. The audience is\n              therefore a set of increasingly sophisticated skills and habits. \n            In this issue of M/C, we present a number of articles with different\n                takes on the audience. Some see it as spontaneously and uncontrollably\n                creative, some define it as stubborn and defiant, others still approach it\n                as a problem to be solved. We offer this issue, then, as an opportunity to\n                revisit the audience, to reconsider their formation and activities from\n              new perspectives.\n             Paul Attallah\n      Keith Hampson\n      'Audience' Issue Editors\n            \n          \n            Citation reference for this article\n                MLA style:\n\n                  Paul Attallah, Keith Hampson. \"Editorial: 'Audience'.\" M/C: A Journal of\n                  Media and Culture 3.1 (2000).

    "abstract": "\n      Futuristic fiction almost by definition enters into a dialogue with the present as a future past. As a consequence, history haunts even the most inane visions of the future in often quite subtle ways. An excellent prompt to speculate on this issue is provided by Luc Besson's popular film The Fifth Element (1997). Like many science-fiction films, it is about a future troubled by its own promises. It almost goes without saying that while not specifically figured around Y2K, the attention to dates and time in the film combined with its late '90s release date also inscribe it within Millennial anxieties about the end of the world. \n      History plays a series of roles in The Fifth Element. In common with many science-fiction fables, the film stages an inverted fictional genealogy, in which the viewer is actively encouraged to revel in identifying extrapolated features and concerns of the present. \n      This heralds a basic historicity: that is, it invites us to grasp our present as history through its defamiliarisation. Moreover, like another futuristic film of the same year, Gattaca, it is aesthetically marked by the pathos of what might be called millennial \"nostalgia for the future\" -- that lost utopian real of Modernist aesthetic desire which seems to haunt these \"post-post-apocalyptic\", Space-Age futures1. This is only enhanced by quoting generously from earlier moments of the science fiction genre (such as Blade Runner). Striking, however, is that despite all of this, everyday America -- globalised and projected two hundred and fifty years hence -- is not so much dystopian or utopian as just ordinary. People still smoke, but filters makes up three-quarters of a cigarette's length; we still get stuck in chaotic traffic, even if it flies above the ground; we still eat Chinese takeaway, only now the restaurants fly to you; and cops still eat take-away at drive-through McDonald's, which are now floating fixtures in the cityscape. That individuals are so stylish (thanks to costume design, everyone is wearing Jean-Paul Gaultier) also seems significant, because this aestheticised ordinariness helps focus attention on the lived time of everyday utopian yearnings. In these ways and more, our contemporary moment is immanent in the film. However, at certain other crucial moments in the film, History is directly presented as an excess. Let me explain. \n      Two hundred and fifty years into the future, a \"Supreme Being\" -- Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) -- is genetically reconstructed by scientists. Dubbed the missing \"fifth element\", she belongs to a highly developed extra-terrestrial species who have a protectoral relation to humanity. In the beginning, Leeloo is cut off from human language -- speaking in a tongue that combines a mixture of European dialects with baby-speak (her favourite phrase, as anyone who has seen the film will recall, is \"[Big] badda-boo!\"). She speaks what a priest in the film calls the \"Divine language\", \"spoken before time was time\" -- evoking the theological dream of a universal pre-symbolic language, of a pure speech that speaks the world rather than speaks of it. Her very first English word is \"Help!\" -- which she reads off a taxi sticker advertisement for starving black orphans. And it is perhaps no accident that she identifies with this future's expropriated. Leeloo is a body cast into marginality. Caged as an exhibit from the moment of her arrival on Earth, with her exotic appearance, wide-eyed wonderment and capacity for mimicry, she displays all the tropes of the infantilised and sexualised Other. Romanticised as a primitivist fantasy, she represents a classically vulnerable redemptive figure2. \n      Two hundred and fifty years into the future, a \"Supreme Being\" -- Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) -- is genetically reconstructed by scientists.

The \"arbitrary\" order of alphabetisation, which replaces the seemingly determined disorder of historical narratives, is akin to the Kantian dream of a cosmopolitan state of \"universal history\". Think, too, of the aging Hegel, writing in 1830: \n      We witness a vast spectacle of events and actions, of infinitely varied constellations of nations, states and individuals, in restless succession. ... Everywhere we see a motley confusion ... But ... we grow weary of particulars and ask ourselves to what end they all contribute. We cannot accept that their significance is exhausted by their own particular ends; everything must be part of a single enterprise. (325-7) \n      Leaving aside for the moment the perhaps inevitably romantic resolution to this predicament, we can interpret this scene as a critique of the Enlightenment pretension to \"total History\".

We cannot accept that their significance is exhausted by their own particular ends; everything must be part of a single enterprise. (325-7) \n      If The Fifth Element critiques the universal history lesson, it also revolves around a dialectical relation between past and present. Although the opening scene in late colonial Egypt locates the film's narrative historically, these later scenes suggest a break with conventional, clean historiographical separations between the past and the present5. Leeloo's reading of History implies that embodied historical reception is in a perpetual in-between state. Not only the representation of the past as History but the experience of Time itself becomes less a matter of chronology than of a Freudian retroactivity, a \"present past\" with everyday variations which belong as much to future possibilities as to what we perceive as the present. The necessary absence of a determinate \"past object\" (referent) in historical understanding means that historicity is a traumatic process of deferral. In psychoanalytic terms, Leeloo's forced recognition of the unnatural deaths of Others is a traumatic encounter which generates a hole in the symbolic order of Leeloo's \"real\". Leeloo's traumatised body metaphorically becomes the singular \"truth\" of the symbolic world6. \n      A global history is in fact nobody's history in particular -- belonging to everybody and nobody. This is the fate of the CD-ROM: a \"memory\" overwhelmingly composed of media images, and an allegory for our own situation of image saturation (whose stereotypical symbol is the isolated individual glued to a flickering screen). Yet when Leeloo enters history with a kiss, a fragile dialogical exchange in which her own life \"story\" begins, the fate of media images is to become socialised as part of non-synchronous particular narratives7. The grand \"nightmare\" of History has become comprehensible through her particular access to universal History -- and the result is an appropriated, ongoing experience with an undisclosed future. The Fifth Element thus presents a distinctly everyday solution to the problem of historical time -- and is this not how media history is experienced? No doubt in the future no less than the present, history will be less a matter of the Past itself, than of the allegorical reverberation of events documented and encountered in the everyday mediasphere. \n      \n      Footnotes \n      \nMark Dery recently berated the trend for retro-futurism as a Wallpaper-inspired plot, poised to generate a nostalgia for ironic dreams of fading technological utopias, while revealing the banality of design fashions that demand the ever new. See \"Back to the Future\", posted to Nettime (5 Sep. 1999) \n        It is also worth noting the sublime role of the Diva in the film, whose pained operatic performance embodies what Slavoj Zizek once called the jouissance of modernity. \n        Humanity's potential will to \"creative destruction\" has previously been embodied in Gary Oldman's evil business figure of Zorg, who undoubtedly represents the excesses of corporate capitalism (he illustrates his Ayn Rand-style vitalist philosophy at one point by letting a glass fall from his desk and shatter on to the ground: gleefully watching as a team of mechanical robots whiz around the floor sweeping it up, he croons: \"see -- a lovely ballet ensues, adding to the great chain of life -- by creating a little destruction, I am in fact encouraging life\". \n        See Jean-François Lyotard, The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge, trans.

London: Routledge, 1994. \n        Historiographical time can be distinguished from psychoanalytic time on the basis of two different ways of organising the space of memory. While the former conceives the temporal relation as one of succession and correlation, the latter treats the relation as one of imbrication and repetition. Michel de Certeau, Heterologies: Discourse on the Other. Translated by Brian Massumi. Vol. 17, Theory and History of Literature. Minneapolis: U of Minnesota P, 1986. 4. \n        An interesting sf intertext here is Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris, in which a woman who is a projection of a man's memory unsuccessfully attempts to kill herself to prove that she is made of historical reality. In this traumatic scene, she consumes liquid nitrogen and writhes on a metallic floor in a frozen state until she gradually thaws into human movement. \n        Leeloo is finally brought into the \"un-Historical\" time of everyday embodied subjectivity with a single kiss. To borrow the language of psychoanalytic film studies, her \"screen memories\" are reconfigured by an imaginary resolution in the present. I use the term screen memories with a nod to both the computer screen and Freud's compelling if problematic account of repressed mnemic material. Freud writes: \"As the indifferent memories owe their preservation not to their own content but to an associative relation between their content and another which is repressed, they have some claim to be called 'screen memories'\".

    "abstract": " \n      Introduction\n        The recent AOL/Time-Warner merger invites us to re-think the\n          relationships amongst content producers, distributors, and audiences. \n          Worth an estimated $300 billion (US), the largest Internet transaction of\n          all time, the deal is 45 times larger than the AOL/Netscape merger of\n          November 1998 (Ledbetter). Additionally, the Time Warner/EMI merger, which\n          followed hard on the heels of the AOL/Time-Warner deal and is itself worth\n          $28 billion (US), created the largest content rights organisation in the\n          music industry. The joining of the Internet giant (AOL) with what was\n          already the world's largest media corporation (Time-Warner-EMI) has\n          inspired some exuberant reactions. An Infoworld column proclaimed:\n         The AOL/Time-Warner merger signals the demise of traditional media\n  companies and the ascendancy of 'new economy' media companies that will\n  force any industry hesitant to adopt a complete electronic-commerce\n  strategy to rethink and put itself on Internet time. (Saap &amp; Schwarrtz)\n        This comment identifies the distribution channel as the dominant\n          component of the \"new economy\" media. But this might not really be much of\n          an innovation. Indeed, the assumption of all industry observers is that\n          Time-Warner will provide broadband distribution (through its extensive\n          cable holdings) as well as proprietary content for AOL. It is also\n          expected that Time-Warner will adopt AOL's strategy of seeking sponsorship\n          for development projects as well as for content. However, both of these\n          phenomena -- merger and sponsorship -- are at least as old as radio. It\n          seems that the Internet is merely repeating an old industrial strategy. \n        Nonetheless, one important difference distinguishes the Internet from\n          earlier media: its characterisation of the audience. Internet companies\n          such as AOL and Microsoft tend towards a simple and simplistic media-\n          centred view of the audience as market. I will show, however, that as the\n          Internet assumes more of the traditional mass media functions, it will be\n          forced to adopt a more sophisticated notion of the mass audience. \n        Indeed, the Internet is currently the site in which audience definitions\n          borrowed from broadcasting are encountering and merging with definitions\n          borrowed from marketing. The Internet apparently lends itself to both\n          models. As a result, definitions of what the Internet does or is, and of\n          how we should understand the audience, are suitably confused and opaque. \n          And the behaviour of big Internet players, such as AOL and MSN, perfectly\n          reflects this confusion as they seem to careen between a view of the\n          Internet as the new television and a contrasting view of the Internet as\n          the new shopping mall. Meanwhile, Internet users move in ways that most\n          observers fail to capture. \n        For example, Baran and Davis characterise mass communication as a process\n          involving (1) an organized sender, (2) engaged in the distribution of\n          messages, (3) directed toward a large audience. They argue that\n          broadcasting fits this model whereas a LISTSERV does not because, even\n          though the LISTSERV may have very many subscribers, its content is\n          filtered through a single person or Webmaster. But why is the Webmaster\n          suddenly more determining than a network programmer or magazine editor? \n        The distinction seems to grow out of the Internet's technological\n          characteristics: it is an interactive pipeline, therefore its use\n          necessarily excludes the possibility of \"broadcasting\" which in turn\n          causes us to reject \"traditional\" notions of the audience. However, if a\n          media organisation were to establish an AOL discussion group in order to\n          promote Warner TV shows, for example, would not the resulting\n          communication suddenly fall under the definition as set out by Baran and\n          Davis? \n        It was precisely the confusion around such definitions that caused the\n          CRTC (Canada's broadcasting and telecommunications regulator) to hold\n          hearings in 1999 to determine what kind of medium the Internet is. \n        Unlike traditional broadcasting, Internet communication does indeed\n          include the possibility of interactivity and niche communities. In this\n          sense, it is closer to narrowcasting than to broadcasting even while\n          maintaining the possibility of broadcasting. Hence, the nature of the\n          audience using the Internet quickly becomes muddy. While such muddiness\n          might have led us to sharpen our definitions of the audience, it seems\n          instead to have led many to focus on the medium itself. For example,\n          Morris &amp; Ogan define the Internet as a mass medium because it addresses a\n          mass audience mediated through technology (Morris &amp; Ogan 39). They divide\n          producers and audiences on the Internet into four groups:\n        \n One-to-one asynchronous communication (e-mail);\n           Many-to-many asynchronous communication (Usenet and News Groups);\n           One-to-one, one-to-few, and one-to-many synchronous communication\n            (topic groups, construction of an object, role-playing games, IRC chats,\n            chat rooms);\n           Asynchronous communication (searches, many-to-one, one-to-one, one to-\n            many, source-receiver relations (Morris &amp; Ogan 42-3) \n        \nThus, some Internet communication qualifies as mass communication while\n          some does not. However, the focus remains firmly anchored on either the\n          sender or the medium because the receiver --the audience -- is apparently\n          too slippery to define. \n        When definitions do address the content distributed over the Net, they\n          make a distinction between passive reception and interactive\n          participation. As the World Wide Web makes pre-packaged content the norm,\n          the Internet increasingly resembles a traditional mass medium. Timothy\n          Roscoe argues that the main focus of the World Wide Web is not the\n          production of content (and, hence, the fulfilment of the Internet's\n          democratic potential) but rather the presentation of already produced\n          material: \"the dominant activity in relation to the Web is not producing\n          your own content but surfing for content\" (Rosco 680). He concludes that\n          if the emphasis is on viewing material, the Internet will become a medium\n          similar to television. \n        Within media studies, several models of the audience compete for\n          dominance in the \"new media\" economy. Denis McQuail recalls how\n          historically, the electronic media furthered the view of the audience as a\n        \"public\". The audience was an aggregate of common interests. With\n          broadcasting, the electronic audience was delocalised and socially\n          decomposed (McQuail, Mass 212). According to McQuail, it was not a great\n          step to move from understanding the audience as a dispersed \"public\" to\n          thinking about the audience as itself a market, both for products and as a\n          commodity to be sold to advertisers. McQuail defines this conception of\n          the audience as an \"aggregate of potential customers with a known social-\n          economic profile at which a medium or message is directed\" (McQuail, Mass\n          221). Oddly though, in light of the emancipatory claims made for the\n          Internet, this is precisely the dominant view of the audience in the \"new\n          media economy\". \n        Media Audience as Market\n        How does the marketing model characterise the relationship between\n          audience and producer? According to McQuail, the marketing model links\n          sender and receiver in a cash transaction between producer and consumer\n          rather than in a communicative relationship between equal interlocutors.\n          Such a model ignores the relationships amongst consumers. Indeed, neither\n          the effectiveness of the communication nor the quality of the\n          communicative experience matters. This model, explicitly calculating and\n          implicitly manipulative, is characteristically a \"view from the media\"\n          (McQuail, Audience 9). \n        Some scholars, when discussing new media, no longer even refer to\n          audiences. They speak of users or consumers (Pavick &amp; Dennis). The logic\n          of the marketing model lies in the changing revenue base for media\n          industries. Advertising-supported media revenues have been dropping since\n          the early 1990s while user-supported media such as cable, satellite,\n          online services, and pay-per-view, have been steadily growing (Pavlik &amp;\n          Dennis 19). In the Internet-based media landscape, the audience is a\n          revenue stream and a source of consumer information. As Bill Gates says,\n          it is all about \"eyeballs\". In keeping with this view, AOL hopes to\n          attract consumers with its \"one-stop shopping and billing\". And Internet\n          providers such as MSN do not even consider their subscribers as\n        \"audiences\". Instead, they work from a consumer model derived from the\n          computer software industry: individuals make purchases without the seller\n          providing content or thematising the likely use of the software. The\n          analogy extends well beyond the transactional moment. The common practice\n          of prototyping products and beta-testing software requires the\n          participation of potential customers in the product development cycle not\n          as a potential audience sharing meanings but as recalcitrant individuals\n          able to uncover bugs. Hence, media companies like MTV now use the Internet\n          as a source of sophisticated demographic research. Recently, MTV Asia\n          established a Website as a marketing tool to collect preferences and\n          audience profiles (Slater 50). The MTV audience is now part of the product\n          development cycle. Another method for getting information involves the\n        \"cookie\" file that automatically provides a Website with information about\n          the user who logs on to a site (Pavick &amp; Dennis). \n        Simultaneously, though, both Microsoft and AOL have consciously shifted\n          from user-subscription revenues to advertising in an effort to make online\n          services more like television (Gomery; Darlin). For example, AOL has long\n          tried to produce content through its own studios to generate sufficiently\n          heavy traffic on its Internet service in order to garner profitable\n          advertising fees (Young). However, AOL and Microsoft have had little\n          success in providing content (Krantz; Manes). In fact, faced with the\n          AOL/Time-Warner merger, Microsoft declared that it was in the software\n          rather than the content business (Trott). In short, they are caught\n          between a broadcasting model and a consumer model and their behaviour is\n          characteristically erratic. \n        Similarly, media companies such as Time-Warner have failed to establish\n          their own portals. Indeed, Time-Warner even abandoned attempts to create\n          large Websites to compete with other Internet services when it shut down\n          its Pathfinder site (Egan). Instead it refocussed its Websites so as to\n          blur the line between pitching products and covering them (Reid; Lyons).\n          Since one strategy for gaining large audiences is the creation of portals -\n          - large Websites that keep surfers within the confines of a single\n          company's site by providing content -- this is the logic behind the\n          AOL/Time-Warner merger though both companies have clearly been\n          unsuccessful at precisely such attempts. AOL seems to hope that Time-\n          Warner will act as its content specialist, providing the type of\n          compelling material that will make users want to use AOL, whereas Time-\n          Warner seems to hope that AOL will become its privileged pipeline to the\n          hearts and minds of untold millions. Neither has a coherent view of the\n          audience, how it behaves, or should behave. Consequently, their efforts\n          have a distinctly \"unmanaged\" and slighly inexplicable air to them, as\n          though everyone were simultaneously hopeful and clueless. \n        While one might argue that the stage is set to capitalise on the audience\n          as commodity, there are indications that the success of such an approach\n          is far from guaranteed. First, the AOL/Time-Warner/EMI transaction, merely\n          by existing, has sparked conflicts over proprietary rights. For example,\n          the Recording Industry Association of America, representing Sony,\n          Universal, BMG, Warner and EMI, recently launched a $6.8 billion lawsuit\n          against MP3.com -- an AOL subsidiary -- for alleged copyright violations.\n          Specifically, MP3.com is being sued for selling digitized music over the\n          Internet without paying royalties to the record companies (Anderson). A\n          similar lawsuit has recently been launched over the issue of re-\n          broadcasting television programs over the Internet. The major US networks\n          have joined together against Canadian Internet company iCravetv for the\n          unlawful distribution of content. Both the iCravetv and the MP3.com cases\n          show how dominant media players can marshal their forces to protect\n          proprietary rights in both content and distribution. \n        Since software and media industries have failed to recreate the Internet\n          in the image of traditional broadcasting, the merger of the dominant\n          players in each industry makes sense. However, their simultaneous failure\n          to secure proprietary rights reflects both the competitive nature of the\n        \"new media economy\" and the weakness of the marketing view of the\n          audience. \n        Media Audience as Public\n        It is often said that communication produces social cohesion. From such\n          cohesion communities emerge on which political or social orders can be\n          constructed. The power of social cohesion and attachment to group symbols\n          can even create a sense of belonging to a \"people\" or nation (Deutsch). \n        Sociologist Daniel Bell described how the mass media helped create an\n          American culture simply by addressing a large enough audience. He\n          suggested that on the evening of 7 March 1955, when one out of every two\n          Americans could see Mary Martin as Peter Pan on television, a kind of\n          social revolution occurred and a new American public was born. \"It was the\n          first time in history that a single individual was seen and heard at the\n          same time by such a broad public\" (Bell, quoted in Mattelart 72). One\n          could easily substitute the 1953 World Series or the birth of little Ricky\n          on I Love Lucy. \n        The desire to document such a process recurs with the Internet. Internet\n          communities are based on the assumption that a common experience \"creates\"\n          group cohesion (Rheingold; Jones). However, as a mass medium, the Internet\n          has yet to find its originary moment, that event to which all could\n          credibly point as the birth of something genuine and meaningful. A recent\n          contender was the appearance of Paul McCartney at the refurbished Cavern\n          Club in Liverpool. On Tuesday, 14 December 1999, McCartney played to a\n          packed club of 300 fans, while another 150,000 watched on an outdoor\n          screen nearby. MSN arranged to broadcast the concert live over the\n          Internet. It advertised an anticipated global audience of 500 million.\n          Unfortunately, there was such heavy Internet traffic that the system was\n          unable to accommodate more than 3 million people. Servers in the United\n          Kingdom were so congested that many could only watch the choppy video\n          stream via an American link. \n        The concert raises a number of questions about \"virtual\" events. We can\n          draw several conclusions about measuring Internet audiences. While 3\n          million is a sizeable audience for a 20 minute transmission, by\n          advertising a potential audience of 500 million, MSN showed remarkably\n          poor judgment of its inherent appeal. \n        The Internet is the first medium that allows access to unprocessed\n          material or information about events to be delivered to an audience with\n          neither the time constraints of broadcast media nor the space limitations\n          of the traditional press. This is often cited as one of the\n          characteristics that sets the Internet apart from other media. This feeds\n          the idea of the Internet audience as a participatory, democratic public.\n          For example, it is often claimed that the Internet can foster democratic\n          participation by providing voters with uninterpreted information about\n          candidates and issues (Selnow). However, as James Curran argues, the very\n          process of distributing uninterrupted, unfiltered information, at least in\n          the case of traditional mass media, represents an abdication of a central\n          democratic function -- that of watchdog to power (Curran). In the end,\n          publics are created and maintained through active and continuous\n          participation on the part of communicators and audiences. \n        The Internet holds together potentially conflicting communicative\n          relationships within the same technological medium (Merrill &amp; Ogan).\n          Viewing the audience as co-participant in a communicative relationship\n          makes more sense than simply focussing on the Internet audience as either\n          an aggregate of consumers or a passively constructed symbolic public. \n        Audience as Relationship\n        Many scholars have shifted attention from the producer to the audience as\n          an active participant in the communication process (Ang; McQuail,\n          Audience). Virginia Nightingale goes further to describe the audience as\n          part of a communicative relationship. Nightingale identifies four factors\n          in the relationship between audiences and producers that emphasize their\n          co-dependency. The audience and producer are engaged in a symbiotic\n          relationship in which consumption and use are necessary but not sufficient\n          explanations of audience relations. The notion of the audience invokes, at\n          least potentially, a greater range of activities than simply use or\n          consumption. Further, the audience actively, if not always consciously,\n          enters relationships with content producers and the institutions that\n          govern the creation, distribution and exhibition of content (Nightingale\n          149-50). \n        Others have demonstrated how this relationship between audiences and\n          producers is no longer the one-sided affair characterised by the marketing\n          model or the model of the audience as public. A global culture is emerging\n          based on critical viewing skills. Kavoori calls this a reflexive mode born\n          of an increasing familiarity with the narrative conventions of news and an\n          awareness of the institutional imperatives of media industries (Kavoori).\n          Given the sophistication of the emergent global audience, a theory that\n          reduces new media audiences to a set of consumer preferences or behaviours\n          will inevitably prove inadequate, just as it has for understanding\n          audience behavior in old media. Similarly, by ignoring those elements of\n          audience behavior that will be easily transported to the Web, we run the\n          risk of idealising the Internet as a medium that will create an illusory,\n          pre-technological public. \n        Conclusion\n        There is an understandable confusion between the two models of the\n          audience that appear in the examples above. The \"new economy\" will have\n          to come to terms with sophisticated audiences. Contrary to IBM's claim\n          that they want to \"get to know all about you\", Internet users do not seem\n          particularly interested in becoming a perpetual source of market\n          information. The fragmented, autonomous audience resists attempts to lock\n          it into proprietary relationships. \n        Internet hypesters talk about creating publics and argue that the\n          Internet recreates the intimacy of community as a corrective to the\n          atomisation and alienation characteristic of mass society. This faith in\n          the power of a medium to create social cohesion recalls the view of the\n          television audience as a public constructed by the common experience of\n          watching an important event. However, MSN's McCartney concert indicates\n          that creating a public from spectacle it is not a simple process. In fact,\n          what the Internet media conglomerates seem to want more than anything is\n          to create consumer bases. \n        Audiences exist for pleasure and by the desire to be entertained. As\n          Internet media institutions are established, the cynical view of the\n          audience as a source of consumer behavior and preferences will inevitably\n          give way, to some extent, to a view of the audience as participant in\n          communication. Audiences will be seen, as they have been by other media,\n          as groups whose attention must be courted and rewarded. Who knows, maybe\n          the AOL/Time-Warner merger might, indeed, signal the new medium's coming\n          of age. \n        \n          \n        References\n        \nAnderson, Lessley. \"To Beam or Not to Beam.

    "title": "Virtual Domesticity",
    "abstract": "\n      This paper has been constructed in a variety of working environments; some physical, some virtual, some merely perceptual. At an ever increasing rate, both work and leisure for the informationally-overexposed in contemporary, \"post-modern\" western cultures are taking place in a heterogeneous assemblage of working and living environments. At this point, I want to specifically consider the personal computer as a domestic space, one that mirrors, oddly and specifically, the ways that we relate to our own personal living spaces. I'm considering the domestic because I want to get away from some of the more outlandish configurations of virtual spaces in critical writing.\n      These configurations in such writing tend to suggest that virtual spaces are utopian and transform our relationships with mundane reality. The mirroring I want to talk about is instead an illustration of the way we incorporate the virtual with the real in quite prosaic ways. \n      One of the traditional conceptualisations of the divide between the private and the public sphere is to consider it as a distinction between play and work, although obviously this kind of distinction has the greatest currency when gender roles are highly specified in different spheres (and indeed the notion of culture as a bifurcated structure at all has less currency in postmodernity). The personal computer, being a multi-purpose computational and communication system, is capable of taking on many roles, depending on how its software infrastructure has been furnished. The kinds of distinctions we impose on its use have much stronger interactions at the wider cultural level. In Europe and in countries such as Australia and New Zealand, the so-called \"personal home computer\" of the 1980s held a much greater sway over the domestic market than it did in the United States, simply because buyers at the time had much less invested in the distinction between machines for work and for play. But shifting working patterns have forced machines that can do the work to go into places where they might not have been accepted before. And the clear distinctions of usage (work vs. play) have begun to blur in quite complex ways. But certain aspects of a computer's function have not quite managed to catch up... \n      Despite the now unremarkable ubiquity of the personal computer in the home, the metaphors for data organisation in modern operating systems are clearly evolved from business office layouts. Discrete packages of information are \"files\", organised into \"folders\", \"directories\", or \"drawers\". Graphical User Interface (GUI) based operating systems further the metaphor, drawing files as sheets of paper with the corner folded, stored in manilla folders or filing cabinet drawers, which are accessed from a \"desktop\". These metaphorical associations of data types and programs suit the corporate office environment rather better, it could be argued, than the domestic environment, regardless of whatever actual use the computer is put to at home. \n      I want to parallel two quite distinct and seemingly very different activities, by way of an illustration of how we arrange our data and our personal lives. The first is moving house. The second is re-installing Windows. Long time computer users will know what I'm talking about here, but for other, more fortunate types, I'll explain. \n      The Windows operating system for PCs controls everything about the computer, from the way a piece of software can save data to the hard drive, to making sure the cursor and the mouse are in sync. Before a piece of software, such as a word processor, can be used normally, it must be copied to the hard drive of the computer and made to communicate with the operating system. This, in Windows, involves the operating system registering the location and function of every file that makes the software work. The more programs the user adds, the more this \"registry\" gets filled up, and the greater the chance that the data held in the registry breaks in some way. Eventually, the operating system grinds to a halt, and the computer seems barely functional. At which point, the only solution is to save all the user's data to a separate location, wipe the contents of the hard drive, and reloading all the software, starting with the operating system. This process is intensely tedious, and occasionally disastrous. Sometimes, programs only work due to very precise and unrepeatable combinations of driver software. Occasionally, the user might forget to back up all their data, and lose important files. Idiosyncratic settings that give the machine a unique personality for the user will invariably vanish. \n      There can be any number of important reasons for moving house, but typically they don't involve the fact that the owner has broken the old one. However, in some way, the house is less fit for residence than it was previously. So it is with a computer re-installation. The level of psychic trauma associated with a move may be far greater than that with a reformat, but it is quantitatively, not qualitatively so. And just as a new house can be a breath of fresh air (even literally), a newly installed operating system will seem to fly through activities that it once wheezed through, even if the underlying hardware is the same. \n      A computer is a domestic space for power-users. It has to be cleaned, maintained, customised and made unique. Like a house, it is a text that has inscribed on it every change and renovation that the occupant has seen fit to implement within it. Although the metaphors of operating systems encourage us to think of data structures as we think of office stationary and equipment, the context of the usage and the attachments we form with these abstract structures colour the way we construct their environments. This is even starting to feed into the design of user interfaces. Music software is increasingly beginning to resemble hi-fi gear in its graphical designs. Image viewers have control panels like VCRs. I don't think that this can be reduced to a notion of form following function. Often these new interfaces actually get in the way of efficient operation of the software. But considered semiotically, they relate very strongly to our patterns of interaction with living environments. \n     Computers are tremendously widespread in western nations, and yet we are in a transitional period. They are colonising domestic spaces, creating new forms of spatiality that are domestic but both physical and virtualised. Moves have been underway for several years to bring this colonisation to an apotheosis, a state of ubiquitous computing, whereby computers become seamlessly and invisibly integrated into all domestic and working environments. Early attempts have included the \"WebTV\" project, a mostly unsuccessful attempt to turn the TV into an Internet browser. If such a change does come about, it will almost certainly transform the way we interact with our computing technology again, and this time, in unrecognisable ways. \n          \n     References\n     \n Poole, Steven.

    "abstract": "\n      'Let me give you an analogy; analogies, it is true, decide nothing, but they can make one feel more at home.'\n      -- Sigmund Freud, New Introductory Lectures 72 (1933)\n      This paper emerged from a larger study of Freud's view of culture, which used elements of Freud's own way of proceeding to mount a critique of the elaboration of that view. It is proposed here that the use of analogy is foundational to Freud's procedure in building his model of the mind, rather than just a temporary means to an end, and, crucially, that Freud is himself unaware of both the necessity of the analogical move and also of his desire for it. The creation of the concept of the Freudian psyche is a rhetorical tour de force, a structure made of figures of speech, the chief among which is the analogy. Freud constructs an analogy between culture and mind: what is left of his theory of both if this rhetorical connexion is removed? \n      In the opening pages of one of his last works Freud considers the problem of the interpretation of culture, and he concludes that there too it is a question of getting the patient on the couch: '... one is justified [he writes] in attempting to discover a psychoanalytic -- that is, a genetic explanation ...' -- in that psychoanalysis is a method of explaining the origins of present condition of such things as states of mind, to which culture more generally is analogous (Civilization 65). Understanding may be an end in itself, but there may be a more practical purpose in bringing psychoanalysis to bear: a culture may become sick, neurotic, and psychoanalysis may be able to play a part in understanding the nature of the problem, if not also in treating it. Civilization and Its Discontents concludes with the idea that 'we may expect that one day someone will venture to embark upon a pathology of cultural communities' (144). \n      What Freud has to say about culture can be read, I propose, on a number of levels. The smallest elements which begin to reveal meaning -- which are capable of being differentiated in a meaningful way, and therefore analysed as texts -- are parapraxes and the minute revelations of the psychoanalytic techniques of free association and dream analysis. A second level of text is that produced by a unitary, identified 'author', such as Wilhelm Jensen's Gradiva, or Leonardo da Vinci's Virgin with St Anne. An epoch, such as Freud's Civilization (and its Discontents), and then his view of a species (as in Totem and Taboo), each with its own teleology, form texts of a higher order. \n      My engagement with Freud here is with his method of argument by analogy. On some occasions he makes explicit the extent to which he is dependent on (flexible!) analogies of the description of his method -- as when he writes this in The Question of Lay Analysis:\n      \n        'In psychology we can only describe things by the help of analogies. There is nothing peculiar in this, it is the case elsewhere as well. But we have constantly to keep changing these analogies, for none of them lasts us long enough. (195) \n      \n      In a key moment in The Psychopathology of Everyday Life, he again explicitly uses analogy instead of argument, writing: 'Instead of a discussion, however, I shall bring forward an analogy to deal with the objection' (21). This is a point at which he is dealing with the reason for the forgetting of names, and although he is not yet prepared to indicate what is in his view the precise reason for this (namely: repression), he wishes to persuade his reader to stay with him; and so he inserts a narrative about what we would now call a mugging, an event with just the right combination of violence and yet familiarity to allow readers to accept that such things happen but that the agents are usually unknown. That he is confident of the efficacy of this procedure is indicated by that fact that he uses the same analogy again in the Lecture 3 of the Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis (40-59). \n      Although Freud uses analogy -- as a comparison between two separate and distinct and different things -- what he is most interested in is primary process. This is a mode of thinking which may be capable of an awareness of the differences between things, but is more interested in their confluences (overdetermination and condensation), and their similarities and ability to replace each other (displacement). I suggest that analogy is actually primary process subjected to 'secondary revision', and that Freud is himself unaware of the source of his recurrent need to use analogy. \n      Consider also the 'Slovakia' example in Lecture 23 of the New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis, in which Freud is extrapolating his division of the mind into the three parts: super-ego, ego and id, the 'three realms, regions, provinces, into which we divide an individual's mental apparatus...' He introduces this in a characteristically persuasive way: 'Let me give you an analogy; analogies, it is true, decide nothing, but they can make one feel more at home' (New Introductory Lectures 72). He then proceeds to a brief description of some of the characteristics of (what is now) Slovakia, in which German, Magyars and Slovaks live, in which there are three kinds of topography and also three groups of industry. He constructs the image partly to demonstrate the complexity of the interrelationships of the parts of the mental apparatus (and partly to have a shot at the powers that at Versailles divided up parts of Europe), and to show that the assignment of distinct names to them tends to obscure the way in which they in fact overlap and interact. However, what the analogy powerfully imports is the 'naturalness', indeed the inevitability, of the division into three. Despite the argument actually being that this division is in fact not clear-cut, it nevertheless implies the necessity of the division. So that his audience is all the more ready the accept the tripartite model of the mind. \n      We could analyse this analogy between the two 'geographies' somewhat in the way that Freud would examine the account of a dream. Firstly, there are the day's residues: in this case his experiences in growing up in this part of Europe together with his reflections on the politics of defining a nation. Then we see the conflation of the two different realms of human experience, political geography and metapsychology; and the displacement of the one set of structures for the other. There is also the overdetermination of the tripartite structures: German, Magyars, Slovaks; hills, plains, lakes; cattle, cereals, fish; superego, ego, id. Finally an instance of secondary revision can be clearly seen in the conclusion of Freud's demonstration. \n      If the partitioning could be neat and clear-cut like this, a Woodrow Wilson would be delighted by it; it would also be convenient for a lecture in a geography lesson. The probability is, however, that you will find less orderliness and more missing, if you travel through the region. ... A few things are naturally as you expected, for fish cannot be caught in the mountains and wine does not grow in the water. Indeed, the picture of the region that you brought with you may on the whole fit the facts; but you will have to put up with deviations in the details. (New Introductory Lectures 73) \n      The implication for my analogy (with dream-analysis) is clearly that there will be a slippage between the different meanings of the images as the process of overdetermination tries to get each to do different work at the same time, and certain elements will have to be refined or retuned, whether in the service of more or less precise relation. \n      A final point might be made, while still on the topic of Slovakia. Freud is, as we have seen, critical to some extent of the political-geographical situation that he receives and describes in his image. The reference to the American president suggests that there might have been a better way to carry out the partition, and certainly events in the region in our own very recent past suggest that this is so. Freud, however, is ultimately accepting of many of the aspects of the picture. He takes the different kinds of primary industry as givens: agriculture, viticulture, and the human culture implied in the national names. The fact that an outsider like Wilson might get it wrong only makes clearer the implication that received political geography is meaningful and in some senses right. This is an example of a cultural unconscious about which Freud does not speak because he cannot. It is not that his assumption about this matter, that which is taken-for-granted, is unthinkable: it is unsayable, something which is outside consciousness because it is so taken-for-granted. This kind of unconscious, which I am calling a kind of cultural unconscious for want of a better term -- and perhaps a notion of the 'non-conscious' might be more accurate -- simply cannot be accommodated by consciousness.   \n      Here Freud was appealing to geography to make his point. He far more often appeals to the authority of literature. To give a crude example, it is well known that it was the essay on nature -- thought at one time to be by Goethe -- which is supposed to have been the spur that pricked the side of Freud's intent and actually drove him into what was to become psychoanalysis. So literature not only has an inspirational effect for him, but is also evidence of the interpenetration of Freud's mind -- his way of thinking by analogy and citation -- and the culture of which he is the recipient, and in which he is caught up. \n      If analogy is essential to Freud's theory, rather than just part of its explication (and space has permitted mention of only a few instances) -- if analogy functions as the clasps that hold together the new clothes of the Emperor of Psychoanalysis - what happens when the clasps are removed? \n          \n       References\n      \n References to the works of Freud in English refer by volume to the Standard Edition (SE):\n      Freud, Sigmund.

    "title": "THE VIRTUAL UNIVERSITY AS 'TIMELY AND ACCURATE INFORMATION'",
    "abstract": "This article investigates the implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning System in a redbrick university in the UK. The first part is concerned with the way in which the implementation project team has come to conceptualize its task or mission and represent it both to itself and to the rest of the university. On one hand, the discussion is about the rolling-out of a rather mundane information system, purchased simply as a replacement for an out of date system called 'MAC'. On the other, for some people, the system amounts to a large, and complex - almost mythical - model of the university, a kind of 'virtual university'. Specifically,the article is interested in one particular phrase, script, or mantra that appears over and over as the accepted rationale, mission and justification for the project: the 'provision of timely and accurate information'. It is argued that the phrase helps to mediate the boundary between how the project team and others understand the university as a whole, and the ways in which it is, could be, and should be changing. The second part of the article is focused on the way in which those implementing the new system are attempting to move the university from an old (seemingly 'chaotic') model to a new (supposedly 'ordered') 'informational model'.",

    "title": "THE USE OF THE INTERNET AMONG ACADEMIC GAY COMMUNITIESIN TAIWAN : AN EXPLORATORY STUDY",
    "abstract": "The rise of the internet has tremendous impacts on homosexual communities in Taiwan. The internet has created a medium where homosexual people can form virtual communities to seek for emotional support without fearing the disclosure of their sexual preferences and causing unwanted negative consequences. The internet has become a medium where homosexual communities can share information with each other and voice their concerns to the public. Thus, the internet may become what Ithiel de Sola Pool (1984) called 'the technology of freedom' for homosexual communities. The purposes of this paper are set to discuss whether academic homosexual individuals perceive the internet to be more fair and impartial in terms of news reporting than traditional mass media and to investigate why they use the internet. This paper employs a questionnaire survey method to collect data for the questions. The quantitative analysis of survey data (N=701), from a self-completed questionnaire using modified snowball sampling of gays and lesbians from Taiwan. Principal component analysis with varimax rotation led to seven factors that account for 66.31% of the variance. These factors are social interaction and information, entertainment and relaxation, personal revelation, preference, privacy and escapism, pass time and, novelty-seeking. Correlation analyses also suggested that respondents' demographics, internet usage frequency and, time are associated with their use motivation. As an exploratory study of an academic homosexual population and their internet use behaviour in Taiwan, this study raised more questions than it intended to answer. The use of individual media by this group needs further study.",

    "abstract": "This article argues that the changes characterized by many commentators as announcing the ‘information age’ are better seen, not as heralding a new type of society, but as the continuation, consolidation and extension of capitalism – something which is accompanied by constant upheaval and innovation. The shift from conceiving the ‘information society’ as a result of technological breakthroughs to one which lays emphasis on the primacy of ‘information’ itself is observed. The importance especially of informational labour’s ‘flexibility’ is regarded, not as indicative of a new age but of the requirements of globalized capitalism which engenders change the better to consolidate its practices. The instability of life today is ascribed, not to the upheavals resulting from the ‘information revolution’, but rather to the insatiable dynamic that has long been a distinguishing feature of capitalist enterprise. These processes are examined in terms of the shift from public to private provision of information and in the heightened uncertainty of existence today.",

    "title": "ON THE NATURE OF FUTURE WORLDS? - CONSIDERATIONS OF VIRTUALITY AND UTOPIAS",
    "abstract": "It has been a widespread belief that computers can create viable utopias, design the future and plan and co-ordinate things such that the world can be born anew. The exponential increase in computing power has allowed for interaction in imaginary places – utopian spaces – and the endless re-configuration of those places. There are then good reasons to make links between the realm of the virtual and the creation of utopian and future worlds. We explore some of these links in this article. Having offered a preliminary discussion of the nature of traditional utopian and future world thinking, we then draw a distinction between stable state and flexible utopias, the former characterized by structurally fixed blueprints, the latter by the possibilities of virtual technologies which allow us endlessly to re-configure virtual spaces. This distinction leads us on to a debate that is implicit in the writings of Sherry Turkle and Richard Coyne, namely the analysis of the virtual from a Husserlian, as opposed to the dominant Heideggerian view. We defend a Husserlian analysis which, it is shown, better satisfies the concept of ‘flexible utopias’. The totalizing existential experience by a Heideggerian analysis corresponds well to ‘immersion’ technologies e.g. games and VR, utopias as ready-mades but, a Husserlian approach allows us to account for the creative process of making utopian or future worlds using software such as interior design when one changes items ad infinitum as part of the normal practices of being a designer. In the conclusion we will pull together the strands of the article and, end by noting how the contemporary theorist, Robert Nozick complements our arguments when he offers a version of utopia as a meta-utopia of flexible utopias or future worlds!",

    "title": "‘INFORMATION SOCIETY’ AS THEORY OR IDEOLOGY: A CRITICAL PERSPECTIVE IN TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT IN THE INFORMATION AGE",
    "abstract": "This paper argues that the concept of Information Society fails as theory because it is internally incoherent and unsupported by evidence. Its current popularity within policy discourse can only be understood ideologically. In particular it is argued that one of the drivers of current policy towards higher education is based upon the supposed growth of knowledge work linked to a theory of human capital formation as crucial to international competitiveness and to an explanation of unemployment in terms of a skills gap. The paper goes on to argue that current labour market indicators and research into the skills gap do not support this policy thrust and that a better explanation of the current push towards the creation of virtual universities is the desire to cut educational labour costs rather than to upgrade the economic status of so-called knowledge workers.",

    "title": "PROMOTING SCHOLARSHIP THROUGH DESIGN",
    "abstract": "How can new media positively transform scholarly practices? One possible way is for scholarly archives such as e-journals and digital libraries to better support the needs and practices of their users, instead of the publishing process. This article examines what it might mean to promote cognitive and social aspects of 'scholarship' through innovative archive design. Design requirements for supporting both scholarly tasks and scholarly communities are derived by analysing existing cognitive and social theories. A theoretical framework for guiding archive design is introduced: the contextually enriched document framework. This framework suggests that: document interfaces should enable practitioners to progressively enrich documents with important contextual information arising from social processes; and archive managers should engage in proactive practices to facilitate use and assist practitioners in realizing the benefits of the new technology. Both the design requirements and the framework are illustrated with examples from an existing electronic journal - The Journal of Interactive Media in Education .",

    "abstract": "The legal context in which universities operate is among the forces shaping the ways in which new information technologies are taken up and used. In the USA, constitutional law - that law which addresses how society is to be structured and what types of processes should be permitted within it - is particularly important in determining what institutions can do. The ultimate arbiter of constitutional law is the US Supreme Court, the decisions of which establish basic principles for the US legal system. This article reviews the entire body of US Supreme Court decisions that deal with higher education and mines them for their implications for the use of new information technologies by universities.",

The USA, therefore, is a particularly unique setting for an examination of the rhetoric associated with the politics of adopting online learning technologies. This paper examines the context of the US on-line learning system with a particular focus on those aspects of the movement which appeal so keenly to Americans. Certain values are expressed in this movement which are almost uniquely American such as democracy, freedom, efficiency, independence, the vocational nature of education, and meritocratic schemes for education as a sorting mechanism for the society.",

    "abstract": "Decisions about distance education are made too often without adequately considering the broader institutional context. This paper explores how a better understanding of 'macro' contexts can lead to more successful choices at the 'micro' level of designing and developing specific programmes. Six models derived from distance learning practices are examined. Analyses of these experiences highlight three primary institutional and political characteristics that have a critical influence on distance education outcomes: private or public emphasis; degree of dedication to distance learning; and holistic or incremental strategy. Three secondary dimensions are also discussed: technology mix; financial and production models; and target markets.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an overview of the development of new media in the secondary and higher education systems of the European Union (EU) and USA. A combination of driving forces in pedagogical thinking, technological progress and business models have raised new expectations for the wide-spread use of educational technology, such as by providing major market opportunities as in the adult training segment. Many public sector and private commercial initiatives for connecting schools to the Internet, first adopted in the USA, and then in member states of the EU, have met with marked success. Most of the secondary schools are, or are being, wired, if but to a limited extent. The diffusion of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the EU schools is particularly rapid given their initially low penetration rate. If American organizations are indeed leading the development of online courses and programmes in the higher education sector, European universities have now realized the importance of investing in this field. However, for new media to significantly improve the educational process in the EU and in the USA, they must be embodied in the complex school or university environment, and be nurtured by new partnerships between business and the academy.",

    "abstract": "This paper traces the use of the World Wide Web as a medium of political communication during the 1996 American presidential campaigns. Beginning with the Republican campaigns’ use of the medium during the primary election season, a typology of uses of the web is outlined. While all campaigns felt it necessary to participate in the World Wide Web, different candidates used the medium differently. Furthermore, no campaign made full use of the much-publicized interactive capacity of the web; they used it more as a new means of transmitting traditional mass-media literature (video, graphics, etc.) and as a way of providing access to large volumes of campaign information (voting records, speeches, position papers, etc.).",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses the impact of 'computer mediated communication' (or CMC) on political activism and social movements. CMC may be expected to affect collective action by improving the effectiveness of communication and facilitating collective identity and solidarity. However, the heterogeneity of social movements undermines generic arguments and their relationship to CMC. Accordingly, the potential consequences of CMC on three different types of political organizations are discussed: organizations mobilizing mainly participatory resources, organizations focusing on professional resources, and transnational networks. The potential to build 'virtual [social movement] communities' seems highest among sympathizers of movement organizations who act professionally on behalf of causes with vast resonance among the public opinion and low radical potential. All in all, the most distinctive contribution of CMC to social movements still seems to be instrumental rather than symbolic. Existing bonds and solidarities are likely to generate more effective mobilization attempts than was the case before the diffusion of CMC; it is more disputable though as to whether CMC may create brand new social ties where there were none.",

    "title": "INFORMATION INTERDEPENDENCE: Keohane and Nye's complex interdependence in the information age",
    "abstract": "A well-known and respected attempt to theorize interdependence in the field of international relations is complex interdependence. In Power and Interdependence , Robert O. Keohane and Joseph S. Nye, Jr define interdependence as reciprocal effects among actors resulting from 'international transactions - flows of money, goods, people and messages across international boundaries'. Though much research has been done on the effects of interdependence on the first three, the flows of messages have been studied less often. Keohane and Nye addressed the issue in a 1998 article in Foreign Affairs , discussing changes in the global environment resulting from the information age which have had an impact on their ideas. This article proposes to go deeper into complex interdependence. The world is becoming increasingly 'information interdependent' and this essay is an attempt to apply the assumptions and concepts presented in complex interdependence to the information age. In the final analysis, complex interdependence complements research from the field of communications, that information flows should be understood as underlying mechanisms and processes that facilitate contextual understanding of issues. It maintains the integrity of the assumptions of complex interdependence, while adding an understanding of the nature of information and information flows.",

    "title": "THE INFORMATION SOCIETY AS MEGA-MACHINE",
    "abstract": "Too often the history of information and communication technologies (ICTs) is wrenched out of the history of technology and presented as something altogether separate and therefore different, rendering previous analyses irrelevant. However, there are sufficient analytical tools to hand without the continual invention of new paradigms to understand the current stage of technological advance. To support this contention, in this article, the continuing relevance of Lewis Mumford is explored. Mumford's discussion of the megalopolis and the emergence of the invisible city as its most developed state make a direct link with the networked information society, establishing a link between the information society and Mumford'sanalysis of the previous history of technology.At the centre of Mumford'sdiscussion of this history is the dialectic interaction of authoritarian and democratic technics. Mumford's notion of technics stresses that technologies can not be divided from the social relations in which they appear. In the information society,this dialectical pair map onto the twin dynamics of enclosure and disclosure. The former dynamic represents the control of information through commodification and marketization, the latter the recognition of the empowering and emancipatory qualities of ICTs. Up until now,discussions of the information society have regarded only one or other dynamic as normal, whereas utilizing Mumford'sinsight, the contradictory character of the information society can be theorized without rendering the second dynamic abnormal. Thus, the article concludes that recourse to Mumford's ideas, to re-embed ICTs in the history of technology, allows a more nuanced and fruitful treatment of current developments in information society.",

    "title": "THE VIRTUAL UNIVERSITY IS . . . THE UNIVERSITY MADE CONCRETE?",
    "abstract": "The application of information and communications technologies (ICTs) to higher education has recently gained a new impetus, fired by the promise, and also perhaps the threat, of the 'virtual' university. While there has been much empirical research on individual ICT initiatives, most of this has been narrowly evaluative with little attention paid to their cumulative impacts on the university as an institution. Equally, while there has been much writing on the development of virtual higher education, much of this has been speculative, concerned with the advent of still marginal new institutions and little of it has been empirically grounded. This paper is based on in-depth studies of ICT initiatives in four established universities in the North East of England. It argues that one of the consequences, often unintended, of the introduction of these technologies has been to generate demands and pressures for a more corporate institutional form in which goals, roles, identities and procedures are made explicit and standardized across the institution. To the degree that these demands are met, the result appears to be that the closer that institutions move towards the goal of becoming a virtual university, the more corporate, or 'concrete', their institutional form becomes.",

This is done by considering arguments for: (i) a global human right initiative in respect of global media conglomerates; (ii) technological change in respect of digital cultures; and (iii) the arrival of what Castells'shas described as the culture of 'real virtuality'. These views and perspectives are assessed in terms of the contributions they are likely to make towards what I call a 'cautious cosmopolitanism'. Finally I seek to make some definite policy recommendations that might help foster conditions in which cosmopolitan democracy could flourish.",

    "title": "VIRTUAL COMMUNITY CARE? SOCIAL POLICY AND THE EMERGENCE OF COMPUTER MEDIATED SOCIAL SUPPORT",
    "abstract": "This article argues that the emergence and growth of internet use in Britain has important implications for the analysis of social policy. It attempts to outline a research agenda for social policy in relation to one particular aspect of internet use, that of on-line self-help and social support – what we term here virtual-community care . The article presents data on patterns of home based internet use in Britain and outlines some contemporary debates in social policy about the importance of self-help and social support. It also considers how the internet is being used for self-help and social support with a particular emphasis on the emerging situation in Britain. Three illustrations of on-line self-help and social support are presented: two from newsgroups, which are part of the ‘uk.people.* hierarchy’: one concerned with disability and one with parenting issues; and one web based forum concerned with issues surrounding mortgage repossession. Drawing upon this illustrative material the article discusses some emergent issues for contemporary social policy discourse: the rise of self-help groups; the privileging of lay knowledge and experience over the ‘expert’ knowledge of health and welfare professionals; the nature of professional-client relationships; the quality and legitimacy of advice, information and support; dis/empowerment; and social exclusion.",

    "title": "PROXIMITY POLITICS",
    "abstract": "'Proximity politics' refers to a certain set of new political–cultural problems and issues that the globalization process confronts us with. Specifically it refers to the sort of engagements globalization entails as it draws us all closer together: both 'structurally', via the complex institutional interconnections of globalization, and 'phenomenologically' via the sort of experienced proximity that is provided in time-space bridging technologies – particularly communications and media technologies. The article contends that this 'relational closeness' – in a complex set of interactive modalities which do not abolish, but, in some contexts, actually intensify cultural differences – presents its own distinct order of politics. It attempts to map some of this emergent terrain, focusing on some recent debates about cosmopolitanism . Here it explores, for instance, problems of conflicting cultural-political principle thrown up by the structural impact of enforced proximity: principles of universalism and humanism vs the demands of cultural difference; ethical interventionism vs the principle of sovereignty; 'global governance' vs the claims of localism. It concludes, optimistically, by suggesting that the grosser fears of incompatibility of such principles may often be exaggerated and that there is, in fact, a good deal of room for (at least theoretical) manoeuvre on the emergent terrain of cosmopolitan politics.",

    "abstract": "For-profit firms use the internet to offer classes, courses and degree programmes in direct competition with nonprofit and government-supported colleges and universities. At the same time, many firms seek to partner with academic institutions in offering online instruction or distance learning.This paper outlines and discusses alternative models of academic/for-profit collaboration that are being developed in the USA. Collaboration requires the partners to define responsibilities for technology, administrative services, content development, promotion and student selection, instruction, awarding of credits and overall quality control. Firms may want to 'unbundle' the traditional faculty role of both course designer and teacher,and use different professionals for the two functions. Although most collaborations today involve non-degree programmes, many schools of business are working with for-profit firms to offer MBA degrees online. The diversity of higher education in the USA means that many different models will be tried. Collaborations will expand the markets for online distance learning, but a number of difficult issues remain to be resolved.",

    "abstract": "Many people believe that information technology will bring massive structural changes to the university. This paper draws on concepts from both computer science and social theory to explore what these structural changes might be like. The point of departure is the observation that the interaction between information technology and market economics creates incentives to standardize the world. Standardization can be a force for good or evil, depending on how it is done, and this paper develops normative ideas about the relation between the forces of standardization and the places in which university teaching is done. Information technology allows these places to be more diverse than in the past, and a good rule of thumb is that the places in which learning occurs should be analogous in their structure and workings to the places in which the learned knowledge will be used. Universities can support this increased diversity of learning places with appropriate structural reforms, including decentralized governance and explicit attention to certain aspects of the university organization, such as media services and the career centre, that, historically, have been marginalized.",

    "title": "IRELAND: DISTANCE EDUCATION IN AN EXPANDING DEMOCRACY",
    "abstract": "The recent and explosive development of the Irish economy has earned the Republic the popular accolade, CelticTiger . Enticed by government subsidies and tax incentives, foreign investors favour location in Ireland in order to penetrate the Single European Market (SEM). Commensurate with the demands of foreign investors for a fully developed infrastructure, the deregularization of the Irish Telecoms market (1998) has afforded new opportunities for the transformation of education and training in Ireland. This paper explores the democratizing potential of distance education within the Irish Republic. It focuses on awareness programmes and initiatives for the promotion of information technology (IT) access, and considers particular challenges in ensuring equal access to the benefits of new technologies, for all.",

However, with the advent of online learning environments, China must face a brave new world of innovation.

    "abstract": "The defining moments of traditional spatially based higher education are made up of fixed and fluid experiences. These 'moments' are now creaking as funding per student falls and the romanticized ideal of an education detached from 'real' life falters under the weight of highly variable student experiences. Distance learning in all its guises has always been regarded as inferior by those embedded in the traditional system. However more and more students demand something different from costly campus-based education. It is time for a more open discussion about the tensions between richness and reach and the role that new facilities like the Internet could play in reaching more students without wallowing in the nostalgia that often accompanies such debates.",

    "title": "FROM MEDIA POLITICS TO E-PROTEST",
    "abstract": "New forms of political expression are often taken as further evidence of the 'cultural turn' within contemporary societies. Taking two recent cases – the use of popular culture in the election campaigns of British political parties (and particularly the Labour Party) and the so-called 'Carnival Against Capital' of June 18th 1999 – this article argues for caution in assuming that such cultural modi vivendi necessarily require culturalist forms of explanation and analysis. Weargue that both established political parties and extra-parliamentary social movements have found new opportunities for political communication and mobilization through media and information technology (particularly the Internet). However, the resource and organizational problems they confront remain the same, as does the familiar instrumental rationality of their actions. Rather than leading us to abandon established analytical tools such as political intermediation, political opportunity structures or resource mobilization, shifting opportunities and conditions require the adaptation and extension of such concepts. In this spirit, we attempt to offer an analysis of the cultural mode adopted by parties and movements without losing sight of their broader goals and motivations.",

    "title": "STUDENT DISTRESS IN A WEB-BASED DISTANCE EDUCATION COURSE",
    "abstract": "Many advocates of computer-mediated distance education emphasize its positive aspects and understate the kinds of communicative and technical capabilities and work required by students and faculty. There are few systematic analytical studies of students who have experienced new technologies in higher education. This article presents a qualitative case study of a small graduate-level web-based distance education course at a major US university.This paper examines students' distressing experiences due to communication breakdowns and technical difficulties. This topic is glossed over in much of the distance education literature written for administrators, instructors and prospective students. The intent is that this study will enhance understanding of the instructional design issues, instructor and student preparation, and communication practices that are needed to improve web-based distance education courses.",

    "abstract": "New media technologies provide opportunities to expand academic curriculum offerings and enhance student learning. Yet web-based and online learning tools should not be just repurposed text and information, or videotaped faculty lectures. Instead, the web calls for the inclusion of sound, text and visuals for learning tools that provide a media-rich environment. This allows faculty to create multidimensional experiences that cater to different learning styles and provide opportunities for problem solving. Drawing on my production experiences at HBS, as well as my own experience teaching visual anthropology and creating films, videos, photographs and web products, I discuss the teaching opportunities that new technologies and media can provide.",

    "title": "THE RHETORIC OF DEMOCRACY IN INTERNATIONAL ON-LINE EDUCATION",
    "abstract": "On-line education has been heralded as the next democratizing force in education, particularly in higher education (Daniel 1996; Jones 1997). By opening access to populations which have not had access either because of geographical location, job status, or physical handicap, the rhetoric of on-line education suggests that this new technology will democratize education, breaking down the elitist walls of the ivory tower. However, it is not at all clear that the reality of implementing distance learning solutions have in fact any potential, much less actual value for democratizing higher education. Much the opposite, founded on the myth of the meritocracy, on-line education has the potential to exacerbate already intractable views of individual achievement through education as rectifying failures to meet disadvantaged populations' needs. This paper presents several cases of international on-line education and the rhetoric that surrounds its introduction. In some cases we are able to share stories of implementation of distance learning programmes or governmental promises made to those interested in distance learning. In each case, we attempt to tell a story that sheds light on the ways in which the noble goals of democracy are and aren't met in the harsh reality of on-line learning.",

    "abstract": "Universities face challenges in creating and nurturing reflective discourse about ICTs within higher education. Constraints to this discourse include time-space compression caused by ICTs, and changing perceptions of the university's role in an information society. In answering these challenges, a call is made for elevating the role of higher education in public knowledge formation. Such a move reduces the constraints of time pressures by valuing discussion and debate and the time required for these activities, and questions authority and credibility gained solely due to practical and discursive technological competency. Thus, the question is not just to explore how communications technologies are shaping our experience of time and space, but to debate how we wish to use technologies and other means to shape and create the time and space in which meaningful human social and political life is possible. Institutions of higher education should both serve as sites for public knowledge formation, and as contributors to such initiatives in civic society.",

    "abstract": "The phenomenon of rapid urbanization is posing challenges to planners in developing countries. As it becomes harder and harder for planners to disentangle the global from the local, it is increasingly recognized that without a solid local base, city governments will not have the strength that is needed to navigate global circuits. This social integration requires democratized political mechanisms based on administrative decentralization and the participation of citizens in municipal management. Our paper focuses on the role of information in the democratic process looking at a case study of new local governance structures in Bangalore. The city has become a focal point for software development regionally and globally.Such regional and global interconnections are taking place simultaneously with a number of local level initiatives aimed at encouraging democratic decisionmaking via legislation and by introducing new local governance structures.",

    "title": "WOMEN'S WORK IN THE INFORMATION ECONOMY: The case of telephone call centres",
    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the work experiences and career opportunities of women employed in technology-intensive offices known as telephone 'call centres'. Call centres have grown rapidly across Europe in recent years, creating a significant number of new jobs and receiving considerable attention within the media, business and academic communities. However, despite the fact that the majority of call centre jobs have been taken by women, researchers have so far paid little attention to their position in this new 'industry'. The article addresses this research gap. In particular, it is concerned with the question of whether call centre work is offering women new opportunities for skill development and career progression, or whether a more familiar trend is taking place in which women are being drawn into a highly routinized, 'de-skilled' and de-valued area of work. The paper also uses the specific example of call centre work in order to reflect on broader issues about the changing nature of women's work and employment in the so-called 'information economy'.",

    "abstract": "This article argues that the current universal service policies fail to appreciate first-mile issues, that is, how connectivity looks, feels, and behaves from the subscriber's perspective. For individuals and households, connectivity is not just merely a stretch of wire but an important connection that takes them out to a broader world, encapsulating network interface devices, the software, and training, as well as incentives to create content and contribute to the community. Universal service should represent the sum total of the capabilities that extend users into the networked nation, rather than just a \"last-mile\" collection of vendor-related concerns and constraints.",

A method is outlined for employing information indicators to observe or measure the information environment.",

    "title": "Tapping User-Driven Innovation: A New Rationale for Universal Service",
    "abstract": "The current transformation of communication policies, as governments turn to the marketplace as the driver of network evolution, requires a redefinition of universal service. The debate so far has focused primarily on the elaboration of new funding mechanisms and the definition of which services should be covered. We argue that a more fundamental, third area demands attention: the articulation of a new rationale for universal service itself. Without articulating a clear justification for universal service, designing its scope and funding mechanisms is problematic at best. Past justifications rested on welfare (make telephony affordable to all) and network externalities (increase the network?s value by widening its reach). Increasingly, these need to be complemented by a new rationale based on the innovative potential of universal service. This article explores how universal service can fuel innovation-driven economic growth.",

    "abstract": "Are new Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) such as the Internet and the World Wide Web a boon to poor countries and poor people around the globe, enabling them to leapfrog their underdevelopment and become equal partners in an emerging global order? Or, have the new technologies , introduced into an asymmetric global system, already become an engine of greater social inequality? There are few questions more important to the evolution of the global system, and few questions on which there is less agreement. Yes, the new ICTs are unequivocally an engine of inequality, according to the highly respected UN Development Program’s (UNDP) annual publication, “The Human Development Report.” The UNDP  nds that, “The Internet is contributing to an ever-widening gap between rich and poor which has now reached ‘grotesque’ proportions” (UNDP Press Release, 12 July 1999, p. 1). But according to the highly respected annual “World Development Report” (WDR) of the World Bank the new ICTs are quite positive and have tremendous equalizing potential. The WDR points to dozens of stories showing that telemedicine, distance education, and falling ICT costs are having positive and dramatic impacts on the growth prospects of poor people and poor countries (Knowledge for Development, World Development Report, 1998/99). It seems that for the World Bank, the glass is more than half-full. For the UNDP, it is less than half-empty. If one thing is clear, it is that highly contested questions have bubbled to the surface regarding the impacts of the new ICTs on the poor. It is precisely at such moments that research and scholarship can make a valuable global contribution . For example, researchers can rephrase the World Bank-UNDP dispute as follows: “What will it take for countries and international organizations to achieve the positive outcomes described by the Bank and avoid the negative consequences described by the UNDP?” And,",

Our study of search engines suggests that they systematically exclude (in some cases by design and in some, accidentally) certain sites and certain types of sites in favor of others, systematically giving prominence to some at the expense of others. We argue that such biases, which would lead to a narrowing of the Web's functioning in society, run counter to the basic architecture of the Web as well as to the values and ideals that have fueled widespread support for its growth and development. We consider ways of addressing the politics of search engines, raising doubts whether, in particular, the market mechanism could serve as an acceptable corrective.",

    "abstract": "This article combines cost proxy model estimates of the cost of the public switched telephone network in Colorado with U.S. Census Bureau data on household income in Colorado to examine the possibility of paying for universal telephone service in a competitively neutral manner, without an explicit high-cost fund. Cost proxy models can provide the cost of providing telephone service by census block group, and Census Bureau data allow the calculation of mean household income by census block group. Based on these two types of data, this article shows that if telephone service were priced as a tax, and if each household in Colorado paid between 0.6% and 0.75% of their annual household income for telephone service, there would be no \"high-cost deficit.\" This article also shows that there is no correlation between household income and cost of telephone service. Thus, it is not the case that all high-cost areas are, for example, wealthy mountain communities.",

    "abstract": "The mid 1990s was a period when the development of the household market for new information and communication technologies (ICTs) was of paramount importance for producers and suppliers. The Household Information Systems project was devised to investigate whether or not discourses of convergence accompanying the development of new ICT services and products had any resonance in the lives of \"ordinary\" consumers. This article presents an overview of the research and a more general series of observations about research into the domestic consumption of new media technology. The article advocates an approach to studying new media technology that analyzes the \"full life cycle\" of technology. In practice, this means utilizing theories from a range of disciplines focusing on a number of different points in the \"cultural circuit\" within which all technology is located.",

    "abstract": "In Europe, universal service developed within a public-service-oriented institutional framework. The historical conflicts that produced these institutional arrangements are still important for national policymaking. Furthermore, the level of technological development and integration in the European Union forms the context in which decisions concerning universal service are made. Our analysis of telecommunications policies in three small European countries - Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway - shows that business actors are well networked and press for a minimal definition of universal services, whereas those actors promoting an extended definition seem to be less coordinated and therefore less successful. Hence it is unlikely that universal services will be defined more extensively in the future.",

    "abstract": "This article examines the nature of the gap in household telephone penetration among Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics. By analyzing historic and current penetration levels of the radio, television, and telephone, it suggests that most information technology gaps are amalgamations of smaller socioeconomic trends and can be discerned and reduced only with careful historical analysis of both technology choices and living patterns. It proposes localized universal service strategies, since the penetration gaps are affected by a complex array of factors more particular to localities than to the country as a whole and as such must be investigated with rigor and caution if progress toward the elimination of penetration gaps is to occur.",

    "title": "The Internet Backbone and the American Metropolis",
    "abstract": "Despite the rapid growth of advanced telecommunications services, there is a lack of knowledge about the geographic diffusion of these new technologies. The Internet presents an important challenge to communications researchers, as it threatens to redefine the production and delivery of vital services including finance, retailing, and education. This article seeks to address the gap in the current literature by analyzing the development of Internet backbone networks in the United States between 1997 and 1999. We focus upon the intermetropolitan links that have provided transcontinental data transport services since the demise of the federally subsidized networks deployed in the 1970s and 1980s. We find that a select group of seven highly interconnected metropolitan areas consistently dominated the geography of national data networks, despite massive investment in this infrastructure over the study period. Furthermore, while prosperous and internationally oriented American cities lead the nation in adopting and deploying Internet technologies, interior regions and economically distressed cities have failed to keep up. As information-based industries and services account for an increasing share of economic activity, this evidence suggests that the Internet may aggravate the economic disparities among regions, rather than level them. Although the capacity of the backbone system has slowly diffused throughout the metropolitan system, the geographic structure of interconnecting links has changed little. Finally, the continued persistence of the metropolis as the center for telecommunications networks illustrates the need for a more sophisticated understanding of the interaction between societies and technological innovations.",

Some of the key themes include the importance of social contexts and work processes, sociotechnical networks, public access to information, and social infrastructure for computing support. The article draws upon 25 years of systematic analytical and critical research about information technology and social change.",

    "title": "Refining and Extending the Business Model With Information Technology: Dell Computer Corporation",
    "abstract": "The exceptional performance of Dell Computer in recent years illustrates an innovative response to a fundamental competitive factor in the personal computer industry - the value of time. This article shows how Dell's strategies of direct sales and build-to-order production have proven successful in minimizing inventory and bringing new products to market quickly, enabling it to increase market share and achieve high returns on investment. The Dell case illustrates how one business model may have inherent advantages under particular market conditions, but it also shows the importance of execution in exploiting those advantages. In particular, Dell's use of information technology (IT) has been vital to executing both elements of its business model - direct sales and build-to-order - and provides valuable insights into how IT can be applied to achieve speed and flexibility in an industry in which time is critical. Many of the insights gained from this case can be applied more generally to other time-dependent industries, suggesting that the findings from the Dell case will have implications for a growing number of companies and industries in the future.",

    "abstract": "Present U.S. local exchange employment is less than half of what it was in 1981. This study tests several alternative explanations from labor economics, industrial organization, and political economy for employment reductions by U.S. local telephone companies. It evaluates the relative strength of the relationship between each explanatory factor and employment change. The contributions of six potential explanatory factors (wages, sales, technological change, competition, productivity, and profit rate) were investigated. Regression equation models were formulated and tested using crosssectional time-series data on 50 local carriers who provided 90% of the service between 1988 and 1995. We found that digitalization and productivity increases were the most important factors in explaining employment reductions by firms. Wage increases and computerization were significant sources for employment reduction only in the short term.",

    "abstract": "One of the reasons the proponents of expanded universal service have not made much headway is that they have not been able to provide a coherent justification for the major resource and policy commitments it requires. The lack of consensus on the very meaning of the term \"universal service\" has added to the confusion. This article argues that it is critically important to articulate a clear justification for universal service before we discuss what it should include and how it should be funded, the two main preoccupations of the current debate. It answers the \"why\" question by drawing on the literature on consumption norms and citizenship rights and thereby provides a cogent justification for universal service. A clear articulation of the rationale for universal service should reduce some of the confusion in the current debate and bring greater clarity to the ongoing debate on this important public policy issue.",

    "title": "ICTs in the Rush Hour of Life",
    "abstract": "In the Netherlands, many women have entered the labor market in the last two decades. This development - among other social changes - has resulted in substantial shifts in the time that Dutch people spend on paid labor and \"caring tasks\" on the one hand and leisure activities on the other hand. This task combination has caused serious time pressure and coordination problems among dual-income families with children. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to label this stage of life as the \"rush hour of life\". In this article the findings of a small-scale qualitative case study among these \"busy\" households are presented. The objective of this study is to describe and analyze patterns of acceptance and use of information and communication technologies (ICTs), especially telecommunication technologies, in the context of the everyday life of these households. The question is raised whether ICTs can be a solution to time pressure and coordination problems. Theoretically, the research is rooted in a user-oriented perspective toward technological innovation, developed in the United Kingdom by Silverstone, Haddon, and others, which understands the incorporation of ICTs into the everyday life of households as a \"domestication process\". A paradoxical conclusion of this study is that ICTs are not explicitly perceived as solutions to the communication and coordination problems these households experience in everyday life, although they are being used for solving these problems. This ambiguity seems characteristic for the acceptance of ICTs in everyday life. The domestication concept is a useful concept to describe these ambivalent and paradoxical processes of (non)acceptance and use.",

    "abstract": "Electronic computers in information systems are often seen as \"ready-to-use\" technology, which simply becomes applied to certain domains. This article explores the sociotechnical processes involved in the development of information systems by studying two cases of medical informatics, the Laboratory Instrument Computer (LINC) and a medical information system at a hospital. They show that information systems have from the beginning been a result of multiple alignment processes between the relevant actors, among which are users, developers, and the technology itself. The first case reveals that information systems are successful when actors become aligned and coordinated across boundaries. This alignment includes user interfaces as well as parts and components of the computer. The second case exhibits disalignment between relevant actors, which leads to an unstable information system. The two mechanisms are found coexisting in medical informatics.",

    "abstract": "This article argues that an enlightened, inclusive vision of universal service is possible by learning lessons from disability. Telecommunications policy has historically built in norms that needlessly exclude people who are regarded as having a disability and therefore being outside of the mainstream. Accordingly, universal service policies focus on availability and affordability of telecommunications services, rather than on their accessibility and functionality. The article shows how rethinking universal service through disability can lead to inclusive policies that benefit everybody.",

    "title": "Sexism And Language : What Can The Web Teach Us?",
    "abstract": "In his seminal work l'Emile Rousseau asked his female reader to educate her daughter so that she would become a 'honnete femme' and not a 'honnete homme'. Rousseau was playing on words as the collocation 'honnete homme' refers to a social and intellectual ideal reserved for the masculine gender, whereas the 'honnetete' described in 'honnete femme' refers to the loyalty of a spouse vis-a-vis her husband. This different meaning of an adjective when it qualifies the noun femme or the noun homme is found in other collocations in French, for instance a grand homme is a \"great man\" but a grande femme is \"a tall woman\". This lexical and semantic dissymmetry is the topic of this essay. I make the hypothesis that the differential meaning can be explained by the systematic derogation of the noun femme ; therefore, in the case of the syntagms with a differential meaning the noun modifies to a certain extent the adjective. Computerized databases and on-line texts provide the much-needed data to examine this assumed phenomenon of derogation of the noun femme . I also remark upon the usage of some women writers. Female writers tend to use more positive adjectives with the word woman . Also female writers such as de Navarre and Sevigne use adjectives with the 'male (and positive) meaning' when referring to women and not the 'female (and negative) meaning'.",

    "abstract": "On the web site of the Laboratoire de Francais Ancien at the University of Ottawa we intend to offer free access to a query and research tool, both powerful and new, for use on Chretien de Troyes' masterpiece the Chevalier au Lion , Chretien being the most famous writer of medieval French romances. We are preparing a presentation of all the Chevalier au Lion manuscripts, with analysis and interpretation, that will constitute an indispensable collection of documents for future critical work — both for critical editions in general and critical editions of this particular work. Our aim is to show the educated public the text itself, accompanied by a series of indices, a study of the language and a complete lexicon of each manuscript copy. When the work is complete, the reader will be able to see images of the manuscript folios, to decipher the text by means of a first, \"archeological\" transcription (the text as is), and to understand it, through a second, critical transcription of the emended manuscripts. The series of indices will allow easy, automatic look-up of the text, and various types of query (phonetic, morphological, syntactic, lexical, semantic, literary, cultural, etc.). Morphosyntactic study will give a systematic framework for determining the meaning and import of textual forms and expressions encountered in reading. The lexicon will provide precise definitions for all the lexical words of each manuscript.",

    "abstract": " The liberalization of the telecommunications sector provoked renewed attention to the concept of universal service. This has led to popular misconceptions of the underlying historical rationale for universal service that blur academic discussions on the topic and are often misused by policy makers for ideological purposes. The hermeneutic approach of this article consists of a critical investigation of the meaning of the concept of universal service in the light of historical evidence and economic theory. This `restoration' of the meaning of universal service transcends the political part of this article. It is argued that the universal service provision is largely unproblematic in `mature' telecommunication markets. However, in a socalled information economy, other problems arise that require new regulatory and political approaches. The basic tenets of such an alternative policy are outlined in the conclusion.

    "abstract": " Within contemporary New Zealand the political climate is such that market forces tend to be privileged over any social or cultural mandates. This has resulted in a deregulated broadcasting context in which three of the five free-to-air channels are operated as State Owned Enterprises (SOEs), with the remaining two operating as independent commercial operations. However, within this deregulated broadcasting context, there is an attempt to maintain something of a public service ethos. This article examines a New Zealand television documentary series, An Immigrant Nation, and the tensions and contradictions arising in a project that attempts to tell `marginal' stories within the `mainstream' media.

In Heidegger's ontological analysis of everyday things he is concerned to show that their significance as everyday things shows up in what they are for (Heidegger, 1962: 95-107). His well-known example is a hammer. What is a hammer? It is not an object-Thing to be scrutinized in terms of its objective properties. Rather, it is for use. A hammer reveals what it is (what it is for) when it is put to proper use. In being used appropriately its significance or meaning is discovered and made manifest. Heidegger shows that everyday things have, in each case, a particular for-the-sake-of-which that discloses what they are. My starting point for thinking about the meaning of `for' is concerned with radio and television and in particular the question, `What or who are programmes for?' In this article I try to show what it means to say that they are `for me or anyone'. ",

    "abstract": " The film industry in Argentina has witnessed a recent `boom' in commercial blockbuster movies that is bringing audiences back to see national films. These high budget productions are produced in part by large television channels that are utilizing state subsidies for these projects. While this translates into healthy growth for the film industry, it is transforming the character of national film production from a cultural project to a commercial product. Consequently, smaller, less commercial filmmakers are being slighted in favor of these larger corporate entities; a move that contradicts the original intent of improved film legislation passed in 1994. This tension between film production as a form of national culture or a commercial industry is emblematic of the cultural politics waged in current President Menem's administration - a government characterized by its neoliberal economic reform and ties to global business.

    "abstract": " Nationalism is an elusive concept, resisting all attempts at formulating an allembracing definition. Despite this Janus-faced character, however, the literature on nationalism abounds with definitions and theories designed to explain its rise. In a groundbreaking study, Michael Billig (1995) challenges the orthodox conceptions of nationalism and introduces the term `banal nationalism' to cover all those unnoticed, routine practices and ideological habits which enable the daily reproduction of nationhood. The newspapers play a major role in this `unmindful' process of reproduction. This article is inspired by Billig's day survey of British newspapers. Replicating Billig's analysis in the Turkish context, the article examines 38 newspapers on a randomly selected day. In the course of the survey, the presentation and content of the news are analysed and the articles of the columnists and the advertisements are dissected. The results of the survey do not deviate from Billig's findings in the British case: the Turkish newspapers constantly `flag' nationhood. The fundamental premises of nationalist ideology are taken for granted and all debates are conducted within the parameters of the nationalist discourse. The article concludes by raising the following question: is there an alternative to this state of affairs? ",

    "abstract": " The use of a Jewish family as icons of the British middle class in British Telecom's famous `Beattie' campaign of the 1980s and early 1990s raises questions about the place of Jews in British cultural life. By connecting this episode in the history of Anglo-Jewry to more long-standing social dynamics and to recent arguments about advertising and citizenship, it becomes apparent that, rather than expressing a hard won enfranchisement through the democratizing field of consumption, these ads extend earlier forms of the perpetual qualification of Jewish citizenship in Britain.

    "abstract": " The Cosby Show changed the face of international television distribution as profoundly as it altered American television culture. However, while many scholars have addressed the show's domestic popularity, its international acceptance remains a virtual mystery. This article investigates the various economic, textual and audience practices that led to The Cosby Show's international success, and that continue to make middle-class African American sitcoms lucrative international fare. The Cosby Show set the representational and marketing standards that continue to determine what types of African American shows are sold internationally, and where those shows are sold. While the international syndication industry learned many lessons from The Cosby Show, including the global appeal of domestic sitcoms, this article suggests that deeper revelations regarding the importance of televisual representations of race in global programming remain unrecognized.

    "abstract": " This article discusses live two-way interviews between television presenters in the studio and programme participants at outside broadcast locations. It concerns itself in particular with the relationship between the television event and the event-in-itself, outlining the way in which one programme, Election 97, brings spatially dispersed individuals and places together in a dialectical relationship and suggesting that the television event in such instances is generated not by the reconstruction of events at some discrete remote location but rather via the penetration of a multiplicity of remote sites into one another in the live space of the broadcast. It concludes by arguing for a view of the event as complex, self-referential and multiply-mediated when seen from the perspective of its spatio-temporal dynamics. ",

    "abstract": " Lack of interaction between the mass media and their audiences has always been a target for media criticism. While the Internet provides a potential for more interactive communication, one wonders how much this opportunity is taken up. The traditional mass media do not seem to become obsolete. Their function as providers of a shared lifeworld might become even more important. Besides their traditional formats, mass media are well represented on the World Wide Web, but it is not clear yet how interactive they will be in the online environment. The article first goes over theoretical implications, taking the perspective of the current Frankfurt School and the American movement of public journalism. Then it identifies concrete settings and levels of interactivity in online journalism. Finally, an exploratory study of New York Times journalists and forum participants helps illustrate chances and problems of mass media online. ",

Drawing on focus group discussions, content analysis and interviews with media personnel, I demonstrate how templates help to shape news narratives and guide thinking not only about the past, but also about the present and the future. The argument is illustrated by examining the position of the `Cleveland scandal' (and the subsequent `Orkney crisis') in discussions of child sexual abuse. The discussion explores how templates such as Cleveland are established and maintained by source strategies, social power relations and journalistic/audience reception processes. The article concludes by outlining the implications of templates for media production practice, media studies theory and audience reception research. ",

    "abstract": " The media imperialism thesis has long argued that the expansion of Western media production into developing countries has resulted in the domination of their national media environments and the consequent destruction of their indigenous media production. This article examines the empirical tenability of this claim with regard to Asia. Delineating the region's media developments, it identifies forces such as national gate-keeping policies, the dynamics of audience preference and local competition, all of which inhibit and restrict the proliferation of Western cultural production. On the basis of this empirical evidence, the article argues that the claims made by proponents of the media imperialism thesis seem overstated in the Asian context. In conclusion, the article suggests that although media imperialism is perceived as a very real danger by governments, there are in fact several other problematic trends such as the rampant growth of commercialization and the decline of public broadcasting, the dominance of entertainment programming and a lack of genuine diversity in program genres and formats that collectively represent a more significant threat to media systems in Asia.

    "abstract": " Anti-imperialist struggles within the Third World, from East Timor to Tibet, are compelled, due to relative powerlessness, to utilize western media in order to mobilize crucial world support. In the case of the Tibetan exile community, a media struggle with the Chinese government in Beijing is one of the few options open to it. But, western media culture has its own internal disputes, its own running conflicts about popular culture, as well as about the values and hegemonic structures within the media industry. In addition, these media are themselves embedded within a culture which is highly promotional - in terms of its dominant rhetorics and the ways its audiences negotiate reading positions. Despite much media sophistication on the part of the Tibetans, the promotion of Tibetan struggles against the Beijing government's aggression therefore also becomes entangled in a web of other promotional discourses, from commercial advertising to campaigns for overseas aid.

    "abstract": " The article begins by reviewing recent work on music radio, much of which suggests that radio's processes of selection reinforce the success of existing and familiar artists and genres. Through examining the recent history of BBC Radio 1, I suggest that there are ways in which the music selection and scheduling processes of radio may be used to lead (rather than entirely follow) public tastes. I include a small-scale comparative analysis of the `airplay' of certain records on Radio 1 and its commercial rivals, together with an examination of Radio 1's recent scheduling and programming changes. I seek to draw out two implications from this analysis. First, I argue that there is some support for Radio 1's rhetorical claims to have changed the British popular music environment in the mid-1990s. Second, I argue that the patterns of programming on Radio 1 are consistent with many of the BBC's stated public-service commitments, despite a popular and commercial perception of pop music being inappropriate for the Corporation. However, I suggest that this public-service role is achieved, not through the usual habit of scheduling specialist music in the evenings, but by effecting a new permeability between the traditionally separate domains of daytime (mainstream) and evening (specialist) music programmes.

    "abstract": " This article examines some changes in news style in British newspapers between about 1880 and 1930 and proposes that they provide evidence of the emergence of a coherent and self-sufficient discourse of the news. It argues that changes in the ways in which the news has represented the world are as important as technological or economic changes to the development of the 20th-century news form, and that it is therefore important to look closely at issues of language. It suggests that three main developments in news texts occurred: the wide range of voices and styles of the Victorian press became subsumed under a single universal news voice; the status of the news text changed from being a collection of raw information to being a form of knowledge in itself; and the news developed independence from the conventions of public discourse.

    "abstract": " In this article I use the concept of genre as a notion to look into the relationship between the production and the audience, especially on the production side. The empirical material of the study is a Japanese television family drama called Wataru seken wa oni bakari or Wataoni. Recently the concept of genre - traditionally known from literary theory and cinema studies - has been found useful especially in studies on (news) journalism. In these studies genre is usually defined as a cultural and social contract between the production and the audience, the rhetorical mode of address inherent in genre being a central notion. The mode of address is seen to recommend audience members certain meanings and viewing patterns. Although the idea of `communicative contract' also includes the production side, empirical studies of the rhetorical force of genre in both production and reception are rare.  I propose that it can be useful in an empirical study to look into the ways in which genre addresses both the viewers and the makers. The way the generic mode of address works for each direction may differ, but nevertheless genre also persuades the makers to adopt a certain subject position and meaningful relationship with the programme in question.

    "abstract": " This article suggests a non-prescriptive notion of the concept of `influence', and points out the shortcomings of simply questioning viewers in attempting to elicit subtle forms of influence by the media. It describes the methodology of a study which took an indirect and multi-pronged approach to investigating how television and videos might exert an influence on the storymaking of 10-12-year-old children. The combination of stories, interviews and other data made it possible to contextualize, rather than isolate, the role of television- and video-viewing in the storymaking and lives of these children. Bringing a variety of qualitative data to bear on the question made it possible also to begin to see, in what has been hypothesized as the `psycho-cultural ecology', how the individual's relationship with and response to the screen is indeed individual, while closely tied in with broader family dynamics, all of which are expressed in storymaking.

    "title": "Cultural compliance and critical media studies",
    "abstract": "This commentary is a challenge to social scientists. In it we ask why much of social science and in particular media and cultural studies can now communicate little that is critical or relevant to its own society. In the ferment of social and political ideas which we associate with the 1960s, it was assumed that science could be ‘for the people’ and that it would be possible to link theory and practice in progressive rational critique. These ideas were not new and indeed had their origins in Enlightenment thinking. But the period of post-war consensual politics certainly increased demands for academic approaches which were relevant and critical. In the period which followed there was a profound shift in political power towards the right, in both the USA and in Britain. The 1980s saw a ferocious struggle to establish a new dominance for the free market. This involved pushing back the restraining influences of the post-war consensus with its commitment to full employment and social welfare. This period was therefore a high point in the development of news management and of state and business public relations – the age of spin doctors (Miller and Dinan, 2000). Yet strangely it was also during this period that the concept of ideology disappeared from much academic work in media and cultural studies. A new set of theoretical questions and issues now preoccupied cultural theorists. We will argue here that much media and cultural studies had in fact wandered up a series of theoretical dead ends. To illustrate this, we will look first at the cultural and material changes which did occur in our society and then at the problems with the new directions taken by media and cultural studies. The rise of the New Right in the 1980s did not signify a new age or a new type of society. The same social relations of production existed (between employers and employed) and the same tendencies of capital to accumulate. It continued to agglomerate into larger and larger units giving greater power in the market. For example, in 1996 the £28 billion merger of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas in America gave them nearly two-thirds of the world’s commercial airline market and over half of the US military aircraft production. In the same year, the proposed",

    "abstract": "Drawing on results from a four-year project of basic research, and applying quantitative as well as qualitative methods, this article describes important, recent trends in young Danes' media culture and discusses the research implications that these trends enforce and enhance. Three empirical trends stand out: innovation in media applications, increased interaction between media types and genres, and a more `seamless' social integration of media into everyday life. First, contemporary adolescents are a multi-media generation in two senses: notably young men are pioneers in computer use and both genders mix a variety of media. Second, contrary to much postmodern discourse young people do not necessarily demonstrate media reflexivity as a result of increased intertextual crossbreeding. Third, adolescents' leisure culture is undergoing important reshufflings because of the changing media landscape: public and private spaces are becoming regendered, and the computer acts as a catalyst in shaping more vertical forms of interaction resembling premodern forms of socialization. Finally, it is argued that these trends call for more interdisciplinary, multifaceted research that integrates textual and social dimensions of analysis.",

    "abstract": " This article explores the implications of postmodernism for feminist media studies. It takes two key tenets of postmodernism which overlap with much work in feminist media studies - the notion of representation as reality and audience resistance. In the context of the metathemes of identity and difference, it argues for a mode of analysis which is integrative and tracks social and ideological relations at every level between cultural production and consumption. The article further suggests that without a universalism of sorts the idea of equality in a fully functioning democratic society is impossible. However, the concept of universalism must be deconstructed so it can be recognized as a contingent historical product. This is referred to as `paradoxical universalism'. For feminist media studies this requires a mode of analysis which does not atomize and treat as separate the different phases of mass communications or individualize our everyday experience of it. ",

The aim of this article is to present a conceptual framework for studies of TV journalism as communication; including different intentions, strategies applied to appeal to viewers, processes of production, bases for audience involvement, roles and relations. I differentiate three modes of communication: information, storytelling and attractions, and argue that this trichotomy is more fruitful and analytically developed, compared to other conceptualizations such as the dichotomy: information and entertainment.

    "abstract": " Although live broadcasting has declined in the long term, and is deemed of little importance by most television theorists, this article maintains that an analysis of `liveness' remains central to an understanding of television in general. `Liveness' is not defined as a technical phenomenon, but rather as the viewers' belief in live broadcasting. This belief depends on the televisual text, on the social context, on the social characteristics of viewers and on the temporal sequencing of television viewing. Based on the combination of sounds (especially the voice) with images, a typology of television sequences is proposed according to the degree of liveness reached: (1) fully live (maximum liveness, as in major media events); (2) continuity (appearance of liveness without certainty, as in game shows); (3) edited (non-fiction and non-live, but influenced by the context of live television, as with some news reports and documentaries); (4) fiction (minimum liveness especially in films, but influence of liveness in some genres). The analysis is applied especially to national and general audience channels. However, a short survey of cable programming shows how liveness has not disappeared, and is related to the possibility of switching, at any given moment, to live channels. ",

It notes that a wide range of organizations have begun adopting public relations as a means of achieving particular goals through media coverage. At the same time media institutions, operating under tighter editorial budgets, have become more dependent on information supplied by external sources. The two trends have resulted in the sudden growth of the professional public relations sector and changes to existing patterns of source access. How such trends are affecting various sources in their attempts to gain and manage media access is the debate that therefore takes up most of this piece. Is public relations simply another means by which institutional and corporate organizations are managing to secure access advantages, or is it providing new means whereby non-official sources can gain media access which was hitherto denied them?

    "abstract": " This article examines the role played by broadcasting in Irish artistic and cultural life from independence in 1922 to 1960 with the onset of formal modernization. It examines the cultural context for the arts in early independent Ireland in which a mood of ambivalence and sometimes outright hostility to high culture prevailed. Rather than a profound disjunction between pre- and post-modernizing phases of Irish history, however, this article argues that there were important lines of continuity in cultural experience, in particular middle-class experience of the arts, which continue to inform Irish cultural life up to the present. Such cultural experience may be characterized by its pervasive middlebrow sensibility which, starved of the traditional institutional supports for culture, made up in amateur enthusiasm what was missing in cultural capital. Broadcasting, in fact, was the key institution in the middlebrow process of cultural development in pre-1960s Ireland which along with the developing arts policy of the time can be seen to give a different complexion to a period in Irish history better known for its cultural impoverishment and repressive nature.

    "abstract": " This article revisits Comedia's assessment and theory of the alternative press. In its examination of the radical projects and press in the 1970s and 1980s, the group pointed out some internal weaknesses and the failure of the alternative press to take advantage of some `useful' aspects of capitalism. It suggested that the alternative press, in order to escape from the ghetto of marginality, should employ mainstream economic and organizational technique to put finances on a firmer footing. This article examines Comedia's view by looking at the founding and history of Red Pepper, which can be seen as a test bed for Comedia's theory. The article presents the Comedia position in its intellectual context. By outlining the background to the launch of the magazine, which was organized according to the principles that were set out by Comedia, and through detailed analysis of its organization and financing, the Comedia theory of the alternative press is shown to be wrong. It suggests that the more commercially sophisticated model of an alternative press independent of the party is not viable. ",

    "title": "Television production: issues of exploitation, commodification and subjectivity in UK television labour markets",
    "abstract": " This article analyses the features and conditions presently characterizing work and employment for freelance workers in UK television production. It does so at two levels: one is middle range in its theorization and evidentially grounded; the other, at a higher level of abstraction, ponders the most appropriate way to approach and comprehend these findings in a broader socio-historical context. At the middle and grounded level, the article argues that: 1. these freelances largely organize their own labour market in terms of recruitment, referencing, discipline and hierarchical relations; 2. the concept of an employment relation properly describes the situation for some of these workers, but not for others; 3. the features of a dual labour market are present but do not follow the pattern (of core-periphery) suggested by flexible firm theorists; 4. success as a television worker involves a process of commodification, extending beyond the transformation of simple labour power into the commodification of aspects of the individual's personality and/or aesthetic creativities; 5. the motivation to work in television reveals not only (sometimes, not even) the pursuit of earnings but also existential goals of self-affirmation and actualization; 6. television workers are active in their own commodification processes.  At a more abstract level of theorization, the article reflects on the constitutive role played by television workers in the exploitative and commodifying processes of television production. The latter is viewed as largely a profit-seeking and competitive industry, and the constitutive role of workers in its operations problematizes any structurally determinist approach to analysis. The article considers that problematic in the context of labour process approaches since Braverman, the critique of same mounted by Knights and Willmott on Foucauldian arguments regarding the theorization of the subject, and the redress of Foucault conveyed in Giddens' concept of structuration and Willmott's appeal for a `dialectic of praxis'.

    "abstract": " The article intervenes in the debate over the effects of globalization on the nation-state by exploring the ways in which meanings of the global are produced through the nationalist imagination in India. Globalization in India has unfolded in the context of the `new economic policies' of liberalization initiated in the 1990s. Both television and print media images increasingly contribute to the reproduction of a hegemonic political culture, one that has discarded the remnants of a state-dominated planned economy. An analysis of this process calls into question the post-national thesis of the globalization paradigm. First, the imagined form of the `global' is produced through cultural signs that rest on the deployment of nationalist narrative. Second, media representations depict India's relationship with the world economy through images of a hybrid relation between the national and the global. Finally, globalization in India has led to a form of reterritorialization which polices the boundaries of gendered social codes. ",

    "abstract": " This article examines how major upheavals at News International in the 1980s influenced the relationship between technological innovation and workplace reorganization at the Financial Times. Using a historical institutional theoretical framework, the article combines interviews with members of the Financial Times and documentary research to develop a case study of the influence of workplace reorganization at one media corporation on processes of reorganization at another. What emerges from the case study of the Financial Times (and News International) is the need to analyse the relationship between technological innovation and workplace reorganization by examining an organization's internal culture; its institutional context, including other organizations in the same industry; and the interaction between its actors' worldviews, choices of action and institutional context.

The work contends that gacetillas have been the key ingredient in a system of governmental press subsidy, essential in explaining the way in which the Mexican press has served as a propaganda tool for both the Mexican government and the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) throughout most of the 20th century. The work also characterizes how the gacetilla system works and how it affects press content and journalistic routines. Finally, the work speculates about the current transition in the political economy of the Mexican press and the implication of this process for future media studies. ",

    "title": "Promoting a labor perspective in the American mass media: unions and radio in the CIO era, 1936-56",
    "abstract": " Corporate interests have dominated American radio since the late 1920s, using a commercialized medium to sell business products and ideology. For several decades, organized labor challenged business control of the radio. Unable to compete with business in other areas of the mass media, radio, with its potential for reaching a large audience, held promise for a labor movement hoping to contest business domination of political discourse. This article explores the relationship between organized labor and radio broadcasting from the 1930s to the mid-1950s. During the early part of this period, unions engaged in a fierce struggle for access to radio and began challenging the coverage of labor in the mass media. In the post-Second World War era, organized labor launched an aggressive campaign to utilize radio to promote a working-class political perspective. By the early 1950s, labor's voice was more widely heard on the airwaves than ever before. Organized labor offered at least a modest check on corporate America's command of the mass media. ",

Using examples from British television, this article argues that scheduling is the key mechanism by which the structures of television reproduce themselves afresh, day after day. It is the point where the perceived habits and preferences of past viewing audiences govern the arrangement of future television, providing the basic pattern of broadcasting, interpreting and shaping the habits and actions of its viewers and non-viewers. It specifies what programmes are to be made and defines the character or `brand' of each channel and thus the character of each national television universe. As such, it has provided a powerful bulwark against globalization. ",

    "abstract": " Vox pop interviews were used extensively in British broadcast coverage of the death and funeral of Princess Diana. They were one of several ways that public expression of emotion was defined as an important part of the events of the week. Some commentators criticized this attention to the public response, rather than on new information and formal events, as an excessive and sentimental part of a loss of proper perspective. This criticism raises two issues in the relation of media events to everyday experience - entitlement of members of the public to feel overpowering emotion at the loss of someone they knew only through media, and the sincerity of expressions of emotion when ordinary people are faced with microphones and a camera. I argue here that such criticisms miss the ways interviewees packaged their responses with an awareness of just such criticisms. Interviewees showed entitlement by presenting themselves as speaking for ordinary people, linking their responses to the place and time, and tying their stories into their everyday activities or to historic events. They showed sincerity by presenting their feelings as atypical for them, by acknowledging apparent clichés, and by emphasizing Diana's own sincerity. Analysis of interviewees' reflexive sense of performance shows how `intimacy at a distance' can make public involvement a component of media events. ",

Interwoven into this account of political activism on the internet is a treatise on the use of the internet as a way of supporting or building a Habermassian public sphere and ways in which the dominance of Northern or established political views can be challenged. Use of the ICT can be seen as a political act in itself, here Walch is dealing with the politics of the internet created by those carrying out politics on the internet.",

    "abstract": " This article engages recent debates about the future of cinema in the digital age. Firstly, it seeks to broaden the rather narrow terms in which the transition to digital cinema is often understood in film theory. Secondly, it tries to assess claims about the 'demise of narrative' frequently associated with the digital threshold. On one level, it is argued that a dialectical understanding of the relation between terms such as 'narrative' and 'spectacle' is needed to advance current debates. On another level, it is suggested that digital technology should not be wholly defined by the current dominance of 'blockbuster' films. In place of technological determinism, an understanding based on the politics of spectacle and distracted spectatorship is advanced. ",

    "title": "Approaches to Analysing the Web Text",
    "abstract": " This paper challenges the dominance of concepts of hypertextuality as the foundation for the analysis of web texts. Instead it argues that web texts cannot be understood without reference to their specific contexts of production and consumption. As part of the construction of an alternative to existing analytical approaches to the web text contemporary practice in web design is surveyed, as are its relations with the culture of particular groups of producers. Drawing on an interdisciplinary framework allied to the field of British media and cultural studies, this paper suggests how the analysis of the web site might be approached in terms of its status as an emergent media/cultural form. It discusses how such forms might be understood in terms of the shared social conventions which inflect their production. It argues that web sites can neither be analysed in terms of generic hypertext or as a homogeneous genre and that rather the formation of groupings of sites in line with the ideologies, values and preoccupations of their producers require concrete analysis together with further research into specific practices of 'reading' web texts.

    "title": "Stereoscopy and Pre-Raphaelitism",
    "abstract": " My argument attempts to rethink discourse on John Ruskin and the Pre-Raphaelite paintings in terms of media and technological concerns. In particular, I discuss their discourse in relation to the Victorian optical practice of the stereoscope. The visual space of the stereoscope is radically different from the mimetic capacities of photography, film and television in that stereoscopy depends on the absence of any mediation between the viewing subject and the object. In this respect, it is possible to argue that stereoscopic images have echoes of dematerialised computer-generated imagery. According to technological determinists, digital image production technologies are entirely 'new' practices which will completely change cultural forms. However, the emergence of new media specifically and technology generally does not occur outside the most dominant and pervasive media, but occurs within existing social relations, cultural forms and their histories. The emergence of image production technologies in nineteenth-century visual culture is not simply the product of the so-called 'age of mechanical reproduction'. In this paper, this is discussed by drawing on discourses on Ruskin and the Pre-Raphaelites. ",

Despite the seemingly ephemeral, diverse, and dynamic nature of cyberspace, Jordan has aimed to point to some of the relatively stable social relations and patterns that have formed through the shifting dynamics of virtual life. ’1t is time’, Jordan asserts, ’to outline the normative orders of cyberspace. It is time to put aside the fear of appearing to be &dquo;out of date&dquo; with virtual lives’ newest playthings’ (p. 3). He is quite aware that this ’mapping’ project is only a starting point, but believes that a beginning is not only necessary but is now possible.",

    "abstract": " This paper reviews diffusion of on-line research at daily newspapers in the USA during a five-year period from 1994 to 1998. Diffusion literature indicates new technical innovations require certain social and economic conditions and other factors before adoption begins. Once the adoption process begins, it takes place in stages before reaching critical mass. Data collected in this study confirms Everett M. Rogers' process model. The World Wide Web has become the dominant on-line research tool for journalists. Commercial services that provide access to government databases and archival databases, such as those containing newspapers and magazines, are also in wide use. While general computer use in newsrooms has increased, so has the frequency of use of on-line services. Primary resources used to search the web are AltaVista and Yahoo! and journalists most often used government sites. Internet technologies were not widely used during the five years studied. Adoption of computers and the internet- web appear complete, but the adoption process in some advanced-use categories remains in process. ",

    "abstract": " The convergence of satellite, telephony and computer technologies has been hailed by many as the catalyst for the Information Technology revolution. However, convergence, like the term globalisation, is a much-used and much-abused term; and convergence, like globalisation is usually merely asserted as a factor in a vague and unexplained way. Why did convergence take place at the time and in the manner it did? This paper will set out to construct a theory of convergence and argue that the convergence process has its genesis in a much wider economic and political dynamic - that is to say the 'crisis of space' that occurred in the mid- to late-1970s. The economic and political 'resolution' to this ongoing process, the dynamics of which are still in operation today, set in train the late capitalist phase of globalisation. A consequence of this was the rapid convergence of hitherto discrete technologies into the highly dynamic and hugely powerful IT revolution. The nature of converged technologies, and their effects upon the nature of communication, of consumption and production - and ultimately the cultures and societies which evolve out of these processes, is analysed through this critical framework.

    "abstract": " Terms such as 'internet radio', 'internet broadcasting' and 'web radio' or 'webcasting' crop up relatively frequently in media articles and academic analyses of the changing face of global media. Yet, while the terms are often used interchangeably and there does not seem to be a set of formal definitions which distinguish one from another, there are major differences between the sorts of services described by these labels. Furthermore the services, now often generically termed 'netcasting', offer significant challenges for traditional radio broadcasting principles and practices. This article discusses issues and concepts concerning net- or webcasting via a limited experiment in on-demand internet radio which was established as a postgraduate student production outcome. It explores internet radio as a particular media form used as the setting for this outcome. ",

In particular, the article stresses the materiality of planet Earth and the politics of resources in its less economically 'enabled' regions as elements which must be taken into account in the kinds of theoretical writing emerging in the field of new cultural technology studies.  As befits the frequently used communicative modes of various interviewees and collaborators from the western Pacific region whose ideas inform my thinking in this article, my contentions are expressed through a mixture of conventional critical argument and a series of examples, allusions, metaphors and aphorisms intended to inform and stimulate the engaged reader.

    "abstract": " Contemporary debates concerning hypertext theory often question the place of the written word in visual media. Contrary to this, I argue that hypertext is first and foremost a visual, graphical medium. It is a way of spatialising ideas into discrete units which might be grasped by the mind and efficiently retrieved along lines of connections: association. This technique has a long history. There is a strange continuity in metaphor between early associationist models of memory, classical Greek systems of place-memory loci, sixteenth and seventeenth century philosophies of memory retrieval and the history of hypertext. I argue that hypertext belongs to this lineage. ",

This piece is going to explore a few ideas borrowed from the analytical psychology of C. G.

For example why do users readily assume other identities (often of the opposite sex)? On one hand we welcome the net as providing new sources of information and unparalleled opportunities for communication. While at the same time we are afraid of its dark corners, of its power to corrupt through the easy access it provides to extreme types of pornography and the dissemination of information that is socially subversive.",

    "abstract": " What is new about the so-called 'new media'? Enthusiasts often assume that digital media must break radically with the aesthetic and cultural traditions of their predecessors. However, new media and new genres are best understood by examining the ways in which they refashion or 'remediate' older forms. Computer graphics, virtual reality, and the World Wide Web define themselves by borrowing from and remediating television, film, photography and painting, as well as print. Virtual reality remediates film as well as perspective painting; digital photography remediates the analogue photograph; the World Wide Web refashions almost every previous visual and textual medium. Furthermore, older media can remediate newer ones. For example, television is making such extensive use of computer graphics that TV screens often look like pages of the web. ",

    "title": "Medium Specificity Re-visited",
    "abstract": " Medium specificity arguments have had a long history in film theory. Forged primarily in studies seeking to locate the differences between cinema and theatre,1 or cinema and literature,2 such arguments have a much earlier history in the idea that art forms can be differentiated from one another on the basis of their means of imitation. Medium specificity theories generally concern themselves with the idea that different media have 'essential' and unique characteristics that form the basis of how they can and should be used. Within Film Studies, interest in both the idea of a 'cinematic apparatus' and the formative period of early cinema can be viewed as reactions emerging from a long period of engagement with medium specificity theories. Curiously, while it is common practice to use cinema as an analogy for multimedia, 3 there is little direct discussion of the relevance, or irrelevance, of medium specificity arguments in the broader space of 'new media' theory. 4 Our intent in this article is not to revive medium specificity arguments as these have already been problematised, but rather to establish them as a concern for new media theory, and also to extract from them a concept of specificity that can account for the different characteristics of established and emergent media.

    "abstract": " The concept of remediation can help explain the cultural economy of the World Wide Web. As developed in a recently published book (co-authored with Jay Bolter), remediation refers to the way in which new digital media refashion prior media forms. Digital media like computer graphics, virtual reality, and the web define themselves by borrowing from, paying homage to, critiquing, and refashioning their predecessors, principally television, film, photography, and painting, but also print. Furthermore, older media can remediate newer ones within the same media economy. Remediation seems to be a fundamental characteristic not only for contemporary media, but for all visual media at least since the Renaissance with its invention of linear-perspective painting. Each medium seems to follow this pattern of borrowing and refashioning other media, and rivalry as well as homage seems always to be at work. In this paper I take up the cultural economy of the web in relation to three competing conceptual frameworks for making sense of new digital media: cyberspace, ubiquitous computing, and mediated public space. In so doing I hope to move towards an analysis of the cultural economy of the heterogenous networks within which digital media circulate and areconsumed. ",

    "abstract": "In contrast to Norbert Elias’ perception of the court as a “gilded cage”, historians have, over a couple of decades, agreed on concepts of courts as specific social systems that can be visualised by a series of concentric circles around the ruler. Courtiers and officers were not only domesticated by the court (“Civilizing Process”), they were rather integrated in the mechanisms of decision-making. Therefore, courts can be defined as cultural and political nexuses: places where central power encountered the subjects (yet still belonging to different sort of elites, including noble and functional elites), and where power and resources were concentrated and redistributed. Courtiers and officers were integrated in a permanent process of interaction and redistribution in the surroundings of the ruler. Possible share in power and rule, promotion and admission to offices at court and in the chancery were accordingly regarded as a consequence of the ruler’s grace on the one hand or, as the quasi-institutional practice and structure of governance on the other hand. Thus, individuals who had direct and specific access to the rulers or belonged to their inner circle (gaining their trust and establishing an intellectual and even physical proximity with them), were sometimes raised to a position that enabled them to accumulate resources and develop their own influence and power.",

    "abstract": " Chris Marker in his feature film Level 5 combines formal and structural elements of two different types of media: film and computer. Visually and narratively, he compares the essential characteristics of the analogue (film) and digital (computer) media. The feature film functions like a fictional documentary based on historical documents about the battle of Okinawa at the end of the Second World War. Within this narrative Marker develops a complex structure of media discourses where he interrelates, merges, and layers elements of different media and thereby gives an insight into the structure of intermedia and hypermedia and aesthetically differentiates between fiction and simulation.

    "abstract": " Abtract: This paper proposes that to understand the meanings that technological innovation holds for social life, empirical evidence must accompany theoretical analysis. Using data from the large-scale and longitudinal UK-wide futura.com survey conducted by the University of Leeds (UK), the key questions of emergent technologies' relationships to the formation of social solidarity and identity, and the patterns of social activities found among IT users are addressed. The evidence to date does not support the argument that technological innovation is directly linked to changes in identity, or is resulting in declining levels of social activity. IT uptake is an evolutionary rather than revolutionary process. ",

The development of 'gay' magazines in the early 1970s is outlined, although terms such as 'gay' and 'homosexual' which were produced in a Western context are shown to have undergone a shift of meaning when imported to Japan. Many of the functions of these Japanese gay magazines are shown to have been taken over by gay sites on the internet. The variety of gay material on the internet is described, and, using interview information derived from Japanese gay men over the internet, the different ways in which these men use the internet is discussed. Finally, the role the internet is playing in the process of 'global queering' in which a variety of western discourses about homosexuality confront and interact with non-western indigenous constructions is questioned.

    "abstract": " This article suggests ways in which research into a nineteenth- century technology such as early cinema might be valid in understanding digital technology. It identifies a number of stylistic resemblances between early cinema, personal computing and the internet. It also claims that there is some value in applying one analytical methodology to both 'old' and 'new' media. By looking at digital technology through the filter of an extremely well developed discourse in early film history, softer determinist accounts of digital technology can emerge which are not dependent on the premises of progress nor those of various forms of Postmodernist criticism. In a reverse angle, so to speak, it also argues that a close tracking of digital technology and its critical discourses as they unfold in various entertainment forms can tell us much about the attractions and fascinations that early cinema had a century ago had for its audiences. In short it claims a continuity in audio-visual history and criticism which is a valuable addition, even antedote, to the hyperbole and unsupportable technological determinism that digital media has attracted both in academic and commercial commentary.

    "title": "Girl Gamers and their Relationship with the Gaming Culture",
    "abstract": " This paper describes an investigation conducted into the current accessibility and allure of gaming platforms for females. In order to investigate one of the most developed areas of new media, a traditional feminist approach of explaining factors that exclude females from new media technologies was avoided in favour of a focus upon the experiences and attitudes of females who already view themselves as 'gamers'. Synonymous with 'grrl gamer' and 'game girlz' this paper uses the term 'girl gamer' to describe females who possess an aptitude for the games that currently define the contours of the gaming culture. In-depth interviews and ethnographic game-play observations conducted with a small sample revealed that 'girl gamers' possess an alternative playing orientation, style of play, the importance of cultural competency in game preference, as well as knowledge on the ways gaming is embedded in household dynamics.

    "abstract": "most recent collaboration, Times of the Technoculture, offers a sustained critique of technopopulist rhetoric. By and large the authors offer a lucid and polemical survey of contemporary theories, concepts and applications of new information technologies. As the title of the book indicates, Robins and Webster focus much of their attention on a diachronic appreciation of information and communication technologies (ICTs), in so doing attempting to debunk their mythic revolutionary power in the new millennium. Bill Gates is henceforth chided for being too ’friction free’ while Marshall McLuhan is admonished for his love of technological determinism. And while such figures are rightly critiqued for their contributions to an ahistorical view of technology, they have also clearly reached the status of straw man, or should I say fibre-man (that has been routinely taken apart, packet by packet). To be fair, this is probably more of a critique of the technoculture literature as a whole than Robins and Webster’s book per se. Yet, on the other hand, the authors",

    "abstract": "through to the more empirical Mitra’s ’Virtual communality: Looking for India on the Internet’. Section nine approaches the subject of colonialism and globalisation through cyber-culture. Topics such as the Saidian Orient, Westernism, race and the nation state are examined. Here the ideas broached at the start as to whether cyber-culture is a technologically enabled culture, in some way autonomous from mainstream culture or whether it is an aspect of mainstream culture are given further airing. Nakamura’s paper on racial identity tourism ’Race in/for Cyberspace’ sits well with Stratton’s account of the globalising aspects of cyberspace, ’Cyberspace and the Globalization of Culture’ and Sardar’s ’ALT.CIVILIZATIONS.FAQ’ presents an account of the dystopian prospect of cyberspace. As with any collection of readings all the works have been previously available in some format and some in several. The skill in this volume, however, can be seen in the grouping of the readings and the intelligent and insightful introductions that preface each section. It is these overviews and the groupings of the works that add value to the highly useful collection of the papers into one volume. The groupings provide an anchor or framework for analysis above and beyond specific subject approaches. However, this framework did seem to suffer from some notable absences, particularly both Mark Poster and Kathleen Hales are absent. Such post-structural (or post-human) positions would certainly have benefited the ’Post-(cyber)bodies’ section. This aside the volume’s structure provides an excellent approach to the diverse nature of the fields of study; who knows, perhaps in such a collection of papers from different disciplines a new coherence of approach can be found.

    "abstract": "Dan Schiller’s book provides a detailed historical examination of the evolution of the global political economy of cyberspace. As the Unitd States has stood at the forefront of the global communications revolution and its governmental policies have defined the worldwide integration of information systems, Schiller focuses on the USA communication and information networks. These systems, such as the internet, were originally developed by the government, the military contractors and allied educational institutions. However, Schiller demonstrates that there has been a decisive shift away from the public sector to the private corporate integration of these USA networks into the heart of the global political economy as USA governments have established ’neo-liberal’ or market driven communications policies during the last two decades. This, Schiller contends, has been at the expense of labour rights, the public interest and democracy as multi-national corporations have been able to streamline their labour costs and integrate digital communications systems into the centre of the global political economy. Moreover, such ’neo-liberal’ policies indicate that the USA government has not only been compliant to the interests of corporations, but has actively pursued multi-national corporate interests, under the guise of globalisation and efficiency, as a nexus of vested political and business interests have come to define American politics.

    "abstract": " This paper addresses the interrelation between mechanical motion and electro-mechanical mediation. It draws attention to the close parallels between various modes of 'mobile subjectivity' associated with moving image/sound technologies and mechanical forms of transportation. The kinetic experiences associated with the freeway and the roller coaster are offered as two quite different examples of how the interpenetration of media, objects and subjectivities takes place in the realm of moving images and bodies. It is argued that the same modes of perception and motion associated with the car and the roller coaster also figure in a variety of new media forms that appeal to the contemporary body-in-motion/perception-in-motion nexus (from virtual environments to ride films and location-based entertainment). Like other communication networks of the present, both exist as ambivalent spaces for the representation of social interaction and social fears. ",

    "abstract": "Computer-mediated technologies (CMT) have created many opportunities for the arts. Some of those opportunities have been about re-purposing or re-mediating existing practices. Elsewhere, emergent practices, which are significantly different to what have gone before, are evident. A growing body of CMT works contest traditional practices in that there is no single unique or master copy; in the way the roles of maker and consumer are reapportioned; in the ways digital media themselves, physically and extra-linguistically, differ from previous display technologies; and in the user’s knowledge of what is missed or skipped.3 A particular feature of CMT art practices is ’new media’ interactivity: sequences of textual, visual and aural display guided by human actions of varying complexity which create new variations or instances of the work which are unique to the occasion and result from the reflexive selection of the user. Widening cultural and economic access to fast, reliable and responsive, local and networked systems means that such interactivity is now an increasingly important site of cultural activities.",

    "abstract": "This book presents contributions by women critics in the field of new media and its technologies. Each article represents a feminist statement featuring the interrelationship between theoretical discourse and the politics of the subject, especially the position of the body and self in cyberculture. The book positions itself within the ’repolitization of feminism’ and connects with timely debates on cyborgs, multiple selves, and shifting sexual identity, issues that have been theorised by Donna Haraway, Sherry Turkle",

    "abstract": "The following exchange took place between 10 and 13 July 1999 as a self-contained module of the\n         American Scientist Forum (a final postscript being added on 23 November, 1999).   http://amsci-forum.amsci.org/archives/september98-forum.html  \nThe main participants in the exchange were Stevan Harnad of the University of Southampton and Hal Varian, of the University of California, Berkeley. The exchange focuses on the problematic issue - crucial to Harnad's thesis - of the extent to which academic authors are prepared to give their work away by making it freely available, without charge, on the Net. Although the exchange has been edited slightly to make the discussion easier to follow, it seemed appropriate, given the subject matter, to retain it in its original quote/comment form. Harnad begins by emphasising 11 of his argument's main points, and by providing addresses for the various locations on the Net where the relevant publications can be found.",

    "abstract": "Free software is supposedly developed by a loosely organised \"community\" of programmers. However it has been quite unknown until now who, except for some well-known celebrities, belongs to this community, and more importantly how contributions are distributed. The authors present a first survey of free software authorship, with the emphasis not on building a census or even a \"hall of fame\", but on identifying patterns of concentration and distribution of contribution. The sample code size is not necessarily representative and there are several errors due to the automated and vast nature of the task of identifying and crediting authors. Nevertheless, comprehensive data is collated for the first time, and can be scrutinised in detail on the survey Web site.",

This paper departs from the discussion of leadership in Learner and Tiroles working paper \"The Simple Economics of Open Source\". My paper argues that leaders in open source projects only have indirect means of influence on what co-developers should develop. It is shown that leaders are beggars for help and contributions from co-developers, when the project starts up. But leaders become choosers, if a project becomes successful and attracts the attention of productive co-developers. The paper discusses the source of power of the open source project leaders as well.",

This paper examines these risks in the context of three historical instances in the development of \"distance\" education technology: the use of the written word to deliver course materials, the creation of the mass lecture hall, and the recent development of pre-packaged general education Web courses. These \"Web courselets\" represent the most serious threats to the undergraduate learning experience and may undue many of the recent efforts to reform undergraduate education.",

Four specific objectives include: 1) successful cooperation between the various institutions; 2) the development of an interactive Plant Information Center with a Web-based portal; 3) the development of lesson plans using primary research materials from the herbarium for 6th grade students; and, 4) a test of the usefulness of digital images of herbarium specimens for plant identification and for inspiring the public with the aims and methods of botanical science.",

    "title": "Searching for authority: Archivists and electronic records in the New World at fin de siècle",
    "abstract": "The 1990's marked a turning point for archivists and electronic records management (ERM). Major conceptual solutions for ERM were proposed, and while these approaches have been adopted by some they have also generated intense debate and discussion. Three questions continue to remain unanswered. What is the authority for these approaches? How pervasive have these approaches been in influencing archival practice? How well known are these approaches across the archives field? This paper attempts to provide some preliminary answers to these questions. First, it reviews the literature on electronic records as published in the four leading North American English language journals, the American Archivist, Archival Issues, Archivaria, and Provenance for the past decade. During this period these four journals published a total of 62 articles on electronic records, and this part of the paper provides an in-depth citation analysis of these articles. Second, the author draws on data collected as part of the preparation of a single state wide long-range plan (Pennsylvania) for the management of archives and historical records, re-evaluating the data for what it tells us about the success and relevance of new approaches for ERM. The author uses these two sources of evidence to reconsider how archivists have approached ERM. He argues that the real responsibility, or authority, for ERM from an archival perspective must derive from local and institutional applications rather than relying only on model or magic bullet solutions provided from a higher level. While these new models have been very useful in helping the archival profession re-orient itself to records and record-keeping issues, they may not have been very helpful for providing practical solutions at the local level. The paper will conclude with some comments about what needs to happen to close the gap between practice and theory, application and model.",

It enables one to place documents on a Web server, which students can access on campus or remotely. We have developed a Web-based collaborative system, which enables students to work through lab-based tutorials with access to a lecturer at a remote location through a Web cam, e-mail and a chat room applet. The student also has access to other students through the chat room applet and can browse through the history to check whether questions have been previously answered. Remote control software allows the lecturer to take control of the students machine in order to troubleshoot problems. Currently, the system is in everyday use and here we demonstrate the many benefits of such a collaborative environment.",

    "abstract": "A new relationship between educational institutions and companies needs to be formed, by bringing students into small and medium enterprise in an effort to prepare students with information technology skills while simultaneously providing companies with high-tech workers. Currently, more than one million information technology openings will be available in the year 2000 in companies with 50 to 99 employees and it is estimated that more than 800,000 positions will remain unfilled. By envisioning a new relationship between schools and smaller companies, a new workforce literacy program can serve to not only alleviate the current IT shortage but to also provide equal job opportunity for disadvantaged and traditionally disenfranchised students.",

    "title": "The social life of information - Table of contents",
    "abstract": "For years pundits have predicted that information technology will obliterate the need for everything from travel to supermarkets to business organizations to social life itself. They have heralded the coming of the virtual office, digital butlers, electronic libraries, and virtual universities. Beaten down by info-glut and exasperated by computer systems with software crashes, viruses, and unintelligible error messages, individual users tend to wax less enthusiastic about technological predictions. Amid the hype and the never-narrowing gap between promise and performance, they find it hard to get a vision of the true potential of the digital revolution. John Seely Brown and Paul Duguid in their book The Social Life of Information (Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 2000) help us see through frenetic visions of the future to the real forces for change in society. Arguing elegantly for the important role that human sociability plays in the world of bits, this book, and the chapters published here in First Monday, gives us an optimistic look beyond the simplicities of information and individuals. The authors show how a better understanding of the contribution that communities, organizations, and institutions make to learning, knowledge, and judgement can lead to the richest possible use of technology in our work and everyday lives.",

Each focuses on different critical factors in its success at the individual, group, and community levels. The technical and management decisions of Linus Torvalds the individual were critical in laying the groundwork for a collaborative software development project that has lasted almost a decade. The contributions of volunteer programmers distributed worldwide enabled the development of an operating system on the par with proprietary operating systems. The Linux electronic community was the organizing structure that coordinated the efforts of the individual programmers. The paper concludes by summarizing the factors important in the successful distributed development of the Linux kernel, and the implications for organizationally managed distributed work arrangements.",

    "abstract": "Students entering distance education programs often find themselves adapting to new learning environments and new technologies. Part of this adaptation involves coping with unfamiliar technology and learning to manage its use within the group, helping them create the environment in which they will learn. Part of it involves developing personal relationships that will ease their work and learning, helping them cope with unfamiliarity and change. Examining suggestions from distance learning students on how to cope with this process yields three-fold results. First, it demonstrates how students, instructors and administrators need to work together to ease student's paths. Second, it helps us in advising distance learning students about what they can expect from distance learning, and how they can contribute to and benefit from their distance learning community. Finally, it provides recommendations to instructors and program directors on how better to help their students cope with this community building transition and distance learning environment.",

When the Project ends in September 2000, the Project team will have preserved thousands of items, including sound recordings, photographs, sheet music, lyric sheets, and more, pertaining to the life and work of this master of the American popular song. Much of this content is already accessible to the public through a multimedia Web site. More digital content and improved search capabilities will be added in the coming months. While the Project builds upon previous experience and expertise, the complexity of the Project has presented numerous challenges. This paper describes some of these challenges and their resolution, along with a brief discussion of remaining issues.",

One result is that very few Internet consumers actually pay for network content, instead offering up personal information as they go. Content providers then collect, buy, and sell this information. To bring the Internet economy into its next stage of development, complementary software and legal architectures must be created in which personal information is regarded as a commercial property right, and accorded corresponding monetary value.",

The School of Library and Information Sciences in cooperation with the School of Visual Arts received a 1998 National Leadership Grant from the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services to build a collaborative program that includes a digital imaging laboratory and fellowships for students in a Certificate of Advanced Study Program.\n The work of the digital image manager includes the production of visual images, the creation and management of databases, and the ability to use advanced network and information technologies to improve access to digital images and information. The program of study prepares individuals to work as digital image managers in museums, libraries, archives, and other information centers.\n The Project provides a unique educational experience made possible by the cooperation between a museum and a university. Students digitize objects from the Museum collection and build an image database that will be accessible on the Web. The experience includes the use of video-conference technologies to enhance collaboration between the Museum and the University. Students communicate with the Museum staff, work on images and database information simultaneously, and share experiences immediately. By linking the digital image laboratory and the African American Museum, students have every opportunity to learn from museum professionals as well as from the University community.",

Even if the academic course work of higher education can be replicated online, what cannot are the organized extracurricular activities which have been a crucial component of a traditional college education. These activities create social capital, prepare students for civic engagement and combat the self-absorbed individualism which undermines democratic society. We would do well to think about their loss, and the unintended social consequences which flow from adopting the Virtual University as a model for higher education in the twenty-first century.",

    "abstract": "We often speak of democracy as a mere decision-making procedure rather than as a \"form of life.\" Part of the reason for this formalism is the difficulty of revealing the aspects of individual and social existence that provide the impetus toward democracy and that democratic practices should reflect and augment. I argue that the Internet's status as a \"virtual\" rather than actual reality (its status as a serendipitous form of what phenomenologists call an epocheor a \"placing within brackets\" of our standard beliefs) reveals some of the more important aspects underlying democracy. In particular, the Internet's virtual status indicates that society is what I term a \"metamorphosing multi-voiced body.\" This implies that democracy off-line and online must support the interplay or solidarity among the \"voices\" of this body (as opposed to their mere plurality) and simultaneously respect their heterogeneity. It must adopt the \"interplay of equally audible voices\" as its political ideal. Because this interplay among voices produces new discourses, democracy's valorization of the multi-voiced body must also affirm the metamorphosis that society's creativity brings about. I also consider what this view of democracy means for current issues concerning the fate and character of the Internet as well for the clash between the liberal, communitarian, and deliberative views of online democracy.",

    "abstract": "The coming economic era and precepts are emerging as totally different from industrial capitalism. We're learning that e-businesses and their networks destroy many of our basic concepts of production, marketing and distribution. Jeremy Rifkin [1] notes that in this \"Age of Access\" we are entering an era in which lifelong customer relationships are the ultimate commodities market. This provides a different, more positive, and perhaps more likely view.\n The Internet is changing business models and empowering consumers to create new communities that combine the power to aggregate rich sources of individually personalized data in real-time activities. Large-scale data aggregators are emerging to navigate and mediate info markets. While information records are proliferating, new standards for content capture and management are appearing. Most companies continue to hope they will control their customers' information assets. However, what if this is not true or becomes impossible? What if consumers decide to band together and control their own personal information? Are you ready to freely give your customers their data records? Are you prepared to live up to the COMsumer Manifesto?\n \n This article offers a disruptive antidote to the hierarchical, closed, supply-system, explicit, knowledge-driven, \"We Know What You Want\" data mine world where many customers feel powerless. This is a world well beyond 1999's \"Net Worth\" [2] and 2000's \"The Cluetrain Manifesto\" [3]. Infomediaries are not just trustworthy agents which sit between the vendor and the customer [2], and markets are not just conversations [3]. In this new world, communities sense needs, desires, and wishes for the future and create new data markets - to which organizations must respond or die! We are closing in on the \"tipping point\" [4] where COMsumers take complete control of their destiny by collectively owning their personal information assets.",

    "title": "Information seeking on the Web: An integrated model of browsing and searching",
    "abstract": "This paper presents findings from a study of how knowledge workers use the Web to seek external information as part of their daily work. Thirty-four users from seven companies took part in the study. Participants were mainly IT specialists, managers, and research/marketing/consulting staff working in organizations that included a large utility company, a major bank, and a consulting firm. Participants answered a detailed questionnaire and were interviewed individually in order to understand their information needs and information seeking preferences. A custom-developed WebTracker software application was installed on each of their work place PCs, and participants' Web-use activities were then recorded continuously during two-week periods. The WebTracker recorded how participants used the browser to seek information on the Web: it logged menu choices, button bar selections, and keystroke actions, allowing browsing and searching sequences to be reconstructed. In a second round of personal interviews, participants recalled critical incidents of using information from the Web.\n Data from the two interviews and the WebTracker logs constituted the database for analysis. Sixty-one significant episodes of information seeking were identified. A model was developed to describe the common repertoires of information seeking that were observed. On one axis of the model, episodes were plotted according to the four scanning modes identified by Aguilar (1967), Weick and Daft (1983): undirected viewing, conditioned viewing, informal search, and formal search. Each mode is characterized by its own information needs and information seeking strategies. On the other axis of the model, episodes were plotted according to the occurrence of one or more of the six categories of information seeking behaviors identified by Ellis (1989, 1990): starting, chaining, browsing, differentiating, monitoring, and extracting. The study suggests that a behavioral framework that relates motivations (Aguilar) and moves (Ellis) may be helpful in analyzing patterns of Web-based information seeking.",

    "title": "Using the World Wide Web to enhance classroom instruction",
    "abstract": "The use of the World Wide Web (WWW) as an instructional tool is gaining momentum as more teachers, instructors, and trainers incorporate it into their repertoire. Grouped together, any instruction that makes use of a computer is called Computer Based Training (CBT), and those strategies that employ the Web as the repository for instructional information are known as Web-Based Instruction (WBI). WBI can be employed in a distance education model or as an adjunct to teacher-led classrooms.\n Specifically, WBI can be used to meet the needs of a more diverse student group. Typical classes consist of students with varying abilities and previous knowledge, and WBI can help a teacher address these differences. WBI also allows students to work a pace that is more comfortable - some students work faster than their peers while others may wish to take longer. In addition, the use of WBI provides the opportunity for multiple grade levels to be accommodated in the same classroom at the same time.\n From a teacher's perspective, SBI can help with many daily management tasks by reducing the paper flow required for paper-based instruction, allowing for quick and easy revisions to instructional materials, and ensuring that instructional materials are always available to students. In addition, because the bulk of instruction is delivered via the Web, the teacher is free to spend time working with individual students and small groups; less time is spent in whole-class instruction.\n An added bonus of Web-Based Instruction is the fact that it can offer students a \"virtual teacher\" because students can access the instructional materials anytime, anywhere. This allows students who were absent the opportunity to access instructional materials away from school, and even the possibility to accommodate students in a course when their schedule is full.",

    "title": "Providing content and facilitating social change: Electronic media in rural development based on case material from Peru",
    "abstract": "In his famous book Understanding media, Marshall McLuhan discusses the impact he expects (networked) electronic media to have on the world. Since then the emergence of a 'global village' has become a universally accepted idea. McLuhan is perhaps more to the point when he observes that \"The organic everywhere supplants the mechanical. Dialogue supersedes the lecture\" (McLuhan, 1964; pp. 255-256). This paper takes a cue from McLuhan and discusses the way different types of information flows reveal the underlying power structures related to the provision and exchange of information. In line with McLuhan it is argued that 'dialogue', or information exchange, through networked media will have to play a role of increasing importance in development, whereby dialogues will have 'horizontal' and 'vertical' dimensions. Networked media are in that way to facilitate rural networking and social change. In its essence information provision, or 'lecture' is claimed to strengthen existing power structures, to create dependencies and to lead to a mismatch between information demand and supply. Despite the fact that networked electronic media are favored for rural development, they obviously do not have the same reach and levels of access and accessability as the traditional electronic media do. Another distinction between media is the type of information and content they are able to convey in a message, whereby significant differences between traditional and networked electronic media can be distinguished. Based on the two above mentioned distinctions between electronic media combinations of electronic media are suggested for use in rural development, both to improve the quality of the information provided and to change existing information and communication related power structures.",

    "abstract": "As we build cyberspace, it is up to us, as individuals, not to promote illiteracy and proprietary standards that shut out those who fail to purchase computer programs from a specific vendor. It has become fashionable to blame others, such as Microsoft, for creating what is known as the \"dark ages of computing\". However, I suggest that we can and should look to ourselves as the source of the problem. In this article, I propose the \"public park\" analogy as a first point of departure from current critical thinking, and as a framework with which to better understand possible conflict of interest in government and education. Moreover, in the age of Personal Cybernetics (personal electronics, wearable computing, implantables.com, etc.), this issue will become all the more important. When \"technology as extensions of mind and body\" is no longer a metaphor, will we have already sold our heart and soul for software of a particular corporation, or will our thoughts be free?",

I will also look at how the Internet is being used to promote Cuba as an upmarket tourist destination, tourism now being Cuba's most valuable source of foreign currency and, therefore, critical to its ailing economy.\n Cuba's telecommunications infrastructure is poor and outdated which, when combined with the severe restrictions placed on the Cuban population, makes Internet access beyond the reach of most Cuban citizens. Cuban opposition groups, based mostly in the United States, do not face these barriers and, in the second part of this paper, I will examine how a number of these organisations are using the Internet to promote their anti-Government agendas and counter the state 'propaganda' machine.",

After setting the stage by discussing the use of information and communications technologies (ICTs) by Sen. John McCain in the primary campaign, the researchers evaluate the Web sites of four major candidates for President of the United States over the course of the general election. Additionally, this article serves as a digital archive of Web pages caught at what many believe is the nascent stage of what might come to be the dominant medium for political communications in the decades to come.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a two-year project at Cornell University Library to develop an archiving solution to safeguard Cornell's digital image collections, consisting of two and a half million images created over a decade. The Project has inventoried Cornell's digital image collections, investigated current and emerging file formats for long-term utility, explored functional requirements for storage, and drafted recommendations for requisite preservation metadata. These efforts demonstrated the need to develop institutional policies and resources to facilitate long-term maintenance. The final goal of this Project, therefore, is the development of a mainstreaming effort to move digital preservation from a project to program mode. A Digital Preservation Policy Working Group has been assembled that will present its recommendations to the Library Management Team in September 2000. Their report will cover requirements for conversion and metadata, a technical strategy for storage, maintenance, and long-term care, and an assessment of the resources needed to maintain these digital assets.",

    "abstract": "Standards development is particularly difficult within the digital library arena, primarily because the most active players have not yet formed a true community in the sense of having evolved a common vocabulary, commonality of interest, or structures for collaboration and communication. Competition, the need to allow for innovation and experimentation, and the need for speed in a rapidly changing technological environment all help to foster a culture that does not necessarily value standards. Appropriate responses can help encourage the development of standards even in this environment. Among these is the recognition that collections of practices, best practices, local and global guidelines, normative standards and implementers' agreements can all be useful under different circumstances, and to aim for the level of standarization most appropriate to the situation.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the development of a set of workflow management tools (WMS) that will reduce the manual input necessary to manage the workflow of large-scale digitization projects. The WMS will also support the path from physical object and/or digitized material into a digital library repository by providing effective tools for perusing multimedia elements. The Lester S. Levy Collection of Sheet Music Project at the Milton S. Eisenhower Library at The Johns Hopkins University provides an ideal testbed for the development and evaluation of the WMS. Building upon the previous effort to digitize the entire Collection of over 29,000 pieces of sheet music, optical music recognition (OMR) software will create sound files and full-text lyrics. The combination of image, text and sound files provide a comprehensive multimedia environment. The functionality of the Collection will be enhanced by the incorporation of metadata, the implementation of a disk-based search engine for lyrics, and the development of toolkits for searching sound files.",

An operational definition of interactivity, including 18 measures, is developed and applied to an empirical study of 100 online newspapers. The study asks whether or not financing (profit vs. non-profit), type (pure Web-based vs. printed versions) and origin (U.S. vs. international) of online newspapers affect the degree of interactivity at the sites.",

    "abstract": "In order for public libraries to ameliorate the \"digital divide\" in their local communities, this paper presents a socially grounded and participative process for facilitating access to networked digital information for marginalized groups. Through the Afya Project, a participatory action research approach to digital library design is taken that targets the barriers in access to health information and services experienced by African American women in the community. SisterNet, a local grassroots social network of African American women committed to addressing physical, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual health issues, is a partner for the Afya Project. SisterNet has played a significant role in recruiting African American women as community action researchers to participate in data collection and analysis related to the development, implementation, and assessment of Web-based resources. Use scenarios in socially grounded user studies are being employed as a key methodological technique to design culturally appropriate and usable Web-based health information services that will help African American women in the community achieve their vision of better health.",

Thus, in virtual reality, knowing easily becomes a struggle for power over things to be known and over knowers. The exchange of ideas and information becomes a battle of wills, a futile and dispiriting activity. This problem is especially serious in distance learning conducted in virtual reality. How can authenticity be restored? By nurturing collaborative inquiry rather than competitive hierarchy among teachers and students.",

Specifically, it presents and compares rates of penetration and use, and analyses their evolution over time. While one or two EPs perform significantly better than the others, retailer acceptance and consumer uptake invariably fall short of expectations. This does not bode well for the use of EPs on the Internet, and particularly since the virtual world presents a number of additional hurdles. On the other hand, it may also present additional opportunities.",

    "abstract": "As the Internet is spreading around the globe, a problem is created concerning its impact on the local cultures. This paper argues that the relation between computer-mediated communication technologies and local cultures is characterized neither by a homogenizing effect, where the technologies bring about one global monolithic culture, nor by an erecting of barriers separating one culture from another, where there is no impact at all. Instead, local cultures usually find ways to cope with the impact and are resilient enough to absorb it without losing some kind of identity. A case study is presented on a local Internet scene in Thailand to see how Thai culture co-opts the Internet and how its identity is being constantly negotiated.",

Nearly all 1,200 community colleges in the U.S. offer some type of environmental courses. Over 100 community colleges offer one-year certificate or two-year associate degree programs in environmental technology.\n The constant change in federal, state, and local environmental, health, and safety regulations impacts and quickly dates the curricula in environmental programs. New regulations, discoveries, and emerging technologies change the nature of the knowledge and skills required of environmental technicians. Community college libraries have fixed budgets that may curtail purchasing the wide array of supplemental materials that are current with developments in the field. This problem is drawn into even sharper focus as increasing numbers of colleges offer environmental programs via distance learning. ATEEL is an innovative, online library designed to serve the specialized needs of community college environmental technology students, instructors, and workers throughout the nation.",

Mobile Internet technologies and practical applications necessary for widespread public use are advancing rapidly in Japan and are likely to catch on quickly in other countries. The remarkable adoption of mobile Internet in Japan and the popularity of digital music file sharing services such as Napster in the United States create a situation in which powerful synergies are possible between these two fundamental forces. Digital music via mobile Internet creates attractive opportunities for music artists, music consumers, entrepreneurs, and major music labels facing an uncertain future for music industry distribution practices. The realization of such opportunities depends not only on technological and business innovations, but also on the willingness among all parties involved to collaborate in equitable and valuable ways.",

    "abstract": "In a series of four studies, student postings on newsgroups created for their courses at Carleton University were monitored, and opinions were gathered from samples of students and instructors regarding their newsgroup activities. Results show that an overwhelming majority of students never posted messages on newsgroups, nor did their instructors. In addition, a large majority of students rarely read what others had posted. Students were more likely to post messages when graded for doing so and when encouraged by the active involvement of their instructors, though the quality of the resulting discussions remained questionable. The few instructors who were enthusiastic about the educational potential of course newsgroups worried about the large amounts of time spent on reading, answering, and grading students' postings and about the lack of career rewards for these activities. The results clearly indicate that course newsgroups have limited educational value until students and instructors find more time and motivation to make more and better use of the medium.",

The different worlds of television, telephone and data processing are beginning to share similar technologies and are starting to develop overlaps. This technological \"convergence\" spurs an array of other convergence moves in products, markets and businesses. \n \nThis leaves industrial, commercial and public policy makers in Europe with three major questions: \n \nHow is the CE product spectrum changing, with regard to services, usage and markets? \nHow is the global structure of the CE industry changing and what effect could this have on corporate strategies in the European Union? \nWhich public policies could be important in this context and what underlying research is needed? \n \nThis article is constructed as to give an answer on the last question by means of answering the first two. In doing so, it offers state of the art knowledge, but the authors would like to stress that during their research one of the main problems they found is the lack of research on this topic.",

    "title": "Hello, out there: A look at distance education in Alaska",
    "abstract": "This study examines the state of distance education in Alaska. Providing public education has offered long-standing challenges to educators and policy makers in the state since the indigenous peoples of Alaska were introduced to Western education. This is especially so at the secondary and post-secondary levels. Factors such as a low population density, isolated and remote villages, a high teacher attrition rate, a low number of Alaskans (particularly Alaska Natives) in the classroom as licensed teachers, and a challenging environment contribute to the situation.\n The University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) has had a longstanding commitment to provide post-secondary education to students in rural Alaska. By surveying individuals involved in distance education in the state, this study found that distance education is primarily being delivered by audio conferencing and prepared curriculum modules. In an effort to meet the educational needs in rural Alaska at the post-secondary level, administrators and faculty are working to increase the number of courses delivered by distance education using asynchronous communication.\n There were over 1,000 distance-delivered courses at the post-secondary level in Alaska delivered by the various campuses within the University of Alaska System during the 1999-2000 academic year. The typical distance education student in UA System is female, in her 30's, and likely to be White. Twenty-five percent of students taking distance education courses in various UA campuses were identified as Alaska Native, which is significant since they constitute 15 percent of the state population. Students taking distance education courses from any of the University of Alaska sites took an average of two courses per semester.\n There is a need for greater coordination among the different sites delivering distance education courses and training for faculty in a more consistent manner. Information and access to course work should be made more readily available to all post-secondary students within and outside the state. Further research is necessary on gender disparity and on the relatively high number of Alaska Native students taking distance education courses.",

    "abstract": "An extensive analysis of user traffic on Gnutella shows a significant amount of free riding in the system. By sampling messages on the Gnutella network over a 24-hour period, we established that almost 70% of Gnutella users share no files, and nearly 50% of all responses are returned by the top 1% of sharing hosts. Furthermore, we found out that free riding is distributed evenly between domains, so that no one group contributes significantly more than others, and that peers that volunteer to share files are not necessarily those who have desirable ones. We argue that free riding leads to degradation of the system performance and adds vulnerability to the system. If this trend continues copyright issues might become moot compared to the possible collapse of such systems.",

    "title": "Overcoming regulatory and technological challenges to bring Internet access to a sparsely populated, remote area: A case study",
    "abstract": "The South African Government has launched a drive to provide Telecentres to communities and Internet access to schools. The Telecentres are normally centrally located with respect to clusters of schools and other community services. In the context of this drive, a Telecentre was established in Manguzi, a remote town in the KwaZulu Natal province in South Africa. The surrounding schools did not benefit from this centre due to the inappropriate distance between the schools and Telecentre. In addition, the schools could not be connected to Internet directly due to the absence of telephones. In this case study we will show that existing \"off-the-shelf\" technologies were not applicable to the specific situation and hence there was a need for a new solution.\n There are unusual challenges in providing Internet connectivity to a \"sparsely\" populated rural community separated by vast distances from nearest urban development. This case study details how we combined existing Internet access technologies to overcome various obstacles such as the lack of existing telecommunications infrastructure, remoteness of area, as well as political and economic issues. Furthermore the solution implemented had to be cheap, suited to the specific regulatory and geographic environment, robust and suitable for a particular application, namely Web browsing and e-mail.\n We used the asymmetric nature of the data requirements of the specific applications to our advantage, using radio links and satellite broadcast technology to provide the required connectivity. We will discuss the expected merits of the new solution and its implementation. We will also present our practical findings and discuss how it compared to our expectations.\n Similar needs and situations exist in other parts of the world, especially those that have a lack of telecommunications infrastructure, very remote rural areas that are very sparsely populated. We hope that the outputs of this paper can contribute to the technology decisions of people responsible for rolling out Internet infrastructure in similar environments.",

    "title": "Speculative microeconomics for tomorrow's economy",
    "abstract": "Governments and societies that bet on the market system become more materially prosperous and technologically powerful. The lesson usually drawn from this economic success story is that in the overwhelming majority of cases the best thing the government can do for the economy is to set the background rules - define property rights, set up honest courts, perhaps rearrange the distribution of income, impose minor taxes and subsidies to compensate for well-defined and narrowly-specified \"market failures\" - but otherwise the government should leave the market system alone.\n The main argument for the market system is the dual role played by prices. On the one hand, prices serve to ration demand: anyone unwilling to pay the market price does not get the good. On the other hand, price serves to elicit production: any organization that can make a good, or provide a service, for less than its market price has a powerful financial incentive to do so. What is produced goes to those who value it the most. What is produced is made by the organizations that can make it the cheapest. And what is produced is whatever the ultimate users value the most.\n The data processing and data communications revolutions shake the foundations of the standard case for the market. In a world in which a large chunk of the goods valued by users are information goods that can be cheaply replicated, it is not socially optimal to charge a price to ration demand. In a world in which cheap replication produces enormous economies of scale, the producers that survive and profit are not those that can produce at the least cost or produce the goods that users value the most; instead, the producers that flourish are those that established their positions first. In a world in which the value chain is only tangentially related to ultimate value to users - in which producers earn money by selling eyeballs to advertisers, say - there is no certainty that what is produced will be what users value the most.\n The market system may well prove to be tougher than its traditional defenders have thought, and to have more subtle and powerful advantages than those that defenders of the invisible hand have usually listed. At the very least, however, defenders will need new arguments. And at the most, we will need to develop a new economics to discern new answers to the old problem of economic organization.",

    "abstract": "While the idea of an electronic-based locator system to help citizens easily find information by and about government (commonly known as government information locator systems, or GILS) is not new, Washington State approached the development of its GILS program in a different way. This GILS emerged from the work of a legislatively created, government official/citizen task force designed to increase public access to government information. The Washington State Library (WSL) developed not only a metatag-based locator system, but also a marketing and training program to make government agency participation easier and more attractive. The system itself was developed from the user's point of view to make it more intuitive for users with a variety of computer skills levels.\n With the assistance of a National Leadership Grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), Washington State has successfully replicated its GILS system in several other states and raised the visibility of the issue of state library agency leadership in this aspect of information management. As a result, a growing number of states are developing similar systems. A second IMLS grant to Washington State will formally explore and pursue opportunities for interstate interoperability of locator systems.",

Globalization is affecting this industry more than many other industries and it is primarily induced by developments in Information Technology.

The oddly global and local structure of the music industry [,premised on copyrights, might] be undergoing some fundamental changes. The roles of music publishers and record companies especially [may be] about to alter.

[The original article was featured in the May of 2000 issue of First Monday - much has changed since then, but much of my original text still seems to have some validity. What may have changed, however, are the likely prospects for this industry, especially for incumbent firms.]",

    "title": "Social science at 190 MPH on NASCAR's biggest superspeedways",
    "abstract": "In aerodynamically intense stock-car races like the Daytona 500, the drivers form into multi-car draft lines to gain extra speed. A driver who does not enter a draft line (slipstream) will lose. Once in a line, a driver must attract a drafting partner in order to break out and try to get further ahead. Thus the effort to win leads to ever-shifting patterns of cooperation and competition among rivals. This provides a curious laboratory for several social science theories: (1) complexity theory, since the racers self-organize into structures that oscillate between order and chaos; (2) social network analysis, since draft lines are line networks whose organization depends on a driver's social capital as well as his human capital; and (3) game theory, since racers face a \"prisoner's dilemma\" in seeking drafting partners who will not defect and leave them stranded. Perhaps draft lines and related \"bump and run\" tactics amount to a little-recognized dynamic of everyday life, including in structures evolving on the Internet.",

    "abstract": "This article focuses on two issues with regard to the policy debate on the regulation of access of communication systems. The first issue deals with the concepts that are commonly used in communication policy with regard to the regulation of `access', i.e. universal service and public service. The article then goes on to challenge the validity and usefulness of these concepts in the new communications environments. The analysis points at many shortcomings in this respect. Attention is focused consequently on what communication policy in a networked society - or information society - should take into account. Here the main argument is that communication policy has to shift from media policy to social policy. What this means for regulating access, and its two main concepts, will be briefly outlined.",

Findings suggest we believe `other people' are responding to media messages about the internet, perpetuating beliefs that internet use is higher than it actually is, and that we are further behind other people than we actually are.  Evidence of third-person perception and overestimation of internet use were found. An understanding of internet anxiety can help structure messages for mass audiences, and lead to more efficient and appropriate use of the internet by business. ",

    "abstract": " Much of the rhetoric that surrounds the so-called `electronic frontier' of the new communication technologies has emerged at a moment when discourses about borders, margins and exiles are also proliferating in the arts and in critical writing. What Mark Poster has called the `second media age', which he sees as constituting a mode of information fundamentally different to broadcast media, can also be seen as defining a period in which electronic technologies service individuals and populations who are culturally and geographically displaced on a scale previously unknown in history.  The article critically interrogates the writings of Mark Poster, Mark C. Taylor and Esa Saarinen as theorists of the new media and draws from different articulations of exile by Edward Said, Theodor Adorno and Hamid Naficy to present an alternative theoretical response to contemporary electronic culture.

Some of these products even reflect some kind of feminist programme to make girls and young women more interested and better qualified to exploit new information and communication technologies. The article analyses two Norwegian examples of such initiatives, a CD-ROM called JenteROM and a webservice called HjemmeNett, based on interviews with the most prominent actors of the respective design constituencies. The analysis focuses on the ways gender is constructed in multimedia form and content, in order to explicate gender as a process of social learning. What is observed is a set of ongoing transformations of gender as well as computers, related to controversies about proper definitions of gender and femininity as well as about how new media content and form should be designed in order to cater to women's interests.

There has been a widespread integration of computer technology into newspaper production over the last 10 years and this has led to the production of images through qualitatively different production techniques. This article will examine, through fieldwork, the practices of photographic journalism, the transformation of picture desks into electronic environments for image control and the perception of picture producers as to the feasibility of enhancing the aesthetic quality of a photograph without tampering with its other qualities.

This article takes an early step in filling that gap. In-depth interviews with 10 individuals who work and teach in the field of interactive communication led to a conceptual definition of interactivity based on six dimensions: direction of communication, time flexibility, sense of place, level of control, responsiveness, and perceived purpose of communication. Suggestions are made for applying these dimensions to multiple forms of computer-mediated communication. Future research should empirically test the existence and application of these dimensions. ",

They are: the increasingly abstract and alienated nature of economic value; the subsumption of all labour — material and intellectual — under systemic capital; and the convergence of formerly distinct spheres of analysis — the spheres of production, circulation and consumption. This article examines the implications of the knowledge economy from an historical materialist perspective. I synthesize the systemic views of Marx (1846 [1972], 1875 [1972], 1970, 1973, 1976, 1978, 1981), Adorno (1951 [1974], 1964 [1973], 1991), Horkheimer and Adorno (1947 [1998]), Jarvis (1998) and Bourdieu (1991, 1998) to argue for a language-focused approach to new media research and suggest aspects of Marxist thought which might be useful in researching emergent socio-technical domains. I also identify specific categories in the Marxist tradition which may no longer be analytically useful for researching the effects of new media. ",

The article is based on empirical research of the development of telematics in the East End of London. It is argued that the use and development of a technology expresses a social vision, creates a powerful symbol and engages us in a form of life. In the case of telematics this involves addressing a rethinking of citizenship along the lines of consumerism, and understanding how that interacts with the development of telematics in local contexts such as the East End. This grounds an understanding of the innovation of telematics in the material, social and cultural aspects of a cultural form, which in so doing helps to assess telematics' role and value in the contemporary public sphere.

    "title": "Intra-Institutional Rivalry and Policy Entrepreneurship in the European Union",
    "abstract": " The topic of information and communications technology (ICT) convergence is now of primary interest to policy makers in industry and government at the national and international level, as well as the academic community. In 1997, the European Commission published a Green Paper on the matter, and subsequently launched a consultation process which resulted in a series of re-regulatory proposals as part of the 1999 Communications Review. In recent years, there has been considerable evidence of Commission pro-activity and agenda setting in telecommunications and broadcasting. This article argues that ICT convergence policy is an interesting case of both policy entrepreneurship and intra-institutional rivalry within the Commission. Here, the ambitious initial proposals of interests in the Commission in favour of creating a uniform, light-touch regulatory ICT regime at EU level were significantly modified in the light of opposition from the Commission's own quarters, other EU institutions, the national political level and the broadcasting sector. As a result, it appears that in the immediate future there will be only limited, though still very significant, development of a convergent approach to ICT regulation, in the form of measures dealing with infrastructure and associated services.

    "abstract": " This article takes a social learning perspective to examine the development of a community information service in terms of the changing computer interfaces used and their relations to a variety of more or less competing discourses around the related concepts of community, access and service. We show how both the enthusiasm of internet proponents and the pessimism of writers such as Castells does not take account of the complex interplay of local and global concepts of what the information society can be. Taking a sceptical middle course between, we show how some of the debates around the `information society' elide some crucial distinctions in the development of community information services. Through an ethnographic analysis we show how these discourses have been worked out in struggles around the development of appropriate interfaces for a community information service. ",

    "abstract": " Current notions of social exclusion are to an extent anchored in older concerns with relative poverty, which had the merit of considering not just material deprivation but also the social and cultural dimensions of participation or exclusion. The focus of this article is on the role of ICTs in relation to people's ability to participate in society. It draws upon detailed qualitative research on single parent and young elderly households to explore what counts as experiences of inclusion or exclusion and the processes behind them. Dealing mainly, but not exclusively, with the more traditional ICTs of telephony and broadcasting, the article considers processes of self-exclusion as people have mixed evaluations of these technologies derived both from current circumstances and past experiences. It then looks beyond the acquisition of ICTs to show how other modes of access to these resources are important before reflecting upon the quality of experience of ICTs, not just in terms of the functionality on offer but also taking into account that technologies are themselves symbolic goods. Finally, and drawing on more recent research, the article asks what lessons might be learnt from these traditional ICTs when considering newly emerging ones like the internet. ",

The recent advent of synchronous, automatic translation systems (SATS), incorporated into the internet, are but the first sign of a communications revolution as profound as the invention of print. This article briefly surveys the following: (1) text/speech recognition and translation problems; (2) current developments in machine translation (MT) and artificial intelligence (AI) devoted to resolving these problems; and (3) potential future SATS technological developments and uses. The second half of the article is devoted to a wide-ranging analysis of several potentially profound future political, economic and cultural consequences of SATS. The main conclusion points to a paradox: although (perhaps because) SATS will lead to greater linguistic (and external-cultural) differentiation, the overall impact will be centripetal - greater integration among the world's peoples, more international peace, and a general higher level of agreement regarding norms and values.

In general, in this article, I argue that CMC theory and research has been limited by the `textual bias' of previous scholars. CMC researchers and theorists must begin to reconstruct the communicative, rhetorical and epistemological features of multi-media CMC in order to describe and explain communication in cyberspace. Through an integrated, inter-disciplinary program of multi-methodological empirical research, scholars can build theory that better accounts for multi-media CMC. ",

Federal hearings and other documents written between 1988 and 1996 are analyzed to create a typology of possible harms caused by CID, including the potential for CID to be used in the stalking of women by abusive men.  Four examples of CID usage that led to a murder of a spouse or lover were located through NEXIS searches of electronic newspaper archives. Analysis of these cases suggest that: stalking has not been a common feature of murder cases involving CID; men have been equally likely to be victims as women; half of the cases have taken place in one of the two states with no restrictions on CID; in half the cases it was the misinterpretation of CID information, rather than the data itself, that led to the murders; and in half the cases the victim's CID device was used against them.

    "abstract": " Personal relationships are noted for intimacy, frequent interaction, the maintenance of multiple relations, face-to-face contact and a desire for proximity. What happens to such relationships when face-to-face contact is unavailable or severely limited? How do pairs maintain personal relationships at a distance and via computer-mediated communication, and what do their personal networks look like under these conditions? Social network data from four computer-supported distance learning classes are used to build a picture of the size and composition of students' personal online networks. Individuals reported on their communications regarding instrumental and social relations with others in their class, and on which media they used to maintain these relations. In keeping with social network studies, those who communicate more frequently maintain more relations and more socially supportive relations, and report more positively about their desire for future work and social interaction. Individuals benefit from closer ties by feeling a stronger belonging to the class and perceiving greater social interaction among class mates. Unique to the online multi-media environment, strongly tied pairs use more media to communicate and appropriate both the technology and occasions for interaction to maintain their ties. Interview data from members of the same program reveal that pairs with closer ties used computer media to create virtual proximity, whispering to each other via Internet Relay Chat during synchronous classes, and seeking out others via email late at night.

    "abstract": " It is often suggested that new media may provide a new means to preserve the diversity of cultural identities in an increasingly global media environment. In order to address this suggestion, this article first analyses different conceptions of new media/multimedia and how the dominant discourses at a national and European level tend to focus on the economic and technological potential of multimedia rather than its wider social or cultural role. The article continues by analysing how these wider discourses and trends interact with more local factors to shape the form and content of multimedia artefacts produced in four organizations based in Ireland. These organizations were attempting to produce multimedia artefacts specifically designed for Irish, French and German users. The article explicates the processes by which global technologies are actively shaped within local production and consumption contexts and highlights a number of important political, economic and social factors which actively shape attempts by organizations to develop diverse forms of multimedia content.

    "abstract": " A number of different theories have been proposed to explain the relationship between technological development and social change, including: technological determinism, symptomatic development and social constructionism. A popular and influential theory describing this relationship is technological determinism. An examination of the history of the computer's graphical user interface reveals that the original inventors of this technology were influenced by theorists associated with the determinist perspective. However, when creating their actual interfaces, early designers Douglas Engelbart and Alan Kay utilized methods that support a social constructionist view of technology development. Moreover, as new social interfaces emerge that incorporate software agents into the process of computer interaction, these new designs continue to support a constructionist approach. This article will describe the relationship between theories of technological determinism and the development of graphical user interfaces to argue that a social constructionist approach bridges the gap between theory and invention.

The contributors all tried to elaborate a new consensus on the status of personal identity in relation to real and virtual communities of belonging. They did so through a conscious attempt at analysis of the means of production and reproduction in cyberspace. The position of the magazine, militantly activist and always optimistic, set the tone for the social acceptability of the so-called computer revolution. This optimism can be explained by the socio-economical origins of its founders and of the public that they sought. An analysis of their editorial agenda allows us to reconstruct the discourse held by these pioneers of digital interaction, and their attempts at legitimizing their utopia of a technological democracy into a reality yet-to-be-created.

    "abstract": " The internet is often seen as a significant contributor to the globalization of culture and the economy. It is also seen as an inherently international medium, unimpeded by national borders and removed from the jurisdiction of the nation-state. This paper argues that although geographic borders may be removed from cyberspace, the social structures found in the `real' world are inscribed in online networks. By surveying 4000 web sites, it is determined that the organization of the world wide web conforms to some degree to traditional national borders. Web sites are, in most cases more likely to link to another site hosted in the same country than to cross national borders. When they do cross national borders, they are more likely to lead to pages hosted in the United States than to pages anywhere else in the world. ",

    "abstract": "On 30 April 1997, more than 32 million Americans watched Ellen, witnessing television history as Ellen Morgan became television’s first openly homosexual leading character. Amid the controversy and protests, one group of more than four million Americans actively refused to watch the much-hyped episode as part of a nationwide protest. This specific movement, however, was not protesting the program’s representations of sexuality nor reacting to any perceived immoral content within the episode. Rather, the boycott of Ellen was a byproduct of a larger protest against the medium of television itself, as an organization called TV-Free America sponsored its third annual TV-Turnoff Week, coincidentally concluding the day after Ellen’s coming-out party. Founded in 1994, TV-Free America “encourages Americans to reduce, voluntarily and dramatically, the amount of television they watch in order to promote richer, healthier, and more connected lives, families, and communities.” This organization promotes its philosophy of television reduction primarily by sponsoring the National TV-Turnoff Week, encouraging Americans to go without television for one week at the end of each April. These weeks are locally organized through schools, libraries, community councils, and city governments, and they seem to be quite successful, adding approximately one million participants in each successive year; TV-Free America boasts that more than eighteen million people have participated in these weeks since 1995. The TV-Turnoff Week approach has been attempted in various local incarnations since 1974, but TV-Free America has made their focus national. TV-Free America also provides resources and literature advo-",

As I flipped through the book, I dis cov ered faint pen cilled notes and dia grams scrib bled across its pages—the fifty-year-old traces of the man behind the man ual (see Fig ure 1). Sur prised to find signs of life in this dusty book I scru ti nized the notes a lit tle more closely, think ing I could incor po rate them into my research. What became most strik ing about these traces, how ever, was the feel ing of total incom pre hen sion they evoked in me. In my mind, there was noth ing “basic” about this book’s account of tele vi sion, and no mat ter how hard I tried, I could n’t under stand these high-tech doo dles because I lacked the tech ni cal knowl edge to decode them. I want to use this per sonal anec dote as a way to begin a dis cus sion about the cir cu la tion of tech ni cal knowl edge about tele vi sion dur ing the period 1949-1955. By tech ni cal knowl edge, I am refer ring to the mechan i cal and elec tri cal oper a tion as well as the instal la tion and main te nance of the tele vi sion set. From 1949 to 1955, the con sump tion of tele vi sion sets sky rock eted. The num ber of tele vi sion sets in Amer i can homes grew from 910,000 in 1948 to 37,590,000 by 1955 (Hansen 1956, 790).

    "title": "Review Essay on The Uses of Television, by John Hartley",
    "abstract": "The publication of John Hartley’s new book, The Uses of Television, could not be more timely. It appears at a time when the territorial disputes between television studies (as a branch of cultural studies), cinema studies, and traditional disciplines seem to be at a low-level skirmish. In some of the panel exchanges and hallway talk at the 1999 Cinema Studies Conference in West Palm Beach, Florida, there seemed to be a palpable lament, nostalgia even, over the passing of the high moment of cinema theory. This pining for the golden age of cinema theory is exemplary of many of the positions that target popular culture, political correctness, and intellectual fashion as the culprit in the erosion of the serious regard for serious art and serious intellectual study. This state of affairs is, at the very least, prompted if not driven by a suspicion—in some cases, hostility—toward cultural studies and within that formation, television studies. Where the field of cultural studies generates suspicion for its purported lack of theoretical rigor and its intellectual fashion, contempt for television (and by extension, those who watch it and that branch of study concerned with it) stems from its identity as a popular medium whose appeal is the crass commercialism of aggressive capitalism. This is of course a very old story, but so it goes. The Uses of Television also appears in the United States when the politics of representation, especially over questions of access, images, and the role of television in the production of the nation and citizenship, is once again a",

The nanny’s dress styles them selves are out ra geous: touch-below-the-crotch minis and breast-hug ging blouses or form-fit ting, full-length gowns—all out fits gar ishly col ored and pat terned, fre quently sequined, and invari ably worn with high heels and “big hair.” If we add to such vul gar, hypersexualized dis play the fact that many of the makeovers are by high-end design ers Bob Mackie, Todd Oldham, or Gianfranco Ferre and are punc tu ated by Drescher’s sig na ture tush-twist ing swish, it becomes abun dantly clear that we have exchanged the world of mimetic real ism for some bizarre/bazaar form of psychosocial fan tasy.",

    "abstract": "In 1994, one of the major theatre chains in Canada, Famous Players, became part of Sumner Redstone’s Viacom empire when he acquired Paramount. Soon after, Famous Players began to rattle unions, weaken job security, and generally make its employees as mobile and replaceable as possible. For example, the corporation, despite its own and Viacom’s soaring profits, demanded 60 percent wage cuts from its projectionists in Alberta. Similar demands have been made of other projectionist unions across the country, with frequent citation that technological change has altered and cheapened the work projectionists do. A six-month lockout and a (not especially well-respected) boycott of their theatres followed. On one occasion, no doubt inspired by rally speaker William Christopher (TV’s Father Mulcahy from MASH), protesters made their way through a theatre lobby in Calgary using what Famous Players called “goon tactics.” While the projectionist union denied that any of its members entered the theatre, the corporation claimed to have videotape evidence of an assault and property damage. No criminal charges were laid, though a cardboard cutout of Sandra Bullock was indeed trampled in the melee. The corporation unsuccessfully petitioned the Alberta Labour Relations Board for an injunction against picketing at their theatres, though the board ruled that the projectionists must",

For that cra ven fig ure ulti mately dies alone, sur rounded by rot ting goods and spent ser vices: ano mie is the fate of such iso lates, in the truly lonely hour of the last instance. To avoid such an end, the lib eral indi vid ual must also learn socia bil ity and col lab o ra tion. In our media-thick era, this desire for a dou ble-sided sub ject has pro duced a lit any of binary judgments: solo TV view ing bad, team bowl ing good; gam bling online bad, church atten dance good. In early 2000, 55 per cent of the U.S. pop u la tion was esti mated to have access to the internet—by far the high est abso lute num bers of any coun try in the world. But depres sion and lone li ness were dis pro por tion ately rep re sented among these den i zens of the internet, so much so that U.S. cul tural crit ics, func tion al ist soci ol o gists, and media mavens are con cerned that the lib eral indi vid ual has become unbal anced by it, with the self ish util i tar ian out weigh ing the pro-social vol un teer. Put another way, the cor ol lary of the internet’s spread across the nation is said to be the rise of sol i tude and a dim i nu tion in social activ ity—the loss, in short, of civil soci ety. Again, the lit any of binary judgments applies: less time shop ping in stores, but also less time spent with the fam ily; more time in the house, but more of that time work ing (Markoff 2000, A1). The other side to these num bers is that e-mail, not Web pur chase or other finan cial trans ac tions, is dom i nant—just 25 per cent of users buy online and less than 10 per cent bank that way, account ing for expen di ture of almost $15 bil lion in 1999 (Markoff 2000, A18; Vogel and Druckerman 2000).

    "abstract": "Who invented the internet? When he’s not busy claiming the status of a role model for Love Story, Al Gore sometimes includes this achievement in his curriculum vitae. He is not alone; chain bookstores feature memoirs by all manner of men making similar assertions. The truth is out there, however. Because while Al, his girlfriend Tipper, and his roommate Tommy Lee Jones were padding around Ivy-League dorms during late-night ice-cream feasts, the RAND Corporation was busily devising means of waging the Vietnam War. Its consultancy services did not end there, of course. Our friends over at the corporation also addressed the following question: What if the Soviet Union managed to strike at the heart of the domestic U.S. communications system? Asuccessful attack would leave the country disabled, unless a devolved network could be introduced. The packet system of today originated with that desire to decentralize computing through nodal, semiautonomous sites. In keeping with those origins—state-driven Cold War consultancies—the internet, as we all know, grew nested within public institutions of government and education, and the associated warfarewelfare para-bureaucracy of publicly funded but ostensibly independent research by private universities and firms. How, then, did cybertarianism emerge as an origin myth? And what is it?",

    "abstract": "“Art in Motion” (AIM), a new, international festival of time-based media arts, opened and closed its temporal window at the University of Southern California (USC) on 28 January 2000. Running nonstop at different sites throughout the campus from 9:45 in the morning until 7:30 in the evening, the event consisted of numerous screenings, an exposition of interactive and new media works, an audience-generated performance, a public reception, and an awards ceremony. The festival was founded and organized by Janet Owen and Jim Keller. Their goal was to attract responses from different media bases and place them together in one overarching context where time rather than media or genre would determine the admission of an entry. To accomplish this goal, they staged a competition offering a first prize in each of the following categories: feature, short, animation, and interactive/new media. The winning entries were selected by a renowned trio of judges: writer, art critic, and curator Bruce Hainley; producer of experimental documentaries on the arts and Director of Exhibitions, Santa Monica Museum of Art, Carole Ann Klonarides; and director, video artist, and writer John Sanborn. All entries were also considered for a $1,000 Intelefilm Award for Creative Excellence, sponsored by Intelefilm. By not limiting the call for entries to the choice of media but to the criterion that the work be time based, the AIM Steering Committee’s final selection, taken from more than 150 works submitted, included features, shorts, CD-ROMs, hand-drawn and digital animation, installations, and web sites. These works originated from Germany, Slovenia, Mexico, Great Britain, and Holland, as well as from all over the United States. To move across the lines that genre and media tend to draw as distinctions, with the lines of those teaching them and distributing them, seemed to be the most important and innovative component of this festival.

    "abstract": "This essay proposes digital video (DV) as a new centre of gravity for the design/production process of architecture and its kindred arts. DV's capacity to work with synthesised and captured images, that can be modelled and reverse engineered, offers a powerful mode of exploration, iterative development and communication for information-rich projects that depend on a complex mobilisation of team skills and technical resources. The promise of DV is that it taps into the great fund of visual/operational knowledge held in the culture at large, and that it can enable the design/production process to become more responsive and more open to a wider group of interested parties. The essay argues that the fulfilment of this promise becomes increasingly urgent as our moving-image-saturated environment melts the boundaries of place and time, and dissolves the distinctions that separates the permanence of architecture from the transience of events.",

    "abstract": "The authors use their different work and training background as perspectives for discussing the changing world of graphical design. In this digital world, expert knowledge of the technology is essential, but the authors argue that a consequence of prioritising technical expertise in the new interdisciplinary IT- design studies may be a loss of quality in design. To improve the depth in design the authors introduce a psychological framework for design work and on this basis they suggest a systematic method. The method is a 4-step conceptual model: reason, function, emotion and senses, and technology. The model interacts with all phases of the design, and functions as a generating-creating and execution-evaluation system. The authors emphasise that evaluation is embedded throughout the design process. They suggest that a systematic method becomes the guiding tool in interdisciplinary design education, an essential part of the students design qualifications as well as an essential tool in design work.",

    "abstract": "The increase in the hardware and software capabilities of interactive media has allowed an increase in the use of animated imagery within software learning environments. New animation software programs, targeted specifically for use on the World Wide Web (WWW) and CD-ROMs, have been introduced into the market place for programmers, designers and others who may have little training or experience with incorporating animated imagery into interactive content. This paper provides an overview of theories which relate to motion in the areas of education, science and culture. This paper is not meant to be an exhaustive source, but more of a reflective piece on work done in other fields that relates to animation within software. The final portion of this paper lists six common uses of animation in learning software, as well as ten recommended guidelines for evaluation of animations within a software learning environment.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores how the new communication technologies have impacted on the 'Graphic Information Design' BA Hons at the University of Westminster and uses a reading of the degree course documents from 1970 to the present day to identify and trace the history of this impact. The paper outlines, in particular, the development of the theoretical component of the course and argues that this component, known as contextual studies, has done little to address the impact of the new technologies and the radical paradigm shift from 'page' to 'screen'. It suggests that contextual studies should develop a more appropriate framework which would address these developments and details the content of one module 'Critical Theory' as a possible site for a more appropriate framework. In conclusion, it suggests that the Internet has greater potential than conventional teaching to deliver a more appropriate contextual studies programme; one which would also address the needs of graphic information design students into the 21st century.",

    "abstract": "The transposition from painting to architecture from two-dimensional entity to a spatial structure, became the core idea of a project designed for the students of architecture to encourage them to examine the possibilities of abstract expression in the conceptualisation of architectural ideas and strategies. A series of tasks were created to enable them to identify full expression and physical presence of movement in an abstract painting as transferable into architecture. There were then other tasks oriented towards discovering, investigating and recording various types of spatial conditions as potentially architectural. Fundamental issues related to Jackson Pollock's philosophy of painting are now finding a new dimension in the digital domain of 3D modelling techniques, supplying them with the tool capable of not only projecting the release of pure energy in virtual space but also of recording endless sequences of free gestures in time and space. These can then be rewritten in the form of a computer program as well as being controlled on a higher level of architectural design.",

    "abstract": "Computers can be very helpful to us by performing tasks on our behalf. For example, they are very good at performing calculations, storing information and producing visualisations of objects that do not yet exist as a made artifact. Increasingly, however, a different role is being found for the computer. It is the role of a catalyst, or a stimulant, to our own creative thinking. In such cases the computer is not primarily performing a task for us and generating an answer within itself, rather it is helping us to generate answers within ourselves. The computer helps us think creatively. This role for the computer can be illustrated in the context of computer support to creative design. In order to design computer systems that support the creative process, it is important to understand that process well enough to predict what might help, rather than hinder. Given such research, we may begin to define the characteristics of what the computer must do in order to augment creative thinking. The paper explores a particular application of intelligent user interfaces – the augmentation of creative thought in artists.",

    "title": "Technological latency : from autoplastic to alloplastic",
    "abstract": "Digital technologies can bring about a paradigm shift in architecture that reflects the ongoing cultural adaptation of society to an electronic environment. To achieve this we must consider current technical developments in psychological as much as technical terms. The concept of 'trauma' is important: it refers not to a strategic dis/re-orientation, but to a suspension of the possibility of orientation. The paper speculates on the relations of trauma to the patterns of creativity propagated by digital technology, in order to counter the re-incorporation of electronic technologies within traditional ideological frameworks. One might characterise this as a shift from an autoplastic (a self-determinate operative strategy) to an alloplastic (a reciprocal environmental modification) mode of operation. Three projects are described. The Pallas House project hints at new possibilities of numeric craft and decoration. In Aegis the surface deforms according to stimuli captured from the environment, which may be selectively deployed as active or passive sensors. The Paramorph is imagined as a series of tessellated aluminium surfaces which act as host to interactive sound sculpture, sound deployed in response to the passage of people moving through the form.",

    "title": "The design and evaluation of an interactive calculator for children",
    "abstract": "The aim of the research project reported here was to investigate the potential use of multimedia systems in teaching primary mathematics to pupils with learning difficulties. A multimedia interactive calculator (MIC), that combines learning materials with a calculator interface, has been designed as a result of classroom-based studies together with iterative prototype evaluation. The visual styling and operation of the MIC is the consequence of design decisions made in response to a user-need analysis carried out as part of this research. The MIC mediates between the concrete stage of learning number and the manipulations of symbolic arithmetical representations, particularly as they are used in the standard calculator, a transition which is difficult for many pupils to make. The work shows that multimedia systems can be helpful to children in making this transition. However, the authors agree that the careful use of an information design approach is needed to produce successful software. The MIC has been shown to be useful in teaching the concepts of number and the routines of addition and subtraction. Its interactive multiplication tables have helped pupils to discover number patterns and to improve their recall of number facts.",

    "abstract": "This paper relates current uses of digital technologies within architecture to historical attempts at integrating technology and architecture. In doing this a number of historical and current projects are presented. Different themes and practices are distinguished: 'presenting large-scale technical objects', 'making technical elements and processes visible', 'intensifying the effects and qualities of an object', 'space as mise-en-scène of technology', 'from replacing the object to de-materialising architecture'. At the heart of the analysis is the thesis that the digital has intensified the theatrical element within architecture, with technology mutating from a functional and representational object to a space for creating and exhibiting representations. Digital light and imaging techniques as part of architectural projects, their potential for mobilising built structures and for multiplying modes of perception and use are discussed.",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses the collaborative evolution of a digital system to provide support for landscape architects and other design professionals in storing, encountering and retrieving large bodies of 'inspirational objects', mostly in the form of images. The system combines visual 'weak indexing' of objects through placing them in a visual environment, with easy-to-use methods for allocating keywords to objects on a variety of dimensions. The system design is informed by ethnographic observations of landscape architects' work, and by experience gained with earlier prototypes. The features of the system are described, and illustrated with a scenario of use in landscape architectural work.",

It joins Diethelms’ Signet, signal, symbol (Zurich 1976), Frutiger’s Signs and symbols (Studio 1989), Tonfoni’s Writing as a visualising art (Intellect 1994), Goldsmith’s vast and deep Research into illustration (Cambridge 1984) and the June 1978 edition of Scientific American (the Schmandt-Besserat paper ‘The earliest precursor of writing’). The other books are over there ... What I particularly like about the present book is the way it bridges between semiotics (School of Peirce, Morris and Eco) and semiology (School of de Saussure, LeviStrauss and Barthes). Subject to very few reservations and questions, here is a richly illustrated commentary and reference work which can be regarded as almost a manual for designers, computer scientists and others who use, or plan to use, icon-based systems of message-exchange, discourse-exchange.",

    "title": "The student's construction of artistic truth in digital images",
    "abstract": "Images that clearly present a constructed physical truth, like digital images, remind us to question the reality factor of any image. Because many digital images appear to be photographic, or photographic-like, the medium forces artists to revisit what a photograph, and consequently a digital image, represents. In turn, this rethinking influences how students in computer art see reality and truth when they create digital imagery. Embracing this question, some digital artists have constructed visual narratives that appear photographic, yet lack the physical world referent that their images imply. Since the late 1980s and early 1990s, when this kind of construction became popular, many digital artists have grappled with how to identify the truth in their images. This study describes how some advanced digital art students resolved this conflict by defining their own artistic truths.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the limitations of contemporary interface design and offers the potential of more profound forms of interaction by drawing on the rich and much older heritage of interactive art. Whilst HCI design is preoccupied with making the computer more simple to use, installation work, kinetic sculpture, and interactive multimedia art forms have generally been more concerned with the predicament of human/technological negotiation, whilst remaining a salient form of human communication. HCI activity sets out to make the complex systems of computing easy to understand and use, whilst interactive art often uses simple technology to make complex, inspiring and esoteric statements and experiences. In many ways the more simple and 'low resolution' the technology the more immersive, acute and intimate the experience. 'Low resolution' examples such as telephone-sex-lines are explored alongside more immersive systems, such as biofeedback interfaces, and other interactive experiments drawn from the 'technic' strand of art history.",

    "abstract": "Future typographic and graphic designers will need to be able to design for a range of media, both to secure their role and to provide the necessary design expertise in technological environments. This paper proposes an approach to teaching which introduces theoretical issues within a practical design project to encourage the development of general concepts that can be transferred to different technologies. A specific project on designing for the screen is described, which is taught as part of a BA degree in Typography & Graphic Communication. In the context of this project, reasons for introducing theory are proposed, examples of the nature of the theory are given, and the methods used to introduce material are illustrated. A detailed account of one student's implementation of this project is used to demonstrate how theoretical issues can provide direction in a design task. However, careful consideration needs to be given to how theory and practice are integrated to encourage students to look beyond the short-term benefits of specific training to the development of more general knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Computer graphics may once have been driven forward by the needs of architects and designers, but those times have now passed. The centre of action has switched to the entertainment sector - particularly animated movies and computer games. While a few architects have shown an interest in the design of virtual space, there has been little flow the other way. But games software can be remarkably effective as an architectural tool. We look at how the more bloodthirsty kind of computer games can be subverted for peaceful purposes.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a number of ongoing projects that will be valuable to the development of technologies for digital theatre and performance. This paper describes an EU ACTS project called RESOLV which develops an integrated system to capture real 3D environments using laser and video. Current research on motion tracking, statistical behaviour modelling and simulation is presented, and possible applications, both for visual augmentation and audio generation, are discussed. The projects presented were not originally designed in the domain of theatre and performance, however their results and output seem to be well suited to be applied in this area.",
