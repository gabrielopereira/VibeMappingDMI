    "abstract": "Introduction\n\n“First,” said Charlotte, “I dive at him.” She plunged headfirst toward the fly. As she dropped, a tiny silken thread unwound from her rear end. “Next, I wrap him up.” She grabbed the fly, threw a few jets of silk around it, and rolled it over and over, wrapping it so that it couldn’t move. Wilbur watched in horror. He could hardly believe what he was seeing, and although he detested flies, he was sorry for this one. “There!” said Charlotte. “Now I knock him out, so he’ll be more comfortable.” She bit the fly. “He can’t feel a thing now,” she remarked. “He’ll make a perfect breakfast for me.” (White 37–8)\n\nE.B. White’s Charlotte’s Web has long been celebrated as a cornerstone of children’s literature, lauded for its heartfelt exploration of friendship, mortality, and the cycles of life. Beneath its pastoral simplicity, however, lies a rich narrative complexity that echoes the thematic and stylistic conventions of film noir. Central to this reinterpretation is the character of Charlotte A. Cavatica, whose role as a morally ambiguous saviour embodies the noir archetype of the femme fatale: manipulative, intelligent, and driven by shadowy motives. The farmyard, seemingly idyllic, serves as a microcosmic stage where existential dilemmas, loyalty, and sacrifice unravel with an eerie undertone of inevitability reminiscent of classic noir.\nThis essay investigates how Charlotte’s Web draws upon the tropes and themes of noir to interrogate questions of agency, moral ambiguity, and fate within a children’s narrative. By analysing the characters’ interactions, the role of deception and manipulation, and the stark interplay between light and darkness, this article reveals how White’s text transcends its genre, offering young readers a nuanced exploration of moral complexity. Through this lens, Charlotte’s Web emerges not only as a tale of love and loss but also as a sophisticated narrative of ethical grey areas, inviting readers to grapple with the paradoxical nature of heroism and the price of survival.\nFilm noir, a cinematic style and genre originating in the 1940s and 1950s, is characterised by its dark, moody atmosphere, complex narratives, and morally ambiguous characters. Emerging in post-World War II America, it reflects societal disillusionment and cynicism (Conley 347; Cossar 145-154). Its defining visual style includes low-key lighting, high-contrast photography, dramatic shadows, gritty urban settings, and unsettling camera angles that create a sense of entrapment and disorientation (Skoble 47-48; Dick 155).\nThematically, film noir blurs the lines between good and evil, often exploring fatalism, alienation, and the destructive forces of sexual obsession and violence (Skoble 47-48; Cossar 145-154). The narratives feature tough, cynical protagonists—often loners—alongside the archetypal femme fatale, a manipulative woman leading men to their downfall (Dick 155). Complex plots, rife with twists, flashbacks, and voice-over narration, enhance the genre's mysterious allure (Mitchell). In its historical context, film noir captures the post-war malaise, critiquing urban life, societal ambition, and the collapse of traditional social structures (Cossar 145-154). With its enduring themes of moral complexity and visual innovation, film noir remains a poignant reflection of mid-twentieth-century anxieties and an iconic genre in cinematic history.\nCharlotte as the Femme Fatale\nThe femme fatale is a multifaceted and captivating archetype within film noir, defined by her seductive beauty, danger, and ability to manipulate men, often leading to their downfall or destruction. Central to her characterisation is her use of physical allure to captivate and control others (Piechucka 112-128; Choi 431-445). She embodies a blend of danger and mystery, frequently causing tragedy while being a tragic figure herself (Piechucka 112-128; Karam 25). The femme fatale’s duality is a defining feature, as she often oscillates between victim and victimiser, innocence and experience, life and death (Özdinç; Piechucka 112-128). This archetype challenges societal norms through her transgressive sexuality, blending fear and sensuality (Simkin 20-49; Choi 431-445), while also adopting traditionally masculine traits such as dominance and assertiveness (Piechucka 112-128; Choi 431-445). She poses an epistemological threat, embodying ambiguity and unpredictability that unsettle those around her (Simkin). Historically, the femme fatale has evolved from ancient mythologies to modern depictions, reflecting shifting cultural attitudes towards female power and sexuality (Simkin 20-49; Lindop 1-18). While often portrayed negatively, some feminist readings interpret her as a symbol of empowerment and resistance against patriarchal structures (Piechucka 112-128; Lindop 1-18). The enduring complexity of the femme fatale makes her a timeless and significant figure in literature, art, and film.\nCharlotte A. Cavatica, the spider, embodies the noir archetype of the femme fatale—intelligent, manipulative, and driven by complex motives and moral ambiguity to navigate the oppressive dynamics of a patriarchal farmyard. In classic noir, the femme fatale uses her intellect and resourcefulness to bend societal structures, often walking the line between saviour and manipulator (Simkin). Similarly, Charlotte employs her web-weaving abilities not only to save Wilbur but also to assert her agency within an ecosystem dictated by human control. Her duality as both a nurturing figure and a calculated strategist challenges traditional notions of heroism and morality, aligning her with the complexities of noir narratives.\nCharlotte’s intelligence is central to her role as a femme fatale, enabling her to exploit human psychology and manipulate perception. Her plan to save Wilbur through her webs—inscribed with phrases like “Some Pig” and “Radiant”—is a testament to her strategic acumen. “Trust me, Wilbur. People are very gullible. They’ll believe anything they see in print” (White 108), she assures him, highlighting her keen awareness of human susceptibility to language. This manipulation is not driven by malice but necessity; Charlotte recognises that survival in a world dominated by human values requires bending those values to her advantage. Her pragmatism reflects the moral ambiguity often associated with femmes fatales, whose actions, though ethically complex, serve a greater purpose.\nCharlotte’s predatory nature deepens her connection to the femme fatale archetype, particularly through her unapologetic consumption of blood as a necessary act for survival. When Wilbur expresses his horror at her diet, Charlotte replies coolly, “I drink their blood. I love blood” (White 39). This declaration, stark and visceral, encapsulates the duality of her character: she is both a nurturing saviour to Wilbur and a predator bound by instinct. As Dixon observes, femmes fatales in noir often navigate spaces of moral compromise where survival necessitates manipulation and control, and Charlotte’s actions reflect this dynamic (102). Her predatory instincts, transformed into acts of protection for Wilbur, highlight her ability to navigate moral grey areas, a hallmark of noir narratives.\nWhile Charlotte’s intellect and cunning align her with the femme fatale archetype, her nurturing qualities add depth and complexity to her character. Her relationship with Wilbur is defined by genuine care and guidance, qualities not typically associated with the femme fatale’s self-serving nature. For instance, Charlotte consoles Wilbur and helps him confront his fear of death, preparing him to navigate the harsh realities of life. As Neumeyer observes, Charlotte’s actions exemplify “a delicate balance of self-interest and altruism, where survival intertwines with care” (68). This duality challenges the stereotype of the femme fatale as purely manipulative, presenting Charlotte as a figure whose compassion and pragmatism coexist.\nCharlotte’s role is further complicated by the patriarchal structure of the farmyard, where human control dictates the fate of animals. Her ability to disrupt this hierarchy by rewriting Wilbur’s narrative through her webs underscores her power and agency. The act of weaving becomes a subversive tool, allowing Charlotte to redefine Wilbur’s worth and challenge the deterministic roles imposed on them. As Garber notes, Charlotte’s web is “both a symbol of entrapment and a demonstration of ingenuity, asserting her place in a world that marginalises her” (Garber 600). In this way, Charlotte aligns with noir’s exploration of subverting oppressive systems and reclaiming agency in constrained environments.\nCharlotte’s manipulation of language further positions her as a noir figure, intertwining deception with empowerment. Her webs, both literal and figurative, symbolise the duality of her actions: they are traps for flies and tools of salvation for Wilbur. This ambiguity mirrors the femme fatale’s use of charm and guile to navigate morally complex situations. “It’s the way I’m made. A spider has to pick up a living somehow or other, and I happen to be a trapper” (White 39), Charlotte tells Wilbur, embracing her role in the ecosystem while transforming it into a force for good. Her acknowledgment of the “miserable inheritance” of her predatory nature echoes noir’s fatalism, where characters grapple with the inevitability of their roles while seeking ways to transcend them.\nCharlotte’s actions raise profound ethical questions about the cost of survival and the moral compromises it demands. Her success in saving Wilbur comes not through conventional heroism but through calculated deception and strategic ingenuity. This complexity situates her within the noir tradition, where heroes and antiheroes alike navigate ethically ambiguous worlds. As Misheff notes, Charlotte’s webs “serve as both a lifeline for Wilbur and a testament to the power of ingenuity and sacrifice” (135). Her ability to weave a narrative that challenges the farm’s deterministic power dynamics underscores her role as a master manipulator and a figure of resilience.\nWilbur as the Morally Grey Protagonist\nWilbur, the protagonist of Charlotte's Web, embodies the classic journey of noir characters from naivety to a profound grasp of life's complexities. His narrative arc is marked by an existential fear of slaughter, which underscores his initial vulnerability and passivity. Saved from certain death by Fern’s compassionate act, Wilbur’s life is depicted as one of dependency from the very beginning (Brower). This reliance on others for survival is further emphasised by his dependence on Charlotte, whose strategic interventions not only save him from becoming “smoked bacon and ham”, but also illustrate his passive role in his own destiny (Rushdy 35-60). Charlotte’s web, both literal and metaphorical, becomes the scaffold for Wilbur's existence, showcasing his reliance on external forces for survival (Thomas 201-15; Rushdy 35-60).\nWilbur’s path is deeply influenced by his ongoing confrontation with mortality. His dread of slaughter is not just a plot device but a profound existential crisis that motivates his actions and shapes his relationships. The novel uses Wilbur’s fear to delve into themes of life versus death, highlighting his struggle with the inevitability of his end. Phrases like “divine discontent” and “memento mori” resonate through the narrative, capturing Wilbur's internal battle with existential dread and his aspiration for a life beyond the farm’s confines (Thomas 201-15). These moments are pivotal, marking his transition from innocence to a more reflective state, confronting the transient nature of existence.\nThis evolution mirrors the trajectory of noir protagonists who, initially naive or morally ambiguous, are thrust into a world where they must navigate survival’s moral landscape. Wilbur’s maturation involves a shift from a sheltered, oblivious existence to one where he acknowledges the harsh realities of life and death. His journey is not just physical but intellectual and moral, as he learns about agency, identity, and the nuanced ethics of friendship (Rushdy 35-60; Boonpromkul). Through his interactions, especially with Charlotte, Wilbur explores how relationships can both define and challenge one’s sense of self and morality, much like the noir heroes who grapple with their fates shaped by external pressures and internal conflicts.\nIn this way, Wilbur’s story aligns with noir’s exploration of moral ambiguity and the complex interplay between individual fate and communal dynamics. His character development from a passive, saved creature to one who reflects deeply on life, death, and morality places him squarely within the thematic heart of noir, where every step towards survival might necessitate a compromise of one’s ethical standards.\nThe Barnyard as the Seedy Underbelly Setting\nIn Charlotte’s Web, E.B. White constructs the barnyard as a moral microcosm where survival depends on a collective ethos yet is fraught with tension and ethical ambiguity. The barnyard animals’ interactions reflect a world where pragmatism and individual motivations blur traditional moral lines, creating a complex portrait of communal life. Templeton, the rat, exemplifies this moral ambiguity. While he is motivated by self-interest, described as “a crafty rat, sneaky and feared by others”, his contributions to Charlotte’s plan are crucial to Wilbur’s survival (White 45). Templeton’s scavenging for the words that Charlotte weaves into her web—“Some Pig” and “Terrific”—emphasises how even morally questionable behaviour can serve a greater purpose. Scholars like Brower have noted the intricate interplay between individual agency and collective necessity in the barnyard, describing it as a “web of utilitarian ethics” that challenges the conventional moral binaries of children’s literature.\nThe goose and gander, though less directly involved, reveal the barnyard’s communal pragmatism. When the goose reluctantly offers Templeton an unhatched egg, warning him not to harm their goslings, the act is neither purely altruistic nor entirely selfish. Rather, it reflects an understanding of the barnyard’s interconnected survival strategies. The goose’s proud declaration, “luck had nothing to do with this; it was good management and hard work”, situates the barnyard as a space where resourcefulness underpins morality (White 46). Johnson argues that these interactions mirror play dynamics as a creative and ethical process, suggesting that the barnyard animals engage in collaborative problem-solving that embodies a moral fluidity aligned with survival.\nThe pastoral setting itself is both idyllic and utilitarian, described as “peaceful and warm in winter” yet shadowed by the reality of death and survival (White 19). Wilbur’s attempted escape, spurred on by the goose, highlights this duality. While his fleeting freedom elicits chaotic support from the animals, their contradictory advice underscores the tensions between individual desire and communal necessity. Thomas observes that this duality reflects the story’s spiritual undertones, where humour and practicality coexist with deeper existential questions. This nuanced depiction of the barnyard disrupts the pastoral ideal, portraying it instead as a site of negotiation and moral compromise.\nThe narrative’s ethical complexity aligns with the thematic elements of noir, where survival often demands moral compromise. Charlotte’s carefully orchestrated deception, aided by Templeton’s opportunism and the passive support of other animals, mirrors noir’s pragmatic ethics. Sagoff interprets this dynamic as a reflection of environmental ethics, where each character’s actions are driven not by abstract ideals but by immediate ecological and existential needs. The barnyard, therefore, becomes a stage for exploring questions of necessity, interdependence, and the ethical ambiguity of survival.\nThe barnyard becomes a noir-like microcosm where moral ambiguity, survival, and interdependence shape the characters’ actions and relationships. E.B. White’s portrayal of the barnyard challenges the idealised pastoral setting often found in children’s literature, instead presenting a space where characters must navigate ethical grey areas. Templeton, the opportunistic rat, epitomises this complexity. While primarily motivated by self-interest, Templeton plays a critical role in Wilbur’s survival by retrieving scraps of text for Charlotte’s web, described as “a sneaky rat with no morals” (White 47). His actions align with noir’s archetypal antiheroes, whose selfish motives inadvertently contribute to a greater good. As Brower observes, this interplay of self-interest and communal benefit reflects a “utilitarian ethic”, where necessity dictates moral choices rather than idealism. The barnyard’s interconnected dynamics echo noir’s narrative focus on alliances of convenience. The goose’s reluctant cooperation with Templeton, offering him an unhatched egg as long as her goslings remain unharmed, highlights the pragmatic compromises necessary for survival in this environment. Ratelle expands on this by interpreting the barnyard’s ethics through the lens of animal studies, arguing that Charlotte’s Web challenges anthropocentric narratives by foregrounding the subjectivity of its animal characters. Wilbur, in particular, is presented as more than a stand-in for human anxieties; his plight reflects the ethical complexities of animal edibility and human consumption. Ratelle notes that “Wilbur’s survival is not just a triumph over death but a commentary on the commodification of animal lives” (327–8), emphasising how the narrative resists simplistic moral binaries.\nThis moral complexity situates the barnyard within a noir framework, where survival necessitates deception and ethical compromise. Charlotte’s calculated manipulation through her web—spinning words like “Some Pig” and “Radiant”—is an act of strategic misdirection, reminiscent of noir characters’ reliance on cunning and subterfuge. Sagoff interprets Charlotte’s actions as part of an environmental ethic that prioritises practical outcomes over moral absolutes. Her web is not merely a tool for saving Wilbur, but a reflection of the collective effort needed to sustain life within the constraints of the barnyard’s ecosystem.\nThe barnyard’s duality—its idyllic appearance and the harsh realities of survival—further aligns it with noir’s thematic landscape. While described as “peaceful and warm in winter” (White 13), the barnyard is also a site of constant negotiation between life and death. Wilbur’s existential dread, encapsulated in his plea to avoid the slaughterhouse, mirrors the fatalism of noir protagonists who grapple with the inevitability of death. His realisation that freedom within the confines of the farm may be preferable to perilous independence echoes noir’s recurring theme of limited agency within oppressive systems. Ratelle observes that this tension between agency and captivity underscores the story’s engagement with questions of animal autonomy and ethical responsibility, offering a critique of human dominion over nature (329-30).\nThe story’s modal duality, blending comedy and tragedy, also reflects noir’s juxtaposition of light and darkness. While the barnyard animals’ playful banter adds levity, the inevitability of Charlotte’s death and the fragility of Wilbur’s survival ground the narrative in existential reflection. As Thomas notes, this interplay of humour and poignancy enhances the story’s universality, allowing it to resonate with readers across different stages of life. The barnyard, much like the urban landscapes of noir, becomes a space where survival requires ethical negotiation and where moral clarity is often elusive.\nThrough its characters and setting, Charlotte’s Web transcends the genre of children’s literature, weaving a narrative rich with the themes of film noir. Charlotte, as the quintessential femme fatale, manipulates not just the physical world but also the perceptions within it, driving the story towards a nuanced exploration of moral grey areas. Her actions, alongside Wilbur’s journey and the barnyard’s complex moral landscape, invite readers to delve into questions of ethics, agency, and the paradoxical nature of heroism. By employing noir’s thematic and stylistic elements, White crafts a story that is both a tale of love and loss and a sophisticated narrative on the price of survival and the ethical ambiguities that accompany it.\nReferences\nBrower, Andrew V.Z. \"Oh, What a Tangled Web We Weave.\" Cladistics 36 (2019). &lt;https://doi.org/10.1111/cla.12406&gt;.\nConley, Tom. \"Stages of 'Film Noir'.\" Theatre Journal 39 (1987): 347-63.\nCossar, Harper. \"The Revenge of the Repressed: Homosexuality as Other in The Killing.\" Quarterly Review of Film and Video 22 (2005): 145-54.\nDick, Bernard F. \"Columbia's Dark Ladies and the Femmes Fatales of Film Noir.\" Literature\\Film Quarterly 23.3 (1995): 155.\nDixon, Wheeler Winston.

    "abstract": "Introduction\nThe dark silhouette of Batman (Robert Pattinson) emerges from the shadows on a rainy night, confronting a gang at a train station. One of their members asks, “what the hell are you supposed to be?”, before moving to attack. Batman quickly disarms the gang member, but in contrast to many of the character’s incarnations – on the screen and the comic book page – who would knock the criminal out before moving on, this Batman pummels the gang member even after he’s been knocked to the ground. With a throaty growl Batman responds, “I’m vengeance”, then proceeds to violently assault the other gang members.\nSo begins The Batman, director Matt Reeves’s 2022 adaptation of the Caped Crusader. In addition to the title character’s willingness to inflict violent punishment beyond the boundaries of how the character usually operates, the film inhabits a cinematic realm blending aspects of the noir and gothic genres similar to Tim Burton’s original Batman film (1989) and the Christopher Nolan Dark Knight trilogy (2005-2012). Where The Batman most stands apart from the other cinematic adaptations is its willingness to imbue the main character with traits that arguably deconstruct him as a psychologically damaged yet overly empathetic vigilante, at once alienated from his colleagues yet yearning for connection in a way other cinematic Batmen have not. Compounding this characterisation is the use of gothic and noir tropes which combine in intriguing subversions; Batman embodies the noir role of the dark detective with a chip on his shoulder headed for a bad end, yet is ensnared by the gothic’s connection to trauma and the uncanny as a figure of horror born of grounded, relatable injury. In a further twist of expected conventions, despite Batman’s arguably psychopathic traits and the dark, gloomy atmosphere suggesting that bad end, the film concludes with optimism, hope, and personal growth, suggesting a casting-off of the noir and gothic aspects in favour of psychological healing.\nIn this article we discuss the intriguing dichotomy of The Batman as noir, gothic, and more besides from perspectives of media studies and psychology. We outline how both the noir and gothic genres inflect the film and the title character with expected conventions and qualities that are drawn from psychological aspects of empathy, trauma, and personal distress, and how the film presents a version of Batman working through these issues and who may end up a more stable, sane psychopath than the others who have worn the mantle on the big screen. Finally, we conclude by theorising what a gothic noir reading of Batman implies for the larger state of the character – and the uniqueness of Pattinson’s on-screen version of the character – and for understanding anti-heroism more broadly as a staple of the noir genre.\nBatman as Gothic Noir Character\nOur research locates Pattinson’s Batman at an intersection of two neighbouring genres. The first is of course film noir, concerned with the use of the “hard-boiled detective” and associated tropes – the femme fatale, focus on crime and murder, dark-hued cinematography, and so on. While previous Batman media have included noir stylings and influences, arguably The Batman is the first on-screen adaptation of the character to fully embrace and embody the genre compared to previous uses of camp (Batman: The Movie, 1966, and Batman and Robin, 1997), post-9/11 “terror tv” (The Dark Knight, 2008) and the gothic (Batman, 1989, and Batman Returns, 1992). This latter genre is the second cross-point of The Batman, with the film drawing upon gothic tropes more aligned with the abject, grounded repulsion of human- and self-based horror than with the fantastic and somewhat distanced gothic tropes inherent to the monster and vampire fiction subgenres. In essence, The Batman presents a superhero embroiled in the noir atmosphere of a crime-ridden Gotham whilst dealing with the personal horrors inflicted upon himself and those around him as a gothic protagonist.\nIn a manner similar to Blade Runner’s (1982) combination of film noir and sci-fi, The Batman integrates its film noir tropes into the superhero genre. There is an initial thematic dissonance at work in this fusion, given the wish-fulfilment aspect of the superhero – a figure we may wish to embody or emulate as well as look up to – clashing with the distanced, emotionally isolated nature of the noir protagonist. Very few viewers could say they would want to be Pattinson’s Batman, given how alienating and emotionally bereft he is. Where emulation may be employed is in the desire for exacting justice upon the unjust through Batman’s vigilantism, offering a figure of power and agency that audiences can engage with despite him being an extrajudicial figure (Brooker; Langley; Comerford “The Hero”). In the film, Pattinson’s Batman does not yet enjoy the implicit acceptance of his vigilantism by law enforcement which characterises many of his adaptations; his relationship with Lieutenant Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) is fraught and the Gotham Police Department has a tenuous partnership with him. While he is what Jacques Derrida would consider to be a pharmakon, a figure who alternately helps and hurts Gotham’s situation through his action as both “a remedy and a poison” (Derrida and Johnson 73), he is not legitimated as a necessary tool of dispensing justice. This means Batman is not yet the figure of the state of exception (Agamben) which enables him to undertake crimefighting as an extraordinary extrajudicial practice necessitated by crisis, something which is again inherent to the Batman adaptations mentioned previously. Instead, Pattinson’s Batman hews much closer to the figure of an anti-heroic noir protagonist, “a lone hero, usually some kind of detective or investigator” operating in a city “portrayed as vile and evil … where people are sinful and untrustworthy … abounding in crime” (Flisfeder 103-4). His status as a nascent vigilante waging a one-man war on crime illustrates him as an outsider even before the film explores Bruce Wayne’s tortured psychology and emotional isolation.\nIt is because of this isolation that Pattinson’s Batman is made more complex through the addition of the gothic to the noir. It is made clear through his actions and his narrated entries in his journals that Batman sees himself as becoming an embodiment of fear and violence necessary to secure Gotham; in effect, becoming a monster to stop the monsters. Gothic tropes of inhuman horrors and fear of the unknown marry monstrosity and abjection, a terror made of humanity yet exaggerated into almost mythic status through symbols and disbelief (see Punter; Spooner). Batman makes a conscious effort to be a monstrous symbol of violence to criminals, manifested in a scene where a criminal sees the light of the Batsignal in the sky and runs in fear of a darkened road where he believes Batman may be waiting. Aside from Gotham being a crime-riddled hellhole, Batman’s actions are driven by internal horror and an inability to emotionally process his trauma after seeing his parents murdered at a young age, a trauma which in the gothic tradition haunts him as an inescapable facet (Punter and Byron). His surrogate father figure and butler, Alfred Pennyworth (Andy Serkis), aids Batman in fighting crime and attempts to do the same for his emotional maturation and growth, but Bruce rejects Alfred’s attempts to help as anything other than an aide to Batman’s campaign. A strand of The Batman’s narrative concerns Bruce’s eventual attempt to overcome his emotional isolation and realise his ability to do more than just break bones and scare people. In this manner the gothic as a genre of exploring trauma (Hogle) is also utilised to add to Batman’s nuances.\nWhile Pattinson’s Batman arguably improves emotionally by the end of the film, potentially breaking free from the “noir lone hero” archetype and into something still gothic yet healing, the journey to arrive at that conclusion spells out troubling facets of the character that are sharpened through the combination of the gothic and noir genres. Though many interpretations of the character strongly imply a close connection between Batman’s actions and the murderous antics of the villains he faces – arguing that he is only one bad day away from joining them in Arkham Asylum (Morrison) –, rarely has there been a version of the character that embodies so starkly many elements of outright psychopathy.\nConflicted Sense of Self-Help through Hurt and the “Empathy Cost” Problem\nBatman, a dark and brooding figure with a dearth of emotions and penchant for violence, encapsulates the hallmarks of a psychopath. Using Hare et al.’s (394) Psychopathy Checklist Revised (PCL-R), this anti-hero would score highly on several criteria, including shallow affect, lack of remorse/guilt, criminal versatility, and the need for stimulation. However, many other criteria would not be met (e.g., pathological lying; conning/manipulative; superficial charm), meaning they would fall below the threshold of clinical psychopathy. Psychopathy is most known for its association with a lack of empathy and callous/unemotional traits (Hare et al. 392). On the surface Batman would seem to be high on these criteria; however, we argue this may not be the case. What Batman does display are characteristics of boldness (calmness under pressure or threat; high self-assurance; tolerance for danger; thrill seeking) and meanness (excitement seeking; empowerment through cruelty; Patrick et al. 926-8). These traits are synonymous with the primary psychopath: one who demonstrates low anxiety and social effectiveness (Patrick et al. 918). \nBatman also embodies other dark traits from the constellation of Dark Triad characteristics (Jonason et al. 194; Greenwood et al. 166). This construct represents personality traits (psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism) that are often thought of as negative and maladaptive (Jones and Paulhus 28). Born of trauma, Batman demonstrates high levels of aggression, antisociality, and grandiosity through being special and entitled (Jonason et al. 193; Wang 1007), personality factors that are most often associated with narcissism and psychopathy. However, the presence of these ‘dark’ traits does not necessarily exclude other positive characteristics, such as empathy, which add to the complexity of his gothic noir characterisation. Heym et al. identified a cluster of individuals high in both dark traits and empathy. The Dark Empath displays selfish and untrusting or contentious behaviours, despite the high levels of empathy. Whilst lower in aggression than the Dark Traits cluster (low empathy, high dark traits) the dark empath still displays higher levels of aggression than typical (Heym et al. 7). Batman does not strictly adhere to all of Heym et al.’s (8) dark empath qualities, being higher in interpersonal aggression; however, this research demonstrates that, in the real world at least, psychopathy, narcissism, and empathy are not all mutually exclusive.\nWhilst Batman comes across as unempathetic and unemotional, these qualities are, like the one he dons, a mask. His empathy is targeted towards those few who are close to him and those whom he deems worthy of it: respectively, Alfred and the citizens of Gotham City. Importantly, Batman denies himself compassion and empathy, and does not expect it in return, something in keeping with noir tropes of the loner hero. By compartmentalising these emotions, he distances himself from humanity, de-humanising himself. This is a protective mechanism that grants freedom for him to commit the highly violent acts he does, in order to bring ‘justice’ to those who deserve it; the cost of being the ‘hero’ is that he cannot indulge in the human condition, for to do so completely would be to see himself as a true monster. In this way, Batman portrays himself as unfeeling, uncaring (to a degree), and a psychopath.\nThe juxtaposition of both Batman and the film’s primary villain, The Riddler (Paul Dano), as two different types of psychopaths not only imbues the film with an unrelentingly dark tone – again, in keeping with many other film noir texts – but also blurs the lines between pure good and pure evil. The Riddler, whilst embodying more of Hare’s psychopathic traits, is still enacting vengeance against corrupt officials, which could possibly be seen as a type of heroism. But viewers lack an affinity for The Riddler the way they do for Batman, given that the former’s mental instability takes him beyond the reach of ‘normal’ understanding. Whilst Batman is ruthless, The Riddler is more so, garishly displaying his gruesome punishments for the whole city to see. It is both warning and theatre. The Riddler revels in his ability to unnerve, regardless of the cost to others, as is demonstrated in his disregard for safety when attacking the funeral of Don Mitchell Jr. (Rupert Penry-Jones). Batman at least has some redeeming qualities, though they are few. He saves children and innocents, and demonstrates care towards others – albeit a limited number – such as Alfred and the Catwoman (Zoe Kravitz). His inability to protect Alfred is a cause of angst and anguish for him, making him strive harder to find the one responsible. He tries to protect Catwoman by convincing her not to kill the cop, knowing that she will ‘never come back’ from that; in a twist on noir tropes, Catwoman as the typical femme fatale becomes a figure of redemption rather than a cause of the hero’s downfall or a tragic murder victim. But the miasma of despair and fear that seems to follow Batman makes connections otherwise difficult. Even those who need to work closely with him, such as Gordon and the GCPD, are uncomfortable in his presence, resulting in further isolation of the anti-hero (Sánchez and Vidal-Mestre 256).  \nThis perceived lack of empathy, the absence of emotional displays, the difficulty with connections, and the inability to relate to people can be seen as character flaws, emphasising the anti-heroic nature of the character (Wang 1006). In this case though it is arguable that each of these is a deliberate conscious choice Batman makes. He does this in order to become the monster he believes he needs to be, undertaking a sacrifice to be the saviour of Gotham. It is a mistake to believe Pattinson’s Batman lacks empathy, whether as a deliberate choice to excise it or not. A lack of empathy would mean he would not understand another’s pain or distress. Instead, he has an over-abundance of emotional empathy. Davis (118) defines empathy as having both cognitive and affective elements, such as empathic concern (concern and compassion for others) and personal distress (the discomfort you feel in the face of another’s distress). Batman experiences a great deal of personal distress, feeling the pain of others acutely. In part this is what drives him: that desire to relieve not only others’ pain, but his own.\nEmpathy is also commonly associated with morality, or more precisely moral action (see Hoffman 221). Whilst Batman obviously has a moral code, that code is fluid and malleable – also a distinctly noir trait, for the loner hero willing to break the legal and moral rules to succeed. For instance, Batman will work with criminals in order to fulfil his goals, although his distaste in doing so is obvious. This moral fluidity, and his code of the end justifying the means, places Batman in morally ambiguous territory, underpinning his dark persona of ruthlessness, and reinforcing his noir anti-hero positioning (Sánchez and Vidal-Mestre 256; Wang 1006).\nBatman is what Comerford (“Ambiguous” 4) refers to as a liminal hero, inhabiting the spaces between the black and the white. In true noir fashion, Batman stalks the grey areas between hero and villain, between good and evil, between empath and psychopath. Whilst traditionally these latter two concepts sit diametrically opposed, as demonstrated in Heym et al.’s (7) research, they can be found together in the dark empath. Batman is able to be both aggressive and empathetic by compartmentalising his empathy and walling off his emotions. His high emotional empathy acts as the motivator for violence to protect those he sees as innocent. But as we can see, navigating this liminal emotional space comes at a high cost. \nConclusion: A Hopeful Batman?\nWe have examined noir and gothic facets of both Batman and The Batman through brief explorations of media studies and psychology, arguing that the film and this version of the character offer a unique representation of a character traditionally associated with darkness.\nThe Batman combines gothic tropes of horror and gruesomeness with noir tropes of the ‘hard boiled’ detective, as Batman seeks to bring to justice Gotham’s latest serial killer, the Riddler. This iteration of Batman embraces his anti-heroism, engaging in extreme acts of violence in order to visit justice upon the unjust. With its sepia tones and dreary atmosphere, this film pushes the limits of the liminal hero, leveraging both the noir and the gothic to portray a dark study of the tortured human condition.\nConcurrently, the film ends with what is arguably an optimistic ending. Bucking common film noir trends, Batman does not die, nor does he become relegated to the fringes of society as a loner once more, but instead he is embraced by the public as a hero, saving them from the breaching of the Gotham sea wall. Gothically speaking, while Bruce Wayne’s trauma is still present, he has shown promising signs of healing through his horror, evidenced by his willingness to mend his relationship with Alfred. As if to underscore this optimism, Batman’s final scenes feature him – a nighttime vigilante usually occupying the shadows – standing in daylight.\nReferences\nAgamben, Giorgio. State of Exception.

    "abstract": "Introduction: From Classic Noir Parody to Aussie Comedy Noir\nHowever you choose to identify noir – as a genre, style, or cycle – over its 80 years from classic American film noir to neo-noir, neon-noir, national noirs, and television noir, it has undeniably seeped into popular culture. Exemplary of this is the way noir has hybridised with other genres and styles, true of comedy as much as its more serious pairings with science fiction, Western, and Gothic. This is not a new phenomenon: Sue Short points out that pastiche noir began appearing at the end of the classic cycle, citing Kiss Me Deadly (1955) as an example that noir has always had “a sense of exaggeration and self-consciousness” (185). Successful parody relies on a shared understanding of visual motifs, narratives, characters, and iconography. As Dahlia Schweitzer indicates, “we take the rules of genres so seriously that we even call attention to them for the sake of comedy … even when poking fun, the rules are still being followed” (117-118). With so many easily identifiable features, noir has enjoyed homage and parody in sketch comedy, films, animation, and the ‘noir episode’ in television over the years. There are also comedy-noir hybrids that don’t solely rely on parody but rather weave the style into the fabric of their narratives and visuals.\nComedy-noir draws not only on classic film noir and neo-noir, but encompasses other noir iterations, such as Scandi Noir, its international adaptations, and the rise of distinctive national noirs, including the growing catalogue of Australian Noir. Audience understanding of the generic ‘rules’ of these ‘new noirs’ has also allowed for comedic parodies and hybridisations to emerge. Australian audiences are no strangers to comedy-infused crime, and Greg Dolgopolov’s work includes a great discussion of its distinct flavour in Australian features as well as defining the features of Outback Noir. Series such as Mr Inbetween (2018-2021), which Cath Moore notes was “billed as a black comedy crime drama” (127), have also been recognised as part of the growing Australian Noir oeuvre, with critic Andrew Nette describing the hitman drama as “so dark, so funny and so noir [and] also … so very Australian”. The SBS series Troppo (2022), based on the successful novels of Candice Fox (marketed under the publisher’s ‘Penguin Noir’ banner), also fits the Australian Noir mould. Its comic moments arise from the relationship between its two leads, a jaded American cop and a damaged local loner with a passion for sleuthing, employing the common crime trope of mismatched detectives. While these two shows are solid examples of how comic overtones inevitably bleed into Australian Noir, I would be hesitant to bill them as ‘comedy-noir’. There are others that fit this description more closely, combining noir conventions with comedy (and a touch of the Australian Gothic) for a more baked-in approach that pays homage to or takes inspiration from noir, as well as drawing on Australian comic-crime traditions. I’d like to explore this concept in a small selection of recent TV series: Thou Shalt Not Steal (2024), Deadloch (2023), and Bay of Fires (2023).\nOutback Comedy Noir: Thou Shalt Not Steal\nI believe Stan’s recent series Thou Shalt Not Steal (2024) is our first Outback Noir comedy, parodying identifiable aspects of Outback Noir, which itself shares generic lineage with the Western. Ivan Sen’s Mystery Road (2013) and its subsequent sequels and TV series “flipped the colour palette” of noir (Turnbull) to Outback red, and inverted the traditional noir iconography of shadowed night into bright day (Dolgopolov 80). That the visual language of Mystery Road is repeated in Thou Shalt is no accident: writer-director Dylan River also co-wrote and directed the prequel series Mystery Road: Origin. The Mystery Road film was shot in Queensland and its various series in Western Australia, showcasing iconic Outback Noir landscapes, with long stretches of red-dusted roads flanked by dry scrub. Thou Shalt is set and shot in South Australia and the Northern Territory, so immediately places the viewer in this familiar setting.\nTo signify its comic turn, Thou Shalt amplifies the revisionist Western iconography of Outback Noir in the Mystery Road universe (Dolgopolov 79), with outward parody of classic Westerns, including in its music and titles design. When Robyn (Sherry-Lee Watson) escapes juvenile incarceration in the first episode, she jumps on a correctional officer's back as if riding a bucking bronco. After initiating her escape on foot, Robyn busts her ailing grandfather (Warren H. Williams) from hospital then proceeds to steal a taxi. After he reveals her father is still alive, she drives them to where her mother lives to find answers, eventually setting off to find him and evade recapture. The determination of cabbie Maxine (Miranda Otto) to retrieve her car, and the sizable bag of cash in its boot, sets an adventurous interstate pursuit in motion. She convinces outback preacher Robert (Noah Taylor) to drive her in his rattling station wagon and caravan, as his son Gidge (Will McDonald) has also absconded with Robyn.\nThou Shalt first flips the Outback Noir genre by making the young Indigenous girl the protagonist rather than the victim. Thematically, “past and present are inextricably linked” in Outback Noir, as they are in other forms of noir (Dolgopolov 84), and the young Robyn’s journey is similarly concerned with reconciling elements of her past with her present. Just as Mystery Road’s Indigenous detective Jay Swan (Aaron Pederson) “negotiates a complex world between black and white” (Dolgopolov 82), Robyn is similarly caught between two worlds: in one, her estranged alcoholic black mother, in the other, the absent white father she's trying to find. Like classic noir detectives, Robyn is also given a narrational voiceover, but in her case, her expletive-laden inner voice adds to the comic effect while also establishing the series’ socio-cultural context: “I’m 17 and I’m a thief. Them missionaries reckon ‘thou shalt not steal’. A bit rich from the bible bashing bastards that stole our country” (ep. 1).\nAs Short identifies in features such as Pulp Fiction (1994) and Fargo (1996), “accidental or inept criminality” and “comic mischance” (201; 202) can be used to subvert noir-style crime and violence. Thou Shalt employs such shockingly hilarious moments: Maxine is electrocuted by the caravan’s dodgy wiring, and a trucker accidently shoots himself in the head. Dolgopolov notes that dumb criminals often feature in Australian crime comedies (84), and to them Thou Shalt adds even dumber cops. Robyn easily fools a local uniformed cop to avoid arrest, and a mismatched duo of federal police officers, cheekily monikered Burke and Wills (Darren Gilshenen and Shari Sebbens), often seem as lost as their namesakes. The white male of the pair parodies male cop machismo, much to the eye-rolling chagrin of his Indigenous female partner.\nAlthough many scenes are played for laughs, the comedy does not detract from Robyn’s serious situation. She is certainly no angel and knows it, but the plucky teen refuses to remain a victim and fights back even in the face of hopelessness. Likewise, serious issues encountered by the Indigenous characters – racism, alcoholism, incarceration – are woven into the plot, but the characters are also allowed to have some fun, for example the Aboriginal men making fun (in their language) of Will’s clothing, and the cheeky aunties who make sexual comments about a young police officer. Creator Dylan River deliberately set out to educate with humour, saying “with comedy, hopefully people will watch this who usually wouldn’t watch an Aboriginal, Indigenous drama” (qtd. in Frater).\nDark secrets and moral decay lurking beneath the surface in small communities is a common rural noir (and indeed, Australian Noir) trope that also appears in Thou Shalt. Preacher Robert has lied to his son Gidge about the boy’s parentage, is profiteering from selling alcohol to the local Aboriginal community, and, despite his self-proclaimed piety, is easily swayed by Maxine’s sexual advances, which barely conceal her own dark motives. Robyn and Gidge are betrayed by the morally corrupt adults they encounter, such as the road stop truckers who menace the teens with the threat of sexual assault, one of whom is likely a serial killer and kidnaps Gidge. Although Maxine initially purports to help Robyn, she later tries to force the girl into prostitution as payback for her theft. Robyn’s reunion with her dumb ocker father also proves a fizzer, with his wife summoning Burke and Wills to arrest them both. Ultimately, it’s up to Gidge and Robyn to save each other.\nJust as Outback Noir provides a glimmer of reconciliatory hope, shown through Mystery Road’s black and white detectives working together (Dolgopolov 84), Robyn’s unlikely allyship with Gidge blossoms into a sweet romance, making their story akin to the lovers-on-the-run noir trope. While the series’ ending sees Robyn back in juvenile detention, she and Gidge dance joyfully together from opposite sides of the chain-link fence, the smile never leaving her face even as she is dragged away by the guards. This scene comically embodies Alberto Garcia’s concept of ‘bright noir’, in which noir’s traditional narrative of futility is undermined by instead “embrac[ing] optimism” (42). Robyn’s voiceover intones, “I’m gonna take a new road. With this fella” (ep. 8), and audiences are left hopeful the couple will find a way (if not necessarily legal) to be together.\nTassie Goth-Noir-Comedy: Deadloch\nAmazon’s Deadloch bills itself as “a feminist noir comedy set against a bucolic backdrop with a rising body count” (Guesswork TV), not only placing its homage to noir front and centre, but teasing an intriguing twist on generic conventions. When watching the series, it becomes clear that the ‘noir’ in its tagline refers to more recent television noir, and in particular Scandinavian (or Nordic) Noir, rather than the classic era. Crime scholar Sue Turnbull says the series “flips the Nordic Noir crime genre on its arse”, and the Hollywood Reporter states this Tasmanian Noir is an “irreverent send up of self-serious Nordic-noir/Scandi-noir shows like The Killing and The Bridge and their international imitators like the U.K.’s Broadchurch” (Rahman). In fact, creators Kate McCartney and Kate McLennan used the working title Funny Broadchurch while developing the show (Press).\nLike any parody, Deadloch’s success as a comedy-noir lies in the audience’s understanding of the original style. I would also argue that a further precedent to this understanding can be found in the dramatic Tassie Goth-Noir series The Kettering Incident (2016) and The Gloaming (2020), themselves self-consciously influenced by Scandi Noir (Brammer 125). Deadloch also makes use of its Tasmanian setting to visually reference Scandi (and Tassie) Noir. Just as the opening title sequences of The Gloaming and The Kettering Incident showcase Tasmania’s dangerous beauty and hint at their dark themes (Brammer 132), Deadloch’s opener consists of “a drone shot across an expanse of grey water under a leaden sky accompanied by eerie music and a sense of foreboding” (Turnbull), coding it as a noir-mystery without foregrounding its comic stylings. In a television interview, McLennan states, “we keep calling it Tassie Noir, I mean we're not the first person to say that, but it is”, emphasising that the creative team imagined what a northern hemisphere crime drama would look like in Australia, and in particular in Tasmania, where “it feels like that no matter where you are in Tasmania that you're in a small town” (qtd. in The Project).\nDeadloch’s first scene encapsulates McLennan’s and McCartney’s key aims of interrogating the tropes of television crime noir. It delightfully flips the naked, violated female corpse trope of endless crime dramas, by having two Indigenous teen girls discover the corpse of a white man on the shores of its titular lake. Miranda (Kartanya Maynard) and Tammy (Leonie Whyman) are sneaking a smoke on the beach in the early morning gloom, and as Vanity Fair’s reviewer observes, “if this were your standard thriller, they’d be the killer’s prey” (Press). When they encounter the body, the victim’s penis is foregrounded and centred in the frame – a shock for viewers and the characters alike – and then Tammy drops her smoke on the corpse, prompting her to beat the embers on the unfortunate man’s pubic hair with a cry of “shit, his dick’s on fire!” (ep. 1). McCartney says this choice of victim is a direct result of the creators being “sick of seeing cold white tits on a slab … with fully dressed men having a conversation over the top of them” (qtd. in Standard Issue). The black humour in this inversion of a typical TV noir scene is “inviting us to laugh at the expense of the unfortunate” (Short 183), and as a self-proclaimed feminist comedy the ‘unfortunate’ here is the man. Like Thou Shalt’s Robyn, Miranda and Tammy also reverse the Outback Noir roles of Indigenous women, a deliberate creative choice to “give a voice to people that would normally be portrayed as victims in these shows” (McLennan qtd. in Standard Issue).\nDeadloch includes the familiar trope of a pair of investigators forcibly buddied up to investigate a case, trading the “mismatched male and female cop from different cultural backgrounds” (Turnbull) for two women. Local detective Dulcie (Kate Box) is level-headed and meticulous, but rather than parodying the troubled female detective of Scandi noir, she aligns her more closely with the noir male cop with a troubled home life (Turnbull). The shadow of an affair she had when she and wife Cath (Alicia Gardner) lived in Sydney looms over their marriage. Her chalk-and-cheese partner Eddie (Madelaine Sami) is brought in from Darwin to help solve the crime, and this forced partnership cleverly drives both comic and more serious narratives in the show.\nJust as Steven Sanders noted that classic hybrid-noir series Twin Peaks (1990-1) contained “convoluted plot and subplots, grotesque minor characters, and a protagonist, … with a troubled past” (453), we observe all these aspects in Deadloch. Eddie’s past – the death of her former work partner – churns a hidden darkness within her. In another inversion of Scandi Noir, her darkness doesn’t manifest in the quiet moodiness of a Sarah Lund (The Killing) or the idiosyncrasies of a Saga Noren (The Bridge). Instead, Eddie is loud, rambunctious, and often inappropriately shooting her mouth off, manifesting a grotesque major character. For much of the series, Eddie’s vocal and physical characterisation serves as “the grotesque, unruly female … celebrated and utilised for comic effect” (Boyle 83). Actress Sami’s skills as a physical comedian embody the comic grotesque, and Eddie is constantly moving where Dulcie is more still and observant. Eddie’s hilariously profane one-liners are countered by Dulcie’s calm and deadpan delivery of her comedic lines. Like the famous female Scandi detectives mentioned above, Dulcie and Eddie each have a distinctive look. Eddie stubbornly wears the incongruous outfit of shorts, singlet and tropical print shirt with sandals until the Tasmanian cold gets the better of her, when she adopts a new signature look of colourfully mismatched camping shop fleeces and cargo pants, all of which contrast the professionally-clad and well-groomed Dulcie.\nThe actors skilfully navigate the comic-to-serious turn in the narrative, evidenced when Dulcie chases the drunken Eddie on the slippery deck of a boat (ep. 3), showcasing the physical comedy chops of both actors. Dulcie uncharacteristically raises her voice to Eddie and then savagely mimics her. This temporary swapping of their comic performance styles also marks the turning point in their working relationship, with the scene’s seamless switch to more serious tone as Eddie reveals her past trauma. While there are plenty of other laughs to be had in the town’s quirky inhabitants, it is the comedic interplay of the two leads which ultimately drives Deadloch as comedy and noir-crime procedural. Their relationship can be read both as a sophisticated feminine rendering of the ‘straight man/wiseguy’ trope of classic comic team-ups and a deliberate twist on the pairing of noir detectives.\nAussie Noir in Tassie: Bay of Fires\nABC’s Tasmanian-set series is the most slippery of the three to slot into the comedy-noir mould. It undoubtedly takes on aspects of the classic noir gangster/organised crime element, the ‘small town crime’ tropes of much of Australian Noir, and as ‘Tassie Noir’ it leverages the landscape and rural quirkiness. However, the comedy component doesn’t always hit the mark, and certainly isn’t as consistently present on screen as in Deadloch and Thou Shalt. In Bay of Fires, successful Melbourne CEO Anika (Marta Dusseldorp) has the rug pulled from under her when she is targeted by hitmen. All she knows is she has been betrayed by partner (in business and love) Johann (Nikolai Nikolaeff), and must flee to Tasmania with her children into witness protection. Renaming herself Stella, she tries her best to survive both the weirdness and danger in the fictional town of Mystery Bay.\nProducer and star Dusseldorp states that the backdrop for Bay of Fires, Tasmania’s west coast, “is really a character in this show, it’s a wild wild west” (ABC Radio National). Locations around Zeehan, Queenstown, and Strahan become Mystery Bay, a remote ‘wild west’ enclave harbouring criminals and informants. This area has previously been referred to as the ‘wild west’ in deference to the mining activities of the late nineteenth century which formed the unique moon-like appearance Mount Lyell (Bullock 89), and in Bay of Fires this poisoned landscape is reflective of its poisonous characters. Its opening title sequence follows the style of its comic and serious Tassie-Noir counterparts, with aerial shots over mist-covered mountains segueing to a dark green underwater shot, highlighting the gothic dread of the landscape. It is of course also extremely beautiful, and the picturesque is deliberately juxtaposed with the violent and strange.\nMystery Bay sports a raft of eccentric small-town inhabitants, such as the pig-owning couple with a snobby eye for fashion, Magda and Heather (Pamela Rabe and Roz Hammond), a UFO-obsessed mechanic (Bob Franklin), and a shadowy cult-like family residing on the edge of town. This places viewers in the familiar, comfortable territories of Australian Noir and crime comedy with actors they recognise and love. As critic Mel Campbell notes, these “veteran actors … are having a tremendous amount of fun here as Colourful Locals from Central Casting”. Joining them is hapless local cop Jason (Andre DeVanny), who is clearly powerless against the town’s criminal element. His character is a benign comic example of the struggle figures of authority face in the “moral rottenness of small towns” in Outback Noir (Dolgopolov 80).\nThe classic noir theme of organised crime is realised in the town’s microcosmic criminal underworld, led by ‘queenpin’ Frankie (Kerry Fox). Sanders notes that “violence is an inherent function of the mobster ethos” in television gangster noir such as The Sopranos (453), and Frankie doesn’t shy away from doling out violent retribution. This is evidenced in the dispatch of real estate agent Francis (Stephen Curry), who is chased through the dark woods, put on ‘trial’ by the townsfolk and later found dead in a stream by Stella and her kids, his face covered in a plastic bag (ep. 2). Frankie demands absolute loyalty, even slaying Magda and Heather’s beloved porcine pet when they dare to go against her. While Fox largely plays it straight as the quietly-terrifying matriarch, her crime ‘family’ sometimes subvert her aura of menace with criminal ineptitude. Stretch (Jalen Sutcliffe) sets off a classic gangland-style shootout when he accidently shoots a Russian mobster, his sweet face intoning “Shit. Sorry!” before all hell breaks loose (ep. 8).\nWhile much Australian crime comedy has favoured lower-class underdogs (Dolgopolov 85), Bay of Fires flips the protagonist to the upper-class Stella, with many of the series’ initial comic moments arising from her fish-out-of-water adjustment to her new home, including trading her designer clothes for local op shop finds and moving into a barely-standing house. Stella’s classist view of the criminals she meets also plays on the critique of white Anglo privilege that Dolgopolov observes in other Australian crime comedies (86). However, it doesn’t take long for Stella to join the ranks of her new criminal neighbours, albeit inadvertently. Francis’s brutal gang-style killing is contrasted by Stella’s panicked disposal of a public servant she runs over (eps. 3-4), demonstrative of the neo-noir comic trope involving accidental killers and troublesome corpses (Short 187). She also uses her business acumen to bring white-collar crime to the town, with a plan to avoid becoming another of Frankie’s gruesome victims by generating cash through embezzlement.\nDusseldorp describes the series as a “drama, comedy, thriller” which aims for a tone “like Ozark meets Fargo meets Schitt’s Creek” (qtd. in ABC Radio National). Some critics believe the show struggles to balance this tone, with Mel Campbell stating it “reels between comedy and drama in a stressful and frustrating way”, with lead Dusseldorp “simultaneously the most dramatic onscreen and the most unrealistically clownish”. Any style of comedy is subjective, and as such audiences will respond differently to the show’s tonal inflections; personally, I laughed out loud several times. Overall, the series draws on the landscape aesthetic of Tassie Noir, the classic noir tropes of organised crime and shady underworlds, and neo-noir’s darkly comic use of violence. Underpinning this are Australian Noir/comic-crime’s quirky rural sensibilities and penchant for skilful ensemble casting.\nConclusion\nWhile we have produced a spate of excellent Australian Noir drama on screens big and small, we just cannot help laughing at ourselves, so the appearance of Australian comedy-noir is no surprise. Reading Thou Shalt Not Steal using Greg Dolgopolov’s comprehensive analysis of Outback Noir’s features reveals that the series redeploys these to hilarious effect, while maintaining its own narrative integrity and originality. Shows such as Deadloch prove that we can walk the comic-noir tightrope, and turn an even newer niche sub-genre (Tassie Noir, itself borne of Scandi Noir) into a slick and entertaining crime comedy with a surprisingly heartfelt buddy-cop twist. Bay of Fires, whilst not quite as successfully hitting its comic targets, nonetheless imbues the Australian Noir tropes of small-town secrets and colourful crooks with a few dark laughs. As Jonathan Rayner notes, Australian Gothic cinema embraced the “subversive impact [of] incongruities and startling juxtapositions of horror and humour” (31). Deadloch, and Bay of Fires, as hybrid comedy-gothic-noirs, delight in such juxtapositions and push the incongruity further by punctuating Tasmania’s picture-postcard landscapes with horrific violence.\nSue Short points out that other black comedy TV noirs such as Twin Peaks and Fargo (2014-2024) present an “idyllic town with a dark underside” (207). This is inherent in Deadloch, which embeds the rural crime trope where everyone is a suspect (Turnbull), and in Bay of Fires, with its (somewhat less idyllic) town of mysterious misfits. The outback landscape and rural settings are another hallmark of the Australian Gothic (Rayner 83) and have organically bled into small-screen crime settings. Thou Shalt Not Steal consciously takes its visual lead from “noir/Gothic Westerns” like Mystery Road (Rayner 117), then adds its own comic subversions. Mel Campbell’s comment that “Deadloch [indulges in] the procedural pleasures of rural noir yet [is] ruthlessly willing to lampoon the genre’s clichés” mirrors Short’s assertion that “lampooning well-worn conventions is not an affirmation of noir’s demise [but reflects a] need to imaginatively reinvent the genre” (197). It is also refreshing to find all three series featuring female leads and prominent female supporting roles, with a combination of established actors and rising young Indigenous talent. What we are observing in these comic noirs is the imaginative reinvention not only of broader concepts of noir, but also of Australian Noir itself.\nAcknowledgment\nThe author’s research is supported by an Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship.\nReferences \nBay of Fires.

    "abstract": "Introduction\nOver the last decade, fungi have increasingly appeared in popular culture. Non-fiction texts, such as Melvin Sheldrake’s Entangled Lives (2020) and Doug Bierend’s Mycotopia (2021), illuminate some of the hidden lives of fungi and explore how we could utilise fungi, from sustainable myco-culture to building materials, and models of fungal communities. In turn, this emerging mycological knowledge inspires fiction exploring intersections of human and fungi, including M.R. Carey’s The Girl with all the Gifts (2014) and David Koepp’s Cold Storage (2019). Heightened interest in the potential for fiction to become reality spawns (spores) further investigation.\nIn many of these fungal fictions, the core premise is that a mutation has enabled fungi to infiltrate and control humans. Fungal eruptions warp the form of the human body, and the human becomes food. The fungal mutant demonstrates agency, the capacity to set goals, and learn from its errors. The agentic nonhuman is a terrifying prospect. As the human adapts to this infiltration, both species evolve to survive in the fungal future through further mutation and hybridity. Many of these narratives explore, or leave space for the possibility of, a generation of symbiotic fungal-human beings, a multispecies assemblage best adapted for the post-mutation world.\nThe fungal-human mutant is a challenge to our concept of the human as a separate, bounded individual, and signals future possibilities of adaptation and hybridity. In this article, I consider examples of fungal mutation and the transformation into a human-fungal symbiote. I draw on an ecoGothic framework to consider why fungus is a recurring subject of mutation and how mutated nature might interact with the human.\nThe ecoGothic in Brief\nAn ecoGothic approach orients us to “the more disturbing and unsettling aspects of our interactions with nonhuman ecologies” (Keetley and Sivils 7). It draws our attention to transgression of boundaries, fear of Nature, and the potential horrors arising from human (ab)use of our environments. Beyond this fear of Nature is what Simon Estok terms ‘ecophobia’, an “irrational and groundless hatred of the natural world” (“Ecocriticism and Ecophobia” 208). Estok identifies that ecophobia stems from a sense of human particularity and a desire to dominate and control the natural world. Ecophobia is the response to a loss of control and the perceived threat of a natural world filled with “unpredictable and uncontrolled nonhuman agency” (“Theorising the EcoGothic” 46). As Stacy Alaimo also notes, “the environment, which is too often imagined as inert, empty space or as a resource for human use, is, in fact, a world of fleshy beings with their own needs, claims, and actions” (2).\nA central concern of the ecoGothic is the interchange between the human and nonhuman worlds. Fungal mutations, and the mutant beings that result, draw together Julia Kristeva’s ‘abjection’ and Alaimo’s ‘trans-corporeality’. Kristeva theorises that, to maintain our sense of bounded self, we must throw off (abject) “what disturbs identity, system, order” (4). Bodily waste and the corpse are examples of objects that encroach on that boundary, threatening the “collapse of the border between inside and outside” (53) and thus a source of horror and fascination. Alaimo uses trans-corporeality to describe the recognition that, despite our efforts to separate human and nonhuman entirely, “we are permeable, emergent beings” and our bodies are in constant, productive interchange with the ‘more-than-human’ world (156).\nThough still a niche area within the ecoGothic, the emergence of fungi across texts has drawn increased critical attention in recent years. Ashley Kniss recognises this “Gothic mycology” as a mode mapping “the mysterious behaviour of fungi onto literary plots” (22). Kniss identifies that the “decay-filled endings” of these fungal plots simultaneously offer new beginnings, spaces that have the potential to “reimagine humanity’s interconnectedness with the more-than-human”, a reframing that “goes beyond mere human-fungal hybridity and proposes instead a novel becoming” (23). The fungal ability to infiltrate and control the human, and the resulting hybridity, overwhelms apparently clear boundaries. This fungal infiltration dissolves the boundary of the ‘self’ and reminds us of our own materiality; the natural environment is intimately entangled with our bodies. Additionally, fungi themselves, as organisms of darkness and decay, thresholds and excess, are uniquely Gothic entities. It is worth noting some of their ecoGothic peculiarities before considering how these are transformed in fiction.\nThe Mutability of Fungi\nThere has always been something of the unknown, the strange, the mutant about fungi. Even as we try to pin down fungal properties, whether in popular fungal nonfiction or as objects of scientific study, fungi seem to be continually transforming. Depending on the health and life cycle of the fungus and its host, the same fungus can be an uncanny combination of symbiotic and parasitic and necrotrophic (Frost 591).\nFungi disrupt classifications, refusing binaries in a state of existence that seems to be and/and rather than either/or. What we learn about fungi resists easy categorisation, with any identifying characteristics uneasily qualified by ‘may, can, some, most’. Fungi are “uncannily situated somewhere between animal and plant” (Bierend 249), possessing “a mixture of qualities common to both” (Kaishian and Djoulakian 10). Though mushrooms might appear plant-like, fungi rely on a kind of enzymatic ‘digestion’ like animals. They appear to sense, respond to, and communicate about their environment (Boddy 39, 42) and show complex, even intelligent, behaviours (Sheldrake 65-66). The fungal ability to transform dead matter into succulent growth is horrifying as the visible intermingling of “what should be the ultimate opposites: life and death” (Hogle 108). In many ways, fungi embody the abject; they are “what disturbs identity, system, order, [the] in-between, the ambiguous, the composite” (Kristeva 4).\nWe are inextricably connected with fungi in ways that we are still uncovering. Fungi have evolved to become essential components in unexpected systems, from mycorrhizal networks (the contested ‘Wood-Wide Web’ theory) to our own mycobiomes. Fungi are a dynamic and responsive network, repeatedly demonstrating their “capacity for planning and problem-solving” (Sheldrake 41). They are a reminder that the material and natural world “are complex, interconnected and surprising networks of things, each with its own agency, always liable to interact with human plans in surprising and disconcerting ways” (Clark 114). Fungi elude human control. The agency of fungi is a source of ecoGothic possibilities and a challenge to our current way of understanding the world.\nAlthough generally unseen, fungi are ubiquitous. Consisting of hyphae, thread-like cells, that network and tangle into mycelium, fungi are highly adaptable to environmental stimuli and able to change their shapes and behaviours for ecological advantage; “fungal forms are other — indeterminate” (Harley 151). What we do see of fungi is usually the fruiting body, which is formed when hyphae swell and push out into the world. In reproduction, too, fungi are happy to mutate by fusing hyphae, creating spores, or asexual duplication. Fungal fruiting bodies take on bizarre shapes and features that can evoke intrigue, horror, and desire. Their names evoke Gothic themes – ‘Dead Man’s Fingers’, ‘Witch’s Butter’, the Tooths, and the Stinkhorns (genus Phallus; BMS, English Names for Fungi).\nThe Cordyceps genus has particularly captured the imagination, bringing about the end of human society as we know it across popular culture, including The Last of Us (video game 2013, TV series 2023-2025), The Girl with All the Gifts (2014, film adaptation 2016), and Cold Storage (2019). Depictions of mutated fungal threats are all the more unsettling for being threaded through with real-life fungal characteristics. Part of this fascination is the unnerving potential of Cordyceps. Currently, each species of Cordyceps is adapted to one insect species. Cordyceps infect the host, manipulate behaviours to fulfill certain conditions, then use the body as sustenance and a site to mature, before fruiting and releasing spores to begin the cycle anew. New forms of Cordyceps are not beyond the realm of possibility considering most fungal species remain “unknown unknowns” (Boddy 24-25). A Cordyceps specialising in humans is a horrifying proposition.\nFungal Mutation\nRapidly changing environmental conditions and climate crises in the actual world hold an ecoGothic threat by increasing the potential of mutations. On the one hand, mutation can damage the organism and cause its destruction. On the other, a mutation can become an adaptation useful for survival. Similarly to the monsters and superheroes of pulp-fiction, fictional fungal mutations are often an unintended consequence of unmonitored pollution and scientific experimentation. Initially, the mutations turn the fungus into a threat, and the human into food. The mutations can manifest as fungal agency. There is an inherent tension to exploring nonhuman agency. We can only understand our world and concepts of agency on our own terms. Fungal mutations offer a way to explore this tension, the human subsumed into part of an agentic nonhuman and mutated into a new form. Fungal fictions destabilise our conceptions of humans at the top of the evolutionary ladder.\nIn Cold Storage, by David Koepp, an unlikely human crew are pitted against a “highly mutative organism capable of extinction-level destruction”. Rather than a post-apocalyptic fungal future, the novel is set in March 2019, with the Prologue identifying Armillaria solidipes in Oregon (the humongous fungus) as one mutation away from ending all life on earth. Like Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, the threat to human supremacy results from scientific hubris awakening unexpectedly intelligent life that objects to its imprisonment. Researchers take a Cordyceps novus fungus with “peculiar growth properties” into space “to see how it was affected” (14). When the fungus returned to earth, “it was reawakened and found itself in a hot, safe, protein-rich, pro-growth environment. And something caused its higher-level genetic structure to change” (15-16). This mutation makes the fungus faster to adapt to new situations and new prey. The precipitating event to this particular fungus’s escape is the failure of the cooling system restricting its growth. The cooling system relied on a natural spring fed by the Missouri River, which “had spent most of the twenty-first century warming up, along with the rest of the planet” (165).\nWhen the mutated fungus invades human hosts, not only does it gain nutrients and a warm place to reproduce, it digests the host’s knowledge. The intangible fundamentals of being human – memories, behaviours, relationships – are digestible matter able to be cut out and consumed as easily as flesh. In a parody of Hollywood creature-features, “Cordyceps novus had tasted humans, and it wanted more” (166). The fungus evolves by using humans as nutrients and incubators. The fungus learns, it has strategies, and its colonies reflect the success of its choices. It is attentive to potential problems and is “an excellent student” (221).\nAt various points in the novel, the “grateful fungus” (46) becomes the narrative focaliser. The shifting focalisation, through fungus, human and, at one point, a deer, manipulates reader empathy. Despite the fungus being an explicit threat, there is a dark humour to the fungus’s reflections on its life and the potential offered by humans, “as if God had drawn these creatures up specifically to make life easy for the fungus” (166). Though narrative is inherently anthropocentric, shifting focalisation highlights the essential difference of fungus: “though it can’t think in those terms, or think at all, per se, a fungus knows what works and what doesn’t, and it pursues the former as vigorously and completely as it disregards the latter” (282).\nThere is an ecoGothic unsettling dichotomy in the fungus “joyfully increasing its biomass” (263), while the humans it consumes suffer a grotesque death. The focus, on whichever being is trying to thrive in adverse circumstances, destabilises anthropocentric points of view. By destabilising expectations of character and narration, readers are forced to think of themselves as food; humans are one mutation away from losing their assumed supremacy. If intelligence, agency, and a capacity to learn can be a result of random mutation, an adaptive strategy for survival, then it is only chance that separates human from nonhuman. It is possible that agency is not an exclusively human attribute, only that humans fail to recognise it in nonhuman beings. \nHybrids and Symbiosis\nLike Cold Storage, in The Girl with All the Gifts (Carey 2014) a mutated Cordyceps variant uses humans as food and fertiliser. Set twenty years after the first infection, the fungal plague has transformed most of the population of England into ‘hungries’, zombie-like beings driven to consume humans at all costs. The protagonist, Melanie, is an intellectually gifted young girl living in a military outpost. She is also a new generation of fungal hybrid, “a child who’s neither, or both” (377).\nThe transformation of the fungal-human can be viewed as a series of cascading mutations and mutual adaptation. The initial mutation allows the fungus to use humans, as its real-world counterpart uses insects. In the first wave of the mutation, the fungus consumes the body from the inside out. Hungries are commanded entirely by the fungus, which hijacks the host’s living brain “making it do what the parasite needs it to do” (377). Before the process of co-adaptation, the fungus “utterly wrecks the brain of a first-generation hungry” (379). By the second generation, “the fungus is spread evenly throughout the brain… it doesn’t feed on the brain… It’s become a true symbiote rather than a parasite” (379). These fungal-children are capable of planning and adapting in search of prey. Unknowable agency coupled with an apparently human form places the reactions of many of the human characters in the realm of abjection. The hungries in Girl are “death infecting life” (Kristeva 4). This second generation is an example of the ambiguous and composite that threatens the boundaries of self (Kristeva 4-5).\nIn this process of generational transformation, it is notable that, unlike the zombies of the first mutation, the second-generation has more than a hint of the vampiric: “a face out of nightmare… Dark-eyed, pale-skinned… Its wide mouth hangs open to display slender pointed teeth like the teeth of a piranha… reacting to the light with instant, murderous rage” (384). These traditional Gothic monsters are liminal beings, a semblance of life and nearly-human forms. Coupled with the fungus, these interstitial creatures further destabilise the boundaries of human/nonhuman: “they exist across multiple categories of being and conform cleanly to none of them” (Hurley 24). Their monstrousness is a discomforting illustration of the natural world overwhelming porous human boundaries. Considering these beings as ecoGothic monsters, their propensity to shift and function as “the harbinger of category crisis” (Cohen 40) means they could be productively read through Jeffrey Jerome Cohen’s “method of reading cultures from the monsters they engender” (37). Fungi and fungal mutations challenge us to “reevaluate our cultural assumptions” (Cohen 52). Fungal life is networked and rhizomatic, rather than hierarchical. Kingdom Fungi encompasses a plurality of forms, adaptations, methods of reproduction, and ways of being. As well as continually evading human control, both in fiction and real life, fungi raise questions about agency as a distinctly human quality. Certainly, this new generation of fungal-human beings are an ecoGothic example of monsters that “stand at the threshold” of becoming (Cohen 52).\nAs well as the almost-human monsters, The Girl with All the Gifts features entirely human ones. Dr. Caldwell is the human expert on this (fictional) version of the Cordyceps fungus. Her dissections of the fungal-children reveal mycelial threads and fungal matter are dispersed throughout their bodies. Though she repeatedly deems these deaths necessary for scientific understanding, at her final dissection she acknowledges “the extent (close to a hundred per cent) to which her own labours over these past seven years have been a waste of time” (371). Caldwell’s monstrosity is her refusal to acknowledge the capacities of the nonhuman, or its value as a lifeform. Her response is ecophobic. She sees Melanie and the other fungal-children only in terms of how they can be used for human survival rather than the next step in the process of adaptation. For Caldwell, they are not worthy of attention because “the subject presents as a child but is actually a fungal colony animating a child’s body” (112).\nCaldwell’s theories of fungal behaviour are modelled on her own willingness to ignore anything that does not serve her, assuming the fungus would shut down “all behaviours that didn’t serve the parasite’s agenda” (378). Early in the novel, Caldwell explains that the fungus hasn’t spored, and determines that it can only reproduce “asexually, in a nutrient solution. Ideally, human blood” (52). However, on the journey to find another safehold she sees hungries behaving in ways that demonstrate “the survival of other human drives and emotions” (379). Her assumption that the fungus would not have needed the sex drive or motherly instinct leads her to make the false assumption that the children were immune, a different type of infection, rather than a posthuman form adapted for survival in symbiosis with the fungus. By not entirely destroying elements of its human host, the fungus benefits from human methods of reproduction in a world where fresh prey is running low and the original hungries have deteriorated beyond use. This implies fungal agency even before the co-mutation and symbiosis with the human; the fungus was able to make decisions based on possible futures, then mutate again to ensure its survival. Caldwell’s attempts to classify the fungal-children misses that they have already grown beyond the human. Caldwell’s single-mindedness might serve to warn us that, though we privilege human agency and cognition, we are “constantly influenced and altered” by nonhuman organisms (Tidwell “Ecohorror” 542).\nOne of Caldwell’s final observations is that “the world is winding down” (377). She continues to identify Melanie as ‘merely a hungry’, nothing more than a body “infected with a fungus” (377). And yet, Melanie is the “the messenger sent by providence” (380) to hear the summation of Caldwell’s labours. This irony challenges the reader to consider whose world is winding down and how we can reimagine the world that comes next.\nJohan Höglund’s analysis of the text suggests that human extinction is “certainly not as tragic as the alternative future of constant killing and destruction that Melanie envisages” and that “something is gained by making room for tentacular multispecies being and becoming… The novel makes it possible to envisage the hybrid children forming communities very different from current human society” (261). It is in the hybridity, the symbiosis between fungi and human, that a being emerges that can survive in the world after the fungi finally spores. By adapting our approach to connections and partnerships with the nonhuman, it is possible that a new generation will emerge that can thrive in a hybrid future.\nConclusion\nIn fungal fictions, human responses to fungal mutations range from ecophobic attempts to destroy or control through to acceptance of a new normal, even at the cost of human individuality. These unsettling scenarios show the positive potential for hybridity and symbiosis, where decentring the human perhaps “leaves room for other species to live and flourish’ (Tidwell “Monstrous Natures” 543). Reframing existing human structures as non-hierarchical and rhizomatic opens the possibility that we adopt “a collective, mycelial way of thinking about ourselves and the ecologies outside of the self” and that “we must also reimagine the possibility of agency and subjectivity” in nonhuman and fungal life” (Kniss 24).\nUltimately, whether they emerge due to random chance or a result of human action, fungal mutations are an ecoGothic confrontation with the limits of our own control. By troubling anthropocentric borders of body and mind, mycological texts challenge readers to confront “their own tangible, embodied and emplaced selves as material beings, interconnected with substances and the world” (Kuznetski and Alaimo 140). These fictions allow us to conceptualise and experiment with other types of agency and ways of being. They are also a response to the anxiety about what might come about if humanity continues to cause ever greater ecological shifts.\nFungal fiction offers the potential for adapting alongside the nonhuman rather than fighting it. As Kniss notes, to survive the Anthropocene will require “sacrifice of human identity and way of life” and “a posthuman reimagining of our place in ecological hierarchies” (25). The possibilities of mutation and adaptation are, like fungi, more of an and/and than either/or. Amidst the horror of change, where established structures are upended, there remains the potential for better, deeper connections with the natural environment and opportunities to work in partnership with the nonhuman world, rather than by fear or dominance. In the end, it is mutation that might save us after all.\nReferences\nAlaimo, Stacy. Bodily Natures: Science, Environment, and the Material Self. Indiana UP, 2010.\nBierend, Doug.

    "abstract": "Introduction\nThe city is one of the most common iconographies associated with film noir, particularly at night. For several noir critics, the city is an inseparable and determining element in the definition, narrative structure, and aesthetic of film noir. However, while urban spaces dominate classic imagery, noir has also engaged significantly with rural and small-town settings. These spaces challenge the presumed centrality of the city, revealing noir’s capacity to explore moral decay, isolation, and violence beyond the urban landscape.\nThis article examines the role of rural and small-town spaces in noir, centring the television series Mare of Easttown (2021) as an example of “small-town noir”. Set in a working-class town in Pennsylvania, the series illustrates how noir narratives adapt to non-urban landscapes, using these environments to explore themes of entrapment, generational trauma, and social disintegration. Unlike the anonymous and sprawling cityscapes of traditional noir, Mare of Easttown situates its story in a close-knit yet fractured community, where the relationships change the meaning of the crime and the dynamic of the investigation.\nThrough the analysis of Mare of Easttown, this article focusses on how television has become a significant platform for the evolution of noir, offering space to explore narrative complexities and spatial diversity. The setting of Mare of Easttown asserts that noir’s essential characteristics—moral ambiguity, disillusionment, and entrapment—are not bound to the city but can also resonate in small-town settings.\nNoir beyond the City\nIt is hard to separate film noir from the urban space; in fact, most studies place the city as a central and determining element in its aesthetics and in the construction of the narrative itself. James Naremore states that noir evokes a series of generic and stylistic characteristics, one of which is the urban setting, particularly diners, decadent offices, or stylish nightclubs (1). Regarding noir's relationship with the city, Nicholas Christopher states that the city is an essential element of noir. He adds that the “two are inseparable” since the vast American metropolis, with its dynamic mix of greatness and decadence, serves as the perfect backdrop for noir (37). The inseparability between urban space and noir is also mentioned by Andrew Dickos. The author states that one of the determining structural elements of noir is the existence of an urban setting or at least the existence of an urban influence (6).\nFor Imogen Sara Smith the importance of the city in noir is intrinsically linked to one of the main antagonisms that arises in this type of film: the conflict between the values of individual freedom and community security. The author adds that “film noir is about people who break the rules, pursuing their own interests outside the boundaries of decent society, and about how they are destroyed by society – or by themselves” (2). Thus, faced with the impossibility of standing up to the magnitude of society, the protagonists of noir are driven to despair, feeling an intense need to escape. For this reason, one of the central motifs is precisely the idea that there is no escape. Therefore, noir is about characters struggling to survive and, ultimately, to escape what Lewis Mumford calls the megalopolis. The city functions as a perfect metaphor for imprisonment and is decisive in the construction of the very narrative structure of noir. As Eddie Muller points out:\n\nas in every noir, these folks will carom through a story line with a structure reflecting the city itself. Unexpected intersections. Twisted corridors. Secrets hidden in locked rooms. Lives dangling from dangerous heights. Abrupt dead ends. The blueprints were drawn up by a demented urban planner. (21)\n\nA possible reason for this emphasis on the importance of the city may be related to the attempts to conclusively categorise noir. One of the arguments pointed out by Smith is related to the need for many authors to try to define film noir as a genre. The use of the city as an element that somehow supports their theories is justified by the fact that one of the ways of defining a genre is through the setting or subject manner. This is the case for the Western with its strong connection to the American West, or the war films, which tend to take place on the battlefield, and so on, whereas film noir is too diverse to be classified in such a precise way. Noir is far too complex to be classified so distinctly since it embraces other genres such as the gangster, the heist, the melodrama, and even the Western. It is therefore easier to understand it by assuming film noir as “a mood, a stance, an attitude. It is defined not by any single element but by a combination of content, style and theme” (Smith 4).\nAnother aspect that may be brought to the Smith argument is the fact that, although the representation of urban space is more consistently associated with noir than other elements, the reality is that there are several films whose action takes place in rural spaces or small towns. For example, in On Dangerous Ground (1951), the protagonist is transferred from New York City to a rural community upstate in the hope that a less chaotic environment will have a healing effect. In Out of the Past (1947), Jeff Bailey takes refuge in the small town of Bridgeport in an attempt to escape his criminal past. However, the examples are not restricted to the classic noir period. In contemporary times, these locations are also central to some noir-influenced narratives, namely Fargo (1996), Winter's Bone (2010), Cold in July (2014), or Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017), just to name a few.\nNevertheless, the differences between noirs set in urban areas and those set in rural areas or small towns are not restricted to a simple change of location. Although most small-town noirs deal with the same themes, using similar character types, their specificity lies in the fact that they offer a series of social, spatial, and visual readings of the American landscape. In this respect, Smith characterises the small towns of film noir as places dominated by oppressive forces, where the police serve their own interests or those who have more power, rather than strictly following the law (83).\nAs a result, certain illegal activities take place in plain sight, without any consequences. In turn, anyone who destabilises the harmony of the small town quickly becomes a target, and sooner or later they suffer the repercussions of their intrusion. Consequently, these places are apparently peaceful and perfect, but behind this false cover, they hide dangerous secrets, violence, or fanaticism. In short, they are spaces where everyone knows each other and where it is almost impossible to get away from assumptions and from the past (Smith 83). On the complexity of the small towns, Imogen Sara Smith notes:\n\nsmall towns are sentimentally cherished in American culture, but they also stand for complacency; their inhabitants are typed as narrow-minded, conservative, ignorant, self-righteous, and distrustful of outsiders. The nosy, judgmental, trouble-making gossip who spies on her neighbors and broadcasts their perceived failings is a ubiquitous type in classic Hollywood films. (83)\n\nThe concept of the small town that the author draws is explored by noir through the representation of communities that tend to restrict freedom and incite intolerance. Accordingly, the more closed the community seems to be, the more vulnerable it becomes to being corrupted. The decline in morality is shared by the whole community, which remains in silence, while violence and money replace justice and law in the small-town structure. While in thematic and narrative terms small-town noir tends to explore the idea of a small, innocent, and fragile community, these are places highly marked by corruption and violence.\nRegarding the formal aspects of small-town noir, Jonathan F. Bell (230) notes that there are significant differences from urban noir. In urban noir, the opening shots are usually images of a huge, labyrinthine city, as in Side Street (1950) or To Live and Die in L.A. (1985), but in small-town noir, the wide-open spaces are the visual counterpoint: for example, the first moments of Affliction (1997) or No Country for Old Men (2017). The landscape conveys an apparent sense of freedom and control, as it allows a complete understanding of the space through the gaze. Nonetheless, these formal devices are used within this landscape to create claustrophobic environments similar to those found in the city, such as dark, decaying bars or typical small-town police stations. Upon entering these spaces, the shadows and dead ends typical of urban noir take on a new aspect, proving that the dark forces of the genre are also widespread in rural areas (Bell 230). The author uses as an example the films The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946), in particular the scene in which Cora Smith (Lana Turner) is forced to climb the cliff through a narrow channel in a rock, creating a claustrophobic and acrophobic environment, and Gun Crazy (1950), specifically the final scene in which almost all visual resources are eliminated, focussing only on the two main characters who, exhausted, take refuge in the midst of a dense swamp (Bell 232).\nMore contemporary films Blood Simple (1984) and Winter's Bone (2010) also use these visual resources. In the first, in the scene in which Marty (Dan Hedaya) tries to kidnap Abby (Frances McDormand), the light cut by the shutters, typical of noir, is present throughout the scene, creating a threatening and enclosing atmosphere. In the second, when Merab (Dale Dickey) takes Ree (Jennifer Lawrence) to the middle of the lake so that she can see her father's body, the dim lighting and blue tones of the scene highlight the protagonist's state of restlessness and uncertainty.\nOther visual resources used are the images of long roads that cross the vast natural territory, with no sign of buildings or human presence. Ironically, this imagery can also represent a certain claustrophobia. The almost endless road towards the horizon carries a symbolic weight, representing in these films the only possible path or predetermined destination, from which there is no escape (Bell 232). Like the future of the protagonists, when you look at these roads, you can see nothing but the continuous landscape. In the opening scene of the film Key Largo (1948), the tar road is the only route to the Florida Keys and, consequently, the only means by which the divergent characters will meet (Bell 233). In Fargo (1996), the opening scene sets the mood and pace of the film when the black screen turns white, slowly revealing a car driving along a road completely covered in snow and seemingly with no end in sight.\nThrough these examples, we can conclude that the themes and visual conventions that were established in urban noir have been reproduced in rural and small-town spaces. Big cities were ideal for crime since they allowed a certain level of anonymity. In small towns, the more familiar and intimate environment increases the likelihood of the criminal being known by all the residents, making these actions even more disconcerting (Short 27). Hence, small-town noir allows for readings of the decaying American landscape, emphasising one of the main messages of noir: there is nowhere safe to go anymore.\nThe approach of film noir to the spaces beyond the big city is largely related to more contemporary forms of noir, particularly through television series. These narratives have become a fruitful space for the development of noir-inspired stories that explore rural areas or small towns and their particularities far from large urban centres. Some examples include the series True Detective (2014-), Fargo (2014-), Ozark (2017-2022), and Sharp Objects (2018), among others.\nWhat they have in common is that they represent communities which, the more compact they are, the more deeply corruptible they become. As Smith states, in these places, “racketeering doesn’t only affect the hidden realm of government; it’s a shared, unspoken secret among all citizens”. Consequently, “truth itself is warped as people agree to accept the validity of lies” (92). Ultimately, justice and the law are dictated by money and violence in the structure of those societies. Taking this reading of the noir space in suburban areas of the USA as a starting point, this analysis explores how Mare of Easttown, from a contemporary perspective, draws inspiration from noir representations of the small town. Additionally, we will examine how space plays a decisive role in shaping the narrative and defining the characters, while embracing traditional noir themes.\nMare of Easttown as Small-Town Noir\nThe HBO series Mare of Easttown (2021) is a quintessential example of how contemporary noir narratives can explore the complexities of small-town life in suburban America. Through its noir-influenced storytelling, dark visual aesthetics, and morally ambiguous characters, Mare of Easttown delves into the socio-economic struggles, generational trauma, and intertwined personal histories that characterise the town of Easttown, Pennsylvania. In doing so, the series not only adheres to classic noir conventions but also redefines the genre by emphasising community and intimacy in ways that amplify the small-town setting.\nThe series is built on the investigation of a teenage mother’s death, which turns into three different investigations into crimes against women. Two of them are related to the kidnapping and rape carried out by an outsider in the context of the small town. The third one, that of the young teenage mother, ends up being classified as domestic violence. The investigations are led by detective Mare Sheehan (Kate Winslet), a woman trying to find balance between family life and her work, but more than that, as a mother figure, Mare carries the weight of loss and guilt. This portrait of Mare as both protector and outcast emphasises the noir's interest in flawed heroes who operate in morally grey areas, divided between duty and personal demons.\nAs a crime drama, the series explores the limits of the police's ability to break cycles of violence against women. In addition, it also examines how the community and family structures of those who live in the small town of Easttown can hide patterns of violence. In this regard, the small town presents itself as a familiar social environment, while at the same time it replicates some elements of the “big city”. For this reason, as Michael Dango points out:\n\nMare of Easttown also figures a social environment that is both family and city at once, making it impossible to disentangle stranger rape and forms of acquaintance, date, or intimate partner rape – and therefore impossible to locate the problem of rape as one of crimes to be solved by the police; or one of ordinary heterosexuality, requiring more radical cultural transformation. (3)\n\nThese patterns of violence and the intertwining of the intimate and the foreign are set against the backdrop of a community debilitated by deindustrialisation and loss of hope. Easttown is beset by issues like unemployment, addiction, and declining economic opportunities. These struggles contribute to the pervasive sense of hopelessness among the town’s residents, a mood reminiscent of classic noir’s fatalistic worldview. The series suggests that these economic pressures exacerbate human flaws, leading to violence and betrayal that often result from characters' efforts to escape or cope with their realities. Moreover, in Easttown, resignation replaces political anger, and it is individual failure rather than corporate greed that Mare's investigation reveals.\nThe failures are mainly associated, but not exclusively, with the father figure. As Sue Thornham states, the several imperfect parental figures who appear in the series are interconnected by their inability to fulfill their duties as fathers or community leaders. Despite their anger, they are not necessarily tied to corruption or damaging expressions of masculinity (Thornham 4). In Mare of Easttown individual failure is, therefore, the failure of the community.\nThis permanent sense of failure relates to the noir tradition of the pursuit of a derailed American Dream, but also to the idea of home and personal and social relationships being jeopardised in the face of weakness and desire. Similarly, the so-called societal institutions (family, marriage, law) and the idea that hard work is enough to overcome economic difficulties end up failing, leading to the consequent destabilisation of the community. In this regard, the series aligns with the noir critique of systemic inequalities, showing how a small town, although idealised as community-centred and healthy, can also be a place where hope is suppressed, and dreams turn to bitterness.\nThe instability of the community is also related to the spatial restriction of the small town. If everyone knows each other and everyone has some kind of access to the privacy of the family, violence within the family not only becomes more “accessible”, but also more shocking. As one of the detectives in the series says during an interrogation: “Is there anybody you’re not related to?” The small town in Mare of Easttown allows for a uniquely noir exploration of interconnected lives and inescapable pasts. The relationships are multi-generational, which means that each action has a chain effect on the whole community. Secrets, past grudges, and untold stories influence present actions, with crimes and personal vendettas emerging as expressions of long-held resentments.\nThis thematic focus is particularly effective in a small-town setting, where proximity and shared history intensify the characters’ entanglements. In noir, the protagonist often tries to escape a dark past or a corrupt urban landscape, but Mare's journey is the opposite: she is irrevocably linked to Easttown, a place that symbolises both her losses and failures and her loyalty and resistance. This portrait highlights the noir concept of “entrapment” while emphasising the small town as a space where the faults of the past endure, and the possibility of renewal or escape are limited.\nConclusion\nMare of Easttown can be understood as an insightful look at some of the main problems that haunt suburban and rural areas in the United States. It highlights issues such as the opioid crisis, insufficient health care, precariousness, and low-paying jobs, but also the desire of younger people to get out of their small town as quickly as possible. Crime in Easttown, in general, seems to be more related to the desperation of people obliged to subsist on less, than to pure malice.\nIn addition, Mare of Easttown differentiates from other series by focussing on mundanity amid tragedy and by representing grief, sorrow, and forgiveness as a collective rather than an individual process. Moreover, all these processes are presented as part of everyday life and not just as an exception for dramatic effect. Crime, violence, pain, mourning, and forgiveness are consequences that do not affect just one character, but an entire community that needs to come together to heal.\nThrough series like Mare of Easttown, despite the “hyperreal status and diffusion in popular culture”, as Lindsay Steenberg puts it, television offers the possibility “for the reconstitution of noir as a useful theoretical concept” (63), especially through the way it explores rural and suburban areas. Continuing the long tradition of noir, Mare of Easttown echoes Andrew Spicer's view that noir explores the “dark underside of the American dream. Because that dream forms the core mythology of global capitalism” (xlix). Noir, especially through series like Mare of Easttown, continues to be an important cultural phenomenon that is constantly evolving, a “crucial vehicle through which that mythology can be critiqued and challenged” (Spicer, xlix).\nReferences\nAffliction.

    "abstract": "Introduction\n“With most people, you cannot tell just from looking at them that they are fighting a silent, unseen battle”, says Sugary Symbiote, a Black, disabled, and sapphic artist in the United States. “That is what a lot of my illustrations represent. The girl is surrounded by cute things that make her happy, but she still feels alone and sad” (Sugary Symbiote). Central to her work is the bishōjo, or “cute girl”, drawn from manga, anime, and related media. While scholarship has largely treated bishōjo as objects produced for and by men (Galbraith; Galbraith and Rose), artists such as Sugary Symbiote reveal their queer and transformative potential. Women, queer men, and gender-diverse people have long engaged with bishōjo as sites for self-expression, identity, and resistance. For Sugary Symbiote, the bishōjo “may be assumed to be for the male gaze, but she is more than that. She has internal struggles that no one else can see” (Sugary Symbiote). Her illustrations reconfigure bishōjo through a Black queer lens, forming part of a broader movement by global fans to reclaim and reimagine Japanese popular culture (Gresham; Hassel; Jordan-Zachery and Harris). As Laura Miller notes, bishōjo figures can “serve … important social and cultural functions” by persuading, informing, and resisting through stylised cuteness (“Afterword” 172). In seeing the bishōjo through Sugary Symbiote’s eyes, we aim to draw scholarly attention to these underexplored dimensions of embodiment and affect.\nFigures such as the bishōjo can be continuously reimagined as mediators of body, self, and gender. This aligns with Jack Halberstam’s idea of “sublime mutation” (143), wherein women and gender-diverse people enact the bishōjo’s pliability through an ongoing interplay of the “fem(me)” and “hyperfemininity”. We use “fem(me)” to describe feminine-identifying and/or -presenting people of all genders, who have reclaimed the term “girl” to signify a queer excess. Scholars such as Rhea Hoskin and Allison Taylor show how hyperfemininity, pushed to its extremes, becomes an “agential femininity” that “veers from patriarchal sanctions” (283), offering genderqueer potential (Schippers). Fem(me) cultures also give room for the “cripping” and “queering” of bodies, opening up possibilities of expression and reflection on pain, trauma, and marginality (Kafer). While much academic work universalises fem(me) experience, artists like Sugary Symbiote speak from the first person—visibly and loudly—through their practice. As Lauren Elkin argues, “the feminist artist who addresses herself to the question of beauty and the female body has to be ready for other people to see her as a monster” (35). We are reminded of Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha’s queer-crip performance in Sins Invalid, where she highlights how significant it is to give voice to disability in this context: “queer women of color never say we are disabled if we have any choice about it … . Our bodies are already seen as tough, monster, angry, seductive … . How can we admit weakness, vulnerability, interdependence and still keep … our perch on the ‘thin edge of barbwire’ we live on?” Here Sugary Symbiote’s work and its open, cute vulnerability offers much to contemplate. Like in many other contemporary fem(me) practices, her monstrous feminine appears and demands to be seen.\nYet “repetitive academic attention” (Kinsella 18) to male fans and artists continues to dominate the field, leading to misconceptions and ignoring the rich, creative output of women and gender-diverse practitioners. As Miller notes, this marginalisation “forestalls a consideration of female agency and resistance through aesthetic forms” (“Cute” 24). This article contributes to a larger project titled Girl Estranged, which examines how women and gender-diverse people in Japan and beyond reinterpret bishōjo figures through their own illustrations. Drawing on Elkin’s Art Monsters, we foreground the fem(me) figure as central to exploring “complex feelings” and multiple “forms of embodiment” (22). Even when rendered in the language of cute girl characters, these voices can be, we argue, defiantly monstrous.\nIn the Girl Estranged project, we explore how fem(me) and queer artists engage with bishōjo—manga/anime-style cute girl characters—as symbols, texts, and avatars. Building on Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari’s notion that “we are composed of lines”, we examine how artists invent “lines of flight” through their characters, expressing selves and desires beyond normative structures (202). These lines are not just drawn—they draw us in, enabling expression through and with bishōjo. While we centre sapphic representation—fem(me)-identifying people attracted to fem(me)s—we also include heterosexual fem(me)s and ace-spectrum perspectives, expanding beyond sexual intimacy to explore alternative forms of affect and connection. We collaborate with artists and illustrators who work in local subcultural scenes in Tokyo, Japan, and international digital spaces such as Instagram. Here emerges a convergence of local Japanese cultures and a diverse array of communities who co-participate with them in parallel overseas. In Japan, this includes YUI, an illustrator who creates sapphic works inspired by dating simulation games, and whose joyfully queer and girly images were taken up by English-speaking meme boards worldwide. Other examples include Aoi Uni, who paints abstract interpretations of the bishōjo figure to create her own “ironic and poisonous” queer world. Sugary Symbiote presents one of the many global artists we reflect on, including Australian street artist Bei Badgirl and American-resident artist Junko Mizuno. The visual work of artists across these two scenes tends to operate in intimate gallery networks where zines and low-cost goods circulate. Their curation diverges from mainstream white-wall conventions, shaping a fem(me)-centred aesthetic that resists institutional norms. As should be clear from bishōjo or “cute girls”, the artists we feature reclaim the figure of the “girl”, which does not denote “child”, but rather is a the fem(me) full of self-identifying, agentic presence.\nImagining and Creating “Bishōjo”\nOriginating in the ferment of the nascent movement of mature fans of comics for girls in Japan from the 1970s into the early 1980s, bishōjo are manga/anime-style cute girl characters. This manga/anime style is in contrast to the more realistic drawings seen in Japanese comics, which had dominated the previous decade and continued to have a hold on the popular imagination. In contrast to action stories presenting gritty representations of pulp-like intrigue and violence, a “cuter” manga/anime style provided a more playful and flexible alternative (Shiokawa 97). Here the playfulness of manga/anime’s form, with simplified rounded shapes and bold cartoony line work, shone out in the Japanese media landscape. This was, in some ways, a return to classic visual representation such as Tezuka Osamu’s Astro Boy (1952-1968, see fig. 1), which spanned out from work for children to include people of all genders and age demographics. \nFig. 1: First appearing in the 1950s, Astro Boy was a hit among children. The cute style of the character, pictured here, spread to works targeting more mature audiences in the 1970s. Image courtesy of Tezuka Osamu’s official Website. \nComics targeting girls and young women, written by women and queer men in particular, became a driving force in shaping and expanding on these logics. Given the association of comics for girls with “cute” (Shiokawa 99), it is not too much to say that the bishōjo, representative of the manga/anime style, is above all else “cute”. Even the distinctively large, shimmering eyes of bishōjo, which emerged from the contribution of girls’ comics as a way to encourage “empathy” (Takahashi 124, see fig. 2), are now emblematic of cuteness.\n\nFig. 2: The characteristic look of comics for girls evolved from lyrical pictures in the pre- and interwar periods. Note the massive, sparkly eyes in this poster for an exhibition of illustrator Youko Tadatsu’s work.\nThis capacity to feel with and as the cute girl mutated further, generating hybrid art appealing to men, women, and others. Appearing first in 1978, Invader Lum is perhaps the most famous of the bishōjo pinups and cover girls of the time (Galbraith 107-112, see fig. 3), but she certainly was not the only or the last one. While much has been written on Lum as a character “for men”, little attention has been paid to her significance as an important figure for sapphics, or indeed, the artist Takahashi Rumiko’s own sapphic intimations. (One recalls an interview where Takahashi quipped that, if she were a man, she would “get a wife”; Shōnen Sunday Graphic.) Further to this are assumptions in the literature as to how men engage with these texts. For example, today, the largest university clubs dedicated to queer pairings of bishōjo characters are not only a mixture of genders and sexualities, but also circulate and discuss books on Japanese lesbian politics as part of community-building and allyship (for more, see Welker). On the ground in Japan is a far more dynamic field than scholarship and English-speaking fandom presupposes, and this arguably begins with figures such as Lum in the 1970s.\n\nFig. 3: In the late 1970s, Lum, featured on the cover of this art book, made a huge splash among manga/anime fans in Japan. As the centre of the mega-popular franchise Urusei Yatsura, she appeared in countless media and material forms for over a decade. \nBeginning in Japanese subculture and underground comic markets, cosplay, and spectacular fashion cultures, the bishōjo became increasingly “cool” through international fan movements from the 1990s into the early 2000s, and subsequent Japanese government initiatives, and finally the inclusion of anime on large streaming platforms such as Netflix. Here, a mutation of meaning and cultural capital can be observed between domestic and international markets. In Japan, Saitō Tamaki, a practicing psychiatrist and public intellectual with an interest in manga/anime fans, once described bishōjo as “extremely strange figures, or strange compositions” (Saitō Tamaki). Citing their high artifice, exaggeration and “thingness”, Saitō argues that pleasure in engaging in this fandom involves “special practice” and attunement to read the lines, gestures, emotions, and character designs of bishōjo. This community of practice is linked to fans he calls “otaku”, whom he positions as opposed to those who may find bishōjo to be weird, freakish, or repulsive (for more on “otaku”, see Galbraith). Indeed, in global fandoms, memes elevating the strangeness of bishōjo describe her monstrous form as having “porthole eyes” that through their sheer size appear as a vortex to absorb the viewer. Otherwise, the strangeness of their facial proportions is described as “pug” or “jellyfish” in nature, their overly long, out-of-shape limbs as “insectoid” (see fig. 4). Filmmaker Colin Armistead explains that bishōjo “feel like these sort of nonhuman things”, gesturing toward the “huge eyes” of these “hyperfeminine”, “strange characters” (Galbraith and Rose 7). \nFig. 4: A popular still from Kamichama Karin (2007). Circulated on Tumblr, this “error” in character design gave birth to the bishōjo “bug girl” meme.\nExploiting this strangeness, and bishōjo’s queerly twisted form, fem(me)s have for decades been drawing and sharing images that experiment with these figures. Artists lean into the bishōjo as a figure “perpetually relegated to [the] status of Other … [as] abject existence” (Hoskin 289). They do so in ways that reinsert their bodies and lived realities into the narrative. In the case of Sugary Symbiote, the presumed able-bodiedness and racial “neutrality” (mukokuseki) of the bishōjo figure become fields for playful subversion (for more on mukokuseki, see Gresham). The visual expression of fem(me)s in these spaces tends to move beyond art and cross over into illustration, design, and subculture. Many artists straddle these different spaces, working in close networks of small galleries, artist tables at fan conventions, and online accounts. Research has shown that, for disabled people, aesthetic and online spaces such as these become critical points of connection (Galbraith and Bookman).\nSugary Symbiote\nFor Sugary Symbiote, a Black, disabled, and sapphic artist in the United States participating in this space online, the monstrous fem(me) bishōjo figure becomes a vehicle to intervene. “Bishōjo to me is a facet of hyperfemininity”, she says. “They are soft bodies enveloped in lace and adorned with bows and embellishments, ethereal and fantastical. But even then, the bishōjo is more than that” (Sugary Symbiote; for more on Black femme softness, see LeMaster). Experiments with “yamikawa”, a movement that uses cute aesthetics to explore issues of mental health, and “gurokawa”, a hybridisation of cuteness and body horror, enable Sugary Symbiote to explore both objectification and bodily trauma from repeated surgeries. This practice is part of her reflection and externalisation of her own pain from periods of illness and invasive surgery, as well as her own trauma and isolation. It is also a form of femme resistance to the “contours constituting the ‘feminine’ beyond the dehumanising colonial gaze that seeks to define and contain” (LeMaster 382), creating “alternate ways … subverting and exposing the underlying workings of normative whiteness” (Hoskin and Taylor 291).\nThrough her illustrative practice emerges a mediation on the dissonances between body, gaze, repulsion, and attraction. Pushing the parameters of femininity and monstrous to their extreme, her figures appear “caught between beauty and excess” (Elkin 18) or “the visible and invisible” (Hoskin and Taylor 290). As Elkin writes on the feminine form in art, “to be a monster is to insist on both” (18). This powerful reclamation of body manifests as part of Sugary Symbiote’s destabilisation of race, gender, sexuality, and ability (Gresham 98). The snarling jaws of her figures mirror the powerful words of Audre Lorde, a Black, disabled, sapphic, feminist thinker and poet who uses the motif of monster regularly in her own writing: “if I didn’t define myself for myself, I would be crunched into other people’s fantasies for me and eaten alive” (132). Through the retaliatory menace of her illustrations, Sugary Symbiote snarls back.\n\nFig. 5: “Pest”. Digital illustration by Sugary Symbiote, 2020.\nSugary Symbiote is also a cute fashion practitioner. Through her dress she manifests a girlish excess through satirical layers of vivid pinks, frills, and bows. In particular, Sugary Symbiote is a participant in the jirai-kei and lolita fashion subcultures, both of which emerged from Japan and whose aesthetics take reference from Japanese comics for girls (Rose). For many sapphics like Sugary Symbiote, the hyperfeminine excess of manga/anime culture, along with linked fashion subcultures, plays a key part of her queer self-expression. Here, the subversive potential of hyperfemininity lies in its distance from normative femininity, which is maintained by (visual/visible) exaggeration or excess of the latter (Iseri 142). As such, through her life and artistic practice, Sugary Symbiote uses different strategies to carve out a space for fem(mes) in her own kind of queer worldbuilding, estranging cuteness in a variety of directions.\nWhile expression such as Sugary Symbiote’s can be readily found in fem(me) subcultures online, the literature has yet to capture this mode of hyperfemininity. To date, cute femininity has been typically described as only one of two things: an “adult come-on of sexuality” and “infantilized allure of dependency” (Yano 35). This observation marginalises queer fem(me)s and their own complex culture of aesthetics and desire, and reasserts instead the normative gaze of a cis-heterosexual male audience with little room for movement across categories. When considering the work of Sugary Symbiote, commentary of this nature erases her lived experiences and reflects the dynamics of what can be described as “compulsory (hetero)sexuality”. In response, she notes, “it always perplexed me that such things deemed as ‘cute’ framed around adult women are almost always objectified in a negative way and it truly gives me pause. It’s so unfortunate that cute hyperfemininity is typically viewed as something that has to be inherently sexual, especially when it concerns women and femmes who consume it” (Sugary Symbiote). We also observe the ways in which crip bodies can be “degendered”, whereby some “disabled women are perceived not as fully feminine because of their disability” (Brown 164). Here, then, the uptake of the fem(me) becomes as critical intervention on Sugary Symbiote’s part, exploring the body in the context of queer hyperfemininity.\nThe complexity of Sugary Symbiote’s identity and aesthetics offers a compelling site for reflection through what Kimberly Hassel terms “Hot Girl Otaku Studies”, a framework that draws inspiration from Megan Thee Stallion’s “Hot Girl Otaku” persona and brings together “local and global girl culture” and the “fashioning of the self … within the constellation of media mix or remixed as developed in Japan … and other contexts and gendered socialities” (n.p.). In this framework, Sugary Symbiote’s practice exemplifies what Hassel describes as an “unapologetic embrace of the self”, challenging normative readings of femininity, fandom, and affect (n.p.). As poet Madison Godfrey writes: “femininity wasn’t what made me vulnerable, even though it made me visible. My femininity is not a survival instinct, it is a song” (n.p.).\nIn Sugary Symbiote’s illustrations, Black bishōjo figures with multiple eyes and fanged maws snarl, pant, and ooze blood and tears, and look back at the viewer with despair, anger, or monstrous desire. Mirrored in these figures is Sugary Symbiote herself: “despite adorning myself with these things and decorating my surroundings, I still face my own personal internal struggles” (Sugary Symbiote). In particular, the intervention of the shimmering eyes of bishōjo (discussed above) presents a disruptive and overwhelmingly mutative mode of empathy. Repetition of the eye draws attention to its artifice, whilst also evoking the insectoid or creature. This aggression, however, is reserved for the viewer. Throughout her body of work are sapphic figures in this queer world, entwined in gentle embraces. Here Sugary Symbiote re-imagines the bishōjo as part of her own sapphic fem(me) queer world. This becomes a significant reclamation in a socio-cultural context in which disabled people are sometimes framed as moving outside of desire and desirability (Brown 165). A highly saturated cool pink permeates Sugary Symbiote’s work, referencing a “girly” space which Angela McRobbie describes as a “frilly world of affect and emotion” underscored by “the intensity of focus on body and its surfaces” (qtd. in Banet-Weiser 124). Ribbons and pixel hearts wind around Sugary Symbiote’s figures, and encircle her interest in Black fem(me) rappers and virtual characters alike.\nIn works such as “Zanika exe” (see fig. 6), Sugary Symbiote playfully imagines cute femininity as a computer virus, menacing, laughing, and sneering at the viewer through a series of garbled desktop tables and glitching script. Reimagining the bishōjo character bursting from her software with a vengeance, we are also reminded of the powerful ways Black women in anime spaces have carved out their own dynamic formations within social media. Through platforms such as TikTok and Instagram, they stake a claim in anime fandoms via spectacular displays of hyperfemininity and strength. Hard-hitting reels—such as Naomi Chań’s viral “Hinata isn’t Black” clapback—underscore how Black fans assert their bodily subjectivity “across edges and interfaces, where the racialized body and technology meet” (Gresham 97, 110). In this context, the work of creators like Sugary Symbiote exemplifies how social media becomes not only a tool for expression but also a vital network of hyperfeminine connection and belonging.\n\nFig. 6: “Zanika exe”. Digital illustration by Sugary Symbiote, 2023.\nIn “Choking on Tears” (see fig. 7), the aesthetic markers of the bishōjo are further unsettled and estranged through the repetition of “porthole eyes” and the introduction of an animalesque set of jaws. The hyperfemininity of the vibrant pink satin ribbon, chiffon, soft hair, and twinkly jewels create a delicate veneer for the violence it shrouds. The figure is either clutching at a wound that has been self-inflicted in grief, afflicted by another, or an open post-surgery incision. Veiled by sheer boudoir curtains and in pink negligee, she is eroticised, but as much as these signs attract, the violence of the scene repulses. Voyeurism morphs into grief, as we see her tears drip into the fangs and masseter muscle of her monstrous jaws. In front of us, the anime girl’s heart is breaking, which returns us to the key dynamic of the real woman bleeding into the fictional girl. In this way, manga/anime-style cute girl characters are far more than mere objects, but instead appear as avatars and vessels through which illustrators such as Sugary Symbiote can mediate and channel their own experiences and identities. For her, the bishōjo becomes a vehicle to express a “silent, unseen battle”: “many of us have to deal with this heavy burden everyday” (Sugary Symbiote).\n\nFig. 7: “Choking on Tears”. Digital illustration by Sugary Symbiote, 2023.\nConclusion \nIn the work of Sugary Symbiote we shift the focus from bishōjo as “objects” to “subjects” (Miller, “Cute” 19), and from other to self and back again to “other(ed) selves”. Through experimentations of bishōjo, artists are able to paint themselves “into the picture, remake the picture entirely, [find] a new language, cut it all to pieces, instigate processes of entropy, decreate to create” (Elkin 19). There is something monstrous about the bishōjo and those who would draw and share her lines. The bishōjo moves well beyond what Hoskin and Taylor would describe as the “normative standards” of “patriarchal feminine beauty” (289). It is “strange” (Galbraith and Rose 7; also Saitō Tamaki). With the work of Sugary Symbiote we reclaim the narrative back from the misbehaviour of some men, and the misinterpretation of some academics, in the present to the rich history and bright future of bishōjo art by and for women and queer others. We also look to this horizon to see a coming day when intersex, nonbinary, and trans folks and their hidden histories of engagement with manga/anime in Japan and beyond will be recognised as well. In the monstrous fem(me) and mutating lines of the bishōjo drawn by Sugary Symbiote, one becomes attuned to something queer, a source of potential and inspiration. \nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Sugary Symbiote for their generosity in sharing their experiences and work with us for this article.

    "title": "Negative Affects in the Dark Intervals of &lt;em&gt;A Land Imagined&lt;/em&gt;",
    "abstract": "Introduction\nYeo Siew Hua’s 2018 film A Land Imagined encompasses the “experiential and immersive” aspects of land reclamation, construction projects, and related issues pertaining to the treatment of migrant labour, as the director sought to capture “what [he] saw and felt during each visit” to the worksites. The mistreatment of migrant labour workers (MLWs) in Singapore has long been documented by both local and international groups (Chin 536-37). Despite the Singaporean government conducting steps to improve the treatment and living conditions of migrant labour workers, its request for Singaporeans’ tolerance of living near dormitories underscores the spatial divide between the communities and the “social quarantine” of the MLWs despite being “a permanent part of the workforce” (Chin 531).\nYeo’s film reflects such harsh conditions and triggers of negative affect in several ways. The desert-like setting, as “a test of character”, gestures at the “unhealthiness of industrialised modernity” on the reclaimed land (Smith 160; 164). The MLWs’ discontent is presented through verbal visuals such as the “ANGER IN PROGRESS” sign (in lieu of “DANGER”; 42:55) on the worksite. A recipient and nominee for multiple local and international awards (Lundberg and Peer 222), A Land Imagined is a cultural artefact that unveils the silenced stories of MLWs, especially after the shattering of the myth of racial harmony in Singapore by the 2013 Little India Riot.\nThis article echoes Yeo’s point that “the people on this imaginary land are at the same time equally imagined” (Voelcker). The shared sense of being imagined and reified is thematised through the depicted lived experiences of MLWs and police officers in Singapore alike. In the film, middle-aged police investigator Lok (Peter Yu), who is nameless in the film, is tasked with finding a missing lorry. To do so, he must locate its driver, MLW Wang Bi Chen (Liu Xiaoyi). The non-linear plot shows an insomniac Wang who is worried about being repatriated after being injured at work. As if imagined by Lok in the film and by Yeo in the real world, Wang represents the latter’s observations of MLWs: “these indentured workers live in [sic] the outskirts of the restless city; existing in the blind spot of larger society; their exploitation remains unseen. They are the invisible and imaginary – they are the sleepless, the dreamless (“A Land Imagined”). Indeed, alienated and sleepless, Wang spends his nights at “a dreamy cybercafé” with 24-hour air-conditioning opposite his dormitory, where he seeks physical and virtual connections with the cybercafé assistant, undocumented Chinese Mindy (Luna Kwok) and online gamers, respectively (“A Land Imagined”).\nAfter the disappearance of his dormitory acquaintance, Ajit (Ishtiaque Zico), Wang becomes increasingly paranoid about Ajit’s possible murder by the construction company – a reflection of Yeo’s remark that MLWs “live in precarity” and are “entrapped in their wretched situation” with no way of reporting their mistreatment (“A Land Imagined”). Wang increasingly dissolves into a spectre reminiscent of the MLWs’ “unseen and unheard” existence (Peer 41) before fully disappearing from the construction site. To solve the case at hand, Lok enters the everyday spaces of MLWs and perceives, to use Yeo’s words, in an “experiential and immersive” manner the harsh living and working conditions on the reclaimed sites of Singapore.\nAddressing the social divide (Tan 1), cultural artefacts such as Yeo’s A Land Imagined undercut the myth of the “fine” city by foregrounding the experiences of those on whose back the country is built (Lundberg and Peer 206). Hence films like A Land Imagined “impact upon the social landscape – bringing awareness of the ethical issues the state and society either buries or uncovers as it constructs its futuristic city” (Lundberg and Peer 222-23). Employing the Deleuzian notion of assemblages the role of shared transsensoria amongst the characters, affordances in the scenes, and the audience in supporting their sense-making process of the case and the film (Sim), this article examines the theme of the alienating realities of MLWs and police officers in A Land Imagined and the impact of the film on the audience by applying the approach of embodied cognition and affect to moments of dark intervals in the film.\nDark intervals are strange instances of “stillness, detachment and suspended time” that shape the indeterminacy of noir and its impact on viewers’ “embodied and sensorial experience, underlining the irreducible relational interactions of the human organism within its environment” (Killeen 1; 4). The study of film noir through affect in dark intervals unveils “the restless tumult of [the human’s] own becoming”, which occurs when the intervallic protagonist experiences a “distinctive exposure and attentiveness to this passionate affective state” and undergoes “radical receptivity to the unfolding of [their] own existence and to the potential inherent in that existence” (Killeen 4-5). Their potential, which includes the virtual, is the affective enactment of actions, challenges the “constrictive and hegemonic manifestations of power” (Killeen 6). Such effects are especially potent when the dark intervals disrupt the eurhythmia of capitalist cities such as Singapore.\nSuspense and violence are indelible triggers of affect in noir. Yeo’s A Land Imagined evokes affect and reflective empathy by employing gripping dark intervals in liminal spaces while realistically reflecting the non-violent local atmosphere. Such dark intervals include the eternal land reclamation that sustains the Singapore Dream using sand from neighbouring countries, the 24-hour air-conditioned cybercafé that offers the possibility of enacting other roles through violent RPGs and online sexual encounters, highways linking worksites to workers’ dwellings in centrifugal space, and the intertidal beach zone that affords pseudo-escapes from the strictly controlled Singapore. The liminal spaces in the film are accessible via the emblematic iconography of highways in film noir that reiterates the dispersal – and denial – of MLWs’ lives in Singapore. Akin to “in-between spaces of modernity”, such non-places (Augé) defy traditional systems of meaning and are associated with outsiders such as “labourers … and the multiethnic” (Breu and Hatmaker 4).\nThe affective enactment of ‘becoming’ in film noir lures viewers to imagine characters’ consciousness, a process that disrupts the audience’s patterned behaviours and elicits shifts in their perceptions of the world (Flory 319). Cavallian characters who are “simultaneously mysterious and convincing” especially trigger such embodied changes in viewers (Flory 78). Viewers who enact Cavallian characters’ consciousness and actions experience “anxious curiosity” while broadening their imagination about possibilities in the world (Flory 9; 78). The main characters of A Land Imagined are Cavallian characters with complex but comprehensible affective responses to the engulfing urban alienation in the city-state, as both figures work as invisible but vital cogs in the backend of the ever-spinning capitalist wheel. Besides increasingly recognising MLWs as fellow humans, viewers learn to acknowledge both differences and similarities between them. Through this process, they can attain “a more developed sense of tolerance as well as the human itself, and the need to take responsibility for [their] actions, even when doing so will cost [them] dearly” (Flory 321). Moreover, spectators’ reflective empathy, which often occurs through “considered thought” post-viewing, alters their perception of themselves and their place in the world (Flory 319). While Flory’s work pertains to black noir films, the same embodied processes and subjective changes occur in viewers of A Land Imagined through their encounters with the Cavallian Wang, Lok, and Mindy in dark intervals.\nDreaming about Escapes to Elsewheres on Reclaimed Land\nOne key dark interval depicts Mindy’s conversation with Wang on the intertidal zone of the reclaimed beach. The sequence commences with the two leaving the cybercafé together for the first time and suggests a potential sexual rendezvous should Wang win their swimming contest. Despite the suggestive atmosphere during the van ride and on the beach, the possibility of intimacy fades as strict gender expectations become subverted. Mindy saves the injured Wang from drowning. Acknowledging Mindy’s unexpected dominance, viewers experience new affective responses as “transsensorial and affective valences are carried through cinematic form through moments where impasse occurs” (Sim 48). The affective impact is evoked not by physical intimacy but by the characters’ honest commiseration about their pursuit of freedom from their lives in Singapore. While Mindy is trapped by her undocumented status, Wang’s movements are mired by his employer’s confiscation of his passport, a practice associated with forced labour.\nThis dark interval particularly presents the characters’ affective enactment of prioprioception (i.e., “a sense that provides information about the location of various parts of the body in relation to each other and the surroundings” (Blumer et al.) through the motif of travelling on the intertidal zone constructed by sand imported from neighbouring countries. The sand implies the “flow of territory”, which is “incorporated within cultural global flows and situated within the flexible practices of neoliberal globalisation” (Lundberg and Peer 216). Repose on the liminal intertidal zone thus affords Wang and Mindy the possibility of imagining their escapes to multiple elsewhere. Their perception of the city lights from afar, however, recalls the forever unattainable green light in Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby. By embodying the migrants’ situations, spectators see that their notion of freedom diverges from the Singaporean ideal. Mindy’s inertia and slowly verbalised thoughts (“I was thinking…”) pull the audience into her consciousness in the sultry setting. By internalising her dreams of physical and social mobility, they recognise her Cavallian nature: they share the same desires for mobility, although the migrant is incapacitated by local laws. Rather than seeking their place in Singapore, the migrants dream about leaving behind the stringent rules, perpetual debility, and extreme boredom graphically represented by the straight reclaimed southern coast that Mindy draws on the sand.\nWith lighting as a motif, Singapore’s self-inflated worth is also indicated by the red light in the background of the scene (fig. 1). Two right lights are also sighted later on the religious shrine in the construction office, watching Wang as he searches for Ajit’s passport. The significance of “visual motif[s] can often only be gleaned in the context of the wider elements of the diegesis in which it participates” (Killeen 37). Besides triggering a negative affect (Martinez-Conde and Macknik), the red light further evokes former Indonesian President Habibie’s 1998 denigration of Singapore as “that red dot” on the map, an expression that the country has appropriated as a badge of honour. The success of Singapore, however, is attributed to the efforts of locals and expats, while the MLWs’ hard graft is overlooked (Chin 539). The out-of-focus red light in the background of the intertidal zone analogously stresses the misalignment between deep-seated elitism and MLWs’ vital contributions to the country’s rapid development.\n\nFig. 1: Mindy in a scene from A Land Imagined.\nLok/Wang: Acknowledging the Self/Other through Play on Reclaimed Land\nLok’s affective enactment of Wang and their merged subjectivities are vital to his solving of the case. The detective’s simulation of Wang’s senses on the bed enables him to make sense of the MLW’s thoughts and enactment of the affordances in the dormitory. This dark interval of blended subjectivities also constitutes a suspension of time – as though taunted by the visual and embodied motif of the constant running of sand in construction sites during the workday – through the absence of Wang and the inert experience of insomnia. To use Killeen’s words, Lok “enters – through processes of visceral sensitivity and proprioception – a passive state of ‘utter receptivity’, wherein his current ‘actual’ movement … fuses with the ‘virtual’ movements of memory and anticipation ingrained in the singularity of his existence” (208). Killeen’s description of Rosnow’s experience in Night of the Hunter applies, too, to Lok’s affective enactment of Wang’s nighttime experiences and disruption of his everyday rhythms as an active police investigator (208). Staring at the ceiling, the insomniac Lok not only listens to the audible nighttime chattering from the streets but also notices the cybercafé’s red light, like Wang must have done during his sleepless nights. Their intersubjectivity strengthens the personal connections between Lok and Wang, even when the two have never met in person in the narrative. Concerning the themes of isolation and alienation felt by both MLWs and police officers, Lundberg and Peer rightly observe that Wang is “the spectre that Lok was trying to bring to light”, while Lok increasingly turns into “Wang’s ‘dream-self’” and “ghost-detective” that Wang wishes would care “care about his plight in a Singapore where he goes unseen” (205).\nAs vital parts of reflective empathy evoked by the dark interval, recognition and acknowledgement are required for the inclusion of MLWs. Since its inception, Singapore has always been diasporic, making the land both globalised and glocalised. The potential for reflective empathy for the other is illustrated in the dark interval of Lok’s final visit to the cybercafé. Thus far, Lok’s assumptions about mere business-like transactions at the cybercafé have caused him to overlook the intimacy between Wang and Mindy. Yet, a moment of heightened psychological noir affectivity manifests when he, prompted by the recording of Wang, carefully enacts the MLW’s turning of the head from Station 57 to catch Mindy in his eye line. As though possessed by Wang’s spirit, Lok adopts an intersubjective liaison with the absent MLW to perceive his association with Mindy, which leads to the solving of the case (figs. 2 and 3).\n\n\nFigs. 2 and 3: Lok enacts Wang's turning of the head.\nLok’s potential to expand his experiential traces – and thus his understanding of the case and of himself – is facilitated by his engagement with the computer game that Wang has been playing. As noted by Sim, “the game’s auditory mix of gunshots, rapid clicking, and twinkling sound effects can be heard, while a sonorous and eerie background soundtrack creeps in the distance, reconstructing Lok’s body as an assemblage of affective forces” (51). Lok’s deviating identity also manifests through his role-playing and affective enactment of a terrorist – a separation from his real-life role of a detective – as triggered by the lucid game. Moreover, the more Lok learns about Wang, “their subjectivities begin to morph, flicking between Lok’s timeline and his imagination of what happened to Wang” (Lundberg and Peer 205).\nWith the gameplay eliciting viewers’ affective reactions through its “cybernetic ambience of sensory overstimulation” (Sim 51), and then showing Lok a recording of Wang by the computer’s camera, the viewers perform enactment in this entire sequence on several levels: as the terrorist in the game; an RPG player in the cybercafé; as Lok looking at the recording of Wang and his surroundings; as Wang who previously sat at Station 57 during his sleepless nights; and as the camera spying on both Wang and Lok at different times. The extensive affective enactment by the multiple perspectives is also supported by Sim’s own hypothesis that “the audience – unable to see clearly – is urged to move closer to the screen, shifting the cinematic encounter to one that is embodied and beyond the representational eye that can see through the events on screen” (55). Here, the viewers’ affective responses thus include proprioception as they try to make sense of the obfuscating blend of imagined perspectives offered by the sequence.\nBy adopting Wang’s position in the cybercafé, Lok also begins to perceive Mindy beyond her interpellated role of cybercafé assistant and her toughness signalled by her haircut, tattoos, and attitude. By recognising the migrants’ human connection in the lonely city, Lok not only seeks Mindy’s help to find Wang; the quietude between them facilitates his own escape to imaginary neighbouring lands with the migrants. Mindy’s recollection of the first dark interval imposes a moment of pause that is nevertheless blissful as she recalls the positive affect that she shared with Wang. This sense of inertia is then interrupted by a shot that quickly cuts to the final drive on the highway, where Lok watches the sleeping Mindy in his car (fig. 4). With its warm-toned lighting, this first scene of sleep and female vulnerability creates both sultry and comforting affect in A Land Imagined. Recurring in shots of the highways, the quiet worksite at night, and the final scene at the bonfire, the warm lighting as a motif and an external signifier of Lok’s Cavallian nature is evidently contrasted with the cold, blinding dormitory lighting which silently prevents workers from resting. The iconography of Lok with the warm lights hence carries the affect of calm and safety for Mindy in her defenceless state.\n\nFig. 4: The sleeping Mindy in Lok's car.\nThis scene carries both characters and spectators along the highway to the liminal land of imagination. In this dreamlike sequence, the shot of the concrete highway dissolves into the sequence of the Bengali dance at a bonfire. With its slow rhythmic motion and music, the scene enraptures the viewers to join the hidden experience of the reclaimed land. The shots of Lok’s dance parallel Wang’s at the worksite while also eliciting flashbacks of Wang’s dance during Ajit’s description of his dreams. The latter triggers an almost-sexual affect via a continuous shot of Ajit’s slow massage of Wang’s neck. This instance of physical intimacy that leads nowhere signals the objectification of MLWs as homosexual deviants who taint local culture and destabilise the nuclear family. Ajit’s voice-over about identity (“But I am not me, you not you”), coupled with the slowed-down euphoria of the dance, resonates with the theme of the dark intervals of the film: the need for escape to dream of elsewheres and the possibilities of becoming himself without others’ judgement.\nPerceiving Self and Other: Teaching Viewers to Look Away\nThe final scene uniting Lok and the migrants on the liminal site indicates the processes of becoming that forge a profound connection between Lok’s self and the other. Lok’s authentic involvement in the Bengali dance embodies his newfound role as a participant in glocalised Singapore. Shedding his earlier crouched position of uncertainty, Lok now dances with the migrants with mutual acknowledgement (figs. 5 and 6). In this dark interval, the noir protagonists “are confronted with the radical passivity and passionate becoming that subtends their sense of ‘self’ and indeed their very concept of existence” (Killeen 15). Marked by his anonymous urban identity, Lok is malleable and open to his “redemptive potentiality” (Killeen 208). Embodying Lok’s changes, the viewers, too, perceive their anonymity in the city-state: they, too, undergo their own process of becoming as they affectively enact the dance with Lok and the MLWs at the bonfire.\n\n\nFigs. 5 and 6: The Bengali dance scene.\nIn the final shot of A Land Imagined, Lok spots the solitary Wang looking at the sea and the reclaimed land. Instead of approaching him, Lok turns away. Facing away from each other, Wang and Lok are free to conjure their own dreams in, to use Killeen’s words, the “‘suspension’ in the interval or passage of his own becoming” (209). Juxtaposed with the dazzling lights and unceasing dance movements, Lok’s inertia also draws attention to his active decision to escape from the dreamless local life through the open police case. According to Killeen, the “profound passivity” of the dark interval “perhaps harbours a strange redemptive quality” (33). In A Land Imagined, such redemption manifests in the characters’ letting loose in the liminal side of Singapore. The affect of freedom embodied by Lok’s dance is present in his earlier play with a glass bottle against the background of construction work. First appearing during Wang’s hallucination about his employer’s demise, the beer bottle changes from a haunting signifier of death to one of spirited deviance that unlocks dreams of the potential self and other. While the film captures the “utterly unbearable” discomfort from “the merciless sand blowing incessantly at one’s face and the brutal cacophony of noise generated from the machines” (“A Land Imagined”), my assessment of Lok’s new playful behaviour in this dark interval reveals the potential of challenging the harsh conditions at the worksites.\nLok’s change is further instructed by his beige button-up shirt in both this scene and his first visit to the worksite. Scenes of deviance from work crucial to the order of capitalist Singapore illustrate “the strange joy [Lok] finds in this suspension” of time and order (209). As noted in Benjamin’s “The Work of Art”, viewers encounter both film and architecture through touch instead of visual perception (Smith 49). The emphasis on the body in the dark intervals of A Land Imagined also reiterates Benjamin’s encouragement in The Storyteller for adults to engage physically in childlike play and produce stories that resonate with others across space and time (Breu and Hatmaker 185). In addition to presenting deeper insights into the cultural contexts of local settings, they will evoke viewers’ critical empathy for the simultaneously familiar and mysterious Cavallian characters in the stories to modify stereotypical beliefs about marginalised groups.\nBy affectively enacting the lives of MLWs, for instance by experiencing insomnia in Wang’s dormitory bed, Lok re-assesses his self and acknowledges the other in Singapore. Similarly, the spectators imagine the consciousness of the characters – including Lok – to experience reflective empathy for the marginalised other. Both Wang and Lok conclude the film with their backs to the spectators for them to better share their perspectives. This directed perspective suggests what Chan calls the “rupture or the shifting of identification” as where the viewers’ “realisation of the gaze” (Lacan 84-5) is triggered and they “become aware of the protagonists’ and/or the spectators’ own acts of looking” (Lacan 95).\nFilms with such moments thus “open up gaps of interpretation” together with shifts in identification and “defer the conventional process of making meaning” (Chan 95). Following Žižek’s Looking Awry, Chan also notes the audience’s awareness of “their own [extra-diegetic] act of looking as well as the gaze of the Other upon them”, which supports “the negotiation of identity and identity crisis” (96). Similarly, A Land Imagined “not only implicates the land, state and society in the precarity and marginalisation of construction workers, it seeks to involve the cinematic viewer as witness to the crime” (Lundberg and Peer 213). Lok’s and Wang’s neo-noir approach to intersubjectivity compels the audience to witness the struggles of an overlooked migrant worker through the perspective of a detective, whose investigation not only highlights the disappearance but also amplifies the often-silenced issues surrounding workers’ conditions.\nYeo, too, states that the film “seeks to make complicit the audience in the search of Wang, by placing themselves in the environment of the migrant worker and living out his experience, in the process creating an empathetic need to understand the character and his world” (“A Land Imagined”). While the intersubjectivity between the characters becomes increasingly obvious in the film through their shared positions and actions in the same places, the affective strangeness of the gaze is particularly instructive on another front: the camera shot, which hints at an implied exterodiegetic narrator, also draws in the viewers and elicits their affective responses. A prime example is the scene of the morning after Wang’s Bengali dance at the worksite. While the music from the previous night persists in the background, the MLWs’ returned gaze at the audience as they set off for work in the lorry breaks the fourth wall and silently demands viewers to join them, not only in their dance but also in their harsh realities as MLWs. The audience is thus explicitly acknowledged by the marginalised and challenged to perform a reassessment of the self/other relationship (Figure 7).\n\nFig. 7: The morning after the Bengali dance.\nFilm Noir and the Fostering of Inclusive Communities\nBy “melding two seemingly disparate perspectives into a singularity”, Yeo’s A Land Imagined shows that the Cavallian character and spectators can learn to “dream again and reunite in the revelry of life” (“A Land Imagined”). As shown above, in dark intervals, the film triggers viewers’ imagination or affective enactment of characters’ unexpected behaviours and consciousness and thus disrupts everyday rhythms. By internalising these new embodied processes, spectators learn to acknowledge the lived experiences of migrant communities and recognise the need to overcome the dehumanisation prevalent in the “fine” city-state. The ambivalent ending of contemporary film noir suggests “the sheer affective potential inherent in the ‘passage’ of a life’s taking place” (Killeen 205-6; 209). While the dreams of Wang, Lok, and the viewers might not coincide, the film underscores the sense of reification and triggered affective experiences shared by diverse communities in Singapore. As Yeo claims, A Land Imagined aims “not only to expose the structural exploitation at work but more importantly, humanise through understanding that they too have hopes and dreams” (“A Land Imagined”).\nHence, alongside proposals for non-state entities and the employers to redress MLWs’ debility, film noir can be deliberately deployed to elicit affective responses and deep reflective empathy in the public to enhance their embodied (i.e., physical and emotional) recognition and acknowledgement of the hidden MLWs whose efforts in building the city-state and role in shaping the glocalised atmosphere of Singapore continue to be largely overlooked. The article’s analysis hence demonstrates the ways that Singapore noir such as A Land Imagined consciously unveils hidden lived experiences of marginalised communities while encouraging deviance and play in its audience to overcome strict and problematic hegemonic beliefs and social attitudes. It thus calls for more scholarly attention to noir from the Global South and Southeast Asia to unveil deeper insights into the twenty-first-century neoliberal condition of glocalisation.\nReferences\n“A Land Imagined.

    "abstract": "Introduction\nThis article examines American Conspiracy: The Octopus Murders (2024), a four-part documentary released on Netflix. Directed by Zachary Treitz, the documentary follows young photojournalist Christian Hansen as he tries to solve the mysterious death of Danny Casolaro. In 1991, Casolaro was found deceased in a hotel room while tracking officials in the CIA and former Reagan White House. He had planned to write an explosive book about what he termed “The Octopus”, an octuplet of overlapping conspiracies that transpired in the 1980s. At the time, local officials ruled Casolaro’s death a suicide, but many suspect that someone murdered him for nearing a dangerous truth (McConnachie and Tudge 128). The series follows Christian Hansen between 2013-2024 as he traces his predecessor’s footsteps in a real-life film noir. He compiles forgotten documents, contacts old sources, and narrates his quest for a truth that has been buried for more than 30 years.\nHowever, American Conspiracy is not just about Casolaro’s death. In my view, it is also an artifact of generational conflict between the Millennials (born between 1982 and 1996) and the generations that preceded them (Traub and Donner 975). These include the Silent Generation (born before 1945) and the Baby Boomers (1946-1964; Vogels). I argue that the documentary depicts Millennials attempting to understand the world they have inherited—a world riven by neoliberal austerity (Cairns 125), the 9/11 attacks (Ng et al. 282), and the 2008 financial crisis (Barnes 34). These and other crises have led to wealth inequality and a disenchantment with democracy (Barnes 34; Bennett Inst. 2). While the series does not explicitly reference neoliberalism and democratic disenchantment, etc., it lends itself to this decoding, because it interrogates the Reagan era and foregrounds the unresolved crimes of the past, making generational conflict a key to the latent meanings of the text (Hall 507).\nAmerican Conspiracy therefore cultivates suspicion of the “parent culture”, and specifically those who held power in the 1980s federal government (Clarke et al. 100). Moreover, the documentary showcases the “generational detective”, which is a temporal analogue to Fredric Jameson’s “social detective” concept (qtd. in Tait 9). Beyond asking “Was Danny murdered?”, it also asks: “What have our elders wrought?”\nThe four-part series operates in the conspiracy theory tradition (Knight 1; Popp 256), but it also conveys the tropes of film noir (Dixon 1; Woltmann). Among the most conspicuous is the body double, which occurs when Hansen literally plays the role of Casolaro in dramatised scenes. Other noir tropes include Hansen as a lone detective consumed by an indifferent world; individuals cannot be trusted; information gathered is questionable; the narrative is convoluted; confirmed and suspected murders occur; the ending is neither happy nor satisfying; and a scam sets the story in motion, namely the theft of legal software in 1982. But it is also a true story, which places American Conspiracy into the rarer category of “documentary noir” (Carey). According to Jeffries, this genre entails the filmmaker embodying the role of investigator after authorities have proven ineffectual in the face of crime (301).\nIn the following section, I will briefly outline the documentary narrative and then explain the method used to analyse the text. The third section relates the findings, which hinge on American Conspiracy serving a dual role as documentary noir and a generational detective story. The final section links this series to a “media subculture” of conspiracy theorists active in YouTube videos, podcasts, and social-media threads (Higdon and Lyons 40). This group is a “counterpublic” that espouses left-wing conspiracism (Sienkiewicz and Jaramillo 268) – an ideology otherwise known as “parapolitics” (Jimmy Falun Gong). Studying this subculture is important, because it suggests that conspiracy theory becomes a popular epistemology at a time when disillusionment with politics is at its highest among younger adults (Bennett Inst. 1). When questions are left unanswered from the past, and noir-like endings remain unsatisfying to the generational detective, suspicious media texts emerge in the culture and nourish conspiracy theories for another generation.\nFrom the Shadowy Reagan Era to Streaming Detective Story\nAmerican Conspiracy comprises four episodes. It is disjointed and scattered in presentation, though this tracks with its attention to a convoluted story. As Dan Rather states in an old newscast repurposed for Episode 1 (“The End”), it is a “complex and confusing, still developing case” (00:39:11). It begins in the early 1980s, when a computer company, Inslaw, develops software for the criminal justice system. This PROMIS software could find similarities in criminal cases tried across the country, which would help the government build cases against career criminals.\nInslaw soon sold PROMIS to the US Department of Justice (DOJ). Afterwards, however, the DOJ cut off payments, costing Inslaw millions of dollars. Casolaro caught wind of the PROMIS affair and began investigating the story. Episode 2 reveals that the DOJ stole PROMIS in 1982 for the benefit of a Reagan associate named Earl Brian. Allegedly, Brian helped transfer $40 million to Iran in 1980. The funds came with the demand to detain 52 American hostages until after the presidential election, thus compounding a hostage debacle that made incumbent Democrat, Jimmy Carter, appear weak. After Reagan won the 1980 election, Brian was supposedly repaid for his “October Surprise” role by gaining access to PROMIS.\nThe October Surprise is only one arm of the Octopus, but there is not enough space to explain the other seven. In fact, even the documentary ignores most of the Octopus’s anatomy, focussing on three limbs only: the Inslaw case, the October Surprise, and the strange activity that took place on the Cabazon Reservation in Indio, California. The remaining arms of the Octopus are an Australian bank called Nugan Hand, the 1980s Savings and Loans scandal, the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), the Iran-Contra affair, and the covert adventures of two CIA agents: Frank Terpil and Edwin P. Wilson.\nA mysterious figure involved in the intrigue is Michael Riconoscuito, who claims to have tampered with the PROMIS software in the 1980s to turn it into an espionage tool. Riconoscuito speaks of the convoluted story in Episode 3 (“The Game”), saying: “I’ve got a matrix-like analysis [of the case, but] it would take days to go through it” (00:14:35). At another point, an exasperated Hansen says to the camera: “It never ends! It never ends” (00:23:47). As in film noir, Hansen and Casolaro embody the “hard-boiled detectives unravelling labyrinthian mysteries” (Dixon 1). As in conspiracy theory, the resolution is endlessly deferred (Fenster xvii); Hansen is never able to prove that someone murdered Casolaro, and Casolaro was unable to link all the conspirators in his lifetime.\nMethod \nNetflix categorises American Conspiracy as “True Crime”, which Punnett defines as “nonfiction narratives of criminal events that actually happened” (qtd. in Maher and Cake 97). This may be sensible enough, especially given the genre’s “widespread popularity amongst subscribers of streaming services” (100). I argue that the series is too connotative to be tidily contained this way, however. I believe American Conspiracy addresses a larger question without realising it, which I expose through a “symptomatic” reading of the series (Althusser and Balibar 28). Texts are not only polysemic, but they include unconscious claims and silences that symptomatic readings can identify. A similar approach is Ricouer’s “hermeneutics of suspicion, [which] assumes that the manifest or surface meaning of a text is a veil that masks its true agenda” (Culver and Vuleta 11).\nTo interpret the documentary, I draw on semiotic analysis (Barthes ix; Brown 113; Dunleavy 167). Attributed to such scholars as Ferdinand de Saussure (1857-1931) and Roland Barthes (1915-1960), this method works well for the series, because it allows me to single out visual signifiers on the screen. I next determine the “underlying meaning[s]” the signifiers have for the documentary as a whole (Titscher et al. 126). Semiotics can be used in conjunction with the broader method of textual analysis, which is useful for interpreting Hansen’s statements. Textual analysis traces back to such academic traditions as the University of Birmingham’s Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies in the 1960s (Dworkin 121). The method looks for “underlying ideological and cultural assumptions of a text” (Arya 173), or what Phillipov calls finding “a vocabulary to describe the elusive” (221). This is my general aim when interpreting American Conspiracy as a case study of both documentary noir and generational conflict.\nThe Semiotics of Conspiracy Theory, Young Adulthood, and Media Technology \nJameson argued that the conspiracy text was both a detective story and an “unconscious, collective effort at trying to figure out where we are and what … forces confront us” (qtd. in Tait 2). I agree with this assessment and claim that American Conspiracy adds an additional generational layer. The series is an expression of Millennial investigation from an age cohort who grew up in the triple shadow of neoliberalism, the War on Terror, and the 2008 financial crisis. The “problematic” of the text, or that which is answered without the producers’ acknowledgment, is that Millennials wish to know what treacherous forces were afoot before them (Storey 57). American Conspiracy is an unconscious prying open of the adult generations’ floorboards to search for the proverbial bodies. Noir provides a useful lens to explain what is going on. Generational detectives navigate an alienating world due to neoliberal precarity, and they face constant uncertainty in the form of conspiracy theories that never seem to resolve. In other words, noir is spilling over into their real lives (Dixon 153).\nA prominent signifier in the series is geographic sprawl, which suggests that the conspiracy is as wide as the country. Casolaro lived in Fairfax, Virginia, and he died in West Virginia. The PROMIS affair took place in Washington DC, and Riconosciuto hid evidence in the Pacific Northwest. Casolaro went to New York City to pitch his book, and a related murder took place in San Francisco. The sprawl accords with Jameson, who argues that films such as The Parallax View depict the detective “mapping the … social totality” (Tait 43). He traces this trope back to Alfred Hitchcock’s North by Northwest, “which propels us from one empty hotel room to another across continental North America” (Jameson 122). This is an overlap between conspiracy and noir. As Dixon writes, “noir is a state of paranoia, a zone in which nothing seems stable … and [a] world [that] is a constant battleground” (viii).\nIn Episode 4 (“The Monster”), Hansen questions how he can return to his normal life after peering into this abyssal network of corruption and murder. Jameson likens this phenomenon to a peek below the surface – a conceit that stretches from Dante’s trek through the underworld to Marx’s exposure of “the hidden abode of production” (176). But instead of infiltrating Hell or the “Satanic mills” of industrial England, Hansen steps into a Reagan-era scandal (Linebaugh and Rediker 250). Jameson further states that the “promise of a deeper inside view is the hermeneutic content of the conspiracy thriller” (123). Incidentally, Freud and Marx were graduates of the “school of suspicion”, according to Paul Ricoeur (Felski). This is due to each thinker’s interest in uncovering “self-evident meanings in order to draw out less visible … truths” (Felski). Marx exposed the commodity fetish, and Freud the subconscious desire. A textual analysis shows how this applies to American Conspiracy as well. Hansen admits in Episode 4 that the decade-long investigation was transformative, saying: “it changed me. And it changed the way I think about reality … and think about history … . This is the surface, but what’s going on in the shadows” (00:46:54). Hansen is awakening to truths concealed by the parent generation.\nYoung adulthood is another prominent signifier in the documentary. When Hansen first learns about Casolaro in 2013, he is 25 years old. While the director (Treitz) does not say, he appears to be the same age. The two are also younger than the participants in the on-camera interviews. Markers of youth often surround Hansen, including photos from what appears to be college get-togethers, as well as footage of him skateboarding down the street (Atencio et al. 154). A scene in Episode 4 shows a young Hansen explaining the case and repeatedly saying “like” in between sentences – another giveaway of youth (Hill).\nRelatedly, Hansen has embraced digital media technology in his quest. The opening and closing scenes of Episode 1 depict a conversation through an iPhone. An external hard drive appears on a desk, an iMac computer looms in the background, and hi-tech video cameras and production equipment drift into scenes. The semiotic reading of this technology overlaps with the semiotics of young adulthood. This is because young people have especially embraced digital media in a way the Baby Boomers did not (Prensky 1). As Jenkins et al. claim, young people “have been the lead adopters of mobile, social, and gaming media” (viii). Vogels finds that 93% of Millennials own smartphones, compared to 68% of Boomers and 40% of Silents. Roughly 100% of Millennials use the Internet, and 86% use social media. Additionally, Millennials believe the Internet to be a benefit to society more than any preceding generation. Hansen and Treitz take this youth-coded gadgetry straight into the Casolaro case, thereby linking the concepts of suspicion, youth, and technology in the film.\nThe documentary synthesises new media technologies with film-noir tropes of the 1940s and 50s, with Treitz even citing Hitchcock as an inspiration for his work (McGovern). While Hitchcock may be more of a noir “stylist” than a founding noir director, he worked in the genre in such 1950s classics as Rear Window and Vertigo (Olsen). Hitchcock used “intentionally mechanical” camerawork to bring his vision to life, with the camera circling actors and following them down flights of stairs, among other motions (Olsen). In American Conspiracy, media technology also takes on a conspicuous role: Hansen’s iPhone acts a key to the intelligence underworld; a covert camera shows the filmmakers visiting a home; and a handheld camera follows Hansen through a police station.\nAs the two Millennials set off into the backwaters of Reagan-era scandal, they arrive on doorsteps of elderly couples. They situate greying interviewees before their own cameras. A semiotic reading suggests this is a generational autopsy of the 1980s, the era in which the filmmakers (and other Millennials) were born.\nConclusion: The Persistence of Conspiracy\nIn this concluding section, I connect American Conspiracy to a media subculture that uses conspiracy theories to excavate the origins of our political conjuncture. This subculture is sometimes known as the “para-political” left, which shares content on digital platforms and social media. It is loosely confederated, critical of capitalism, and (at times) internally combative. Podcasts in this milieu include American Exception (2021), Death Is Just around the Corner (2018), Ghost Stories for the End of the World (2020), Media Roots Radio (2010), ParaPower Mapping (2023), Programmed to Chill (2021), Subliminal Jihad (2020), and True Anon (2019). In February 2024, Hansen and Treitz appeared on True Anon, one of the few artifacts from the subculture to have attracted scholarly attention (Chase 214).\nPara-political podcasts share similarities with true-crime content creators. For instance, the conspiratorial hosts interact with fans and followers on social media, as true-crime podcasters do (Boling and Hull 97). True-crime hosts create a “discourse community”, which becomes recognisable to followers who use the same terms and phrases (van Driel 150). Whereas a true-crime fan might understand an in-joke or “specific lexis” (164), para-political enthusiasts might use the term “noided” – a play on the word “paranoid”. Both podcasting genres also present evidence to the audience (Morton 240), which “hails” listeners as members of a jury or investigative panel (Althusser 108). But on the other hand, the para-political subculture, to which Hansen and Treitz are marginally connected, is different. Mostly young to middle-aged men seem to make up its opinion leaders, which might translate to a majority-men listenership. This would clash with the majority-women consumers of true-crime fare (Boling and Hull 106).\nI make this connection between American Conspiracy and the para-political subculture because both expose aspects of the parent culture. The podcasts discuss topics such as the CIA and the JFK and RFK assassinations. They are similar to past noir authors who, for example, used literature and film to unmask that “bright, guilty place” of Los Angeles in the mid-twentieth century (Davis 18) and evince a point that Kellner makes about the hit TV show, The X-Files, which he sees as an artifact of “generational war” (226). Kellner argues that the cohort of its creator, Chris Carter, has an “unhealed wound” from the Vietnam War, adding that it “keeps festering and generating tales to capture its hideousness and horrors” (216). He goes on to say that The X-Files depicts the “older generation [as] tremendously compromised and arguably corrupt, especially those in the military, political, and corporate bureaucracies” (226). It is up to the younger heroes to restore the moral order. While Chris Carter may no longer be doing this today, the para-political left carries the torch, using conspiracy theories to medicate their own “unhealed wound”.\nShareable digital media and conspiracy theories have become fronts in a generational conflict. With different levels of political radicalism, suspicious Millennials negotiate neoliberalism and unresponsive government – a real-life film noir of “doubt and fear and uncertainty” (Dixon 1). They embody the earliest origins of noir, forged in the “depressingly stark 1930s … [when] even the seemingly protected middle classes were facing economic insecurity” (Palmer 389). Like those noir writers, they too expose “capitalism’s unsavoury undercurrents” (390). This media subculture likely embraces conspiracy theory as it does because traditional political processes have left them feeling alienated. Because political and economic problems persist, particularly for young adults in America, the age-old practice of conspiracy theorising will also persist. As Fiske and others have pointed out, marginalisation has long been the crucible for conspiratorial belief (192). Since the wound has not yet healed for the generational detectives, conspiracism will remain an attractive panacea.     \nAcknowledgments\nI would like to thank the editors, the anonymous reviewers, as well as my colleagues Elana Levine, Tanner Mirrlees, Mike Newman, Chris Smith, and Madison Trusolino.\nReferences\nAlthusser, Louis. “Selected Texts.” Ideology: An Introduction.

    "abstract": "Introduction\nIn The Maltese Falcon original novel (Hammett) and film adaptations, most famously in the 1941 John Huston adaptation starring Humphrey Bogart, we see a number of people scrambling to secure an artifact seen as priceless, the black bird statue of the title. Set in 1920s San Francisco, The Maltese Falcon is recognised as one of the earliest original noir classics. Sam Spade and Miles Archer, private investigators, are hired by a mysterious woman to follow her lover, Floyd Thursby. The next morning both Archer and Thursby are dead, and Spade is stuck in the middle. He soon realises that the true motive for both the killings and following Thursby revolved around a valuable statue, the Maltese falcon. This leads Spade on a hunt for the murderer of his ex-partner and the treasured statue. In his quest, Spade must contend with dangerous individuals also looking to acquire the falcon.  \nDetective Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart in the film adaptation) is drawn into the conflict related to finding and obtaining the artifact. Despite individuals with great skills being part of the chase, no individual can accomplish the task solely on their own. Thus, each character needs to gain information or support from multiple other competitors to be successful. This is not an easy task when a believed fortune is at stake and the trustworthiness of all players can be questioned.\nTo gain advantage and progress toward ultimate victory, the characters in The Maltese Falcon need to use the power they have and engage in different strategies and tactics to gain needed information and ultimate control of the black bird. The success of these strategies varies significantly, as will be seen. In this article we will analyse the characters of The Maltese Falcon and their actions within the framework of bases of power and influence tactics, major concepts in the fields of management and psychology. This analysis method lets us better understand the intent of various characters in their actions and assess their effectiveness as well as their efforts to neutralise or reduce the impact of these bases and tactics.\nBases of Power and Influence Tactics \nIn considering the events of The Maltese Falcon, the impact of power and how it is used is crucial to the narrative. Power, a major aspect of human society, can be viewed in sociological or political science in terms of groups of people and whole social systems (Martin 2), or in management or psychology terms as individuals influencing each other (French and Raven 151). Power can involve “power over” others due to position or role as well as “power to” collaboratively work with and influence others (Wrong).     \nIn the fields of management and psychology, one major way of looking at the different types of power people possess is provided by French and Raven (151). They divide power into power bases that are position-based or personal-based. Position means power a person has due to the position, job, or role they have, a similar concept to the hierarchical power of the “power over” concept (Wrong). For example, a manager has recognised power to reward or punish subordinates, and in the United States the president also is recognised as the Commander-in-Chief of the military. Personal powers are more connected to someone’s personal characteristics. Thus, we can see them possessing these powers regardless of the role or position they hold. A person’s charisma or expertise falls into this category. We will review each of the specific power bases below and connect how they relate to particular characters and situations in the story.  \nLegitimate Power\nLegitimate power involves power that is recognised as coming with a particular job or role. A CEO or president is recognised as having certain authority or power that comes with that title. This allows them to influence relevant people or groups of people (French and Raven 151). The major characters in The Maltese Falcon generally lack legitimate power, at least as far as the premise of the book and movie are concerned. Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet) has legitimate power within his criminal organisation, perhaps, but lacks legitimate recognition of owning the Maltese Falcon or an official relevant job. Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) and Brigid O’Shaughnessy (Mary Astor) do not have jobs that come with particular power attached.\nNo character has legitimate, recognised ownership of the Maltese Falcon. Thus, anyone who can seize the object has control of it. The one element of legitimate power we do see is Sam Spade in his role as detective. While Spade is not treated with ample respect by the police in the narrative, he is given more leeway than the other characters. As a detective, his role is recognised by the police as one that involves searching for information and at times interacting with nefarious characters (Hammett 25). This gives him greater ease of movement and ability to move around than the other characters. While he has no legitimate right to the falcon statue, his role as a detective makes his search for it more legitimate.\nReward Power\nThe next type of power is called reward power. Particular roles or people can have resources or things others value. Having the ability to give (or even offer) a valued commodity can give a person influence over another (French and Raven 152). Within The Maltese Falcon, different characters have access to rewards other characters could desire. Both Gutman and Cairo offer money to Spade for finding and handing over the falcon (Hammett 55), while O’Shaughnessy offers Spade love or just sex for his help (Hammett 267). \nCoercive Power\nThe third type of positional power is coercive power, and relates to the punishments or negative outcomes a person is believed capable of visiting on someone else: in other words, the perceived negative consequences if the demands of a person are not met (French and Raven 152). We see examples of this across the movie and book. In the film, Wilmer Cook almost exclusively uses threats to try to get what he wants out of Spade (Huston). Gutman uses a range of tactics and power types, such as ingratiation and rational persuasion, but is not above threatening negative consequences.\nInformation Power\nInformation power relates to the idea that a person’s role or position may give them access to information that is valuable to others (Raven et al. 308). In organisations this might be the right person to talk to for approval, the best process to use in a task, or the political dynamics in place. This could be information that is very valuable to have. When a person controls information, they have power over others in deciding who gets the information. Within The Maltese Falcon, knowledge related to the artifact is valuable. Gutman has significant knowledge of the history of the artifact and its true nature (Huston). Brigid O’Shaughnessy has information related to where the artifact is that others are desperate to possess (Hammett 110).\nWhile Spade begins the narrative with very little knowledge of the Maltese Falcon, he pretends to others that he knows a lot more than he does (Hammett 130). This leads characters to be influenced by him even though he does not have the information they need; the fact people believe he has information gives him power. This actually helps him to gain more information, as other characters give him information that they assume he already has.\nReferent Power\nThe next two power bases relate to personal power, elements related to the person rather than their role. Referent power relates to the likeability or appealing nature of a person. If we feel positive toward a person, we are more likely to be influenced by them and help them (Atwater and Yammarino 5). Brigid O’Shaughnessy is a character who uses significant referent power. Her role as a noir femme fatale means that many men in the narrative want to be close to her. She uses that to her advantage to get people to do what she wants. She uses this as her main appeal to Spade, trying to use his attraction to her so that he helps her achieve her goals (even while often withholding crucial information). Thursby is a man who was previously in her sway, whom she discards when he stops being useful (Hammett 258).  \nExpert Power\nThe last power base is called expert power and relates to the power a person gains from their skills and knowledge. The skills and knowledge a person has help them to be successful in situations and know what to do. This power is greater when others recognise the person as an expert, too. When others feel someone is an expert, they are likely to defer to their judgment and follow their advice (French and Raven 156). Within The Maltese Falcon, Gutman has significant knowledge on the artifact in question. Other characters recognise this, and it often allows him to lead the proceedings. Sam Spade meanwhile is recognised for his skills as a detective. Characters try to get Spade on their side because they believe he will be a significant help in securing the artifact.\nInfluence Tactics\nWhile having potential power is helpful, how people try to influence others is just as important. Research by Kipnis et al. (440) started the examination of specific tactics people use to influence others. While a power base allows for the potential of influence, an individual may use a wide variety of different tactics across situations. Influence tactics have been found in meta-analytic examination to relate positively to work outcomes such as job performance, salary, and promotions (Higgins et al. 96). Most characters in The Maltese Falcon try multiple tactics to gain advantage and influence. We will define here a few major ones used.\nPressure tactics build on the idea of coercive power, as they involve a person making demands and threats (Yukl and Falbe 133). Thus, pressure is put on a person to change their behaviour or opinion. While many characters use pressure at times, one major example is Spade with O’Shaughnessy. Spade threatens he will not help O’Shaughnessy unless she gives him more information on the situation (Hammett 49). This is pressure to make her provide him information that is useful to him, even if someone else having that information could lead to O’Shaughnessy being implicated in a crime or losing the Maltese Falcon. \nExchange tactics, on the other hand, use the reward side of power. When using an exchange tactic, a person offers a reward or benefit in exchange for compliance (Yukl and Falbe 133). Thus, the reason for someone changing their behaviour is to gain what is being offered. This is a common tactic used across The Maltese Falcon. O’Shaughnessy, in talking about getting first involved with the Maltese Falcon, says she was offered five hundred pounds if she helped obtain it (Hammett 105). So, the tactic is an offer of money in exchange for her relevant actions.\nRational persuasion involves the use of logical arguments and factual evidence to try to convince another person to take a particular course of action (Yukl and Falbe 133). Thus, acting or thinking in a particular way is suggested to be a rational thing to do based on that person’s desires, regardless of the potential benefit to the person making the influence attempt. As Spade talks to Gutman about the need for a scapegoat, he gives reasoning and arguments why a scapegoat is needed and that a particular coherent story is necessary (Hammett 236). This is framed as being needed and rational, not as related to a particular person’s interest. Thus, the plan is argued as being “logical” in order to lead to compliance.\nIngratiation is a tactic that involves getting another person to effect a favourable mood toward the influencer before a request is made (Yukl and Falbe 133). The idea here fits with referent power – if we like someone, we are more likely to do what they ask. In discussing how to deal with the police related to the murders in the plot, Gutman compliments Spade on how he is a “difficult person to get the best of” (Hammett 237). In complimenting Spade on his cleverness, Gutman is trying to make Spade feel more favourable toward him. This could mean Spade will be more influenced later by Gutman due to this feeling. \nThe last tactic we consider here is consultation when a person allows the influence tactic’s target input into a decision or plan (Yukl and Falbe 133). By allowing input the person may feel more positive toward the plan and be willing to go along with it. Within the discussion on how to deal with the police related to the murders that have happened, Spade allows Gutman and Cairo to have input (Hammett 236). By doing so, Spade hopes to better gain their compliance and focus their attention on elements that are beneficial to him rather than to take their own independent action. The potential for Spade to be arrested or hurt is much greater if any of them do not go along with the fall guy plan. By including them in this set-up, Spade tries to get them to commit to this course of action.\nNow that we have discussed the nature of power and influence tactics, we will highlight exactly how they play out in some key scenes from the story.\nThe Plot as Seen through Power and Influence\nSam Spade Gets Hired by “Miss Wonderly”\nO’Shaughnessy (claiming to be a ‘Miss Wonderly’) comes to hire Spade dressed well and in full make-up (Hammett 6). We can see this as her trying to look as attractive as possible, trying to create referent power over Spade to make him want to help her. O’Shaughnessy then presents the case as being related to her concern for her sister, who may have fallen in with bad company (Hammettt 6). This is a lie but is used to garner sympathy. Surveillance for the sake of her sister suggests some legitimate power in the situation – it is more legitimate of a person to be looking out for their sister than for them to be asking someone to engage in the surveillance of a stranger. O’Shaughnessy also offers reward power with an exchange tactic of offering two hundred dollars for the job, an amount Spade characterises as high enough for him to overlook the unbelievability in her story (Hammett 42). By paying a high enough rate for the job, she gains Spade’s willingness to accept the job. This early scene thus presents an uncomplicated situation of influence, with O’Shaughnessy using three tactics to help gain the compliance of Spade to take on this surveillance job. \nFirst Spade and Cairo Meeting\nIn the middle of our story, we find Sam Spade in his office, where he receives a visit from Joel Cairo. Cairo initially offers Spade five thousand dollars to find the statue of a black bird. After initially offering Spade the money, Cairo pulls out a pistol and demands to search the office. Despite this, Spade overpowers Cairo and knocks him unconscious (Huston). Cairo first tries an exchange tactic by offering money, trying to create reward power over Spade. Almost instantly we see Cairo switch to the tactic of pressure by pulling his gun. We see Spade react by using expert power in the form of self-defence by knocking Cairo unconscious. Thus, Spade neutralises the attempted pressure.\nAfter Cairo awakens, he tells Spade he had to hold him at gunpoint because of the high value of the black bird. Cairo’s appeal and complaint can be seen as legitimising a pressure tactic. Cairo agrees to pay Spade a two hundred-dollar retainer fee after a negotiation. Cairo tells Spade he believes that Spade knows where the statue is and or at least how to find it, which is another example of Spade's expert power. It also shows Cairo believes Spade has crucial information, giving Spade informational power. At the end of scene Cairo asks for his gun back, and when Spade complies he again points the gun at Spade. This scene shows that Cairo was willing to try three tactics: pressure, legitimating, and exchange. He uses pressure and exchange twice, which could be seen as the use of a fourth tactic, assertiveness.\nSpade and Gutman Meetings\nAt the beginning of the second half of our story we are introduced to Kasper Gutman, who invites Spade to a meeting in a hotel room. Gutman proposes a toast to “plain speaking and clear understanding”, states that the two should get along well, and compliments Spade on his cleverness (Hammettt 128). These complimentary acts attempt to put Spade at ease, fitting with an ingratiation tactic. They also fit with the referent power base, as they work to make Gutman more likable. Spade, however, remains mostly unaffected and uninfluenced. He does use the appeal as an opportunity to probe Gutman for information about the black bird, which at the time he actually had little information about.\nIn this first meeting Spade does not get the information he desires, but is called to a second meeting the same day. Gutman reveals the history and value of the Maltese Falcon, and uses the tactic of rational persuasion using factual evidence to prove the value of the statue before asking Spade to take the case (Hammettt 151). Gutman also uses these facts to try to convince Spade that there is a lack of clear ownership rights for the object. Gutman finally offers Spade twenty-five thousand dollars to retrieve the statue, heavily relying on reward power and the tactic of exchange in this scene to convince Spade to work for him.\nIn these two scenes Gutman tries to use the tactics of ingratiation and the referent power base to learn what Spade knows about the Maltese Falcon. When that does not work, he switches to rational persuasion to prove the value of the statue. Finally, Gutman relies on reward power using the tactic of exchange to convince Spade to retrieve the Maltese Falcon. Spade is influenced by money but only agrees to take the case so that he can solve the murder of his ex-partner. Spade’s own clear goal helps keep him focussed and less influenced by others in the narrative (Hammett 265).\nConclusion\nAs we have shown through this article, the management and psychology ideas of power bases and influence tactics map closely on the action in The Maltese Falcon. The struggle for the Maltese Falcon offers an environment where no single character has control, and only through successfully influencing others is progress possible. Power bases and influence tactics help us to better understand and analyse the characters and their actions; therefore The Maltese Falcon could potentially also be used in the classroom as a tool for illustrating these concepts. While none of our characters ended up with the real black bird, we as the audiences have gained much value from this noir classic.\nReferences\nAtwater, Leanne E., and Francis J.

    "abstract": "Introduction\nSpecial effects (SFX) makeup has long been a powerful tool in the world of performance, used to transform, distort, and reimagine the human form in service of storytelling. From the eerie creatures of horror to the fantastical beings of science fiction, prosthetic makeup plays a crucial role in shaping the visual language of genre media. The American television show Face Off (2011-2018) brought this behind-the-scenes artistry to the forefront, offering viewers an in-depth look at the creative processes of professional special effects and prosthetic makeup artists. Running for 13 seasons, the competition-style reality series tasked contestants with complex challenges inspired by film and television genres, giving audiences a rare opportunity to witness the full arc of character creation—from initial brainstorming and conceptualisation to sculpting, moulding, and the climactic final reveal, known as “last looks”. Judged by industry veterans Glenn Hetrick, Ve Neill, and Neville Page, Face Off provided not just entertainment, but a compelling platform for examining the craft and imagination behind creature design.\nThis article explores how Face Off represents the concept of mutation within the visual and narrative framework of special effects makeup. Focussing on two key episodes—Season 6, Episode 11 (\"Freaks of Nature\") and Season 11, Episode 9 (\"Frightening Families\")—the analysis considers how contestants interpreted and visualised the idea of mutation in their designs. By examining the aesthetic choices, symbolic meanings, and creative decisions made in these episodes, this article seeks to understand how the artists navigate the intersection of genre, biology, and imagination. Ultimately, this investigation highlights how the visual language of mutation is shaped not only by the demands of competition but also by deeper genre conventions and cultural anxieties about the body, transformation, and identity.\nMaking and Moulding Mutants\nThe two episodes in question focus on how SFX artists interpret the concept of mutation. In the episode “Freaks of Nature”, six participants are assigned a specific genetic mutation and tasked with representing it through special effects makeup. The mutations included: impenetrable skin, panoramic vision, elasticity, magnetism, wall-crawling, and tunneling. Before beginning their physical transformations, each artist collaborated with a visual effects designer to create a digital rendering of their intended look to ensure the “mutated DNA” produces a “radically alter[ed] physical appearance”. That is, the characters that are crafted needed to “physically manifest that [selected] trait”. As the collaboration begins, it becomes clear that, despite the fact that the assigned mutations were not inherently monstrous or disfiguring, all six artists independently chose to depict their creations as disfigured, or physically abnormal in some way, with the general consensus amongst the artists that mutation meant developing “villains”.\nThe decision to equate mutation with monstrosity is telling and not entirely surprising given the structure of the competition. The time constraints under which these artists operate—often only having three days to design, sculpt, mould, paint, and apply complex prosthetics—encourage them to rely on core competencies and visual shorthand that are deeply rooted in genre conventions. Faced with limited time to conceptualise and execute a design, artists revert to what they know best and what has been normalised in the broader cultural and cinematic discourse. The choice to emphasise the monstrous of mutation, then, is evidence that, perhaps in response to heuristic processing, the SFX artists are leaning into the stereotypes that they have been exposed to through the production and consumption of popular culture. As Chaiken and Ledgerwood suggest, heuristic processing is where people rely on easily understood cues to interpret material, which can shape judgements that are easily accessed but not necessarily reliable. Applying such a perception to the SFX artists' work in Face Off, it would appear that the artists' creative instincts are shaped by a visual and narrative lexicon that equates mutation with the grotesque, even when mutation can be more broadly applied and understood. Rather than deeply engaging with the concept of mutation, the quick turnaround reinforces a kind of genre muscle memory, where certain visual metaphors become default modes of expression.\nMutation, particularly in the realm of visual media and popular culture, then, is frequently equated with an error or monstrous body. As Mantle posits, discussions of the mutated body have tended to focus on “moral concerns” and more pressingly “a body that deviates from a norm”. Accordingly, scholarly discussions have pointed to how mutated characters can often be depicted as transgressive, deviant, or othered (Gittinger), engaging in body horror that marks the mutant as monstrous (Pheasant-Kelly). Discussing science fiction films as examples, Pheasant-Kelly contends that mutations can produce characters that are “almost beyond recognition as humanoid[s]” (238), citing Cronenberg’s remake of The Fly as typifying mutations that emphasise “fluidity, disgust, infiltration and physical decomposition” (239). Even when the mutated characters do reflect more human representations, such as the superhero mutants of the X-Men franchise, their otherness or difference is elevated, to show they diverge from the norm or expected (Lopez). Thus, the decision of the SFX artists in Face Off to create characters that emphasise abjection is not unexpected. Rather than portraying mutation as a neutral or even beneficial change in an organism’s DNA, the artists defaulted to representing it as something grotesque or unsettling. Their interpretations emphasise the social and cultural narratives that construct mutation as a form of deviance.\nIn “Frightening Families”, the trend towards mutation being synonymous with otherness, abjection, and monstrosity continues. In this case, the task is even more explicitly coded as horrific: the makeup artists are asked to create “a sadistic family of three deranged mutants” that would be found in horror productions, and this is a tonal shift from the previous tasks of season eleven, which had largely been centred on light-hearted or “pretty” themes. Contestant Cig even expresses excitement at finally being able to create something “creepy and grotesque,” nine episodes into the season. This framing indicates that mutation, in this context, is not just creatively freeing but inherently tied to horror. One group designs a family disfigured by a nuclear incident, while the other team imagines a family mutated into grotesque circus performers due to genetic malformations.\nBoth interpretations in the episode are steeped in visual horror and physical distortion, but what becomes particularly troubling is the decision by the circus-themed SFX team to construct a young character with the real-world condition of hydrocephalus. As Aschoff et al. explain, hydrocephalus is an “anatomical-pathological” (68) condition in which fluid collects in the brain, causing not only symptoms such as “headache, vomiting, visual disturbances … [and] epileptic seizures” (67), but also the potential for the brain to grow to “abnormal proportions” (69). Although the character design is praised by the judges—particularly the paint work that mimics the veiny, sallow texture of the skin and what guest judge Marcus describes as “nice radial stretching”—this praise, summarised as “disgusting and fantastic” by judge Ve, underlines a more insidious problem: the rendering of a real and often debilitating medical condition as a spectacle for entertainment.\nScholarship has consistently demonstrated that disabilities have been appropriated by popular culture as mechanisms for delineating norms, marginalising those who do not ‘fit’ ideological constructs of normalcy (Diamond and Poharec; Hadley). While such portrayals have perpetuated stereotypes that do a disservice to individuals with disabilities, these representations were not always perceived negatively. Bogdan, for instance, argues that the ‘freak show’ was once an accepted form of popular culture in America, where displaying extraordinary bodies was not solely characterised by callous exploitation but also functioned as a means of interpreting difference. The “freak”, as scholars like Fielder and Garland-Thomson have examined, was constructed as a spectacle of the extraordinary: a figure that incited curiosity, fuelled speculation, and captivated audiences, functioning as both a spectacle of novelty and a lucrative commodity (Bogdan; Fielder). This duality allowed some performers with disabilities to achieve a measure of fame, suggesting that cultural perceptions of the freak body were complex and multifaceted.\nHowever, as society evolved and cultural narratives reshaped, the perception of the ‘freak’ or disabled body shifted from a symbol of “wonder to one of error” (Garland-Thomson, 3). This cultural shift is evident in the contemporary SFX competition show Face Off, where the depiction of a character with hydrocephalus draws upon early freak show portrayals by placing the character within a circus family—a narrative decision that evokes the historical spectacle of the freak while reinforcing contemporary stigmatising narratives. The dual-edged portrayal underlines how the exploitation of disability as spectacle persists in modern media, yet it is now reframed through a lens of exploitation, framing the affliction as a grotesque spectacle rather than presenting it as a complex human experience.\nSuch a decision, whether intentional or not, however reinforces a long-standing cultural pattern in which the disabled body is framed as othered, uncanny, or monstrous. As Diamond and Poharec argue, “according to humanist ideals, human subjects are white, male, able-bodied, conventionally attractive, heterosexual and cisgender, and rationally mature citizens” (403). To deviate from this narrow standard is to be marked as abnormal, and in media representations, such divergence frequently becomes the object of spectacle. The audience is invited to gaze at the difference, not with empathy, but with fascination or horror, effectively reducing the disabled figure to an object of curiosity or fear (Diamond and Poharec).\nPortraying disabled people as spectacles or presenting their bodies as threatening to the ‘norm’ is what Hadley considers a consistent problem in media: that is, disabled individuals are often represented as either pitiable or terrifying, rather than as complex, fully realised human beings. These portrayals do not just misrepresent disability; they actively contribute to a social hierarchy in which disabled lives are seen as less valuable or less human. By turning a condition like hydrocephalus into a visual shorthand for otherness or horror, the show Face Off participates in a representational logic that perpetuates structures of inequity and maltreatment. Rather than challenging societal prejudices about disability, such depictions reinforce them—subtly teaching audiences that physical difference is something to be feared, fixed, or excluded, especially when the artists are applauded for the authentic dribbling and “creepy” tone of the character. In fact, judge Glenn goes as far as to say that it is contestant Ben’s best work, legitimising the treatment of disability and difference as laudable.\nThe choice to focus on a medical condition as evidence of mutation may also reflect how, under pressure, artists draw from familiar representations that they know will have immediate visual impact. In a challenge that must be completed in a matter of days, the use of such an extreme visual cue may have felt like a practical decision to quickly convey a disturbing and memorable character, drawing perhaps from the stereotypes that they had gleaned from the myriad of popular cultural offerings that position mutation as abject (Domaradzki; Mantle; Peasant-Kelly). While this might raise important ethical concerns, it also illustrates how the time constraints of the competition push contestants to prioritize recognisable visual tropes over nuanced representations\nThe Animal-Human Hybrid\nIn “Freaks of Nature”, the fact that half of the Face Off artists deferred to animal traits in constructing their physical representations of mutation was not unexpected. Animal-human hybrids are a long-standing and culturally pervasive narrative device, especially within science fiction and horror genres, making them a familiar visual shorthand for transformation and difference (Cruz; Domaradzki). These hybrids are not merely imaginative constructs but are rooted in real-world scientific practices. Genetic testing on animals—including gene splicing and the deliberate induction of mutations—has long served as a foundation for medical advancement (Anderson; Dunn et al.; Singh and Seed), and these experiments have in turn inspired screen narratives that explore the limits and ethics of biological manipulation.\nFace Off operates directly within this representational tradition. Even when the characters were not constructed as overtly monstrous, they were often designed as amalgamations or animal-human hybrids. These hybrids were used to communicate specific abilities linked to the assigned mutations—abilities that could have been represented in a variety of ways but were instead visually anchored in the non-human or the abject. For instance, an octopus—with its multiple tentacles—was used to convey elasticity, a fly’s capacity to climb vertical surfaces inspired another design, and a mole rat informed the concept of a tunnelling mutant. These choices suggest that even when monstrosity or non-human traits were not explicitly chosen as the aesthetic direction, the animalistic was still a dominant trope. Here, the hybrid becomes not just a symbol of altered biology but a marker of otherness, particularly when the boundaries around what constitutes the human becomes increasingly blurred in law and animal experimentation (Vining).\nThe integration of animal traits into the characters developed by the SFX artists can subtly signal a tendency to use creativity to explore broader cultural anxieties around hybridity. As Cruz observes, “interspecies hybrids are abnormal and undesirable not only in the sense that their creation does not occur naturally, but also in that they are essentially evolutionary dead-ends” (162). Within this logic, hybrids do not represent progress or potential but aberration and stasis. In fact, Cruz argues that “the uncertainty of what will be produced by the unnatural union is what frightens” (162). It is precisely the unpredictability—the inability to control or fully know the outcome of genetic fusion—that makes such depictions so resonant within horror and sci-fi aesthetics. The animal-human hybrid becomes a vessel for projecting fears about scientific overreach and the destabilisation of natural order. As Cruz notes, “what is most frightening about genetics is our loss of power” (164).\nThe Face Off artists' alignment with this darker lineage of hybrid representation accentuates how deeply entrenched these ideas about mutation and hybridity are in the cultural imagination. As Domaradzki argues, the preoccupation of popular culture with mutation and hybrid forms is closely tied to the rapid development of biotechnologies, which provoke both fascination and fear. Media texts, then, like Face Off, function as interpretive tools that help audiences navigate the ethical and existential uncertainties posed by these technologies. Yet even as they offer a space for creative exploration, they also tend to reproduce dominant narratives that equate difference—especially biological difference—with monstrosity or otherness.\nCreativity and the Mutant Agenda\nThe decision of the SFX artists across both episodes to lean into the monstrous when interpreting mutation may also have been a strategic and creative one. By choosing to represent mutations through incongruous and transgressive forms, the special effects artists in “Freaks of Nature”, for example, had a wider range of aesthetic possibilities with which to respond to the request of judge, Neville Page, to “push themselves creatively”. The monstrous body, unlike a conventionally beautiful or subtle transformation, invites experimentation. As contestant George states in “Frightening Families”, “finally, we’ve done all this pretty shit and now we get to do something scary and bloody and snotty, which is so awesome”. It enables artists to work with exaggerated forms, unfamiliar textures, and extreme alterations to human anatomy that can produce hedonistic responses in audiences (Baltacioglu).\nThese creative challenges allowed the participants to push the limits of their materials and methods, from prosthetics and latex shaping to airbrushing, sculpting, and layering. In this sense, the monstrous was not just a default aesthetic, but also a space for showcasing technical prowess. For example, the winner of the mutation challenge in ‘Freaks of Nature’, contestant Tyler, was conscious that his wall-crawler needed to visually reflect the unique characteristics of a fly, and thus, he opted to mimic hair follicles by burning rubber tubes that would then look stiff and spiky: a creative approach that was deemed a marker of authenticity by the judges.   \nWhile grotesque designs were expected in a mutant makeup challenge, contestants were still encouraged to push creative boundaries. In “Frightening Families”, contestant Adam challenged his team’s “conceptually bland” direction by proposing a character swap—casting a six-foot man as the “little girl” and a shorter woman as the father. This risk, ultimately praised by the judges, exemplifies how artists were encouraged to break from conventional representations. Rather than being confined to more mundane or restrained depictions—such as minor physical anomalies or internal genetic shifts that might not lend themselves to visual storytelling—the artists were given the opportunity to expand the visual language of mutation. This freedom encouraged out-of-the-box thinking and provided a platform to challenge traditional aesthetic paradigms within their discipline.\nThe pressure to engage in out-of-the-box thinking was central to the development of mutants in the Face Off episode “Freaks of Nature”. Contestants openly discussed how they could not play it “too safe” or “too simple,” emphasising that the judges would “appreciate originality”. Creativity was not just encouraged—it was expected as a professional standard. The demand for innovation meant that even within a theme as imaginative as mutation, artists were pushed to take conceptual and aesthetic risks. Simply defaulting to the familiar, even when it fits the brief, could result in elimination. This became evident in the case of contestant Graham, who chose to develop a mole rat-inspired design to represent a tunnelling mutant. Although his choice was conceptually logical—grounded in the real-world biology of an animal known for its burrowing—his execution was criticised for being too predictable. The judges were unanimous in their disappointment, calling the concept the “obvious choice” and the “lowest hanging fruit”. Despite technical competency, his failure to stretch the imaginative possibilities of mutation cost him his place in the competition. Graham’s experience signals what creativity scholars have long argued, that what constitutes creativity may be subjective (Caves), but ultimately, to have success is to generate novel ideas (Amabile).\nProfessional expectations on Face Off required contestants to uphold high standards across multiple domains: innovative concept development, strong narrative cohesion, and meticulous technical execution. Risk-taking was a valued part of the process. Even when monstrosity and mutation already lent themselves to creativity, the bar was raised—contestants had to go beyond the expected, challenge the visual language of the grotesque, and surprise the judges with fresh interpretations. Bilton contends that creative people thrive on bounded creativity, where, for example, they are confined by genre or brief, but use that as a means to challenge parameters. These SFX artists typify Bilton’s thinking as they sought to push the boundaries of character design through cohesive storytelling, problem-solving on the fly, and aligning their work with the discipline’s aesthetic values: subtle paintwork, organic form, clean lines, and anatomical believability.\nSFX artists, then, were expected to not only craft compelling mutant characters but also to reinvent how mutation itself could be visualised. Failing to do so—even when working within a monstrous framework—was enough to be dismissed. While the monstrous or hybrid may be a reliable fallback under time pressure, contestants are still expected to push beyond those tropes. However, the show’s structure simultaneously demands rapid execution and novelty—a difficult balance that often leads artists to return to core motifs that are both professionally learned and socially reinforced. The result is a show where pushing aesthetic and conceptual boundaries was both a creative imperative and a professional necessity.\nConclusion\nThe depiction of mutation in Face Off offers an interesting window into how special effects artists grapple with the visual, narrative, and ideological dimensions of biological transformation. Across the two episodes analysed, mutation emerges not as a neutral or scientific concept, but as a rich aesthetic and cultural symbol—one that is frequently aligned with monstrosity, deviance, and otherness. Whether drawing on animal traits or real-world medical conditions, the artists consistently leaned into the grotesque, creating characters that disturb and transfix in equal measure. While this tendency reveals how entrenched certain genre tropes are, it also points out the professional and creative demands placed on SFX artists to innovate within those boundaries.\nThe mutation challenges, much like the alien, monster-focussed, and creature-based challenges of the discussed seasons, emphasised the grotesque and deviated from conventional aesthetics. This contrast became particularly apparent when placed alongside the more visually pleasing and ethereal challenges, such as the Snow Queens, angels, and fantasy duos, where beauty and attractiveness served as constraining parameters. In contrast, the grotesque-themed challenges permitted greater exploration beyond the boundaries of normalcy. Despite these thematic differences, all challenges demanded similar techniques and approaches, reinforcing the expectation that special effects artists would expand their skill sets and refine their repertoires as the seasons progressed.\nUltimately, Face Off becomes more than a reality competition; it is a site where contemporary anxieties about the body, identity, and transformation are played out through latex, prosthetics, and paint. The show’s mutant challenges highlight both the imaginative potential and the ethical complexities of visual storytelling in genre media. In making the monstrous beautiful—or at least compelling—the artists on Face Off not only expand the possibilities of special effects makeup but also offer insight into the cultural narratives that continue to shape our understanding of the altered body.\nReferences\nAmabile, Teresa M. \"Entrepreneurial Creativity through Motivational Synergy.\" The Journal of Creative Behavior 31.1 (1997): 18-26.\nAnderson, W.

    "abstract": "Introduction\nThe fusion of noir and Western elements in All the Pretty Horses (McCarthy) presents an anomalous hybrid, bridging the fatalism and existential despair of noir with the rugged individualism and pastoral decline of the Western. This relationship complicates traditional narrative boundaries, inviting readers to reconsider the archetypes and thematic constructs at play. Situated within a frontier grappling with industrial encroachment, All the Pretty Horses presents a world caught between preservation and progress. By focussing on the role of horses, this article explores their symbolic and material roles, highlighting the ideological fissures in rural and cowboy identities.\nThis study addresses a critical gap in noir scholarship, by examining how noir texts can help in understanding the myth-making process, and the role of animals in these narratives. The article examines how horses in All the Pretty Horses are transformed into mythic constructs that intertwine freedom with entrapment, mirroring the fatalistic cycles of noir protagonists. Further, the objectified horses can replace the femmes fatales as seductive catalysts of noir stories. Drawing on Barthes’s theory of myth, the article interrogates how these constructs naturalise cultural contradictions, capable of transforming acts of control and violence into symbols of nobility and authenticity.\nNoir and the Western: A Hybrid Aesthetic\nThe noir and the Western are noted as having an anomalous hybrid (sensu Monticone). That is, noir’s preoccupation with fatalism, moral ambiguity, and existential despair aligns with the Western’s exploration of individualism, frontier ethics, and the erosion of pastoral ideals (Kaminsky; Springhall; Conard). All the Pretty Horses presents the Western landscape as the site of noir’s entrapment and disillusionment, where characters grapple with the fatalistic loss of both personal and cultural identity.\nWhile noir traditionally thrives in urban environments, its themes resonate powerfully in McCarthy’s rural settings. The sale of the Grady family ranch, prompted by modern economic pressures, signals the encroachment of industrialisation and the demise of the agrarian heritage John Grady Cole values so deeply. As Somogyi observes, McCarthy’s descriptions of environmental decay and cultural erosion reflect broader concerns about humanity’s impact on the natural world. Grady’s journey to Mexico, ostensibly a boy’s quest for freedom, instead becomes an encounter with the dystopian underbelly of the romanticised frontier, aligning with Owens’s portrayal of McCarthy’s Mexico as a perilous and lawless space (65). The fated end of the cowboy myth and the taming of the wild has been prophesised in fiction for over one hundred years. John Ford’s 1924 film The Iron Horse chronicles Davy Brandon’s (George O’Brien) quest to fulfil his father’s dream of taming the wilderness through the construction of a transcontinental railroad. Dedicated to the memory of Abraham Lincoln and the pioneers of a “greater nation”, the film positions industrial progress as a civilising force. More recently, the rural noir series Yellowstone echoes this fatalism when career cowboy Rip Wheeler (Cole Hauser) observes, “you know, in 30 years from now … nobody’s gonna be doing this, nobody” (Voros).\nGrady’s character combines the archetypes of the noir antihero and the Western cowboy. His adherence to a personal moral code, even in the face of betrayal and violence, evokes noir’s thematic exploration of agency and fate. Lee suggests that Grady’s actions, though noble, are rendered futile by the overwhelming forces of modernity and corruption that define his surroundings. The violent episodes he endures, from reclaiming Blevins’s horse to his survival in the penitentiary, highlight noir’s fatalistic motif of constrained choice. Pippin argues that noir protagonists are often trapped by the illusion of agency – their fates seemingly predetermined by a world beyond their control (49).\nThe combination of noir and western themes reframes the conceptualisation of the cowboy and the frontier, exposing the coexisting but competing ideals of preservation and progress extant in many western narratives (Lee). Grady’s ideals repeatedly clash with the harsh realities of survival and human fallibility as the romanticised veneer of the authentic cowboy life progressively deteriorates. Horses occupy a central role in this dynamic, embodying both the promise of an unspoiled past and the inevitability of its demise (Hoy; Somogyi). Their presence in the narrative bridges the expansive romanticism of the Western with the pessimistic determinism of noir.\nAs the novel unfolds, the layered significance of the horses deepens. They become not just symbols of freedom or nostalgia but also objects of ideological tension, reflecting a broader human tendency to mythologise nature (sensu Nolan, Hackett, and Coghlan). This clash between the romanticised and the real, when viewed through the noir lens, provides a unique perspective from which to explore human interactions with horses and the myth of horses.\nBarthesian Myths and the Equestrian Allure\nRoland Barthes’s theory of myth provides a critical lens for examining the portrayal of horses in All the Pretty Horses (Barthes). Barthes defines myth as a system of meaning that naturalises cultural constructs, transforming historical realities into self-evident truths. In All the Pretty Horses, horses are romanticised as symbols of freedom, authenticity, and the cowboy ethos, yet their depiction simultaneously reveals inherent contradictions and violence underpinning these ideals (Kaminsky; Somogyi). Horses thus become sites where myth and materiality collide, highlighting a human tendency to mythologise the goodness of nature while simultaneously exploiting it.\nHorses in All the Pretty Horses embody an idealised vision of the cowboy life that Grady seeks. Grady’s devotion to horses reflects his yearning for a different life, viewing them as essential to his identity. They anchor him to a vanishing past, representing a world of unspoiled beauty and simplicity that is increasingly threatened by industrialisation and cultural erosion. However, horses exist in both versions of the rural idyll, whether in utopian landscapes providing a safe escape from urbanisation, or within the same landscape represented as dystopian and steeped in crime and violence (Traub; Lee).\nAs an extended connection to the cowboy’s horse, another horse myth All the Pretty Horses perpetuates is the myth of the warhorse, stating “horses also love war” (111). Grady’s father asserts that “no man who has not gone to war on horseback can ever truly understand the horse” (111) exemplifying a deep connection between horses and soldiers. The connection between war and horses creates an existential problem for Grady, the self-titled “comandante de las yeguas” (128), whose identity is intimately tied to horses, but who has not been to war. This bond between horse and soldier has deep romantic roots in literature, as illustrated in Black Beauty, where an old war horse recounts stories of loyalty and shared hardships with his master (Sewell). However, there is definitive evidence of companionship and respect for horses in a post-war cultural memory which could have informed the myth-making. Nathan Wise provides a valuable framework for understanding this evolution, tracing how horses, initially integral to human survival in war and work, became mythologised symbols of resilience, freedom, and nobility.\nIn military contexts, horses were celebrated not only for their utility but also for their perceived virtues, which mirrored the aspirations of their human counterparts. Gullett observes that “there has never been a closer bond between man and animal than that between the veteran Light Horseman and his Waler” (in Wise 65). Wise’s exploration of the human-horse relationship reveals a nuanced dynamic that varied depending on the nature of the working relationship between the horse and human. In some working environments, such as in artillery or supply units, horses were commonly viewed as a military tool or resource that could be worked to near exhaustion and death if needed. In other environments, such as cavalry and light horse, a long, close bond and working relationship with a horse was central to the wellbeing and success of the individual and their unit, and thus, horses were viewed in more sentimental and often anthropomorphic ways: as friends, ‘pals’, comrades, and symbols of endurance (Wise). Of course, the romance, reverence, and respect demonstrated towards horses are potentially one-sided, leading scholars like Somogyi to question, do the horses want to be at war?\nThe romanticisation of the horse-myth obscures some of the harsh realities of the human-horse relationship, particularly the violence and control involved in domestication and taming. The language of horsemanship, with terms like breaking and taming, reflects a dynamic of control that strips horses of their autonomy. The process of breaking and taming horses is an important motif in the novel. On a Mexican hacienda, Grady and Rawlins attempt to break 16 horses in four days, demonstrating their prowess and mastery of horses and therefore affirming their worth in the foreign land (100). The conflict between these actions of control and the image of the horse as a symbol of freedom is a familiar contradiction embedded in the horse-myth of the cowboy life and the warhorse.\nWhen Grady is breaking a wild Mexican horse, he notes, “they did not smell like horses. They smelled like they were, wild animals” (103). Grady suggests that a horse’s true nature emerges only after domestication. For Grady, the act of breaking horses is not merely a demonstration of skill and mastery but a way of bringing forth true nature; a nature that exists subordinate to humans. The act of breaking a horse broadly mirrors a human impulse to dominate and impose order on the entire natural world.\nAs myths, horses are objectified and imbued with an almost sacred quality, their beauty and nobility elevating them beyond a material reality. This mythic allure blinds characters to the practical and often brutal realities of their relationships with horses, such as Jimmy Blevins’s attachment to his stolen horse. The horse’s exceptional quality is a source of pride and a symbol of status, yet it also precipitates Blevins’s downfall. His inability to maintain, reclaim, and again, maintain his horse demonstrates the power of myth to entrap individuals in cycles of obsession and self-destruction. Grady’s relationship with horses is similarly shaped by their mythic constructs. His deep connection to his horse represents his adherence to a personal, frontier moral code, rooted in ideals of loyalty and justice. However, this connection also compels him to act in ways that deepen his entanglement in violence and loss. Grady justifies his decision to help Blevins reclaim his horse by asking Rawlins “what if it was you?” (76). Because of the relationship between Rawlins and Grady, “what if it was you?” is ostensibly the same as what if it were me. The trio’s efforts to rescue Blevins’s horse, in a land foreign to their customs and laws, highlight the innate bond between horse and rider, suggesting that their separation constitutes a fundamental injustice.\nThrough its portrayal of horses, All the Pretty Horses helps in the understanding of the myths underpinning rural and cowboy identities. Barthes’s theory of myth reveals how these constructs “empty reality” (142) and the material conditions of human-animal relationships, transforming acts of control and violence into symbols of nobility and authenticity. All the Pretty Horses opens the romanticised ideals of freedom and individuality that define the cowboy ethos for critique. This critique positions horses as central to the novel’s noir exploration of identity, morality, and the human condition.\nThe Filly Fatale: Horses as Noir Catalysts\nThe mythic horses function as noir catalysts, analogous to the femme fatale archetype, compelling the protagonists into fatalistic cycles of desire, conflict, and inevitable downfall. Unlike the human femme fatale, however, the horses’ agency lies not in intentional manipulation but in their mythic allure and their integral role within the narrative. The comparison between horses and women is made explicit by Rawlins when he explains that “a goodlookin horse is like a goodlookin woman… They’re always more trouble than what they’re worth. What a man needs is just one that will get the job done” (89). This comparison underscores the horses’ dual function as objects of desire and sources of peril. The femme fatale archetype traditionally symbolises the destabilisation of male authority and rationality (Pippin; Creed). Much like the femme fatale, the horses draw the characters into morally complex situations, forcing them to confront the dissonance between their ideals and their realities.\nThe role of the femme fatale has been criticised. Creed underscores the concept of the objectified woman, arguing that patriarchal ideologies in popular narratives reduce women to their sexuality, framing them as enigmatic and alien figures who by their nature disrupt the rational order of male-dominated society (10). Feminist theorists further assert that this objectification serves as a mechanism of control, suppressing female potential (Fiedler). Palmer argues that in noir the taming process is a male act, while domestication is cast as female destiny.\nDrawing on Lévi-Strauss’s theory of exchange, which conceptualises women as signs exchanged among men (Lévi-Strauss), Cook and Johnston argue that noir heroines exist solely within the discourse of male characters:\n\ndepicted as only having an existence within the discourse of men: she is “spoken”, she does not speak. As an object of exchange between men, a sign oscillating between the images of prostitute and mother-figure, she represents the means through which men express their relationship with each other, the means through which they come to understand themselves and each other. (95)\n\nIn All the Pretty Horses, horses partially supplant women as objects in the narrative’s discourse. The exchanges of horses between men become measures of character, as illustrated when Grady and Rawlins judge Blevins unworthy of his horse, assuming its exceptional quality exceeds his status. Like the femme fatale who lures the noir protagonist to his downfall, the trio of Grady, Rawlins, and Blevins are drawn to their respective fates through their relationships with horses. From their initial encounter with Blevins, whose horse's magnificence precedes recognition of the rider himself, ultimately, Blevins’s horse precipitates his death, echoing noir themes in which women—or their symbolic equivalents—lead men to ruin.\nBy reimagining the femme fatale archetype through the figure of the horse, the interplay between allure, danger, and destruction that defines noir storytelling is recontextualised. Horses in All the Pretty Horses are not mere narrative elements; they are dynamic forces that shape the characters’ trajectories and challenge their autonomy. Thus, in All the Pretty Horses, horses transcend their roles as mere animals, becoming pivotal symbolic objects within the narrative's noir framework. Their allure, like that of the femme fatale, embodies both promise and peril, drawing the protagonists toward the fatalistic undercurrents that cause the protagonists to suffer.\nCycles of Suffering and the Returning Home\nWhen Rawlins states, “you think about all the stuff that can happen to you… There ain’t no end to it” (91), he evokes noir’s characteristic circularity, where protagonists often return to their starting point (Palmer). This circularity is echoed in Hughes’s Ride the Pink Horse, where the titular pink horse, part of a carousel, symbolises a cyclical journey: “you go a long way in a circle and end up in the same place as you started” (Silver 232). Similarly, Grady’s return to Texas captures a cyclical fatalism important to many noir narratives. Silver uses the case study of Ride the Pink Horse to explore noir texts and “Schopenhauer’s belief in validation and redemption” (232). Schopenhauer’s philosophy of suffering as an intrinsic aspect of existence offers an interpretive framework for Grady’s hardships. For Schopenhauer, suffering is not incidental but integral to life, a consequence of the cyclical, endless striving that defines human will (Schopenhauer). While Grady never renounces Schopenhauer’s will, and while he never went to war per se, he appears to have sufficiently suffered to finally understand the horse. At the close of the story, Grady and his horse are silhouetted as one against a blood red sky.\nThrough this interplay of themes, All the Pretty Horses bridges the spiritual and fatalistic dimensions of noir and Western traditions. Horses, often anthropomorphised with human and even divine traits, encapsulate this duality. Grady’s belief that “God put horses on earth to work cattle” (127) imbues them with a theological significance that contrasts with noir’s secular fatalism. In a similar fashion Grady believes there is no wealth worth having other than cattle, so a theological connection between worth and horses is aligned in opposition to classic “godless” existential crises of noir narratives (Sanders and Porfirio 96). The noir Western blends religious determinism with the cyclical despair of noir.\nUltimately, horses in All the Pretty Horses are more than narrative elements; they are pivotal constructs that shape the characters’ fates and challenge the myths underpinning their identities. By weaving the fatalism of noir with the mythic resonance of the Western, McCarthy’s narrative offers a profound commentary on the human condition. Horses, as both symbols of freedom and agents of entrapment, embody the collapse of the cowboy myth against the inevitable civilising forces of industrialisation. All the Pretty Horses uses its horses to reflect a broader existential struggle to reconcile the idealised past with an unrelenting present.\nConclusion\nThrough its intricate melding of noir and Western elements, All the Pretty Horses illustrates the collapse of the romanticised ideals of freedom and individualism central to the cowboy ethos. Horses, as mythic constructs, serve as narrative catalysts that intertwine human ambition with cycles of suffering, drawing characters toward their fatalistic ends. Noir hybrid texts such as All the Pretty Horses can reframe the human-animal relationship, exposing the violence and control inherent in the domestication process while critiquing the myths that sustain these practices.\nBy applying Barthes’s theory of myth, this analysis reveals how horses transcend their material reality to become symbols laden with ideological tension. These constructs, both alluring and perilous, align with noir’s femme fatale archetype, recontextualising the interplay between allure, danger, and destruction that defines the genre. The protagonist’s journey underscores noir’s fatalism, illustrating how mythic ideals can entrap individuals in cycles of loss and disillusionment.\nReferences\nBarthes, Roland. Mythologies. Trans.

    "abstract": "Though the ‘official’ film noir period ended more than 60 years ago, the enigmatic allure of noir endures, lingering like the smoke from a femme fatale’s cigarette. IMDB defines the classic film noir period of American cinema as beginning with the film Underworld (1927) and ending with Touch of Evil (1958), while many consider that John Houston’s The Maltese Falcon (1941), an adaptation of Dasheill Hammett’s hard-boiled detective novel, as launching the classic noir cycle. Classic noir is immediately recognisable for its characters: the brooding detective and sultry femme fatale; its themes of crime, corruption, and the seedy side of the big city; and its distinctive visual style, including a high-contrast black and white palette. With its categorisation – as genre/cycle/style – contested and argued over the ensuing years, noir nevertheless remains an essential part of our screen lexicon.\nNeo-noir, a perceptible set of screen texts emerging after the classic noir era, has undergone its own rigorous contestation and evolution, with another distinct iteration, neon-noir, also emerging. Hybridisation of noir with other genres and styles has arguably always been around, and the range of texts that emerged beyond the classic era blend noir with everything from horror in Psycho (1960), science fiction in Blade Runner (1982), dark comedy in Fargo (1996), to the Western in Mystery Road (2013).\nWhilst the visual features of noir are an integral part of its appeal, we must not forget that its literary roots run deep and have continued to proliferate; classic film noir arose from the novels of Hammett and Raymond Chandler, Nordic Noir had its literary roots in books from Henning Mankell and Stieg Larssen, and Australian (or ‘Outback’) Noir has emerged as a crime fiction juggernaut, with several adaptations making their way to big and small screens.\nOn television, Nordic Noir is in its third decade of taking the world by storm, and its influence can be traced across other national noir texts, such as the UK’s Broadchurch (2013-2017). High-quality noir-inspired productions continue to appear on streaming services, such as Netflix’s limited series Ripley (2024), shot in sumptuous black and white. Genre hybridisation is also evident on the small screen, including quirky comedy and supernatural themes in Twin Peaks (1990-1, 2017), an influential network success with a streaming sequel, and comedy in Amazon’s Aussie hit Deadloch (2023-).\nIt is not the aim of this issue of M/C Journal on noir to define or redefine noir, as this is an argument no one can win, and in fact the argument itself can be ruled redundant. Rather, our authors interrogate iterations of noir from its classic roots to more recent hybridisations. Across the media of film, television, and literary fiction, these articles investigate how noir intersects with such diverse genres as the Western, children’s fiction, comedy, horror, superhero films, and documentary. Recognising the multi-faceted nature of noir, articles explore noir tropes evident in themes, characters, and style. Having broken free of its American-centric (and city-bound) classic roots decades ago, national iterations of noir continue to spread and hybridise, and continued academic and popular interest in noir is fed by its ever-changing, ever-growing oeuvre. Noir, as evident in this edition, is both instantly recognisable and generically slippery.\nTess Ezzy’s article “Black Widow: Unravelling Noir Characterisation in Charlotte’s Web’s Femme Fatale” explores the unexpected parallels between E.B. White's Charlotte’s Web and the thematic and stylistic elements of film noir. While the novel has long been celebrated as a staple of children’s literature for its exploration of friendship, mortality, and the cycles of life, this article reveals how it also delves into moral ambiguity, agency, and survival when viewed through a noir lens. Central to this analysis is spider Charlotte A. Cavatica, who embodies the femme fatale archetype: intelligent, manipulative, and morally complex. Charlotte’s actions align with the classic femme fatale, blending altruism with strategic deception to subvert oppressive systems and ensure survival. The barnyard, too, serves as a noir-like microcosm, where idyllic appearances mask existential dilemmas and ethical compromises. Characters such as Templeton, the self-interested yet essential ally, and Wilbur, the passive protagonist wrestling with existential dread, reflect a broader exploration of morally grey spaces, collective survival, and the consequences of agency. Through this lens, the article argues that Charlotte’s Web transcends its pastoral genre, weaving themes of deception, fatalism, and ethical complexity typically associated with noir into a sophisticated narrative suitable for all ages.\nThe article “All the Pretty Noir Horses: The Myth of the Horse in the Noir Western” by Huw Nolan, Jenny Wise, and Nathan Wise explores how Cormac McCarthy’s 1992 novel All the Pretty Horses combines elements of noir and the Western, creating a hybrid that subverts both genres. The study uses Barthes’s theory of myth to analyse how horses function as symbolic constructs, embodying tensions between freedom and control, nostalgia and progress. It argues that horses fulfill a dual role, both as romanticised icons of the cowboy ethos and as agents of entrapment that underscore noir’s fatalism. The analysis situates the novel within a landscape of industrial encroachment, where the Western’s rugged individualism and pastoral ideals degrade under the forces of modernity. Horses represent these collapsing ideals, reflecting humanity’s contradictory yearning for unspoiled nature while simultaneously exploiting it. The article also reimagines noir’s femme fatale through the mythic allure of horses, which, like the femme fatale, lead protagonists into cycles of desire, conflict, and inevitable suffering. For protagonist John Grady Cole, his idealised connection to horses intensifies his entanglement in violence and loss, underscoring noir’s themes of disillusionment and constrained agency.\nIn an in-depth analysis of The Batman (2022) in “Becoming the Shadows: A Gothic Noir Reading of Empathy, Psychopathy and Anti-Heroism in The Batman (2022)”, Tracey Woolrych and Chris Comerford situate the film at the intersection of gothic and noir genres. Unlike previous cinematic portrayals of the character, Robert Pattinson’s Batman is depicted as a morally ambiguous anti-hero, whose violent actions and psychological complexities reflect both noir’s archetypal hard-boiled detective and gothic tropes of trauma and monstrosity. They argue the film’s aesthetic evokes a dark, crime-ridden Gotham where Batman operates as a conflicted vigilante, alienated from societal acceptance yet driven by an overwhelming sense of justice. This iteration emphasises his psychological distress—rooted in the trauma of his parents’ murder—and explores his efforts to channel personal pain into his crusade for justice, which blurs the line between heroism and pathology. Through a psychological lens, the article considers Batman’s dark traits, analysing his aggressive tendencies, emotional compartmentalisation, and bouts of empathy, which align him with characteristics of both psychopathy and what researchers term the ‘dark empath’. Batman’s emotional detachment is seen as a protective mechanism but also as a source of tension, driving his actions and shaping his isolated persona. Further, the article contrasts Batman with the Riddler, highlighting how the film draws parallels between the two as different manifestations of violence and trauma, further complicating the dichotomy of good versus evil. Pattinson’s Batman is viewed as a complex, liminal figure who challenges traditional notions of noir anti-heroes and gothic protagonists. The authors conclude that this interpretation contributes to a richer understanding of the character and the interplay between trauma, heroism, and morality in contemporary storytelling.\nKaela Joseph’s article “Gays Burying Ourselves: Immersive and Subversive Uses of Neon Noir in I Saw the TV Glow” examines Jane Schoenbrun’s 2024 I Saw the TV Glow (ISTTVG), a psychological sci-fi/horror film that uses neon-noir techniques to craft a compelling allegory for the queer experience, centring themes of internalised heteronormativity, identity concealment, and psychological liberation. The article considers the act of self-burial – both metaphorically and literally – as a complex, unsettling process of identity reclamation, tying it to queer struggles of ego death and authenticity. Drawing on noir elements – such as expressionist cinematography, morally ambiguous characters, and grim, suffocating settings – the film, for the authors, shifts traditional noir paradigms into uniquely queer territory, reimagining familiar tropes and fears through a subversive lens. Unlike traditional noir, ISTTVG trades urban landscapes for the banality of the suburban, capturing the stifling mundanity associated with heteronormative conformity. While neon-noir typically relies on cityscapes and artificial light to evoke unease, the article posits that Schoenburn shifts this tension to televisions, projectors, and other nostalgic imagery, blurring the comforting glow of serialised television with undertones of disquiet and despair. Both the setting and cinematography invoke queer temporality, suggesting a simultaneous suspension and urgency of time, reflecting the queer experience of navigating identity within societal constraints, which along with the characters complicate traditional noir archetypes.\n“Who Will Control the Black Bird? Influence and Power Bases in The Maltese Falcon” is an intricate examination of power dynamics and influence tactics used by the characters in the source novel and film adaptation of The Maltese Falcon. Drawing on the noir aesthetic, Gordon Schmidt and Clint Martin consider a morally ambiguous world rife with deception and manipulation, where no one can claim true legitimacy or complete control over the prized artifact. Central to classic noir, the characters navigate a shadowy environment of mistrust, ethical compromises, and blurred morality, consistent with the genre's themes of power struggles and individual ambition. The article explores these dynamics through frameworks of positional and personal power, illustrating how the noir setting forces characters to depend on manipulation, negotiation, and influence to navigate a treacherous moral landscape. It highlights how the interplay of power and character motivations not only drives the narrative but also reflects the pessimistic, ruthless worldview inherent to noir. By analysing the transactional and tension-filled relationships through the lens of power, the article deepens our understanding of the genre’s thematic focus on human vulnerability, corruption, and the elusiveness of control in a world bound by chaos.\nL. Dugan Nichols argues in “Generational Detectives: Documentary Noir, Millennials, and Conspiracy on Netflix“ that the streamer’s American Conspiracy: The Octopus Murders (2024) represents the intersecting evolution of noir storytelling, conspiracy theories, and Millennial generational anxiety. It applies the dark, paranoid tropes of film noir to the documentary format while weaving in themes of disillusionment with systemic power structures, raising questions of murder, corruption, and obfuscated truths. The series’ investigative photojournalist mirrors the archetype of a noir detective, immersed in an indifferent, malevolent world where answers remain elusive, and suspicion infects all interactions. The article argues that beyond its surface as a true-crime mystery, the documentary reflects a larger generational narrative, portraying Millennials grappling with the fallout of inherited neoliberal policies, growing economic inequality, and political disillusionment in the wake of events like 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis. The noir aesthetic – labyrinthine plotting, dramatic sprawl, unresolved endings, and deep societal mistrust – here serves as both a narrative device and a lens through which Millennial anxieties about their precarious world are refracted. Within the broader cultural landscape, American Conspiracy fits into a subculture of podcasts and online communities that use conspiracies to dissect historical and contemporary abuses of power, creating new digital noirs for a disenchanted generation.\nNoir has often been defined by its urban roots, where shadowy streets and towering cityscapes mirror the moral ambiguity and despair at the genre's core. However, noir is not confined to the chaos of the metropolis, as we find in André Francisco’s article “’Small town, big hell’: Noir and Landscape in Mare of Easttown (2018)”. Francisco examines noir themes – corruption, entrapment, and moral decay – and finds they have equally compelling expression in small towns, where intimacy and familiarity amplify tension. The idyllic façade of the small town, steeped in myths of American wholesomeness, often obscures its shared secrets, crumbling morality, and collective complicity. In this context, the TV series Mare of Easttown offers a striking contemporary example, reinterpreting noir’s aesthetic and thematic template within the confines of a suburban American community. Visually, Mare of Easttown adapts noir’s shadow-laden cityscapes into muted greys and desolate suburban landscapes. The decayed houses, barren roads, and dimly lit interiors evoke a sense of suffocating inevitability. Here, wide-open spaces paradoxically feel as restrictive as noir’s urban labyrinths, mirroring a community where violence and despair thrive not in isolation but in the oppressive closeness of intergenerational ties. Crimes in Easttown, such as domestic violence, sexual assault, and child abuse, are not random but products of a deeply broken environment. Justice is elusive, complicated by a network of relationships where everyone is implicated in some way. Like the back alleys of the noir city, Easttown itself becomes a character, embodying the moral decay noir thrives upon.\nCompleting this issue, Kai Qing Tan examines Yeo Siew Hua’s A Land Imagined (2018), a Singaporean noir film, to explore its commentary on migrant labourers’ exploitation, alienation, and the reification of individuals within the neoliberal, glocalised structure of Singapore. Titled “Negative Affects in the Dark Intervals of A Land Imagined”, the discussion focusses on the film’s use of ‘dark intervals’ – liminal spaces like cybercafés, highways, and reclaimed lands – to evoke moments of reflection, personal transformation, and the acknowledgment of marginalised lives. The film disrupts viewers’ preconceived notions, invoking reflective empathy by immersing them in the dreams, struggles, and vulnerabilities of the migrant workers. Visual motifs such as red lights and reclaimed land symbolise Singapore’s unceasing development, achieved at the expense of these labourers’ invisibility and systemic exploitation. In its poetic and ambivalent ending, A Land Imagined juxtaposes the characters’ pursuit of freedom with viewers’ passive observance, asking them to assess their own complicity in the societal dynamics it critiques. It concludes by emphasising the potential of non-Western noir, such as this Singaporean film, to expose hidden injustices and reimagine societal attitudes, calling for more scholarly focus on global noir traditions as tools for critical empathy and inclusive community-building.\n \nAcknowledgment\nThe editors of this issue would like to thank M/C Journal, the peer reviewers, and the Popular Culture Research Network (popcrn.org) for their support of contemporary popular culture research.",

    "title": "Law, Viral Mutations, and Spectral Tropicality in Agustina Bazterrica’s &lt;em&gt;Tender Is the Flesh&lt;/em&gt; (2017)",
    "abstract": "Introduction: Spectral Tropicality and Viral Mutations\nIn mid-February 2025, the World Health Organization issued an alert in its weekly bulletin about an emerging outbreak of a mysterious disease in two villages in Equateur Province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (WHO). This alert generated two major reports in the press: the first was that the disease could kill in less than 48 hours; the second was that there was an ongoing investigation into the possibility that the disease had started in three children who ingested a bat carcass (and who died with severe symptoms of hemorrhagic fever a few hours later). Experts at the time pointed out that the repercussions of the possible link between bat ingestion and the emergence of the disease were justified, since these animals are reservoirs of viruses such as Nipah, Marburg, Ebola, MERS-CoV, and, finally, SARS-CoV-2 (Rojek et al.). However, a few days later, this hypothesis was discarded by the WHO itself, when it found evidence that the contamination could be related to tainted water (Cohen).\nThe media repercussions of the case above exemplify how public opinion is sensitive to disruptive events originating in the tropics—an area traditionally viewed through a dichotomy that, on the one hand, evokes the region as exotic, biodiverse, and paradisiacal and, on the other, as hostile, inhospitable, uncontrollable, and unhealthy (Benitez; Lundberg). Once understood as the white man’s tomb (Curtin), the tropics today reaffirm their agency through tropicality, functioning as a spectre that raises the horror of the dissolution of dreams, intentions, illusions of control, rights, justice, and, to a certain extent, human existence itself (Harvey). Spectral Tropicality is thus the phantasmagorical return of the ambivalent dimension of the tropics that destabilises any certainty and security regarding knowledge, control, or dominion over life. This article analyses how spectral tropicality becomes manifest through a highly mutagenic virus in Tender Is the Flesh (Cadáver Exquisito) by the Argentine writer Agustina Bazterrica, drastically altering the law to legalise cannibalism. In this book, patterns of meat consumption and production are transformed by the emergence of an infectious agent that contaminates all animals and is deadly to humans. In this scenario, the drastic transformation of laws as an effect of the virus’s high evasive capacity against efforts to produce vaccines and medicines is a symptom of spectral tropicality. This tropicality becomes even more powerful in the face of the devastating epidemics and pandemics emerging in the wake of the current planetary and climate crisis.\nThe GGB Virus as a Mutation-Power\nTender Is the Flesh presents a dystopian scenario in which a devastating virus contaminates all animals, making their flesh lethal to humans. Called GGB, the virus is described in the book as highly contagious, affecting a wide range of animal species, but transmitted to humans through the consumption of animal meat. The origin of the virus remains unclear, but its consequences are catastrophic for human society, leading to a ban on the consumption of animal meat due to its virulence. To contain the public health crisis, governments around the world implement drastic measures to eradicate farm animals and prohibit meat consumption. This scenario results in an extreme social transformation, where practices of cannibalism are institutionalised as a response to the scarcity of animal protein. Marcos Tejo lives in a small town in the north of Argentina, where he works as an administrator at a human abattoir, overseeing the production and slaughter of people bred for consumption. His role involves managing the \"production\" process to ensure it complies with the established regulations. As a form of bonus for his work, he receives a woman, described in the book as \"prime meat\" for consumption. The Argentine setting contributes to the creation of a subtropical and suffocating scenario, where the heat and humidity reinforce the feeling of decadence and despair in the plot.\nThe vulnerability of women in this context is explored extensively in the book, as poor women are raised as livestock for both human consumption and reproduction. Here, we see the continuation of a capitalist pattern of exploiting animal flesh, which, in this case, extends to the flesh of women—illustrating a strong association between animal and female exploitation in a patriarchal regime, as explored in the philosophy of Carol J. Adams (Mercier). Tender Is the Flesh is part of a group of literary works, the starting point of which is a highly lethal disease that induces drastic changes on a planetary level, giving rise to morbid persistences associated with patriarchy and the capitalist system (Costa; Schneider).\nThe GGB virus can be considered a mutation-power, a pathogen that evades human attempts at knowledge and control, while reconfiguring the material, social, political, and symbolic dimensions of life. This term may be used with inspiration from the concept of thing-power, as analysed in Jane Bennett’s vital materialism. While thing-power may suggest the centrality of objects, it actually refers to a heterogeneous assembly of bodies, elements, forces, ideas, institutions, and other factors that emerge as events—producing contingent effects that operate with and against human intentions, actions, and thoughts (Bennett). Agency here is not localised but arises from multiple sources that combine human and nonhuman characteristics. Although thing-power encompasses the dynamism of matter itself, the GGB virus points to something beyond that: a pathogenic agent with a high capacity to evade scientific research and defy explanation or containment. In the narrative, reality manifests as a recurring trauma that undermines human intentions, actions, and assumptions of control over the world—revealing the fragility of the self-sufficient universe of reason upon which the capitalist system is built (Kolozova). Thus, it is worth saying that due to its extreme complexity and dynamic nature, the virus represents a mutation-power that at times remains in obscurity and, most often, in complete darkness for the reader. The pandemic in the novel persists within the realm of the unthinkable, serving primarily a dramatic function that envelops the virus in a fog of mystery—raising more questions and doubts than it resolves.\nThe virus as mutation-power in Bazterrica’s work sheds light on themes related to cruelty, survival, and dehumanisation. However, it also explores an underlying ambiguity in the face of a cataclysmic event. The pandemic caused by the GGB virus promotes a dissolution of the past, yet society’s reaction reinforces an attachment to and dependence on certain idealised aspects of that past—out of which extreme solutions emerge to preserve the illusion of life continuing as it was. The meat industry, governments, and the social attachment to meat consumption are all forces that reshape society to adapt to the new reality, producing extreme solutions that eerily resemble older patterns. It is the terror of losing the past—of losing the stability of customs and everything to which one is emotionally anchored (Whitehead)—that fuels speculation about how such horror might materialise in the face of global dissolution. The novel questions how far society can go to ensure the survival of outdated models and how social norms may be distorted under extreme conditions. It exposes the fragility of those norms, highlighting how severe crises can lead to a re-evaluation of values and practices previously deemed unacceptable—all in the name of preserving entrenched economic and cultural systems.\nThe Law and the Sanitisation of Cannibalism\nIn Bazterrica’s work, the legalisation of cannibalism and the breeding of humans for consumption reflect the dissolution of ethical and moral norms in times of extreme crisis. Society is divided into two classes: those who consume human flesh and those who are raised for slaughter, resulting in widespread dehumanisation. The construction and evolution of law emerge here as central elements in maintaining patterns of meat production and consumption in a collapsing society.\nIn this sense, the GGB virus functions as a mutation-power that influences decisions at the legal level. The idea that nonhumans can act in some way within the legal sphere or initiate legal processes is supported by Western history itself. Philosopher Jane Bennett cites historical and contemporary cases in which things, animals, and elements act within legal frameworks. One example is the deodand (meaning “that which must be given to God”) in eleventh-century English law—objects, animals, or elements that caused death or harm to people, and were subsequently confiscated and sold by the Crown as a form of compensation. Another example Bennett discusses involves objects used as material evidence in criminal cases—items that function as actants by intervening in legal proceedings (Bennett 9). Other historical conceptions of nonhuman legal agency also exist. In the early modern period, animals and insects could be the subjects of lawsuits. This was the case with the green weevil (likely Otiorhynchus sulcatus), which devastated vineyards in eastern France in the sixteenth century and was the focus of a prolonged legal process marked by repeated motions and delays (Cabral; Vital). Between the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries, major catastrophes such as storms, droughts, and fires were sometimes considered evidence of crimes—often attributed to witches in cases of so-called climate magic in Europe (Behringer).\nWith the consolidation of Cartesian realism and modern science—along with the resulting dualisms of nature–culture and mind–matter—nonhumans came to be regarded as more or less inert objects. However, this idea is now being significantly challenged by the growing prominence of nonhumans in the context of climate change and the environmental crisis, where they increasingly appear as intruders acting across various spheres of social life. A heightened awareness of existential risks related to the environmental crisis is also linked to the rise of the environmental movement in the 1960s and 1970s, which employed apocalyptic rhetoric to warn against the damage being inflicted on the planet. Thus, in general terms, there is a diffuse yet persistent conception that nonhuman events—whether climatic, pandemic, or otherwise—can exert radical and far-reaching transformations on human life and its institutions (Lundberg; Vital; Das).\nThe intrusion of nonhuman things, elements, and animals has been understood as having a contingent character in itself, presenting varying intensities and degrees of impact in the way they affect humans, nonhumans, and institutions—including legal institutions (Grear). In Tender Is the Flesh, this issue is explored through the impact of a highly mutagenic virus on laws, which are changed to adapt the legal system to a new reality in which animal flesh is no longer available for consumption. The law thus becomes a tool for regulating what is unacceptable in the universe of readers, but which becomes justice in a future social world still clinging to a past dissolved by the force of a hypothetical pandemic.\nThis transformation of laws, however, does not originate with power groups but emerges from the bottom of society. The situation resembles cases of climate witchcraft from the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries, when the Little Ice Age led populations to hunt witches—blamed for severe storms and droughts—shaping intellectual, religious, and legal debates over the validity of such practices. Cannibalism in Tender Is the Flesh begins among the lower classes. Reports of people secretly killing others for food began appearing in the media following the ban on animal meat sales, until the food industry saw an opportunity and pressured governments to legalise the breeding and slaughter of humans. Immigrants, the poor, and other marginalised populations became the main victims. However, the subsequent decrease in population, poverty, and meat prices was propagandised and, over time, came to be viewed positively—especially by the global elites.\nThis is the continuation of necropolitics—a management of symbolic and real death aimed at maintaining the lives of privileged populations (Mbembe). However, this politics of death is elevated to another level in response to the vicissitudes of the pandemic. The process of legalising cannibalism, in turn, is shaped by a technical and neutral language regulated by laws, serving to normalise horror, erase the humanity of the victims, and conceal violence behind legal and sanitary terminology. At the beginning of the book, the prohibition of certain words when referring to the practice and to the people sent to slaughter is emphasised, as “there are words that cover up the world. There are words that are convenient, hygienic. Legal” (Bazterrica 1).\nThe law thus becomes an instrument in service of cultural and economic continuity amid disruptive transformations, engendering a sanitisation and naturalisation of horror. The character Marcos Tejo, an employee at the Krieg meatpacking plant, reflects on the role law plays in this post-apocalyptic universe. Humans raised for slaughter cannot be called humans—under penalty of imprisonment or even being “processed” at the Municipal Slaughterhouse—because such a designation would grant them an identity. In this context, “meat processing” replaces prohibited terms like “death penalty” and “murder”. Cannibalism, of course, is also a word forbidden by law. In the slaughterhouses, technical vocabulary is used to refer to the humans being killed: “production”, “meat”, “food”, “heads to be processed”. Meanwhile, the media, commerce, and government refer to these humans as “special meat”.\nSpectral Tropicality and the Law\nAll the disruptive transformations and attempts to control the situation through law take place in a permanently sweltering environment, punctuated by heat, heavy rain, and sweat dripping from the characters’ faces. The control established by law in Tender Is the Flesh is forged in the wake of the GGB virus, but tropicality remains at all times an intruder—at once familiar and strange—, a hostile spectre that surrounds the characters throughout the narrative. The effort to maintain a fantasy universe in which people continue to eat meat—now human meat, de-characterised and transformed into “special” animal meat—coexists with the virus as a shadow of what broke with previous eating patterns. At the same time, it is immersed in a tropicality that ebbs and flows throughout the narrative. These signs of tropicality function as a tomb of human control over the world, pushing the fantasy of mastery over oneself and the planet to extremes by conceiving of a diet based on cannibalism, conceptually disguised through legal control.   \nThe hypothesis is that the constant presence of signs of tropicality does not occur by chance, just as it is not coincidental that an outbreak of a devastating disease in Africa acquires significant media traction in a short span of time. It is now understood that tropical and subtropical ecosystems—subject to agricultural expansion, biodiversity loss, wildlife trade, and climate change—are the areas most at risk for the spillover and mutation of pathogens, leading to more frequent outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics (Vora et al.). These data reinforce the image of the tropics as regions not fully subject to human control, where efforts to dominate may instead trigger disease processes that spill over from the tropical zone to the entire planet, rendering it hostile, uncontrollable, and potentially uninhabitable. This represents an expansion of tropicality which, once seen as the tomb of the white man, could now become the tomb of all humanity.\nThis is where resistance emerges—centered on abstraction and the maintenance of the fantasy of human control over the world by preserving old patterns of consumption and meat production. The critique of law in Bazterrica’s work is directly linked to the preservation of the illusion of power over oneself and the world, laying the groundwork for the protection of former ruling classes while discarding vulnerable groups—ultimately “feeding” on them. There is a metaphorical questioning here of an apocalypse that does not necessarily entail the end of capitalism, patriarchy, or systems of consumption, production, and power. The book invites readers to reflect on the plasticity of legal systems, in which universal ethical principles can be easily discarded, and to question the extent to which legal norms reflect justice or, conversely, are complicit in oppressive systems. Above all, it expresses diffuse anxieties about law and human institutions in a material, insidious universe—one that manifests as a completely indifferent spectre threatening human yearnings for permanence, control, and justice.\nReferences\nBazterrica, Agustina.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Grey Wardens, Blights, and Staying Vigilant\nBodies are porous and under threat of mutation for both Grey Wardens and the darkspawn they fight in BioWare’s fantasy role-playing videogame series Dragon Age (2009-2024). If they survive the Joining Ritual, Grey Wardens become abject figures, poised in the liminal space between ‘us’ and ‘not us’. Since the Joining forges a connection to darkspawn that will also, inevitably, eventually, mutate them into a blighted creature themselves, Grey Wardens exist in a tremendously Gothic state of becoming. On the other side of this binary are the darkspawn, transgressive entities first introduced as scurrying and bipedal. Eventually, however, the player can encounter figures of horrifying maternal abjection when they meet the darkspawn Broodmother in the Deep Roads. This end-point of corruption is pushed further in the confronting grotesquerie of antagonist Ghilan’nain, a monstrously mutated creator/mother who sculpts the Blight itself.\nThe series introduces the Grey Wardens in the first game, Origins (2009), in which the player character – by something approximating a choice or else kicking and screaming against destiny – must be initiated into their secretive ranks in the opening hours of play. Essentially, they are an order dedicated to keeping the world-threatening peril of the Blight at bay. Spilling up from under the earth, the Blight functions as an eco-gothic threat that can infect and mutate land, water, and people. Sickening crops and poisoning water, the Blight is very much the catastrophic environmental change defined by Smith and Hughes in their seminal discussions of the eco-gothic (5-6). Moreover, the Blight reflects “the non-human ecology rendered uncanny, monstrous” in the changes wrought by its contagious spread (Pinder, para. 1). Thomas Fahy argues that this change, this “preoccupation with hybridity” acts as a recurring motif of the eco-gothic as a mode (3). The fourth game, The Veilguard (2024), is particularly striking in this sense – whole swathes of snowy countryside bubble with blight pools and are encircled by pulsing, blood-heavy tendrils that erupt through the soil, the landscape’s “permeability” made monstrous (Edwards et al., xiv). It is also, crucially, usually dormant – the Grey Wardens, therefore, remain vigilant for decades at a time until they are needed, and until the Blight returns to haunt the landscape. Darkspawn accompany the Blights, monstrous entities that are very much in line with Noël Carroll’s useful framing of “fusion” figures, or monsters that are “amalgams”, that disrupt attempts at categorisation (137). They are recognisably humanoid for the most part, but also consistently skewed or ‘off’ – they move oddly, or appear to have mutated patches of skin or uneven flesh, or they wear armour, but it is positioned strangely on their frames, or their limbs are elongated in a way that feels incorrect. Markedly, they do not speak (with some significant exceptions to be underlined later).\nWhile the games broadly draw from classic dark fantasy and Medievalism in equal measure, there is a seam of the Gothic running through them a mile wide, thoroughly exemplified in the darkspawn and the cycles of creeping Blights. Some of the homages are blunt: Ferelden, the nation the player character explores in Origins, is an on-the-nose stand-in for Middle Ages England, complete with wretched weather and a nationalistic love of dogs, along with a long-standing historical feud with neighbouring Orlais, which is France with a few names changed to protect the guilty. Both Dragon Age 2 (2011) and the third game, Dragon Age: Inquisition (2014), do not allow the player to role-play as a Warden. Instead, they tick companion boxes in both. Interestingly, though, the Inquisition’s Warden, Blackwall, is masquerading as a Warden, though he can become one properly later – a secret that the player can guess, though the player character is ignorant of it. They are also the focus of the first game’s expansion, Awakening, and also feature in a host of transmedial connected texts including – but not limited to – short stories, novels such as The Calling, and graphic novels published through Dark Star Digital.\nIn looking at the mutations of the Blight, and the way this is connected inexorably to the Grey Wardens themselves, the focus here will be the first and then the most recent of the games, Origins and Veilguard respectively, since these are the two that force (in Origins’ case) or allow the player to choose (Veilguard) to be a Grey Warden.\nFig. 1: The blighted village of D’Meta’s Crossing. Dragon Age: The Veilguard (2024). Screenshot by author.\n“Join us in the shadows, brothers and sisters”: Grey Warden Secrets\nAs far as monster-hunting secret(ive) societies go, the Grey Wardens beg and borrow most blatantly from Andrzej Sapowski’s Witcher books (and arguably CD Projekt Red’s video game adaptations of the same) and George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire series. Like the former, the Grey Wardens engage with dark magic in order to gain powers that allow them to fight monsters. Similarly, akin to the Night’s Watch and their position as steadfast sentinels, the Grey Wardens vow “in peace, vigilance”, “in death, sacrifice” in their roles as watchers (Origins). A point of difference, however, beyond the initial intertextual referencing at play here, can be found in the manner by which their ranks are initiated.\nThe Joining ritual is not easily survivable – Alistair, one of the companions, notes that “in my Joining, only one of us died. But it was … horrible” (Origins, see fig. 2). Of the two other non-player-characters who are also present at the ritual, Daveth succumbs to death almost immediately after drinking from the chalice. In an unsubtle but decently presented display of the game world’s dark ‘sting in the tail’ narrative approach, the other, Jory, refuses to drink upon witnessing this, and is summarily executed by the senior Warden present in order to keep Warden secrets safe. The games are not shy on the consequences of blighted mutation if the afflicted person does not become a Warden, which is occasionally pointed out as a stopgap cure of sorts. Veilguard’s Antoine and Evka, for instance, are found to a little too frequently accept ‘new recruits’ for the Wardens in the Anderfels in order to help locals who have encountered darkspawn. Instead, they are shunted through the Joining, and then never really expected to become fighters. On the other side of such encounters, the lost dwarf Ruck shies away from torch lights and has lost most of his mind, his skin grey and on the way to rotting; the infected elf Tamlen can ambush the party camp, unrecognisable in his monstrosity, mutated almost entirely into a darkspawn; and an optional player character origin can find themself in need of even more speedy an initiation into the Wardens, since they have had the bad luck to be infected by darkspawn corruption.\nFig. 2: The player character (centre of group) as she is about to be initiated through the Joining. Dragon Age: Origins (2009). Screenshot by author.\nCrucially, the ritual involves the drinking – the ingestion – of darkspawn blood in a gambit that plays almost like a bleak riff on vaccination. If they survive, they will not succumb swiftly to the darkspawn infection if it is passed into their mouth or eyes during combat. This, the player character soon learns, is also the manner by which they will, as a Warden, be able to sense the darkspawn – a connection that both helps but also represents the eventual cost of the Joining. In ingesting darkspawn blood, the process of mutation is slowed – stretched out to maybe thirty years at best – but not halted, and always present. Grey Wardens, therefore, are abject figures that collapse the border between ‘us’ and ‘not us’. The threat of corruption, “death infecting life”, as Julia Kristeva puts it, cannot however in this case be “thrust aside in order to live” (3). Instead, Grey Wardens exist in a corrupted and most Gothic state of mutated becoming. They are adrift amid “indeterminacy and estrangement from one’s own body” (Aldana Reyes 54). So frequently does the Gothic return to the notion of “the coexistence of life and death”, and here, this hybridity is found in the mutating body of the Warden themself (Cavallaro 201).\nIn the game world, this presents in the way Wardens can sense or ‘hear’ darkspawn; in how they, as they grow older, will have terrible, sense-corroding dreams; in how, for some years, they are immune to the blight. It also damns them to their Calling – that point-of-no-return at which individual Wardens find their thoughts overwhelmed by the “song” of the darkspawn, and ritualistically head for the Deep Roads beneath the earth (Origins). While Alistair, optimistic as they come, suggests that this is so the Warden might take out as many darkspawn as they can in combat before being killed in return, it is far easier to read something much darker at work here. In taking themselves into the deep darkness, the hypothetical Grey Warden’s Calling with all its eventual corrupting mutation into a darkspawn necessarily happens out of sight. Interestingly, in her response to Julia Kristeva’s work, Barbara Creed argues for the way social rituals address the abject: that, essentially, “societies both renew their initial contact with the abject element and then exclude that element” (“Monstrous-Feminine” 212). By contrast, the Grey Wardens occupy again that liminal space within which they make that contact and then enshrine it within themselves; no exclusion is permitted. Elizabeth Stang argues for the Grey Wardens here as representing the “normative … order”, as standing in for the heroic and non-monstrous figure opposing the ‘other’, the hero ready to save the land (237). However, this reading softens – or even arguably ignores – the position of the Grey Wardens as part of the horrors they fight.\nTransformations: The Broodmother under the Surface of Origins\nThe Gothic centrepiece of the Deep Roads sequence in Origins is the player’s encounter with the mutated Broodmother. Deep below the earth, where the darkspawn dwell in horrifying number, the player must work their way through a labyrinth of shadows, corrupted monsters, and the remains of those unlucky enough to have travelled through prior. Catherine Spooner argues that “while Gothic and the grotesque are not reducible to one another, they occupy a similar ... space”, and that is certainly true here (129). The game’s “environmental storytelling” here hinges upon immersion in a Gothic warren that is deliberately designed to be frustrating and horrifying in equal measure – each explored section takes the player and their party further from re-supplying, further from ‘turn-back’ points on the map, further from the daylight far above (Jenkins 122). As Stang discusses in her examination of the Broodmother as the monstrous-feminine, the player’s encounter here is “rife with abject symbolism” (239). Depicted as a monstrously mutated hybrid with multiple pendulous breasts, surrounded by ground that seems more like pulsing flesh, and attended to by darkspawn, the Broodmother is clearly signified as something-that-births. The Broodmother is deeply, confrontingly abject – the mutated maternal figure that is still reproducing, her “generative power” rendered all the more monstrous that it does not seem to need male input (Kristeva 16). As Shohini Chaudhuri frames it, this is a version of the mother of/in abjection, “a parthenogenetic mother, creating all by herself, without need for a father” (95). The lead-up to this encounter is rendered all the more unsettlingly Gothic by Hespith’s explanation of the process of blighted mutation, and how this version of it is horrifyingly different to any form of corruption the player has seen on the surface so far:\n\nthe men, [the darkspawn] kill… They’re merciful. But the women, they want. They want to touch, to mold, to change until you are filled with them. They took Laryn. They made her eat the others, our friends. She tore off her husband’s face and drank his blood. And while she ate, she grew. She swelled and turned gray and she smelled like them. They remade her in their image. Then she made more of them. Broodmother. (Origins)\n\nAs Stang notes, the Broodmother is “particularly excessive” in her mutation – this is not the alteration that Tamlen undergoes into a darkspawn ghoul, for instance, in which he still resembles his former self in frame, build, appearance, and so on (240). It is also, strikingly, not the same sort of transformation that Isseya, Veilguard’s impossibly long-lived former Warden mage undergoes (see fig. 3). While Isseya is visibly corrupted, and arguably occupies a similar ‘abject mother’ role – and indeed, she refers to herself as the mother of the griffons she steals – her transformation is one that is designed around a grotesque skeletal appearance that does not immediately infer femininity.\n\nFig. 3: Isseya, the former Warden mage. Dragon Age: The Veilguard (2024). Screenshot by author.\nBy staggering contrast, the Broodmother’s is one that emphasises fleshiness, corporeality, and the reproductive outcome of the transformation (see fig. 4). Stang reads this transformation as inherently problematic in its reliance on the endpoint of the transformation being a corrupted form of maternity (240). In enduring her mutation – in this case, from dwarven explorer to corrupted darkspawn – the Broodmother also loses her voice, and is rendered all the more bestial. Enshrined amid wetness – the floor seems to be unstable, as if it too has become flesh-like – and reached by traversing a dripping tunnel, the Broodmother here is Creed’s “archaic mother” (Monstrous Feminine 18, also cited in Stang 239). This mutated maternity is also of course, horrifyingly, a possible future that awaits female Wardens in pursuit of their Calling.\nFig. 4: The Broodmother in combat. Dragon Age: Origins (2009). Screenshot by author.\nSculptings: Ghilan’nain’s Bodily Excesses and Experiments in Veilguard\nA primary antagonist, Ghilan’nain’s design at first calls to mind the monstrosities of cosmic horror. She is tentacled, several metres long (or tall, depending on how she arranges herself), and her upper body comprises two sutured-together torsos (see figs. 5 and 6). Her face, mostly hidden behind a vast mask, gives away only that her eyes are no longer eyes – she appears instead to have boils on one side and teeth beneath the eyelid on the other. Nonetheless, like the Broodmother, she is very much a monster whose monstrosity depends upon her femininity – she speaks in the language of creation, and is known as the “Mother of the Halla” before later revelations unveil her true proclivities and she is referred to as a goddess (Origins). Jane Caputi posits that “patriarchal representations of goddesses are confined to images of fertility, nurturance, and sexual receptivity”, and that once they breach this, they become monsters instead (157). Ghilan’nain can certainly be read this way – she shifts from a caring, deified figure in in-game myth who creates and shepherds the first halla (elven deer, essentially) to a grotesquely mutated tyrant when she emerges in Veilguard.\nFig. 5: Ghilan’nain, one of the last remaining Evanuris, lifting up the First Warden and threatening to use his body as fuel for her blight experiments. Dragon Age: The Veilguard (2024). Screenshot by author.\nShe also has one tentacle firmly in the ‘mad scientist’ camp – a grotesque inventor playing with malleable, fleshy toys, with which she creates, reworks, and rebirths darkspawn and dragons with a fondness for vivisection that would impress H.G. Wells’s Doctor Moreau. Tellingly, the player character at one point encounters her works in a “laboratory”, an odd term for the game’s usually more overt Middle Ages setting. It is also here that a past version of herself – a ghost, essentially, a haunting echo – confidently claims, “all that I am belongs to the pursuit of creation. You chose to constrain yourself. I must climb to the heights only understood by gods” (Veilguard). The visual difference in Ghilan’nain herself here is also striking – this past self is missing the tentacles and the added torso, which are heavily implied to have been added through a form of self-surgery. In her work on developing a working definition of the ‘medical gothic’, Laura Kremmel argues that this can be found in “bones and blood”, in “the body’s own viscera”, very much the manner through which Ghilan’nain plans and plots her experiments (21). Like the Gothic itself, Ghilan’nain “knows the body ... knows about physical fragility, about vulnerability”, and her knowledge is turned to monstrous ends (Punter 171). Unlike other blighted monstrous figures, Ghilan’nain maintains control through her ferocious fixation upon experimentation, in which she attempts to turn the mutating presence of the blight into a form of scientific apparatus. Veilguard locates this threat – control over mutation and over the blight – as disorientingly shocking. Following a disastrous encounter with Ghilan’nain at the Grey Wardens’s fortress (see fig. 6), a non-Warden companion points out angrily that “the blight runs in [Wardens’] veins … the same blight that Ghilan’nain commands so effortlessly” (Veilguard 2024). Most strikingly, unlike the Broodmother, however – heretofore Dragon Age’s most pre-eminent female monster – Ghilan’nain is unconstrained, in control of her faculties, creator, not part of the created. For her, the abject filth and flesh of the blight is a tool to be used, rather than something under or through which she is imprisoned.\nFig. 6: Ghilan’nain at Weisshaupt, the fortress headquarters of the Grey Wardens. Dragon Age: The Veilguard (2024). Screenshot by author.\n“In Death, Sacrifice”: Some Final Thoughts\nDragon Age games have something of a reputation for tragic endings – or at least, for the possibility of a tragic sting in the tail. In Origins, for instance, it is surprisingly easy to end up with a conclusion that shows the player’s Grey Warden (or Alistair, via a slightly different set of circumstances and choices) stepping wholeheartedly into the “in death, sacrifice” part of their order’s motto. Tanya Krzywinska suggests that many Gothic games waver in their denouement – that what might be termed the game problem of needing a positive or uplifting “winning solution” for the player can smooth out the genre’s inclinations toward the opposite (16). Strikingly though, even if the player sidesteps or schemes their way out of Origins’ still-infamous “sacrifice” ending, the player’s Grey Warden will still, in the imagined narrative space after the credits roll, go on to become a ghoul, to disintegrate into a darkspawn, to find their Calling deep under the earth. Similarly, for the Grey Warden version of Rook, Veilguard’s player character, if they survive the final showdown in Minrathous, they are similarly doomed beyond the game’s brief epilogue. This is an ending that is strikingly Gothic in its insistent corporeality, since the Gothic is, after all, “experienced in the flesh, in its surfaces and crevices” (Aldana Reyes 50). Both possible Wardens here may also be women, which renders their fate the more troubling, since in Dragon Age’s world, the worst, the most abhorrently different of the darkspawn are or have been women before undergoing mutation. As Marie Mulvey-Roberts observes, “monstrosity has been regarded as quintessential to the construction of femininity” (106). For female Grey Wardens, femininity becomes the devastating lynchpin upon which their eventual descent into monstrosity turns. Subjectivity is ultimately at stake once their Calling begins, and that tenuous balance between ‘us’ and ‘not us’ collapses. As Elizabeth Gross argues, the abject – in this case the ingested darkspawn blood – must be kept “at a distance in order [that the subject] define itself as a subject” (87). For the Grey Wardens, the becoming will eventually, inexorably become the became, as the mutating corruption pulls them across to the monstrous side of the binary.\nReferences\nAldana Reyes, Xavier.

    "abstract": "Introduction\nJane Schoenbrun’s I Saw the TV Glow (ISTTVG) is a psychological science fiction/horror film which draws upon audiences’ associations between serialised television and queer identity development to ask a terrifying question: would you bury yourself alive to solve the mystery of a parallel life not yet lived? The film is an allegory for queer experiences of internalised heteronormativity and concealment in which the villain is not the typical monster of the week, but our own selves, suffocating under the mundanity of surroundings we have yet to break free from. Neon noir elements are used throughout, including dark and mysterious subject matter explored through expressionist cinematography and neon lighting, grim settings utilised to foster anxiety and paranoia, and morally ambiguous characters who embody archetypes such as the femme fatale and anti-hero. Neon noir as a framing device is simultaneously immersive and subversive, engrossing the audience in something familiar, while warping it until it feels unequivocally queer and immeasurably horrific. It trades the neon lights of the city for those of television sets and makes its setting the suburbs, acknowledging that it is the typicality of high school gymnasiums that feels dangerous to queer people, not back alleys. The overall dreamlike quality of queer temporality tells us “there is still time”, while constantly reminding us that time is running out. The femme fatale does not tempt the protagonist with her feminine wiles but with the allure of the protagonist’s own, suppressed femininity. The protagonist then is not an anti-hero due to physical violence enacted towards others, but for emotional violence enacted towards the self. This article explores neon noir as a major device in ISTTVG through cinematography, setting, and character, and explains the connection between noir’s broader roots in the Hays Code and the evolution of the trope ‘bury your gays’.\nNoir and Queer Storytelling \nTo understand noir’s usage in ISTTVG, it is necessary to first understand the shared histories of noir and queer storytelling, with “queer” used for the purposes of this article as a broad umbrella under which all non-heteronormative sexualities and genders are encapsulated. Noir as a genre originated in the United States shortly following the establishment of the Hollywood Production Code, colloquially known as the Hays Code (Smith). The Hays Code placed several prohibitions on depictions of queerness, and sexuality in general, forcing queer storytelling in Hollywood-produced media to become subtextual (Russo 31) or coded (Hulan 17). This was something noir storytelling embraced. Noir, after all, has been described as paranoia put to screen (Gürkan 17), and sometimes it is what audiences do not see which stokes their deepest, underlying fears, thus achieving consternation through imagination (Smith).\nParanoia during the time of the Hays Code was also something audiences already had in spades. While classic noir, like all media of the time, was inarguably influenced by the Hays Code (Pavés 360), it is also inseparable from post-World War II anxieties about morality and social change (Gürkan 17).\nNoir has many definitions; however, the original noir films of the 1940s and 1950s are typically recognised by their expressionistic depictions of that which was considered at the time to be socially deviant but potentially alluring (Gürkan 20). Noir films served as cautionary tales, especially about the dangerous temptation of urban life (Gürkan 20). Noir thus adhered to the Hays Code by depicting ‘deviant’ characters facing major consequences for their actions, including death (Smith). For queer characters, this often meant punishment for simply being queer (Hulan 21). While more complex and nuanced depictions of queer characters were certainly attempted in classic noir films, these attempts were routinely rejected by censors, either heavily edited or outright repudiated by the Production Code Administration responsible for upholding the Hays Code (Pavés 370).\nThis trend of punishing queer characters, especially by death, simply for being queer has continued well beyond the Hays Code (Hulan 21), which ended in 1968 (Rosenfeld). In fact, while a fair amount of scholarship about this trope, sometimes referred to as ‘bury your gays’, does focus on the code’s influence, the trope is older by a considerable number of years, originating in at least the late nineteenth century and still present in media to this day (Hulan 17-9). The trope more recently became part of non-academic, popular discourse, in the early twentyfirst century, following an increase in dedicated spaces for fans to discuss trends in queer media representation online, with a focus on lesbian deaths in serialised television in shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997-2003) and The 100 (2014-2020; Hulan 23-4). Noir’s successors, neo-noir and neon noir, however, have largely subverted this trope by letting the gays be the ones who hold the metaphorical shovel, enacting violence rather than only being victims of it. Examples include Bound (1996), in which women lovers stage a heist towards their shared freedom, dropping bodies in their wake, and Love Lies Bleeding (2024), in which women lovers enact similar, violent revenge before driving off to their new lives together (Smith). Another recent film, Femme (2021), pits queer characters against one another, illustrating the ways in which internalised shame sometimes causes queer people to attempt to bury one another, socially or through acts of violence (Tadeo). \nISTTVG is unique in that it is not rooted in violent revenge or repentance, but in violent liberation, requiring its protagonists to bury themselves, literally, in order to become who they truly are. ISTTVG follows teenage characters Owen (Justice Smith) and Maddy (Jack Haven) through their shared fixation on a science-fiction/horror genre television show, The Pink Opaque, which itself depicts teenage characters Isabel (Helena Howard) and Tara (Lindsey Jordan) in supernatural conflict with a seemingly ever-present villain named Mr. Melancholy (Emma Portner). The film’s first act ends with Maddy’s strange and somewhat unexplained disappearance. When she resurfaces in the second act, Maddy declares that she and Owen are, in fact, Tara and Isabela respectively. She further states that the pair were buried in separate graves by Mr. Melancholy, causing them to slowly suffocate, making the world they have been living in as Maddy and Owen a shared delusion they must escape in order to survive. Maddy/Tara tells Owen/Isabela that the only solution to their survival is self-burial, something Maddy/Tara has already undergone once. Given the seeming absurdity of self-interment, the audience and Owen are left sceptical of Maddy/Tara’s proposal, despite some evidence that she may be telling the truth. Owen ultimately decides the risk is too high, and abandons Maddy/Tara’s insistence to return to the dirt, and their other lives, leaving Maddy/Tara to complete the act alone. With an entire act still left in the film, however, the audience is reminded by a chalk scrawl across the sidewalk that “there is still time”, and the remainder of the film focusses on Owen, haunted by the possibility of Isabela, appearing to slowly suffocate into old age. The audience and Owen/Isabela never definitively learn whether Maddy/Tara’s version of reality is the correct one, but it is the uncertainty about this which is used effectively as queer allegory – that it may be scary by necessity for queer people to bury an inauthentic version of themselves and the lives they have led in the hope that something better lies beyond that ego death.\nISTTVG Cinematography \nISTTVG, like original noir, uses paranoia, especially about that which remains unseen or only partially seen, to drive its central allegory. ISTTVG, however, is better classified as a neon-noir due to its place in time (produced following the 1950s) and its specific use of neon lighting to achieve the light/dark, or dramatic chiaroscuro lighting effect that is characteristic of noir, neo-noir, and neon-noir cinematography alike (Miller). When applied specifically to science fiction and gothic fantasy, from which ISTTVG clearly draws influence, this has also been characterised as “neon-gothic” (Pop 190). Neon-noir is typically neon-lit to accentuate a foreboding or futuristic urban landscape as both setting and character, but in the technicolour of modern film as opposed to the black and white of classic noir (Miller). Other techniques such as stylised framing and camera angles are additionally used to create an immersive, “dreamlike state” which adds to audience anxieties, especially in science fiction/horror neon-noir films that tackle fears about modern or futuristic technologies (Miller). It is unsurprising that ISTTVG’s writer/director, Jane Schoenbrun, would use such techniques, as Schoenbrun has themself identified noir (Night of the Hunter 1955), neo-noir (Southland Tales 2006), and neon-noir (Blade Runner 1982) as influences on their own directorial and storytelling style.\nWhat is somewhat unique, however, about ISTTVG is its use of the television, and other technologies such as projectors and arcade games to achieve chiaroscuro and dreamlike effect that is not necessarily critical of these technologies. Typically, in neon-noir/neon-gothic films, neon lighting is used to highlight that which is fake, inauthentic, or non-human (Pop 207-8). Take, for example, the film Videodrome (1983), which also explores television as an alternate reality, but as a cautionary reality that is intended to cause unease (Thierbach-McLean 1-5), or Blade Runner (1982), with its exploration of the seemingly thin line between humanity and artificial intelligence (Pop 203). Unlike these examples, ISTTVG “validates” (Daschke 2) its audience’s draw towards TVland, recognising the comfort that queer people especially may find amidst the television’s glow and representations of queerness, especially in serialised television where parasocial relationships may be formed with characters depicted on screen. In other words, the simulacra, or imitation, of queerness as seen on television constitute a hyperreality that is the amalgamation of the real and the virtual (Baudrillard 67), which Schoenbrun paints as somewhat of an ideal. It is a contentious but sometimes safer space between and of two worlds, inextricably combined in queer collective consciousness.\nISTTVG further achieves this tension of tranquility vs. terror by playing upon millennial nostalgia, such as by paying homage to Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997-2003; Thierbach-McLean 1) or inserting time-specific imagery like the glow of a Fruitopia vending machine in a school cafeteria to create a sense of being outside of time. That feeling of living outside of linear time further encapsulates the queer experience by creating a sense of queer temporality (Seller 195), or the lived experience of queer people as being outside of heteronormative definitions of time due to the stigma placed on queer identities and relationships, which often necessitated navigating time differently. When queer temporality is applied to the transgender gaze, as it is in ISTTVG, there is additionally a sense of “appearing and disappearing, knowing and not knowing” (Judith Halberstam 77), which Schoenbrun conveys through flashes between reality and unreality without distinguishing clearly between the two. The dysphoria of this untethered state of time and space mirrors the navigation of real-world boundaries people like Owen/Isabela would likely traverse in negotiations of visibility vs. safety in a hostile society.  \nISTTVG Setting\nISTTVG’s setting is also important. Unlike other neon-noirs, ISTTVG is not based in an urban setting. This makes sense considering that urban settings tend to be more heavily associated with queer safety as opposed to queer anxieties. Instead, it is the mundanity of the suburb that feels appropriately suffocating as the audience watches Owen progressively struggle to breathe following the revelation that Owen may actually be Isabela. This makes it such that the other-worldly elements are not what elicits fear, traded instead for those which are painfully ordinary, such as sucking on an inhaler or watching an unremarkable birthday celebration in the private room of an arcade. The suburban setting, being non-descript in exact geographic location, also lends itself to increased immersive possibilities as the audience can project onto it their own experiences with any suburban setting with which they are familiar.\nOne key example of setting and cinematography blended to curate a noir-specific audience experience is during Maddy/Tara’s speech to Owen/Isabela about what it feels like to be buried alive, and to be resurrected in The Pink Opaque. The speech is set in a relatively non-descript planetarium room across which constellations are being projected. The room, like the suburban landscape the film is otherwise primarily set in, appears non-descript, the kind of room any audience member could readily recall having once been in. The lights of the projector are what then create the chiaroscuro effect, but themselves remain rather non-descript until the crescendo of the speech, at which time the full details of the constellations are filled in, creating a sense that Maddy/Tara in the climax of the speech is more fully realised. This also creates a further distance between the journeys of Maddy/Tara and Owen/Isabela, who were already depicted as being dissimilar in age and experience from the film’s start. As a result, there is a sense of fear about Owen/Isabela possibly being led astray by Maddy/Tara, while also horror at the idea that Owen/Isabela may not enact the burial, or put more simply, may not survive or thrive in metaphorical outness.\nISTTVG Character\nMaddy/Tara creates a sense of danger as a character because she retains qualities of a femme fatale, such as being alluring in her perceived deviance while also using feminine wiles (Horbury 113-5) to tempt Owen/Isabela. She, however, is not a typical femme fatale in that she is 1) actually attempting to save Owen/Isabela and 2) is not using her own femininity as a tool. Rather, Maddy/Tara appears to tempt Owen with the suppressed femininity that is Isabela. In so doing, Maddy/Tara calls upon Owen/Isabela to remember what it felt like in The Pink Opaque, a reality in which Owen/Isabela was powerful, beautiful, and happy. Thus, it is Isabela and not Maddy/Tara who ultimately haunts Owen throughout the third act of the film, as the audience is left to desperately hope that the two will become one again.\nIsabela is the embodiment of Owen’s failure to thrive, but said failure is not depicted as morally punishable so much as morally grey, consistent with queer theorists’ views of failure as a sometimes necessary, liberative counterculture, despite being painful (Jack Halberstam 146; Muñoz 27). This makes Owen/Isabela an anti-hero. Moral ambiguity, and thus anti-heroism, are key traits of most noir and neon-noir protagonists (Gürkan 20), who, like Owen/Isabela, are neither wholly right nor wrong in the context of the story. As is the lived experience of real-world queer people, Owen/Isabela’s reluctance towards burial (i.e., identity acceptance and outness) in this context can be seen as rational, albeit simultaneously tragic. While Mr. Melancholy and the unremarkableness of suburban life, as proxies for depression and complacency enabled by heteronormativity, are always looming, it is Owen/Isabela’s own private struggle with internalised stigma/fear of the unknown which serves as the film’s main antagonist and Owen/Isabela’s ultimate undoing. Put another way, “queerness is that thing that lets us feel that this world is not enough, that indeed something is missing” (Muñoz 1), and Owen is missing something without Isabela that becomes the central conflict of the film. The audience is left without a clear answer as to whether Owen eventually embraces Isabela, though it is heavily implied that the character at least realises in the final moments of the film that not doing so is, in fact, slowly killing them both.\nConclusion \nISTTVG works as a powerful allegory for the queer experience because the application of neon-noir techniques causes it to feel simultaneously familiar and outside of time, much like the feeling of compulsory heteronormativity and binary gender roles would feel familiar, emotionally and temporally, to queer audiences. The cinematography, setting, and character arcs of the film further immerse queer audiences in the familiar feeling of paranoia that comes with questioning one’s identity in the shadows of society and in plain sight of that which is otherwise mundane but not without consequence or danger. In focussing the neon of the TV’s glow, the film brings to mind queer experiences of watching other gays be buried alive for all the wrong reasons. This both harkens back to noir’s roots in Hays Code era Hollywood, while also subverting the all-too-familiar ‘bury your gays’ trope to create an experience akin to queer community, as though the audience might be able to reach through the screen and help Owen/Isabela along through shared experience, much as Maddy/Tara attempts to do.\nThe allegory is especially timely as queer audiences and filmmakers grapple with new wartime anxieties (e.g. Ukraine/Russia and Palestine/Israel conflicts), nuclear threat, global climate change, and the re-emergence of nationalism and fascism in influential parts of the world. Like Owen/Isabela, queer audiences are living outside of time, with the freedom to be depicted in media well beyond the restrictions of Hays Code era Hollywood, and yet still facing the same threats to our shared existence which have always driven noir at its core. By subverting audience expectations of the neon-noir genre, ISTTVG acts as a celebration of what is possible and a warning about what may come if we as a society do not bury realities which no longer serve us in fostering connection and safety. Like Owen/Isabela, ISTTVG’s audience is left wondering – is there still time?\nReferences\nBaudrillard, Jean. The Gulf War Did Not Take Place. Trans. and with an introduction by Paul Patton.

    "abstract": "Introduction\nMichael Gracey's Better Man (2024) presents an innovative biographical representation of British pop star Robbie Williams through a radical visual strategy—depicting its subject as a CGI primate rather than through a human actor. Filmed in Australia and partially funded by the Australian Government, the film follows a relatively standard biopic narrative tracing Williams’s trajectory from his Stoke-on-Trent childhood through his tumultuous Take That tenure to solo stardom, mapping his struggles with addiction, familial relationships, and mental health crises. What distinguishes Better Man from conventional biopics is its deliberate disruption of mimetic representation, employing technological transformation not merely as stylistic choice but as conceptual foundation.\nThis article argues that Williams's digital animalisation reconfigures the relationship between celebrity subjectivity and media representation by constructing him as an inherently Posthuman entity—simultaneously human memory and technological artefact. By rejecting the conventional biopic approach that prioritises mimetic resemblance through casting and makeup, Better Man positions itself as a meta-commentary on the constructed nature of celebrity representation, raising significant questions about identity, mediation, and the increasingly blurred boundaries between human agency and technological simulation.\nThe film's primate depiction operates across multiple registers: as technological intervention demonstrating how digital effects transform biographical representation beyond approaches seen in recent films like Elvis (2022) and Rocketman (2019); as metaphorical framework extending Williams's self-description as a \"performing monkey\" into a comprehensive visual system; and as epistemological strategy potentially creating a “virtual cuckoo”, where hyperreal representations systematically displace authentic understandings of real-world subjects (Nolan et al. 189).\nDrawing on Posthumanist theory (Haraway; Hayles; Braidotti) and contemporary approaches to celebrity construction (Turner Approaching; Marshall Power), our analysis examines three distinct yet interconnected transformations: technological mutation through digital spectacle, where Williams becomes a hybrid human-technological construct at the production level; metaphorical mutation through animalisation, where his representation is filtered through animal semiotics; and perceptual mutation through synthetic representation, where these artificial constructions cognitively reshape how audiences understand and remember Williams. Through this analytical framework, we demonstrate how Better Man serves as a critical text illuminating the increasingly unstable nature of celebrity identity in our hypermediated era, where boundaries between human and non-human, authentic and artificial, become progressively permeable.\nSynthetic Stardom: Technology, Spectacle, and the Posthuman Celebrity Mutation\nThe first mutation in Better Man transforms Williams's human identity into something distinctly Posthuman through digital intervention. Posthumanism fundamentally questions boundaries between human and non-human entities, unlike transhumanism's narrower focus on technological enhancement (Hayles 3-6). As Haraway argues in 1985 in her influential A Cyborg Manifesto, traditional divisions between human/animal, organism/machine, and physical/non-physical have collapsed into hybrid identities that challenge established ontological categories. The Posthuman subject emerges through this technological integration, characterised by \"distributed cognition\" and fluid, hybrid forms that transcend conventional human limitations (Hayles 3). Williams's digital representation exemplifies this theoretical framework, creating an identity that exists simultaneously as human memory and technological construct.\nBetter Man embraces this Posthuman mutation by representing Williams through extensive digital imagery. The film's use of motion capture visual effects facilitates this transformation, embedding and building the digital-ape-Williams within archival footage and performances (Debruge). The result is an identity explicitly composite and technologically mediated—both historically grounded and digitally mutable. This technological mutation produces a celebrity identity that exists as a digital construct, always open to reconfiguration, reflecting how information patterns can potentially detach from material embodiment to create new hybrid forms beyond more conventional means of mediated celebrity artifice (Marshall Power).\nThis technological mutation corresponds with scholarly understandings of celebrities as cultural products continuously transformed through media intervention. Celebrity is not merely an individual's accomplishment, but a discursive construction developed and sustained through media technologies and audience perceptions (Marshall Power). Williams's narrative in Better Man explicitly says the quiet part loud, demonstrating constructedness by intertwining authentic biographical events with overtly artificial spectacle. The digital techniques employed destabilise any claims to singular authenticity, positioning celebrity identity as fluid, shifting, and continuously mutating through technological reproduction. This constant mediation creates a unique relationship while simultaneously revealing the artificial constructs underlying celebrity status—a phenomenon where contemporary celebrity culture increasingly relies on technologies that obscure distinctions between original and reproduction, authenticity and artifice (Gamson 16).\nThe Spectacle, as theorised by Debord, refers to the dominance of representation and image over lived reality—an alienation where authentic experience is replaced by mediated simulations (12). Better Man literalises this Spectacle through immersive visual effects and overt aestheticisation of Williams's personal narrative. The hyperrealistic re-imaginings of his musical performances serve not merely as nostalgic evocations but as mediated representations that transform their original context. Through this Spectacle-driven narrative, Williams himself undergoes a mutation into a spectacular commodity—a persona continuously remoulded to sustain audience engagement. The film constructs a hyperreal Williams—a simulation born from the interplay of memory, technology, and narrative that mutates beyond his original human form. Debord's concept of Spectacle is particularly relevant to understanding Williams's representation because it illuminates how the film transforms biographical events into commodified visual experiences. When Williams’s mental health crises and substance abuse struggles are rendered through spectacular primate imagery, these deeply personal experiences become aesthetic objects for consumption. Better Man continues to reveal how contemporary celebrity culture functions such that “humanity continually destroys our irrational yet actually existing relationships and replaces them with a synthetic copy” (Debord 24).\nThis mutation through Spectacle finds resonance in the conception of celebrity as a public negotiation of private lives (Marshall Persona 157). The biopic's integration of synthetic visuals and cinematic fantasy, specifically the digitised depictions of Williams's public breakdowns and personal struggles, positions the Spectacle of mutation as central to contemporary celebrity narratives. Williams's identity is thus encoded within these spectacularised representations, forming a cultural object continually renegotiated and transformed through digital platforms and consumed by spectators who help create a new identity (sensu Lindemann). Yet, audiences are forced into a familiar position of “purgatory”, torn between believing the biopic and understanding the Posthuman fantasy (Marshall Persona 9)\nPosthumanist ideals of continuous adaptation and mutable embodiment characterise contemporary digital existence across society, not merely celebrity representation (Braidotti 64-67). While digital persistence now constitutes a fundamental condition of networked life, Better Man dramatises and commodifies this universal phenomenon through Williams’s spectacular transformations. His digital mutations throughout the film represent not ontologically unique experiences but commercially intensified versions of everyday digital persistence. The film's technological spectacle presents Williams transcending temporal boundaries through synthetic reproduction, yet this transcendence reflects an amplification of widely accessible digital afterlives rather than an exclusive privilege of fame. Contemporary visual technologies enable digital persistence where individuals exist perpetually in mediated forms, with celebrities like Williams representing the hyperbolic, high-production extreme on this continuum (Levitt 20-21). The digital Williams exemplifies not exceptional immortality but accelerated mutation—a mediated identity unbound from biology, infinitely reproducible and adaptable, distinguished primarily through its cultural visibility, circulation power, and commercial potential rather than its fundamental technological nature. His digital persistence differs from ordinary digital traces primarily in scale and deliberate construction rather than in kind.\nBeastly Fame: Mutation through the Animal-Human Divide\nThe second mutation evident in Better Man operates through a remarkable cinematic choice—the literal depiction of Robbie Williams as a CGI primate rather than using a human actor. This is not merely metaphorical but an actual representational strategy wherein Williams's celebrity identity undergoes literal animalisation within established semiotic systems. Animal representation functions as a powerful signifier within semiotic systems (de Saussure 65-70), where the relationship between signifier (the primate image) and signified (Williams's celebrity identity) creates meaning through cultural convention rather than inherent connection. As Barthes demonstrates in his analysis of cultural mythology, these signifiers carry connotations that extend beyond literal meaning to invoke broader cultural narratives and ideological frameworks (133-152). The monkey/ape imagery carries deliberate symbolic weight accumulated through cultural narratives. The film's approach originated from Williams’s frequent reference to himself as a \"performing monkey\" and a desire to approach yet another music biopic through \"a different lens\" (Paterson). However, the implications extend far beyond this initial inspiration, raising questions about how the film deploys this potent symbolism. As one online review noted, “like, I was aware that the character had the face of a chimpanzee, but he was also cheeky, charming and charismatic — like Williams” (Watson). This suggests the animalisation functions partly to capture perceived personality traits, potentially simplifying Williams into easily digestible characteristics associated with performing primates – charm, cheekiness, perhaps even an animalistic lack of agency. Regardless of directorial intent, these animal signifiers establish mediated metaphorical frameworks through which the audience processes celebrity identity separate from the actual person (Nolan et al.).\nThis literal transformation creates a layered representation where Williams exists simultaneously as a human celebrity and an animal figure. By depicting him as a less evolved primate, the film invokes deeply rooted cultural associations—performance, imitation, vulnerability, aggression, and primitive drives—that can reshape how viewers perceive his humanity and interpret his identity and story, focussing on spectacle and simplified metaphor over nuanced personhood.\nThe animalisation of Williams connects to Haraway’s concept of \"simian orientalism\", where primates have historically functioned as boundary objects between nature and culture, serving as mirrors through which humans define themselves (10-15). In Better Man, this boundary-crossing representation positions Williams as neither fully human nor fully animal, but as a mutated, hybrid figure that challenges conventional categories. This hybridity is particularly significant in the context of celebrity culture, where stars have traditionally functioned as idealised human specimens rather than cross-species constructs (Keswani). By rendering Williams as a primate, the film disrupts this tradition, suggesting that contemporary celebrity increasingly operates through Posthuman transformations that transcend biological categories while simultaneously reinforcing the myth of primates.\nWilliams’s animalisation represents one point along a spectrum of human-animal hybridities that includes subcultural practices like furry fandom (Bernstein et al.) and digital transformations like Posthuman holographic animal filters in Years and Years (Lewis). These phenomena share a cultural preoccupation with boundaries between human and animal identities, though they manifest through different contexts and purposes. Furry communities participate in Posthuman identity expression through deliberate community-building and self-expression (Bernstein et al.), while Better Man employs animalisation as a narrative technique within commercial filmmaking (Paterson). The distinction highlights how similar Posthuman imagery operates differently: identity exploration versus biographical storytelling.\nThe animalisation in Better Man reflects broader patterns where the celebrity becomes a cultural text open to transformation (Turner Approaching). The animal body becomes a site where celebrity identity is mediated through established cultural symbolism. This transformation risks creating a “virtual cuckoo”, where such hyperreal representations ultimately displace authentic understanding (Nolan et al. 189). The celebrity-as-animal representation infiltrates cultural consciousness as a Posthuman spectacle, potentially overtaking genuine comprehension of the human. Importantly, this process operates regardless of whether the film itself fully recognises the complex semiotic system it employs, or the subsequent displacement of truth.\nSimulated Celebrity: Epistemological Displacement and Hyperreality\nThe third major transformative mutation in Better Man operates through epistemological displacement, a process whereby artificially enhanced representations fundamentally alter the conditions through which audiences understand Williams’s celebrity identity. This transformation differs from both technological mutation and metaphorical framing as it concerns not merely representation but the cognitive frameworks through which Williams’s identity exists in the cultural imagination.\nThis transformation operates through a process of simulation where representations generate their own reality detached from their origin (Baudrillard 1-7). A virtual cuckoo displaces authentic understanding by manipulating human-focussed supernormal stimuli using synthetic representations (Nolan et al.189). Like the cuckoo laying eggs in another bird's nest, these hyperreal representations infiltrate cultural consciousness, ultimately shaping public perception more powerfully than direct engagement with the original subject.\nWilliams’s digital primate functions as a powerful mnemonic device that becomes a dominant framework through which audiences process his biographical narrative. This effect extends beyond visual novelty to fundamentally reconfigure how his celebrity identity is constructed, circulated, and consumed. By rendering him in Posthuman form, the film simultaneously claims to reveal essential truths about his experience while acknowledging the constructed nature of all celebrity representation.\nThe \"celebrity-commodity\" circulates independently of the actual person, reshaping cultural understanding as an elaborate sign system continuously reframed and reinterpreted by a changing cultural landscape (Turner Economy 193; Marshall Persona). In Better Man, past, present, and imagined versions of Williams coexist and commingle, characteristic of postmodern temporalities (Jameson). This collapse of linear temporality through technological transformation enables the film to function across multiple cultural registers, inserting its synthetic vision into ongoing discourses about Williams’s legacy. Biopics typically evoke sympathy (Smith Jr. 227), and the CGI Williams uses the extant semiotic systems to shorthand many of the stimuli necessary for eliciting desired emotions, all filtered through animal representation. This memorable abstraction risks overshadowing more complex realities of embodied celebrity (and animal) subjectivities.\nBy literalising the myth of Williams’s self-described \"performing monkey\" identity (Watson), Better Man deliberately exposes the manufactured nature of celebrity representation through its conspicuous artifice. This visual approach employs a form of selective transparency, acknowledging fictional components precisely to reinforce the perceived truthfulness of its unacknowledged constructions. Rather than undermining the film's truth claims, this partial disclosure strengthens audience trust in the narrative's unforegrounded elements. The biopic thus exemplifies how \"mythology is camouflaged with abstractions\" such as celebrity, truth, and biopic authenticity (Rothwell 170), using transparent fiction to construct a more compelling impression of authenticity.\nThe manipulation of truth claims reflects a contemporary understanding of identity construction. For public figures especially, identity manifests not as a stable essence but as a networked assemblage—a dynamic configuration emerging from countless connections, portrayals, disclosures, and interpretations (Braidotti 69; Lindemann). Within this framework, personal identity operates fundamentally as a \"social practice\" rather than an intrinsic property, continuously negotiated through interactions with others and cultural frameworks (Lindemann 222-223).\nBetter Man thus intervenes directly in this assemblage, inserting a visually arresting component that reconfigures Williams’s public persona by transforming how audiences perceive, remember, and integrate his biographical narrative into cultural memory. This cinematic representation becomes another node potentially reshaping his cultural legacy through its mediated contribution. Williams’s engagement with this technological mutation demonstrates his participation in the Posthuman construction of his celebrity identity. Rather than merely being subjected to transformation, Williams becomes an agent in his own mutation, collaborating in creating a Posthuman version transcending conventional biographical representation. This collaboration highlights how contemporary celebrity increasingly functions through \"intercommunication\" between public persona and private self, where technological mediation does not simply obscure authenticity but fundamentally reconstitutes its meaning in a hypermediated context (Marshall Persona 39).\nConclusion\nBetter Man reconstructs celebrity identity through its radical visual mutation strategy. By transforming Williams into a digital primate, the film exposes the fundamentally unstable nature of contemporary fame, creating a representation that exists simultaneously as human narrative, technological simulation, and cultural symbol.\nThis mutation operates across three critical dimensions that collectively transform our understanding of celebrity: technologically, Williams becomes a Posthuman hybrid through digital spectacle; metaphorically, his animalisation reconfigures how audiences interpret his experiences through established primate symbolism; and perceptually, synthetic representation reshapes cognitive frameworks through which we comprehend his identity. These interconnected transformations reveal how contemporary celebrity functions not as fixed essence but as perpetually mutable form, continually reconfigured through technological mediation.\nGracey's animalisation strategy serves dual purposes with significant implications: while effectively visualising fame's dehumanising aspects, it simultaneously risks reducing Williams's complex personhood to simplified animal drives. This tension demonstrates how Posthuman celebrity representation inherently involves trade-offs between conceptual clarity and biographical complexity. The film ultimately distinguishes itself not through its biographical content but through its formal demonstration of celebrity as ongoing mutation—fame operating through technological intervention that transforms human subjects into cultural commodities while paradoxically claiming to reveal authentic essence.\nBetter Man thus provides critical evidence of our evolving relationship with identity itself—neither fully embodied nor entirely virtual, but continuously mutable and technologically mediated. Through Williams’s digital transformation, we witness contemporary identity operating through processes of constant technological manipulation that transcend embodied reality. Irrespective of reality, one can always be a better man.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Ashleigh Prosser, Kirstin Mills, and Lorna Piatti-Farnell for their editorial oversight, and the anonymous reviewers whose feedback considerably improved our argument and theoretical clarity.

    "abstract": "Introduction\nAn ecologically responsive parable about biological mutation in a post-apocalyptic environment, David Cronenberg’s Crimes of the Future (2022) was hailed on release as a “dream-noir” (Ehrlich), a “sci-fi noir” (Oller), and a “body-noir” (“Crimes”). The use of the term ‘noir’ here is enigmatic. As is often the case, the term is deployed to address a quality that otherwise resists easy identification. Noir has, of course, acquired a multitude of connotations and aesthetic legacies over the years. As I have observed elsewhere, one of those legacies is a concern with the physicality of the human body, and, somewhat gnomically, with the body in states of passivity and suspension that are, deceptively, also vivid states of transition and potency (Killeen 10). Cronenberg’s examination of such passivity in Crimes of the Future is at the heart of the film’s deft concoction of post-humanist paranoia, ecological horror, and noir aesthetics. As such, my study will observe the ways Cronenberg elegantly steeps his narrative of transhumanist and evolutionary mutation in a distinctive noir iconography of the human body in states of stillness and ‘taking place’. Significantly, this body is framed, too, in a familiar noir environment: liminal spaces of ruin, dereliction, and terrain vague. In addition, I will also discuss the film’s distrust of the hermeneutical violence often performed by depth models of metaphysical ‘meaning’, and its celebration of the redemptive force of the body via its material capacities for transformation.\n1\nNoir is an aesthetic category that long ago transcended cinema. Its chiaroscuro visuals, rich and versatile iconographies, weird psychologies, eroticised metaphysics, and fugal, oneiric atmospheres have migrated to everything from cosmetics to video games, becoming a “noir mediascape” that circulates through “all the information technologies” (Naremore 255). This is appropriate. From the outset, the classic cycle of film noir (1939-1955) proved itself a narrative and stylistic category which fundamentally relied on principles of formal hybridisation. Many scholars, among them Slavoj Žižek, have identified the sense in which film noir itself was never a genre per se but rather an “anamorphic distortion affecting different genres” (Žižek 9), a mutative aesthetic transforming any genre it encountered.\nAs a filmmaker fascinated by mutative operations, it is hardly surprising that David Cronenberg has recurrently invoked noir aesthetics and their concomitant affects, whether very directly (A History of Violence), more adroitly (Dead Ringers, Naked Lunch, Crash), or as a supplement to the ‘body-horror’ stylings for which he is renowned (Scanners, Videodrome, eXistenZ). In Cronenberg’s work noir provides the dark, intricate, and webbed textures within which human beings are beset, stimulated, or transformed by biological agents (viruses, insects, anatomical anomalies), technological agents (machines, instruments, media), or disciplinary agents of capitalist or statist corruption (corporations, governments, organised crime). In Crimes of the Future, Cronenberg brings this textural invocation of noir to a crescendo by linking noir specifically to the topic of ecology and materiality. In doing so, he reinforces a very contemporary articulation of so-called ‘eco-noir’.\n2\nIn recent years a number of scholars have turned to noir aesthetics to develop provocative new theories of ecology. These include works such as Michael Uhall’s Noir Materialism (2024) and Katrina Younes’s The Ecology of American Noir (2025). Significantly, both of the latter acknowledge the influence of Timothy Morton’s concept of ‘dark ecology’, wherein Morton identifies the noir protagonist as a productive metaphor for the human being’s inextricable relation to its environment: in short, a figure who discovers that their very “personhood ironically contaminates the scene” of the mystery they are probing (111). This is the ecological fate of the human: to be a live trait, a relational entity with-in an eclectic ecology in which they are ‘implicated’; not to be its romanticist observer, and certainly not its master. Morton’s dark ecology, moreover, accounts not just for so-called ‘natural’ entities within our environment, but also technological entities. Indeed, Morton’s example of the quintessential implicated noir protagonist is Harrison Ford’s Deckard in Blade Runner (Ridley Scott, 1982) who discovers himself to be one of the androids he has been tasked with eliminating.\nMorton’s conception of a ‘dark ecology’ is broadly consistent with the articulation of a ‘posthuman’, fundamentally immanent, materialist, and emergent model of (anti)metaphysics that continues to spawn wildly in the wake of Gilles Deleuze’s influential philosophy of becoming. In these conceptual worlds of vibrant matter and diverse networks of human and nonhuman actors, the human is necessarily decentred. What emerges in its place is the “vital materiality” of a human body that “is not fully or exclusively human”; one in which, for instance, the bacteria living in our epidermis, or the “swarm” of bacteria living in the human gut, necessarily constitute each one of us as a living multitude, “an array of bodies” (Bennett 112).\nThis is a distinctly Cronenbergian image, of course: the human as multitude, the human as hybridised by and with its ecological cohabitants, or – to use one of Uhall’s terms – the human subject as a morphogenetic entity, a “chimerical site” (115). In Crimes of the Future Cronenberg addresses precisely these facets of human existence – the morphogenetic and the chimerical.\n3\nSet in a near future where civilisation verges on collapse, the film centres on a small outpost of survivors whose world is poised between the decaying vestiges of modernity and a retreat into markers of earlier historical epochs (late medievalism, vague Hellenism, twentieth century glamour aesthetics). This is a kind of ‘1984 Revisited’: by way of 1948, but also 1448 and 484 BCE. Electricity seems in short supply, but sufficient to power vintage ‘brick’ cell phones, old TV sets, and the exotic, fleshly SARK surgical devices prized by the film’s chief protagonists, Saul Tenser (Viggo Mortensen) and Caprice (Lea Seydoux). The latter are prestigious body-modification artists, whose practice involves the live removal of ‘novel’ organs that routinely grow in Tenser’s abdomen. These anatomical anomalies are excised in vivid open surgeries which – in a society where humans’ capacity to experience pain and pleasure has faded – are regarded by their fans as not just revolutionary artworks but as a transgressive form of “new sex”.\nPerformance art of this ilk is this society’s dominant form of entertainment. A vaguely illicit spectacle, it fuses together rival conceptions of theatre: as space of performance, and as space of medical demonstration. (That both of these conceptions of theatre stem from the culture of Ancient Greece is apt, as the film was shot on location in Athens.) But such mortifications of the body are not confined to the rituals of somewhat pretentious high art gatherings. They have spilled out into every corner of society where – in the nocturnal shadows – people moan in delightful agony as backstreet ‘desktop surgeons’ hack into their nerve centres.\nMonitoring the threat of these subversive activities are the agents of diminished state institutions that themselves lurk in the shadows. These include New Vice, a police branch focussed specifically on the “accelerated evolution syndrome” that is wrenching the species away from “the human path”, and the National Organ Registry presided over by two Kafkaesque figures (Kristen Stewart and Don McKellar). The latter duo maintain archival records of novel organs, and each seems torn between discharging their bureaucratic, biopolitical labour and the beguiling allure of the bodily mutations (and mutilations) they encounter.\nInsurrection, finally, is very much the threat in this world. In addition to the phenomenon of ‘naturally’ occurring bodily mutations, which in many cases have made the digestion of food almost impossible, an underground movement of eco-conscious transhumanist bio-engineers have been tinkering with the human organism so that it can survive by consuming its own industrial waste (in the form of ‘synth’ bars made of plastic). It will transpire that Mortensen’s noir antihero, who himself suffers from a rogue digestive system, is actually an undercover agent reporting to New Vice on both threats: that of the body-art circuit within which he works and the transhumanist underground with whom he comes into contact.\n4\nIt is important to note that the sensuous and liminal atmosphere of Crimes of the Future, which is perhaps even more compelling than the narrative on which the film hangs, is explicitly the result of an evocative “rubble noir” aesthetic: its integration of “fragile” and “impermanent” metropolitan spaces “on the cusp of complete demolition” (Fay 126). The film’s dilapidated, crepuscular environment, with its serpentine streetscapes and exorbitant textures of decaying mortar, suggests a sense of civil and ecological cataclysm in virtually every frame. In this, it adheres to noir’s long-established “proclivity … for urban topoi on the verge of destruction” (Dimendberg 64). In reflecting on the liminality of such noir spaces, Edward Dimendberg invokes Ignasi de Sola-Morales Rubio’s analysis of visuals of “terrain vague” in urban photography: strange, void spaces that solicit alienation and wonder.  As de Sola-Morales Rubio observes, for all their unsettling qualities, such terrains vagues are not necessarily ‘negative’ or hopeless spaces, but are primed also with a sense of potential:\n\nthe relationship [in these spaces] between the absence of use, of activity, and the sense of freedom, of expectancy, is fundamental to understanding the evocative potential of the city’s terrains vagues. Void, absence, yet also promise, the space of the possible, of expectation. (120)\n\nDespite the film’s morbid subject matter, its cinematography, production design, and lighting very precisely conjure this quality of potential in the corroding void spaces of Crimes of the Future. As Amy Taubin has observed, the film’s scenography frequently calls to mind Renaissance painting: a sensibility that emerges from astute use of light and colour, and which ultimately helps to communicate a sense of a nascent society in dangerous but vibrant genesis, emergent and inchoate. Indeed, it is precisely the capacity of noir visuals – and particularly noir’s innovative chiaroscuro lighting strategies – to imbue film with a quality of dark materialist emergence that prompts Uhall to anoint his ecological framework as one of “noir materialism” (58).\nThis interplay between the human body and its penumbral, emergent environs is accentuated in Crimes of the Future by the way human figures – staged in languorous, decadent repose or alert, reverberant passivity – tend to blend into, and become resonant with, the textures of erotic collapse all around them, a collapse that obtains not just in the decaying buildings, but also in the fetishized remnants of dead and residual media. Cronenberg entangles these elements with considerable relish, as if to communicate the unseen, untimely, disorderly depths of mutative processes that are going on inside the city’s inhabitants. In particular, the film’s seductively passive protagonist, Saul (Mortensen), is inclined to lurk in the dark margins of the spaces he inhabits. This corresponds, of course, with his role as undercover agent, but also underlines his strange status as an artist/mystic, bemused by the crude machinations of disciplinary state mechanisms as much as he is by the mutiny of his own body.\n5\nThe mesmerising weariness and passivity of Saul Tenser is indeed where the film’s purported ‘body-noir’ dynamics are most pronounced. As I have noted elsewhere, one of noir’s most fascinating visual motifs is an iconography centred on depicting the human body in strange states of passivity and quietude – “dark intervals” – that are uniquely charged with a quality of extra-temporal rupture and very often, in modern noir, with a sense of redemptive affectivity (Killeen 5). Moreover, this iconography itself evokes and transfigures earlier motifs in art history, particularly those focussed on images of melancholic, acedic detachment or contemplative arrest (43). Consistent with such an iconography, it is telling that our first image of Saul finds him lying in repose in bed (in this case, a custom-made device that interfaces with his mutagenic body). The image of the noir protagonist lying in bed, suspended in a disruptive temporality, is in fact one that marks a great many noirs, from the classic era (This Gun for Hire [Frank Tuttle, 1942], The Killers [Robert Siodmak, 1946]) through to more modern articulations (The Long Goodbye [Robert Altman, 1973], Memento [Christopher Nolan, 1999]). Throughout Crimes of the Future we repeatedly find Saul at rest, often in conditions of physical discomfort, but frequently in bliss or reverie. In one of Mortensen’s most charming performative conceits, we also repeatedly find him crouched on his haunches, saturated in shadow, while covered in his preferred attire: a black, vaguely monastic cloak, complete with facial covering: rendering him a curious blend of “artist, ninja and religious ascetic” (Dargis).\nThe motivation for his repeated crouching is the discomfort his body’s mutations induce, and this toll of embodiment, too, is continuous with a certain strain of noir performance, Mortensen clearly channelling the glacial weariness of noir icons past – enthrallingly laconic specimens such as Robert Mitchum, Burt Lancaster, and Dana Andrews. The latter’s “irredeemable materiality”, as Geoffrey O’Brien amusingly notes, seemed to etch onscreen the burden of embodiment itself: “this body that must carry the weight of Dana Andrews through the world, and his coat and hat too, and the extra pack of cigarettes for later” (O’Brien 199). In Crimes of the Future, via the metaphor of a noir body that is actively wearing down its inhabitant and escorting it into the evolutionary future, such a noir iconography is deliciously adapted and intensified.\nAnd yet, in noir films of the dark interval, it is precisely the body’s materiality that very often is redeemed.\n6\nBefore providing an ‘interpretation’ of the redemptive qualities the film apportions to the iconographic morphologies of the arrested, intervallic noir body, I should address first the suspicion of hermeneutical activity that Cronenberg weaves into the film; its subtle critique of excessive metaphysical interrogations of the body and of depth models conspiratorially centred on uncovering latent, suppressed meanings everywhere; mystifying, then demystifying natural processes. It’s a sceptical interrogative metaphysics broadly resonant with that which Paul Ricoeur influentially termed a “hermeneutics of suspicion” (30).\nThroughout the film, the various attempts to control, discipline, or marshal the body’s novel mutations by bureaucratically classifying them, artistically tagging them, or metaphysically exoticising them, invite contempt. As Saul puts it, when expressing unease about the tattooing of his new organ: “it takes over the form, the shape of the organ itself. It really, in a sense, dominates it, reshapes it … . It seems to take meaning away from the organ. It takes the process of meaning for itself”.\nAgainst such semantic systems of analysis and codification, Cronenberg mobilises a more unruly, ancient form of reflection, with etymological origins in ancient Greece: autopsy [autopsia], ‘to see for oneself’. Autopsy is somewhat unruly, because – unlike other forms of knowledge, such as historia or theoria – its priority is not to find a consensual synthesis of facts and viewpoints; rather, its knowledge remains directly in the sensorium of the individual and its immediate, subjective encounter with phenomena. (In this, autopsia shares certain characteristics of another ancient Greek form of knowledge: aesthesis.) Autopsy is the framework Caprice constructs for her most ambitious body-art performance: the ‘live’ autopsy of a dead boy, Brecken, a miracle child who – if his father can be believed – was born with a digestive system that can consume plastic. “We’ve all thought the body was empty”, she tells her audience, “empty of meaning. And we’ve wanted to confirm that, so we could fill it with meaning”. Her own eagerness to perform the autopsy, however, has stemmed from a sense that such an act is “juicy with meaning”. In this, she sounds briefly like her rival, and double, in the film, Stewart’s state functionary, Timlin, who also recurrently expresses an exotic fascination with the body’s “very potent meaning”.\nCaprice is horrified, however, when – during her autopsy of the dead child – she discovers the body vandalised by the hermeneutical, biopolitical acts of those aiming to suppress, derail, or control the message of this “miracle” body. A sleeper agent of the state mechanism, it transpires, has brutally tattooed/codified the boy’s new system of organs with various watchwords and images (“mother”, “death”) all too familiar from psychoanalysis, philosophy, religion, and, indeed, semiotics itself. The act devours the autonomy of the creative body’s own inherent meaning as simply that which it is: creative, self-generative, autopoietic material. Recanting of her own desire for bodies to “mean” something, Caprice, like her partner Saul, will finish the film in awe of the body’s autonomous powers.\n7\nLet us return to the definition of autopsy [autopsia]: “to see for oneself”. As Jacob Foster points out, originally autopsia “vaguely denoted the self-inspection of something, without physically touching it” and such inspection was “certainly not restricted to deceased human bodies” (1492). Over time, under the influence of medical practice, the meaning drifted to become precisely its opposite: to dissect the body. Throughout the film Saul Tenser, while resisting the threat of his own body via dissection, attends to it nevertheless in a profound manner of self-experience equivalent to autopsia in its original sense. And by the film’s close Saul completes the adjustment that this radical, auto-affective passivity has been inclining toward. No longer able to consume food at all, he risks his life by eating one of the transhumanist movement’s “synth bars”, which, as a human, should be fatal to him. His devoted companion, Caprice, films this act: perhaps Saul’s final moment of life. And at this point Cronenberg cuts to a grainy black-and-white close-up (the footage from Caprice’s recorder), as – having swallowed the synthetic material – a rapt, blissful smile plays across Mortensen’s face, while he lies in repose in a familiar noir iconography. The film ends. Tenser is hereby transfigured. And Caprice – now identified with the camera’s own auto-optical sensitivity to such a transfiguration – is herself transformed.\nIn interviews, Cronenberg and Mortensen have revealed this sequence was inspired by Maria Falconetti’s close-ups in Carl Dreyer’s The Passion of Joan of Arc, and by the flickers of subtle, graceful reverie Falconetti imparts, even while her character is burned at the stake. In The Dark Interval I traced a number of noir films inflected with suggestive scenes of what Deleuze, following Spinoza, terms the “beatitude” that inheres in self-affection: a joyful, dispossessing alertness to the “passive syntheses” or “larval selves” that constitute one’s embodiment (74); an accession – as Giorgio Agamben might put it – to one’s own “taking place” (216). As such, Saul Tenser – in the reverberant beatitude of self-affection – steps out of the ‘tenses’, the “crimes” of past, present, and future, to inhabit an ecstatic interval of irruptive noir materiality that restores him, equanimously, to his amorphous ecology. In this redemptive, aporetic atemporality he ‘sees for himself’ and finds the belief that has been eluding him. Like his namesake, Saul of Tarsus, he undergoes here a conversion, as indicated by the film’s suggestive shift to black-and-white. Indeed, in this way, Saul comes to incarnate the complex equivalence between “autopsy” and “faith” that Søren Kierkegaard explores in Philosophical Fragments. For Kierkegaard, the “autopsy of faith” allows the believer not just ‘to see with one’s own eyes’, but “to see only the same as every believer sees – with the eyes of faith” (102). For Kierkegaard such an “autopsy of faith” opens on to divine mystery; in the more secular metaphysics of Cronenberg’s film, an autopsy of faith opens on to the plenitude and promise of a materiality that – while dark, dehiscent, often discordant – resides in bodily powers of transformation.\nFar from the passivity of auto-affection being necessarily an impotent experience of acquiescence or retreat, it is the enigma of potentiality that is disclosed during noir’s dark intervals, and thus it is very possible that Saul – akin to a latter-day St Paul – will lead the cause of the transhumanist insurgents and new mutant population alike. Or perhaps he won’t. It is left to the viewer to decide precisely what the import of the film’s climactic interval of self-affection will be. But certainly Cronenberg encourages us to see as Saul sees, to perceive in the original meaning of autopsia: to see, feel, experience for oneself; to embrace what Deleuze regarded as cinema’s greatest capacity – to restore our powers of belief in the body, thereby “renewing a belief in this world and its powers of transformation” (Rodowick 192).\nReferences\nBennett, Jane.

    "title": "Mutation in Media and Popular Culture",
    "abstract": "The concept of mutation has transcended its scientific origins to become a powerful metaphor in media and popular culture for transformation, adaptation, and fear of the unknown. From the genetic mutations of Marvel’s X-Men superheroes to the biological horror of the infected in The Last of Us, representations of mutation in popular culture often serve as a means to challenge our understanding of the boundaries of the human condition and what it means to be ‘human’. \nMutation is of course not limited to its manifestation in media as embodied physical or biological change and the ethical implications of such experimentation; it can also signify shifts in our understandings of reality and identity, technology and society. In all of these contexts, mutation is the catalyst for change. For instance, the recent evolution of our engagement with generative artificial intelligence, immersive virtual and augmented realities, digital personas and afterlives, and the future of cybernetic implants asks where the ‘original’ and the ‘mutated’ hybrid-self begins and ends. While some may consider such changes to be an inevitable evolution of the self, others may argue they are a monstrous mutation, and with the complexity of these developments our very understanding of personhood is itself brought into question. Likewise, anxieties about viral mutation and ecological collapse in our post-pandemic era of climate crisis speak to the ongoing relevance of the concept of mutation for the way we seek to understand ourselves and our relationship with the world. The smallest of mutations can have profound consequences for ourselves, for our societies, and for all life on our planet.\nThe articles in this issue explore ‘mutation’ across the diversity of its representation in media and popular culture, exploring the ways in which it too has ‘mutated’ over the years in multifaceted ways across many and varied modalities. Many of the articles foreground the importance of the visual in thematising and exploring mutation and its related entanglements with – and challenges to – seemingly stable, ‘whole’ and often binary categories such as gender, sexuality, identity, the body, and particularly the boundaries of the human as set against its ecological and technological contexts. Of particular interest are the ways in which mutation as a concept has the power to transform traditional expectations of popular media and culture by transcending artistic boundaries or thematic expectations of certain genres, forms, styles, and modalities.\nOur feature article, Megan Catherine Rose and Patrick W. Galbraith’s “Mutating Hyperfemininity in Bishōjo Art: On Sugary Symbiote” examines a form of mutation that places the visual front and centre in its political mission and meaning. This article examines “the queer and transformative potential” of mutation in the context of bishōjo, which are manga or anime-style “cute girls”. Arguing that this art form has traditionally been interpreted as objects produced by and for men, Rose and Galbraith explore the reinterpretation – or mutation – of bishōjo by women and gender-diverse people, taking as their case study the work of Sugary Symbiote, a Black, disabled, and sapphic artist in the United States. Sugary Symbiote’s illustrations, several examples of which are generously reproduced within this article, evidence a broad movement by global fans of bishōjo to “reclaim and reimagine Japanese popular culture”, but more particularly reconfigure this through a Black queer lens, underscoring a central interplay between the “fem(me)” and “hyperfemininity” that quickly breaks its heteronormative and patriarchal bounds to become monstrous – and monstrously powerful in the defiance these ‘mutations’ afford.\nWhile Sugary Symbiote enacts defiant monstrousness and mutation in the digital world, Huw Nolan and Jo Coghlan's article “Mutating a Better Man: Robbie Williams, Simian Semiotics, Spectacle, and the Posthuman Celebrity” takes this theme of digital transformation into the realm of contemporary film practices. Nolan and Coghlan argue that Michael Gracey's biographical film Better Man (2024), in which Robbie Williams is represented not in his human form, but rather as a CGI primate, can be read through a posthumanist lens that blurs the boundaries of human identity, oscillating “between authentic human subjectivity and hyperreal digital construct”. Williams, in this article, is interpreted as a “technologically mediated spectacle” which speaks to the “epistemological instability” inherent in contemporary celebrity culture and its dehumanising reliance on constant mutation and transformation. In particular, Nolan and Coghlan argue, the film can be read as “a critical commentary on the increasingly blurred boundaries between human authenticity and technological artifice in our hypermediated era, underscoring celebrity as an ever-evolving, culturally constructed mutation.”\nContinuing the theme of both technological mutation and the aesthetic choices that represent mutation in film and television, Angelique Nairn’s article “Crafting the Grotesque: Mutation and Imagination in Face Off” examines the reality television series Face Off (2011–2018), in which contestants compete in the design, artistry, and application of special effects (SFX) makeup. The article posits that contestants and – by extension – audiences equate notions of transformation and mutation with deviance, horror, and the grotesque, monstrous, and abject. At the same time as it critiques the implications of such associations and representations of mutation, this article explores the creative freedoms bound up in concepts of monstrosity and biological transformation.\nAll of the previously mentioned articles draw on ideas of mutation as linked to concepts of the body and challenges to its stability as a form or construct, and this theme forms the backbone of Padraic Killeen’s article “Ecology, Materialism, and Transfiguration: An Autopsy of ‘Body Noir’ in David Cronenberg’s Crimes of the Future”. Exploring the body horror of this 2022 film, Killeen identifies a “body noir” aesthetic guiding the representations of physiological mutations in the film’s post-apocalyptic environment. Killeen describes Cronenberg’s film as a “narrative of transhumanist and evolutionary mutation”, linking these ideas to “post-humanist paranoia, ecological horror, and noir aesthetics”.\nSuch ecological mutations, linked with eco-horror and eco-Gothic, are central to Rhiannon Rumble’s article “Mycological Mutations: What We Can Learn from Mutant Fungi and Fungal Mutants”. This article takes as its focus the proliferation of representations of fungi in popular culture, focussing on fungal mutations in The Girl with All the Gifts (2014) and Cold Storage (2019). It argues that these fictions, in which fungi have mutated to threaten, transform, and take over human bodies, “raise questions about our intersection with, and response to, the nonhuman world”, and particularly its stability as a separate category from the mycological and ecological.\nSuch fungal mutations are easily suggestive of similarly threatening viral mutations. Bruna Emanuela Vaz Quincó and André Vasques Vital’s article “Law, Viral Mutations, and Spectral Tropicality in Tender Is the Flesh (2017) by Agustina Bazterrica” examines Argentine writer Agustina Bazterrica’s novel Tender Is the Flesh (2017), which imagines human society impacted upon by the emergence of a lethal, infectious agent that contaminates animals. It argues that this virus, which is resistant to human attempts to manage it through vaccines and medicines, represents “spectral tropicality”. It analyses the novel’s representations and implied critique of the breakdown of human rights – particularly those of marginalised people – in the face of the horror generated by pandemic mutations that fundamentally challenge established ways of life.\nViral mutation, ecological threat, and the porosity and mutability of human bodies also underscore our final article, Rachael Robertson’s “‘In Death, Sacrifice’: The Gothic Mutation of the Blight in the Dragon Age Videogames”. In this fantasy role-playing videogame series, argues Robertson, the Blight is an eco-Gothic threat that infects both land and people. Examining the games’ multiple representations of bodily mutation and category collapse, from the “darkspawn” to the Broodmother and antagonist Ghilan’nain, which are both grotesque, “monstrously mutated” representations of the maternal, Robertson explores how questions of identity, femininity, monstrosity, and the abject are entangled in these games to position the Grey Wardens, who are under threat from the Blight, as in an inexorable state of mutation towards monstrosity.\nRead together, these articles underscore the eerie relevance of mutation for our world today, whether in its challenges to the stability of identity and bodily autonomy in the face of rapid digital, medical, and technological advancements, or in the viral and fungal mutations of ecological decay and the human collision with the non-human world. Thus what is portrayed as a ‘mutation’ in contemporary popular culture and its media remains a fascinating area for further scholarly pursuits, one that we hope will continue to ‘mutate’ across disciplines well into the future. \nThe editors of this issue would like to sincerely thank M/C Journal, the contributors, and our peer reviewers, for all the time and energy they gave to support the production of this issue. ",

    "abstract": " Abstract: This study drew upon schema theory and Gestalt theory to explore the impact of congruence on the boundary between word of mouth and sponsored content on social media. Specifically, it delved into how congruence influences unconscious fixation behavior and enhances product attitude toward sponsored content during the preattention stage. Utilizing eye-tracking technology, we conducted two experiments, closely analyzing participants’ eye movements. Our findings revealed that both fixation length and fixation count are significantly higher in influencer posts exhibiting congruence between the product and influencer compared to those with incongruent product combinations. Additionally, posts with congruent product-background color combinations exhibit longer fixation length and higher fixation count than those with contrasting color combinations. Increased fixation length and count correlate with more positive product attitudes toward sponsored content. These insights contribute valuable perspectives on the impact of influencer marketing on users’ attention and product attitude on Instagram.",

    "title": "Death Glitch: How Techno-Solutionism Fails Us in This Life and Beyond by Tamara Kneese (review)",
    "abstract": "This Life and Beyond takes a close look into the uncomfortable intersections of death, technology, and commercialism. With the rise of an abundance of new and changing digital outlets and social media, the question of how these infrastructures create a new sense of mourning of the digital afterlife demands attention. The preservation of digital data is particularly important to these processes, as it has now been integrated into our everyday life practices. The book breaks down the complexity of death and techno-solutionism, be ginning with a lengthy introduction and continuing in four chapters: “Social Memorials,” “Networked Death,” “Disrupted Inheritance,” and “Haunted Objects.” Each chapter in cludes collections of case studies that point out the messiness of death and commercialism. - - Each chapter offers a glimpse into what Kneese calls “death glitches.” Death glitches draw attention to things that were previously unaccounted for, not seen, or not work ing. These glitches become obstacles, but at the same time they lay bare questions that were never realized or answered during life or immediately after death. When people die, they leave behind materials that Kneese calls “digital remains,” referring to the digi tal counterparts of the physical remains of a person. In the “Social Memorials” chapter, Kneese addresses the ways that aging platforms must adjust their policies to “deal” with the dying. The author points out how these death glitches allow us to think about digi tal remains as materials that live on beyond death. The following chapter, on networked death, puts emphasis on this phenomenon by exploring case studies of death bloggers who write about what death means to people even after they are gone. Her chapter “Disrupted Inheritance” questions issues of privacy and the frequent lack of digital estate manage ment within the confines of death. She explores the many new startups",

    "abstract": " Abstract: This article introduces a novel approach to information seeking: the research self (RS). A flexible and holistic model, the RS articulates the various relationships between identity, emotion, epistemology, and research practice. It is rooted in sense-making methodology, lifeworlds, and critical information literacy. This work emerged from a grounded theory study with twelve participants researching one of three topics traditionally labeled “conspiracy theories”: collusion in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy; UFOs and extraterrestrials; and the Missing 411 phenomenon. The RS can function both as a multifaceted information-seeking model and as a methodology for fostering reflexivity specifically and information literacy broadly. This article also introduces the concept of counterestablishment research—any kind of research activity, conducted systematically, that goes against establishment institutions, norms, or consensus. Having emerged from counterestablishment research, the RS may be particularly effective for fostering reflexivity among epistemically diverse populations.",

    "abstract": "Internet demonstrates the interweaving of two parallel threads: the rise of the internet and the emergence of “transgender” as a term to define a shared community identity. The result is a social history of trans activism and an internet history that centers the trans-gender community as users. Dame-Griff guides the reader through the inner workings of the transgender community’s use of communication technology. These workings include linguistic and etymological discussions of a collective community’s term of identification, as well as debates on who is considered a legitimate member of the community. Full of an-ecdotes, documents from the Digital Transgender Archive and the Queer Digital History Project, and firsthand accounts from Dame-Griff himself, this work reflects the trajectory, successes, and struggles of the transgender community with care, respect, and dedication. Methodologically, Dame-Griff conducted significant media archaeology and archival research from the 1980s to the present day; many of the documents shared in this work have been selected and preserved by the author himself as part of the Queer Digital History Project. These resources are complemented by Dame-Griff’s use of the Wayback Machine, a digital archive of content produced on the World Wide Web. Dame-Griff used these archival sources, which include newsletters, advertisements, clip art, comics, screen shots, blog posts, and forum discussions, to create a narrative of trans digital connection and community building. In this respect, The Two Revolutions is an excellent accompa niment to Cait McKinney’s Information Activism: A Queer History of Lesbian Media Technologies , as both pieces document how communication and media technologies can be leveraged to support the labor and connections necessary in fostering social movements and underrepresented",

People who are required to wear electronic ankle monitors express that they experience shame and stigmatization because of being required to wear this technology due to its strong association with the criminal justice system. This article presents exploratory research of instances where wearers present their ankle monitors online and shares a typology describing a range of observable resistance stories or narrative events in these posts. I describe emergent cultures and practices of aesthetic resistance and reclamation practices carried out by the wearer community. This research highlights the acute need to center the voices, acts, and experiences of people and communities rendered vulnerable by technology design and deployment.",

    "abstract": " In this article, I offer a critical view of the significance of studying multichannel networks as a renewed form of cultural intermediaries, with the conceptual lens of ‘friction’, in the context of platformization of cultural production. I first trace the historical formation of multichannel networks in China that is in tandem with the development of the livestreaming industry. Subsequently, drawing on 15 in-depth interviews with media practitioners and a 3-month participatory observation within a multichannel network institution in Guangzhou, China, I argue for a re-evaluation of multichannel networks’ intermediary positions in the increasingly complex platformization process where cultural production and commerce are deeply integrated. By comparing and analysing both the industrial lore (discourse) of multichannel network practitioners and their industrial practices, the findings demonstrate the messy, unstable, and contingent aspects of multichannel networks’ collaboration with platforms. As platform collaborators, or complementors, multichannel networks are not positioned in equality or sameness, and their collaboration does not necessarily produce communal good. Navigating the complex networks of people, products, and platforms as digital marketplaces, multichannel networks faced a precarious middleman position – their commercial activities were restricted and trapped by the industrial lore adhering closely to the platform logics of visibility and commodification.

    "abstract": " This study seeks to gain an understanding of the power relations in a failed platform-cooperativism initiative in Araraquara, São Paulo, Brazil, in 2022. The project was started by a worker cooperative that acquired a Bibi Mob platform franchise and was supported by the city's solidarity-economy incubator. The project failed eight months after its inception. We examine the datafication process in the app in order to analyse how the power relations of global infrastructural platforms – Google and Amazon in particular – contributed to the end of the initiative. The workers’ local actions were constrained by disciplinary power imposed by the global platform ecosystem. Drawing on this Latin American experience, we argue that the infrastructural power wielded by dominant actors within the platform economy is exercised through a disciplinary apparatus, significantly restricting local actors’ autonomy, and acting as a form of what we term ‘disciplined autonomy’.

    "abstract": "Today, the networks of digital platforms are deeply intertwined with our everyday topographies. One of the giants of the industry is Amazon, the world's largest e-commerce company. Over the past decade, it has become our neighbour, employer and critical public infrastructure provider – a standard in modern city life. For the Ruhr metropolis in Germany, Amazon epitomizes a transformative force for shaping the historically industrial region into a warehouse for Europe. It brings with it the promise of turning the region into a service sector hub. With its extensive logistics and delivery operations, however, Amazon is building onto already existing (public) infrastructures, past and present: Drawing on the example of the logistical cluster at the Westfalenhütte in the north-east of Dortmund, a 612.000-resident city in Western Germany, this paper maps out how deeply rooted in (and dependent on) industrial histories ‘innovative’ contemporary developments by tech companies are. From the ground to the cloud, it reveals the various layers of public local infrastructure that Amazon is settling on to, profiting off of – or even taking over.",

    "abstract": " This paper delves into communications dynamics between social media platforms and their users as they navigate the opacity of governance policies. Using Meta and TikTok as case studies, we reveal that gaslighting – traditionally linked with relationship abuse where one partner undermines the validity of the other's experience – has become a pervasive communication strategy for platforms, manifesting in numerous instances where automated and human platform communications have directly contradicted users’ experiences, evidence and research. We analyse 36 diverse interview datasets and six public platform responses to content moderation issues, highlighting the systemic nature of this phenomenon within digital spaces. By moving beyond shadowbanning and isolated platform-to-user dialogue, we expand the scholarly understanding of platform gaslighting to encompass a broader spectrum of governance-related communications. Our dataset draws from seemingly disparate groups who share moderation experiences: Jewish creators engaged in combating antisemitism, Palestinian creators advocating for human rights and sex-positive creators, whose expertise and stories are dismissed and belittled by platforms. Our participants' experiences demonstrate that conceptualising platform communications as gaslighting can help expose corporate power imbalances in platform-user interactions, particularly in cases where platforms govern through undisclosed practices such as shadowbanning and de-platforming triggered by malicious flagging, along with ambiguous communication from their representatives. We demonstrate how the dismissal or minimisation of participants’ traumatic experiences by platforms’ automated processes and human teams is weaponised to inflict epistemic injustice, consolidate power, safeguard public image and evade accountability.

    "title": "State, platform capitalism and infrastructural power: Microsoft's data centres in Greece 2.0",
    "abstract": " This article examines the under-explored role of the state in enabling platform capitalism by analysing Microsoft's infrastructural investment in Greece, as part of the country's post-pandemic ‘National Recovery and Resilience Plan: Greece 2.0’. While much of the critical literature emphasises platform companies’ control over infrastructure and data, we argue that state facilitation is a crucial component of platform capital accumulation. Through a case study of Microsoft's construction of three data centres in the region of Attica, we show how the Greek state actively facilitated this investment, framing it as a driver of modernisation and economic recovery. We base our study on a comprehensive document analysis of official communications, regulatory frameworks and legal documents. This involvement exemplifies how semi-peripheral states like Greece, shaped by neoliberal restructuring and economic dependence, contribute to consolidating the power of tech corporations, often at the expense of local communities and the environment. By integrating theories of state capitalism and techno-colonialism with critical platform scholarship, this article contributes to a deeper understanding of the political economy of platform capitalism, revealing the symbiotic yet exploitative nature of state-tech partnerships and urging a re-centring of the state's role in facilitating corporate dominance over digital infrastructures and global platform capitalism.

    "title": "Gendered inequalities of platform work in Africa: Findings from a multi-country analysis",
    "abstract": "Hopes that the growth of platform work in Africa will provide new opportunities for women's employment have not yet been matched by empirical research. Based on a five-country survey of workers on 18 platforms across four sectors (ride-hailing, delivery, professional, microtasks), the research reported here makes the first direct, systematic comparison of men's and women's experiences of platform work in multiple African countries. The paper finds an absence of specific gender differences across many core operational structures of platform work including general shortcomings related to social protection, contracts, human/algorithmic management and representation being experienced similarly by both men and women. However, the paper also finds that these processes occur within a wider gender-unequal context in which gendered norms skew the presence of men and women in different sectors, and in which wider exclusions encourage women into platform work but lead them to experience greater precarity and dependency than men on that work. For example, women on average earn less than men because they work demonstrably fewer hours. This also limits the purported flexibility of platform work for women workers and denies them a pay premium to reflect their generally higher levels of education. While experienced by only a minority of women workers surveyed, gender-discriminatory cancellations, complaints and abuse were reported. The paper ends with recommendations for actions to address gender inequalities in platform work, and reflections on future research.",

These platforms, often associated with the Alt-Right, challenge mainstream social media by reinterpreting the value of safety. Using a mixed-method approach to study values promoted in social media policies, this study reveals that Alt Tech platforms reject traditional safety measures, viewing them as censorship, manifesting in three key strategies: advocating for unrestricted freedom of expression; reframing safety-oriented governance as censorship, and promoting an ideal of the digitally\n            mature\n            , user.

    "abstract": "Platform-mediated labour is rapidly transforming African economies, expanding opportunities yet exacerbating precarity. This paper develops an empirical typology of heterogeneous platform worker experiences in Sub-Saharan Africa, grounded in interviews with 55 labourers across transportation, domestic services, IT and creative sectors in Rwanda, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Integrating neo-Marxist concepts of dispossession with postcolonial perspectives on enduring North-South domination reveals nuanced differences in autonomy constraints, income volatility, rating dependence and peripheral exclusion across five worker segments: high-skilled independents, low-skilled dependents, aspiring entrepreneurials, established entrepreneurials and discouraged peripherals. Findings show that high-skilled independents navigate autonomy and instability on global freelancing platforms while facing discrimination. Low-skilled dependents experience exploitative algorithms dictating terms of participation. Aspiring entrepreneurials leverage platforms strategically to launch startups. Established entrepreneurials transition from precarious work to launch equitable local platforms. Meanwhile, discouraged peripherals are denied access by opaque vetting. This typology provides traction to tailor protections addressing decent work deficits concentrated among particular groups.",

    "abstract": "\n            This article looks at how the emergence of the disinformation field in Aotearoa-New Zealand is indicative of the territorial power of American platforms in policy settings. The country has been a key flashpoint in the debates around platform harm. Former Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was a champion of technocratic and compassionate leadership in navigating the country through the Christchurch mosque terror attack and COVID-19. At the heart of Ardern's political legacy was\n            The Christchurch Call\n            and adopting a ‘whole of society’ approach to fighting disinformation. In her on-going work she stands as a post-political, moral leader in fostering stakeholder conversations around platform harm, emerging tech and disinformation. This mode of governance is indicative of platform imperialism during the post-2016 Techlash. It is an administrative paradigm that views civil society partnership and big data epistemologies as the means to protect democracies rather than anti-trust measures or domestic platform and media policies. The lead policy entrepreneurs in the field of disinformation research in Aotearoa-New Zealand were The Disinformation Project (TDP). Their role was to furnish local media, government and researchers with a lexicon of “infection” and “subversion”, within which political conflicts are viewed as epiphenomena of disinformation warfare. The field is characterised by a moral, post-political discourse that perpetuates a fantasy of social wholeness and treats platforms as unalterable entities rather than dependent on regulatory carve-outs and arbitrage. The utility of this administrative research is on the wane as the Techlash window of opportunity has closed and with it research centres like TDP.\n          ",

    "abstract": " This study examines the online moving of Chinese Boys’ Love (BL) fans through the lens of platform ecology, exploring how they navigate censorship and create opportunity spaces across multiple digital platforms. Employing mixed methods combining participant observation, in-depth interviews, and secondary data analysis, the research maps the complex tactics BL fans used to maintain their community and content in a restrictive digital environment. The findings reveal that fans move between commercial, fan-run, and outbound-link platforms, to access different types of content and spaces. By combining platform affordances, fans create opportunity spaces that fulfill their desires for BL content, demonstrating remarkable resilience in the face of increasing restrictions. The study contributes to both fan studies and platform studies by extending analyses beyond single-platform interactions and deepening the platform ecology heuristic. It highlights the importance of cross-platform mobility in equipping fan communities to withstand structural vulnerabilities imposed by censorship and platform governance. The research also integrates political-economic analysis with ecological thinking, balancing considerations of user agency and power imbalances. ",

    "abstract": "This article examines the emergence of platformised multi-level marketing (MLM) schemes as a significant, yet understudied, phenomenon in the ongoing transformation of work and labour on digital platforms. Promising wealth, freedom, and community, platformised MLMs organise individuals into cycles of value extraction by leveraging aspirational narratives of financial independence and entrepreneurial success. Through a case study of iGenius, a global MLM firm working through local recruiters, the article analyses the strategic and progressive embedding of individuals into the MLM. The article focuses on the cyclic character of recruitment operations, and identifies three stages of the process, namely recruitment of customers on social media platforms, the commodification of customers through complex and obfuscated brokerage relationships with affiliate trading platforms, and, finally, the embedding of individuals into the MLM organisation as recruiters seeking new prospects, starting the process over again. Throughout the analysis, we show how the nature of work, the value extraction methods, and the control mechanisms intensify as people move from merely subscribing to engaging in financial trading and in the end, turning to recruitment for the MLM. In the concluding discussion, we situate the analytical findings in the broader discussion of precarious work relations and atomisation of the workforce as well as the broader context of investment schemes and online scams. Thus, the article contributes to the study of labour relations and data extraction relationships on platforms and in the digital economy more generally.",

    "abstract": "This study examines how cultural heritage institutions utilize Google Arts &amp; Culture (GA&amp;C), a Google initiative that provides a publishing platform for institutions to showcase their collections and engage with users. Based on semistructured interviews with 23 cultural institutions and one Google employee, the study provides an empirical account of platform adoption beyond dominant commercial and social media contexts. Theoretically, it contributes to platform studies by analyzing how platformization unfolds in the cultural sector, where traditionally public institutions engage with external platforms under varying organizational constraints. Methodologically, it offers a situated perspective on how institutions make sense of platform governance, digital strategy, and content production in everyday practice. Findings reveal persistent challenges in aligning institutional needs with platform affordances. While institutions were drawn to GA&amp;C's promise of greater visibility, infrastructural support, and storytelling tools, these benefits were often undermined by limited technical resources, communication breakdowns, and logistical hurdles. Internal dynamics, from institutional memory to internal collaboration, proved to be the most significant factor shaping institutional participation, leading to fragmented and short-lived use of the platform. The kind of infrastructural alignment central to platformization never fully materialized. As a result, GA&amp;C remained a peripheral tool rather than an integrated component of institutional digital strategies, highlighting the contingent, partial, and often fragile nature of platform adoption in the cultural sector.",

The impact of gig and platform labour reveals significant divergences between the Global North and South, particularly in how these platforms disrupt social labour relations and subjective working conditions, suggesting to analyse in the frame of ‘differential uberisation’ of labour. Through interviews, the study examines the structural heterogeneity of labour realities in Latin America, while also highlighting key contributions from critical Latin American thought on labour. Furthermore, it discusses how conditions typical of peripheral economies, such as the super-exploitation of labour, are increasingly prevalent within the platform economy. These conditions are globalised through the worldwide operation of digital platforms. This article seeks to critically analyse this phenomenon from a Latin American perspective, drawing on long-term ethnographic research.",

    "abstract": "\n            Using Google as a case study, this paper analyzes the online advertising sector's search industry. Arguing that search engines are not engines, it examines Google Search as a supply chain composed of five nodes: Crawler, Indexer, Ranker, Publisher, and Data Center. The final product of this chain is the search service presented to Google consumers, complete with ads and ancillary information. Empirically showing that production and exchange are one economic process in most of these supply chain nodes, we argue that treating them separately is neither accurate for description nor feasible for theory. In reality, Google Search produces and exchanges simultaneously. We observe that the social sciences lack an approach to analyze such unitary production/exchange relations in computational industries. Addressing this blind spot, the paper offers an alternative to describe how the search industry works by bridging supply chain literature in management and the economization approach in sociology. We introduce the digital–industrial economization approach to analyze Google Search's supply chain, in which a variety of nodes concurrently produce, exchange, barter, maintain, and/or store search products and their inputs. We present the term\n            prodexchange\n            to characterize these novel integrated production/exchange combinations.\n          ",

    "abstract": "With the establishment of Unified Payments Interface in 2016 and then the demonetization (notebandi) shocker by the Government of India in November of the same year, there was increased movement and accelerated circulation of digital money in Indian society. During the loan approval process, prior monetary transactions, social media activities, and consumer lifestyle purchases stored as tokens and records are scanned in search of alternative datapoints that guide decision-making. Digital transactions continuously transform money into data and vice-versa. The kind of risk-sharing arrangements that loan apps and lenders (NBFCs) get into, often remain opaque to the borrowers/customers, even as such operating relations shape data and money transactions involved in mobile lending. The delivery of loans by lending platforms might seem unmediated and direct, but through careful research, one will find myriad intermediaries such as third-party developers who provide APIs and SDKs as part of fintech infrastructure that drive automated decisions regarding authentication, verification, and loan disbursal. In this paper, I trace the distribution supply chains of payments and lending by mapping this fintech infrastructure, and in doing so, examine the intermediation process in the loan app ecosystem.",

    "title": "The Amazonification of Royal Mail and postal worker identity",
    "abstract": "Postal work has undergone significant transformations with the advent of platformisation that follows on from broader structural changes in the consumption and delivery of communication infrastructure. In this context, an important question is how worker identity is affected, both in terms of sense of self and in terms of ‘who we are’ collectively as an organisation, especially within a sector like postal work that has a history of public service. We investigate this through a case study of Royal Mail based on in-depth interviews with postal workers in the UK. We argue that the organisational features by which postal workers understand and define their identity at Royal Mail are being displaced by features of Amazonification – the mimicking and adoption of Amazon's technologies and organisational culture and practices – which is contributing to a redefinition of postal worker identity and gives rise to new forms of identity struggle. The identity struggle we are pointing to is not purely embedded in processes of privatisation but in the emerging gig economy template and its accompanying algorithmic management techniques. As such, we see a transformation of the features of postal work into those of platform work, and the loss of protection and social purpose that this represents to postal workers. This focus, we contend, is a very significant but largely neglected aspect in current debates on platformisation and the future of work.",

    "title": "Platforms and the governmentality of political consumerism: A critical analysis of review bombing and de/politicization on Steam",
    "abstract": "Platforms often serve as sites for practices of political consumerism, and exposure to news and political content through platforms can lead to increased engagement in such practices as boycotting and buycotting. However, platforms regularly intervene, visibly and invisibly, with the goings-on among their users, favoring their own techno-commercial logics. This critical analysis explores this tension between platforms and consumer protesters, asking how platforms relate to political consumerism through how they problematize and govern its practices. Using a governmentality lens, I focus on the case of review bombing on the video game platform Steam, arguing that the practice serves as an informal participation in politics that has been problematized by Steam as a social wrong within its population of users. Combining an analysis of Steam's public and developer-oriented policy documents with a critical walkthrough of its user review system, I explain how Steam has modified its platform affordances and discourses to directly and indirectly encourage a “helpful” consumer identity for its users while simultaneously depoliticizing reviews, games, and consumerism as a whole. This ongoing process, a discursive negotiation between platform governors and the governed, reveals not only the tenuous nature and future of political consumerism on platforms but also concerns for the increasing disparity in how segments of society conceive of power relations—and how they desire their change.",

    "abstract": "This article offers a two-decade overview of digital payments in Japan, with a focus on the role of convenience stores in the rollout of new payment systems. The aim is both to follow the recent development of code-based payment apps such as SoftBank's PayPay, while also interrogating the appeal to convenience by both the apps themselves and by academic literature on digital payments. The assumption of convenience as a default explanation for the adoption of digital payments in much literature must be resisted in view of Japanese government policy and large-scale incentive campaigns by payment providers encouraging users and retailers to adopt app-based payment systems. In Japan in particular, these incentives were meant to combat the default convenience of cash or other tap-to-pay prepaid cashless options introduced in the early 2000s. The role of convenience stores in the 2018–2019 “cashless payment wars” period under investigation here is to allow the perceived convenience of the retail forms to inflect the experience of the apps themselves. The article further uses this case as an opportunity to reflect on the temporality of convenience itself, as a retrospective explanatory framework for social shifts, and as a process of becoming-default of a new payment system. I term this process conveniencing. The conveniencing of otherwise inconveninent payment apps is the process under analysis here.",

    "title": "The rise of war influencers: Creators, platforms, and the visibility of conflict zones",
    "abstract": "Since February 2022, the war in Ukraine has ushered in a new era of war documentation, with TikTok emerging as a central platform for showcasing daily life in conflict zones. This shift has given rise to “war influencers,” a distinct group of content creators who transform war zones into consumable units of content by using platform-specific vernaculars to convey their lived experiences. We present a typology of war influencers: (1) Celebrity-War Influencers, who leverage their well-established mechanisms of fame to transition into wartime advocacy; (2) User-War Influencers, who harness the powerful dissemination capabilities of platforms to spotlight their sites of trauma, thus rising from anonymity to online fame. Utilizing digital ethnography, we analyze 97 videos from Ukrainian TikTok creators, examining User-War Influencers from the onset of the war. We identify three primary styles employed by these influencers: (1) POV storytelling, using point-of-view templates to connect audiences with personal war testimonies; (2) memetic content, juxtaposing war sights with trending memes to enhance engagement and shareability; and (3) playful politainment, combining entertainment and political commentary through features like LIVE to fundraise and mobilize global audiences. Bridging war photography, citizen journalism, and influencer culture, we argue that war influencers leverage platform affordances and user interactions to amplify war zone visibility, foster civic engagement, and shape global perceptions of conflicts. In doing so, they contribute to the construction of social epistemology, redefining the collective processes through which knowledge about war zones is mediated and understood online.",

    "title": "Injustice by design: A critical technocultural discourse and Latina feminist analysis of Amazon's ACX audiobook labor platform",
    "abstract": "The commercial audiobook arena is a generative site for studying how the value laden designs of digital labor platforms are impacting workers along intersectional lines. Though a global multi-billion-dollar industry that can be traced back to Edison's invention of the phonograph, audiobooks remain relatively understudied, particularly as it relates to audiobook labor. If we are to construct an equitable and just digital labor future, it is critical that we understand how workers experience the work. Additionally, to develop worker protections and policies that are attune to the racialized and gendered dimensions of platform labor, we must be in conversation with diverse workers. This work takes a closer look at Amazon's Audiobook Creation Exchange (AXC) labor platform and centers the experiences of US-Latina audiobook narrators as Amazon has held a virtual monopoly of digital audiobooks. The lack of regulatory frameworks has allowed Amazon free rein to obfuscate and infuse unjust labor practices via the design of its platforms. This allows it to control and surveille the workers and the work, while keeping itself out of reach from accountability. I center U.S.-based Latinas in my analysis because they bring multidimensional perspectives that are critical to detangling how power is operationalized in the digital economy. And, while geographically located within the U.S., Latina voices are under-represented in media, policymaking, and digital/platform labor scholarship. Thus, the North/South binary does not offer a space but, instead, furthers US-Latina invisibility. By employing a braided Critical Technocultural Discourse Analysis (CTDA) and Latina Feminist approach, I surface the ways that an emphasis on Latinas furthers our understanding of platform work. While some of their experiences may not be unique to Latinas, centering these women brings to focus issues and practices embedded within labor platform design that may not be considered from white and/or single-axis perspectives.",

While aiming to curb sex trafficking, FOSTA-enabled platforms to adopt U.S.-centric moderation practices that censor sexual content globally, regardless of national legal frameworks on sex work and both international and country-specific definitions of trafficking. Beyond their failure to effectively support antitrafficking efforts, platforms’ decision to align their policies to the language of U.S. legal discourse can be understood as a breach of state sovereignty. Through their punitive approach against content that fails to comply with their post-FOSTA policies, platforms effectively force users to internalize American legal consciousness, regardless of their geopolitical location. Sex workers are the ones who are most impacted by these decisions, even in countries where their work is not criminalized. To survive online and the offline harms of deplatforming, they readapt their social media behaviors to what we define as the technologies of the FOSTA-self, a set of self-disciplining and self-censoring practices aimed at bypassing platform surveillance and retaining visibility.",

    "title": "‘Eyo, mixed girl check’: The commodification of embodied performance in the #mixedgirlcheck trend on TikTok",
    "abstract": "Feminist media research has provided a wide range of studies exploring how individuals navigate and negotiate their identities within the neoliberal platform economy. Popular feminist ideas and social media representations are often criticized for their lack of diversity and strong focus on Western, white, able-bodied, upper-class ciswomen. In this article, we expand on existing literature by focusing on creators’ self-representations under the #mixedgirlcheck on TikTok. The nomenclature of #mixedgirlcheck implies to present a different form of girlhood (‘mixed’) with the potential to subvert popular femininity. Through critical discourse analysis, we analysed 100 TikTok videos to answer our research question: ‘How do creators represent their identities in videos posted under the #mixedgirlcheck on TikTok?’. Our analysis revealed four prominent patterns in this trend: (1) the embodied performance of ‘mixed’ heritage, (2) negotiating embodied ruptures in normative authenticity and belonging, (3) embodied heterosexual performativity and the idealization of the bourgeois family and (4) capitalizing on the performance of embodied individuality. We discuss how TikTok's neoliberal platform logic rewards performances of the ‘mixed girl’ that cater to a white, heterosexual, cisgender dominant gaze, uncritical of discriminatory structures such as racism, sexism or heteronormativity. This paper contributes to platform studies by critically examining how TikTok's neoliberal platform logic shapes and rewards identity performances under #mixedgirlcheck, revealing both its reinforcement of dominant discriminatory structures and its affordances for momentary ruptures in hegemonic discourses on ‘mixed’ girlhood.",

    "abstract": "This study contributes to research on digital inequalities in the context of artificial intelligence by examining user perceptions of deepfake technology. We focus on the stratification of deepfake knowledge and attitudes towards deepfakes as critical elements of technology access. Based on a survey of 1,421 German internet users, we analyse the role of sociodemographic variables, digital skills, and personal innovativeness in predicting deepfake knowledge. We then examine the role of deepfake knowledge in users ’ assessments of risks and potentials associated with the technology. Our results point to a generally low level of knowledge and a strong focus on risks in internet users ’ perceptions of deepfakes. We find that age, gender and educational attainment predict knowledge about deepfakes. Digital skills, personal innovativeness, and social media use also positively relate to deepfake knowledge. This knowledge, in turn, is shown to play a role in users ’ positive attitude towards the technology. While age plays only a minor role, female gender strongly relates to low knowledge and negative attitudes towards deepfakes. We thus find evidence of a sizeable gender divide in user access to the novel deepfake technology.",

    "abstract": "Online environments can foster opportunities for political engagement but can also hinder democratic deliberation by promoting hostile and polarizing communication. A prominent concern revolves around the attacks on political actors ’ truthfulness in public discourse. Such discourse is expressed through anti-elite and antagonistic attacks on perceived (un)truthfulness employed by some politicians toward political opponents in public debates, and it is argued to maintain a close affinity with populist politics. During crises, when people seek guidance from elites, discourses of untruthfulness can lead to further uncertainty by eroding trust in political leadership. Relying on the extensive claims analysis of 7,109 Facebook posts published by political party leaders between March 2020 and February 2021, this study investigates how accusations of untruthfulness unfold in the social media posts of populist and non-populist political leaders in Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, and Poland during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings show that populist leaders are generally more prone to utilize accusations of untruthfulness in their social media posts than non-populist politicians, but the extent of attacks is context-dependent.",

    "title": "Revisiting John Stuart Mill’s &lt;em&gt;The Subjection of Women&lt;/em&gt;: A Computer-Assisted Stylometric Analysis",
    "abstract": "According to John Stuart Mill’s Autobiography, his mature work should be thought of as “the product not of one intellect and conscience but of three” (J. S. Mill [1873] 1981, 265). He claimed that The Subjection of Women (1869) was co-authored by himself, Harriet Taylor Mill, and Helen Taylor. Most of J. S. Mill’s readers have been largely unconvinced both by his claims of co-authorship and by his encomiums of his co-authors. Rather than strengthening the claims of a common “fund of thought,” collaboration, and co-authorship, his testimony to their abilities undermined them. Those who are most reluctant to take these claims at face value reject the idea that not only did Harriet Mill have an active, pervasive, and everlasting part in John Stuart Mill’s writings, but also that she was the originator of some of his most characteristic ideas. Others, however, readily admit her influence and her originality. Unlike her mother, Helen Taylor has never actually gotten any consideration as her stepfather’s co-author. Given the challenges of assessing authorship for this text through traditional methods, we apply computational stylometric analysis. Should we accept a key tenet of stylometric studies, that an author’s mind engrafts itself onto the text, then we might be able to test J. S. Mill’s claims of co-authorship. This paper presents the state of the question and the results of a supervised machine learning-based authorship identification analysis of the Subjection. We train three classifiers (SVM, K-NN, DT) on a dataset of essays by all three potential authors. These models are then used to attribute segments of the Subjection to individual authors. The most effective models attribute the majority of the text to John Stuart Mill, though stylistic traces suggest contributions from Harriet Mill and, to a lesser extent, Helen Taylor. This is a particularly difficult authorship identification issue to address.\nSelon Autobiography de John Stuart Mill, son œuvre mûre doit être considérée comme « the product not of one intellect and conscience but of three » (J. S. Mill [1873] 1981, 265). Il affirmait que The Subjection of Women (1869) avait été coécrit par lui-même, Harriet Taylor Mill et Helen Taylor. La plupart des lecteurs de J. S. Mill sont restés largement sceptiques, tant face à ses affirmations de coécriture que face à ses éloges de ses collaboratrices. Au lieu de renforcer les affirmations d’un « fonds commun de pensée », de collaboration et de co-auteurialité, ses témoignages sur leurs compétences les ont affaiblies. Ceux qui rejettent le plus nettement ces affirmations refusent l’idée que Harriet Mill ait eu un rôle actif, constant et durable dans les écrits de John Stuart Mill, et encore moins qu’elle ait été à l’origine de certaines de ses idées les plus marquantes. D’autres, en revanche, reconnaissent volontiers son influence et son originalité. Contrairement à sa mère, Helen Taylor n’a jamais été sérieusement considérée comme coautrice de son beau-père. Étant donné la difficulté d’évaluer l’auteur du texte par des méthodes traditionnelles, nous appliquons une analyse stylométrique computationnelle. Si l’on admet un principe fondamental des études stylométriques — qu’un texte porte l’empreinte cognitive de son auteur — alors il est possible de tester les affirmations de J. S. Mill concernant la coécriture. Cet article expose l’état de la question et les résultats d’une analyse d’attribution d’auteur fondée sur l’apprentissage supervisé appliquée à The Subjection. Nous entraînons trois classificateurs (SVM, K-NN, DT) sur un corpus d’essais des trois auteurs possibles. Ces modèles sont ensuite utilisés pour attribuer des segments du texte à chaque auteur. Les modèles les plus performants attribuent la majorité du texte à John Stuart Mill, bien que des traces stylistiques indiquent des contributions de Harriet Mill et, dans une moindre mesure, de Helen Taylor. Ce cas pose un problème d’attribution particulièrement difficile.",

    "title": "Characterizing Asymmetries in the TenTen Corpus Family Membership: An Implicit Hierarchy in Multilingual Digital Tools",
    "abstract": "In this work, we examine the limitations of digital tools in facilitating cross-linguistic and cross-cultural research from a humanistic perspective. Our primary objective is to draw comparisons between the TenTen corpora, assessing their degree of similarity. In order to achieve this goal, we will conduct cluster analysis on the 43 corpora within the TenTen Corpus Family using a set of parameters that characterize this family membership. This analysis pinpoints the TenTen corpora that exhibit the most similar characteristics within the family, bringing to the surface an implicit hierarchy within the Sketch Engine platform, a multilingual digital tool environment. This hierarchy is structured into four distinct clusters, definable by size, number of functional tools, versions, and Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging. The findings of the current study call for prudence when comparing the TenTen corpora, but also suggest a way of improving a multilingual environment; the examination and establishment of connections among the TenTen corpora are imperative for a comprehensive understanding of multilingualism in Digital Humanities.\nDans ce travail, nous examinons les limites des outils numériques dans la facilitation de la recherche interlinguistique et interculturelle d’un point de vue humaniste. Notre objectif principal est de comparer les corpus TenTen, en évaluant leur degré de similarité. Pour atteindre cet objectif, nous réaliserons une analyse de regroupement sur les 43 corpus de la famille des corpus TenTen en utilisant un ensemble de paramètres caractérisant cette appartenance familiale. Cette analyse identifie les corpus TenTen qui présentent les caractéristiques les plus similaires au sein de la famille, révélant une hiérarchie implicite au sein de la plateforme Sketch Engine, un environnement d’outils numériques multilingues. Cette hiérarchie est structurée en quatre groupes distincts, définis par la taille, le nombre d’outils fonctionnels, les versions et le marquage des parties du discours (PoS). Les résultats de l’étude actuelle appellent à la prudence lors de la comparaison des corpus TenTen, mais suggèrent également un moyen d’améliorer un environnement multilingue ; l’examen et l’établissement de connexions entre les corpus TenTen sont impératifs pour une compréhension complète du multilinguisme dans les Humanités Numériques.",

    "abstract": "La popularisation du numérique et la facilité d’accès de nombreux outils de création ont permis aux lecteur·rice·s, joueurs·euse·s et spectateur·rice·s de participer à l’établissement d’univers étendus. Ces individus sont tout autant des artistes confirmé·e·s, rémunéré·e·s pour ce travail, que des amateur·rice·s, plus ou moins expert·e·s dans leur domaine et dans l’œuvre à laquelle iels participent. Comment toutes ces productions s’articulent-elles pour former un univers cohérent ? Quels outils et méthodes pouvons-nous mobiliser pour les comprendre ? La diversité des propositions narratives, de la fanfiction textuelle aux fangames, en passant par des vidéos, reprises sonores, œuvres graphiques, etc., pose la question d’une multimodalité nécessaire à la compréhension d’une fiction. La diversité des supports mobilisés par les univers étendus (romans, films, séries, jeux vidéo, jeux de rôles, fanfictions, visual novels, séries audios parodiques ou non, pièces de théâtre, etc.) permet d’appuyer notre étude sur un vaste corpus que nous pourrons étudier quantitativement autant que qualitativement. Dans cet article, nous faisons une étude exploratoire entre la production des fans et la production officielle d’œuvres littéraires dans l’univers étendu de Star Wars. Nos objectifs sont de développer une méthodologie d’analyse issue des humanités numériques s’intéressant à l’étude des littératures de l’imaginaire, pour documenter la représentativité et l’inclusivité dans ces œuvres. Nous procédons d’abord par la contextualisation des études en littératures de l’imaginaire et au processus de documentation de ces littératures. Ensuite, nous définissions notre méthodologie d’analyse, du moissonnage de données dans les API au traitement des données dans OmekaS. Enfin, nous concluons cet article par une discussion sur les résultats obtenus et les pistes de recherche vers lesquelles ceux-ci nous encouragent.\nThe increased interest in digital technology and the ease of access to numerous creative tools enable readers, gamers, and spectators to take part in the creation of extended universes. These individuals are just as much established artists—paid for their work—as they are amateur artists, more or less experts in their field or in the work in which they are involved. How does all of this work fit together in a coherent universe? What tools and methods can we use to understand it? The diversity of narrative proposals, from textual fanfiction to fangames, videos, audios, graphic works, etc., raises the question of whether multimodality is useful to understand fiction. Since extended universes may be mobilized in a wide range of media (novels, films, series, video games, role-playing games, fanfiction, visual novels, audio series, plays, etc.), we are able to conduct qualitative and quantitative research on our corpus. In this article, we conduct an exploratory study of the relationship between fan production and official production of literary works in the extended universe of Star Wars. Our objectives are to develop an analytical methodology, drawn from works in the digital humanities interested in the literature of the imagination, to document representativeness and inclusivity in the works studied. We begin our article by contextualizing studies of these forms of literature and the process of documenting them. Next, we define our analytical methodology, from data harvesting in APIs to data processing in OmekaS. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the results obtained and the research avenues they yield.\n",

    "title": "“AI-Human Romance,” or, The Deconstruction of Love: A Baudrillardian Discourse Analysis of Hyperreality",
    "abstract": "The digital revolution has partly disembodied humanity, as evermore time and effort are spent on cyberspace, where virtual simulations of the real increasingly preoccupy our minds. The AI is the last simulator joining the party, now also simulating “love” and “romance.” Today, millions of people are entering “love relationships” with the algorithm. Using a discourse analysis and insights on hyperreality from Jean Baudrillard, Mark Slouka, and others, I analyze how “AI-human relationships” are discursively constructed, and how this discourse establishes hyperreality, as the AI and its simulation of intimacy are represented as equivalent to human partners and real love. Love, the codification of intimacy, is deconstructed by this discourse, as the idea of “AI-human love” displaces intimacy and other signs we associate with love, essentially transforming love into the codification of satisfaction, unrelated to the human touch.\nLa révolution numérique a en partie désincarné l'humanité, car de plus en plus de temps et d'efforts sont consacrés au cyberespace, où les simulations virtuelles du réel occupent de plus en plus nos esprits. L'IA est le dernier simulateur à rejoindre la fête, simulant désormais également \"l'amour\" et la \"romance\". Aujourd'hui, des millions de personnes entrent dans des \"relations amoureuses\" avec l'algorithme. En utilisant une analyse du discours et des perspectives sur l'hyperréalité de Jean Baudrillard, Mark Slouka et d'autres, j'analyse comment les \"relations IA-humaines\" sont construites discursivement, et comment ce discours établit l'hyperréalité, car l'IA et sa simulation de l'intimité sont représentées comme équivalentes aux partenaires humains et à l'amour réel. L'amour, la codification de l'intimité, est déconstruit par ce discours, car l'idée de \"l'amour IA-humain\" déplace l'intimité et d'autres signes que nous associons à l'amour, transformant essentiellement l'amour en codification de la satisfaction, sans rapport avec le contact humain.",

    "title": "Remediation and Spectral Bibliography: Ghost Hunting in Early Modern Books",
    "abstract": "This paper explores the layers of remediation and hidden labour embedded in the digitization of early modern texts, focusing on how metadata traces in digital archives can both reveal and obscure the material history of books. Using a bibliographic workflow, this study examines the challenges of distinguishing between material artifacts of the original printing process and distortions introduced through digitization. Through a case study of Thomas May’s The Tragedie of Cleopatra, I analyze metadata from the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) and Internet Archive, alongside correspondence with archivists, to reconstruct the provenance and digitization history of the text. I thus contend that the digitization of early modern texts introduces ambiguities: digital anomalies that can obscure or distort the material history of these works, thereby challenging the reliability of digital surrogates for historical inquiry. This research highlights the stakes of providing scholars with opportunities for in-person archival study, particularly in cases where digital surrogates present anomalies that resist easy categorization. These stakes are especially high for scholars relying on digital scans to conduct research, as addressing these uncertainties requires innovation in digitization processes, and sustained investment in methodologies that bridge the gap between digital and physical archives, ensuring the reliability of digital surrogates for historical inquiry.\nCet article examine les strates de remédiation et le travail invisible impliqués dans la numérisation des textes de la première modernité, en s’attachant à la manière dont les traces de métadonnées dans les archives numériques peuvent à la fois révéler et masquer l’histoire matérielle des livres. En mobilisant un protocole bibliographique, cette étude analyse les difficultés à distinguer les artefacts matériels issus du processus d’impression d’origine des altérations induites par la numérisation. À travers une étude de cas portant sur The Tragedie of Cleopatra de Thomas May, j’analyse les métadonnées issues du English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) et de l’Internet Archive, ainsi que des échanges avec des archivistes, pour reconstruire la provenance et l’histoire de la numérisation du texte. Je soutiens ainsi que la numérisation des textes anciens introduit des ambiguïtés : des anomalies numériques susceptibles d’obscurcir ou de déformer l’histoire matérielle de ces œuvres, remettant en cause la fiabilité des substituts numériques dans la recherche historique. Cette recherche souligne l’importance de garantir aux chercheurs un accès physique aux archives, en particulier lorsque les substituts numériques présentent des anomalies difficiles à classer. Ces enjeux sont d’autant plus cruciaux pour les chercheurs dépendant des scans numériques, car surmonter ces incertitudes exige à la fois des innovations dans les processus de numérisation et un investissement durable dans des méthodologies capables de relier archives physiques et numériques, afin d’assurer la fiabilité des substituts numériques dans la recherche historique.",

Two examples are given to showcase how critical GC pedagogies of power and counter-power can be carried out. ",

    "title": "Rethinking news media from the perspective of epistemic democracy: ‘Democratic imagination’ in the coverage of minoritised activism in Polish liberal media",
    "abstract": " This article contributes to the rethinking of the relationship between news media and democracy by adopting the perspective of ‘epistemic democracy’, characterised by universal and equal participation of all knowers. While this perspective foregrounds the tension between the normative vision of news media as facilitators of democratic deliberation and their actual socio-political position as part of the hegemonic domain, it also enables the reconceptualisation of media’s democratic role as the cultivation of ‘democratic imagination’. On the one hand, media can exercise democratic imagination in their reporting by promoting epistemic diversity. On the other hand, they may extend the public’s horizon of democratic imagination by generating epistemic friction. The article operationalises this process as countering epistemic exclusion of minoritised knowers and employs the three-tier framework borrowed from feminist philosophy as its main heuristic. Empirically, the investigation focuses on the Polish liberal news media’s coverage of minoritised activism. This is a particularly relevant case due to the liberal media’s stake in reimagining democracy in Poland. The article finds that the Polish liberal media were ready to include minoritised perspectives and relay minoritised experiential knowledge, though they were unable to offer them an equal platform.

    "abstract": " In the following article I analyze sports bars for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ+) communities via a combination of semi-structured interviews, field studies, and archival research. In particular, I examine how sports and non-normative sexual and gender identities influence, and are influenced by, media “in situ.” I also seek to better understand how LGBTQ+ sports cultures are constructed by the owners of these bars, by media technologies and rhythms, and by the patrons themselves. Within this approach I address how media and space overlap and inform one another, especially in relation to social and cultural imperatives, and I unpack how these interactions shape particular LGBTQ+ sports spaces. Guided by queer methodological and analytical approaches, I demonstrate how LGBTQ+ sports bars vary in material, contextual, and historical ways and how they are often influenced by competing concerns related to queer(ed) community and normative sports (media). Ultimately, I contend that to understand these spaces as built environments transformed by, and transforming of, LGBTQ+ communities, we must see them, as with most places of LGBTQ+ commerciality, as arenas of both queer potentiality and normalized inequality.

    "abstract": " Platforms are increasingly part of everyday life, but they remain opaque and impenetrable spaces for most users. To manage life on platforms, users thus need to engage with sense-making practices that help them understand and navigate online spaces. This paper studies how far-right populist activists interpret and navigate their presence on Twitter, using the concept of platform folklore, that is, unofficial and collective narratives aimed at relieving feelings of uncertainty associated with the opacity of platforms. The data consists of 20 life-history interviews with Swedish and American Twitter activists from right-wing populist communities, who all participated in populist Twitter debates. The analysis shows how platform folklore is constructed not only based on observations of content moderation, as emphasized in previous research, but also in correspondence with the political ideology and identities of the activists. This led them to interpret Twitter as a leftist organization that disfavored them, which stopped them from developing strategies to reach the goals they held as central to their Twitter activism. The paper concludes by discussing the role of emotions and ideology in platform folklore within political communities and suggesting directions for future research. ",

    "abstract": " This study examines social media discourse in connection with two separate high-profile statutory rape cases involving two male celebrities in Nepal: film and music video actor Paul Shah and cricket icon Sandeep Lamichhane. In the first case, we analyze the discursive actions of the actor’s fans and supporters, who uncritically back him by disputing the credibility of the rape allegation to protect him, all of which appear to further elevate his celebrity status. Conversely, in the second case, we investigate counterpublics’ discursive articulations aiming at giving extrajudicial punishment to the athlete through callouts and boycotts, which degrade his celebrity status. Data were primarily collected from Facebook and Twitter, including external images and hyperlinks shared on those platforms. By examining how individuals support male celebrities and perpetuate rape culture, while others generate counter-hegemonic discourses to combat it, the findings shed light on the interplay between technology, societal norms, and feminist activism.

    "abstract": " If social media are generally considered workplace distractions, how does Meta promote their enterprise social medium, Workplace? Analyzing Meta’s corporate communication, I explore their emphasis on “connectivity” as Workplace’s key selling point, aligning with existing research on Meta’s self-construction. Highlighting three pertinent themes in the corporate communication, I explore how Workplace is promised to (1) subsume the gray media of corporate life (2) turn companies into communities where workers share information boundlessly, even about their personal lives and (3) that these streams of communicative data are ultimately used as a datafied proxy for corporate health via Workplace. I propose that the productivity claimed to result from Workplace’s connectivity hinges on a subtle merging of personal and professional aspects in employees’ lives, which is in line with broader Silicon Valley trends and Meta’s own organizational image. I discuss the implications and limitations of these findings. ",

    "title": "Dependence in the online screen industry",
    "abstract": " The development of an online screen industry, dominated by a few American and Chinese streaming TV services and video-based platforms, triggers critical questions about the commercial and technological dependence of cultural producers within this industry. Drawing on research in media industries and platform studies, this paper develops a conceptual framework to systematically examine this dependence. Pursuing this aim, we propose to shift the focus from specific video platforms or streaming TV services as the starting point of the analysis to the perspective of cultural producers. Through a discussion of current research, we identify four major sources of dependence encountered by cultural producers in the online screen industry: (1) access to data, (2) algorithmic curation, (3) contractual relations, and (4) monetization. While we recognize that there are vital differences between platforms and streaming TV services, we argue that producers throughout the online screen industry face similar challenges in trying to navigate the four sources of dependence. In short, limited access to data and lack of control over content visibility put cultural producers in a fundamentally weak position vis-à-vis tech companies when negotiating contractual relations and terms of monetization.

    "title": "Digital technologies and the protest paradigm: The discursive construction of the #WomanLifeFreedom protests in <i>Time</i> and <i>Wired</i> magazine",
    "abstract": " In today’s hybrid media landscape, scholars have questioned the “protest paradigm” as the leading interpretation of news coverage of protest action. While the press tends to cover protests in rather antagonistic terms, it is simultaneously highly celebratory of the digital, rehearsing long standing techno-utopian and techno-deterministic discourses. This study zooms in on the Iranian #WomanLifeFreedom movement, investigating how the political power of digital technologies is articulated in Time and Wired magazine. The findings highlight an overarching discourse of technology as a double-edged sword intersecting with discourses of tactical creativity, horizontalism, and digital “witnessing”; as well as two marginal but interlinked discourses: technology as last resort and human right. Findings show that while the protest paradigm persists in the contemporary coverage of the #WomanLifeFreedom movement, legitimizing and delegitimizing frames coexist to produce a more nuanced view of the movement, highlighting activist goals and grievances alongside elements of conflict and spectacle. Considering the transnational dimension of the protests, and the U.S. – Iran political context, the paper concludes that both the geography of protest and the integration of digital technologies in activism shape the coverage of contemporary movements.

    "abstract": " Over the past decades, truth-telling commissions aimed at uncovering, confronting and providing justice for the past treatment of children have been established in many countries, including the Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse (RCIRCSA 2013-2017) and the Norwegian Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) (2018-2023). Journalism plays important roles both in triggering commissions of inquiry and in attracting public attention to their work and findings. This paper investigates media reporting on the RCIRCSA and the TRC. The Commissions were not similar in scale, scope or legal powers, however, they both generated spaces for public listening to stories about the consequences of past policies and present practices of child removal, abuse and racism that potentially could change the grand narratives of each nation. Our findings suggest that future commissions should pay particular attention to the structural power of news logics and mediation. We find, despite the widely different cases, consistent patterns of uneven and hierarchical media reporting and overshadowing of First Nations voices and aspirations. ",

    "title": "Media reporting of industrial wastewater issues in Kenya",
    "abstract": " Scholars have acknowledged the public health risks associated with industrial wastewater. Kenya’s close to 5000 industries discharge large volumes of wastewater, but the authorities have barely enforced the law on industrial wastewater disposal and therefore neighborhoods remain exposed to the effects of poorly managed wastewater from the industries. This is an issue of public interest that public media should seek to highlight. This study investigated how Kenyan media, as a public watchdog, reported the issue of industrial wastewater and therefore whether media has been able to set the agenda. The study was guided by three main objectives: (a) How did the media cover the issue of industrial wastewater in Kenya between January 2010 and December 2014? (b) What are public perceptions of the issue of industrial wastewater and the media’s handling of the issue? (c) What is the link between public perception, government policy and media coverage of the issue of industrial wastewater in Kenya? The study employed a mixed methods approach, using content analysis for newspaper articles and survey study for public perception, and therefore the study generated both qualitative and quantitative data. The study found that Kenyan media reporting on issues of industrial wastewater was very infrequent, less detailed, and the articles were not so prominently displayed. Members of the public said they were unhappy with the media for not paying attention to the issue of industrial wastewater and most respondents said they no longer rely on traditional media for information on industrial wastewater. The public is frustrated with the authorities for failing to enforce the law on industrial wastewater disposal and the inability of the authorities to protect communities from harm. Since the public has opted to seek information elsewhere and not the traditional media, it is fair to argue that the media has failed to build the much-needed trust and confidence among its audience that would have enabled it to set the agenda on the issue of industrial wastewater. To win back the public and become effective on the issue, the media should increase the frequency of coverage, seek to display articles on industrial wastewater more prominently and do more to include the voices of the affected communities in their articles.

    "abstract": " Home surveillance cameras provide new ways for Chinese migrant mothers to provide such care. Existing research on migrant women’s motherhood focuses mainly on two-way communication technologies represented by mobile text messages and phone calls, without discussing individual surveillance technologies and their compatibility and contradictions with long-distance motherhood. This study will define visibility based on home cameras as mediated one-dimensional visibility and ask what role home cameras, as a surveillance technology, have played in the remote performance of mothering by female migrant workers in China and what kind of mothering practices they have given rise to. The findings show that the one-dimensional visibility provided by home cameras alleviates the anxieties of migrant mothers regarding the lack of intimacy and supervised education due to the features of being able to watch at any time without having to answer and secretive gazing. With this one-dimensional visibility, migrant mothers can watch their children from a distance and provide behavioral interventions and control. However, these interventions can both promote and diminish intimacy. When the two are in conflict, migrant mothers prioritize maintaining intimate relationships, which can have an impact on their children’s growth. This enriches our understanding of mediated motherhood. ",

    "title": "“More dangerous than sharks”: Cellspace, death, and pathologies of the selfie*",
    "abstract": " Popular discussions about the selfie have often centered on accusations of Narcissism and cultural decay. Alongside this, globally, the selfie has also been associated with accidents, injury, and death. Taking the case of India – the country most closely associated with selfie fatality statistics – this article examines how the equation between selfies and death is the result of the confluence of psychopathological and physio-pathological discourses, and virally circulating news. What medicalized discourse and sensational journalism often miss, is the fact that selfie fatalities are a symptom of technologically augmented spaces. Taking a humanistic approach drawing insights from photography studies, digital media studies, and studies of risk and modernity, the article unpacks how the moral panic around “killer selfies” obfuscates the contradictions of negotiating technological augmentation and spatial risks.

    "abstract": " The global pandemic threw the world in all its asymmetries and diversities into a limit situation without known coordinates. This article suggests that in its aftermath there is actually a call and an opportunity for more than rethinking existing keywords in the field. It argues that the crisis was “improbable” in the meaning of the word offered by Amitav Ghosh who traces a common sense forged by probabilistic science, that expelled the unthinkable from the modern imaginary. Tracking down this regime of certainty, the essay offers a discussion on the place or displacement of the disorderly, the uncertain, and the disruptive in media theory. It submits that reawakening to the improbable, in light of Karl Jaspers’ philosophical anthropology of the limit situation, offers a fruitful conceptual avenue ahead. Apart from introducing the concept of the (digital) limit situation, the article offers a conversation between existential media studies, critical disability studies, feminist STS, and the environmental humanities, by also inviting an extended family of unruly concepts, including dismediation and deferral. It concludes that limit situations can be transformative also for media theory, if we dare to seize them, by means of existential modes of transversal listening to ghostly pasts never fulfilled. ",

    "abstract": " Digital identity has become a central concept in understanding how people’s online presence is shaped and made sense of. Although extensively studied, the prevailing focus has been on how online identities are shaped by digital platforms or how users curate and perform these identities. How users perceive and assess this concept, however, has received comparatively less attention. In this article, we take a qualitative, user-centric approach to the meaning of digital identity, drawing on insights from 17 online focus group discussions involving 86 participants in Portugal. We identify three distinctive understandings – digital identification, self-presentation, and the datafied self – each corresponding to specific facets of users’ online experiences. Our findings underscore the multidimensionality of digital identity, highlighting its dynamic nature and potential for ongoing reinterpretation. This work contributes to the existing literature by highlighting how the concept’s ever-expanding complexity relates to people’s sensemaking practices about identity, agency, and digital platforms in datafied societies.

    "abstract": " We examine how globally oriented-influencers from India utilize specific strategies of content creation to negotiate with the dominant logic of platform affordances to engage with global audiences. It involves individual negotiations by the influencers with the platform affordances in creating content that foregrounds their cultural realities and aspirations while remaining relevant to global audiences. We do so by deploying the critical technocultural discourse analysis (CTDA) framework to understand influencers’ strategic choices and discursive practices as they interact and negotiate with the platform affordances. Our analysis shows two processes that help the influencers communicate their content to the global audience and sustain their local connections and followership: (1) Templatization: a process through which influencers from the global South attune themselves to the technological possibilities of the platform and utilize its features to produce content with a set of replicable patterns, formats, and practices; and (2) Cultural brokering: a negotiation strategy which allows the influencers to foreground and express their quotidian lived realities and cultural experiences in an increasingly globalized digital environment.

    "abstract": " In 2022, Sorella’s Story was launched at the Venice International Film Festival using 360 immersive technologies with the intention to enable empathic responses from viewers as they witnessed the story of a group of Latvian women and a 10-year-old child, Sorella, in their last moments before being killed by Nazi troops and their Latvian collaborators during World War II. This article presents findings of an empathy survey that was completed by viewers of the film at the Venice International Film Festival, the Brisbane International Film Festival and during orientation week at Australia’s largest film schools: the Griffith Film School. The survey was administered to determine whether using 360 immersive storytelling for a film about the Holocaust triggered empathic responses, and if there were different empathic responses in viewers of different ages. Findings indicate that all age groups responded empathically to the experience confirming 360 immersive technologies’ empathy eliciting capacities. Older people scored significantly higher than younger people on empathic responses, indicating the need for more research on generational differences. ",

We argue that the commercial rise of domestic odor mediating technology, such as air fresheners, facilitate a unique form of nature-based simulation where audiences desire the fake over the real and confuse familiar natural odors.

    "abstract": " In today’s competitive media landscape, the future of public service media (PSM) depends on maintaining its legitimacy among the public. While previous research has predominantly approached legitimacy-as-process, with focus on the normative perspective of PSM’s public value, this study adopts a legitimacy-as-perception approach to explore the expectations of the public. Consequently, it examines the extent to which citizens’ and normative perspectives align. Through data from 10 focus group discussions (with 60 participants) conducted in the Czech Republic, we identified four primary dimensions for public expectations for PSM: (1) the expected roles and functions of PSM; (2) the general characteristics of PSM content (to define the desired nature of PSM content); (3) the principles governing the functioning of PSM (to outline how PSM should operate) and (4) specific requirements for PSM news and non-news content. The study shows that, compared to existing normative conceptualisations of PSM’s public value, the public focusses mostly on individual value and, to a limited extent, on societal value, while entirely neglecting industry value. Additionally, rather than referring to abstract concepts, citizens’ expectations revolve around more concrete functions and tasks, with a common denominator: both distinctiveness from commercial media and distinctiveness from multinational VOD platforms that offer globalised content.

Despite its growing significance, research on cultural crowdfunding remains limited. This paper seeks to make an original contribution by examining the impacts of cultural crowdfunding in Japan, focussing on the perspectives of performing artists and representatives of cultural organisations. It underscores the importance of considering local contexts and developing a nuanced understanding of crowdfunding’s role in the cultural and creative industries. To explore artists’ attitudes and approaches towards cultural crowdfunding, this study employs Boltanski and Thévenot’s theories of justification, specifically contrasting the values of the inspired world and the market world. By analysing cultural crowdfunding in Japan, this paper aims to enhance the understanding of artists’ policies and the role of public support for culture in the post-pandemic society. ",

    "abstract": " This study explores the use of incivility and language aggression in social media debates on Biafra separatist agitation. Using the Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) approach, 611 samples which reflected the opinions of pro-Biafra and anti-Biafra groups were analyzed to highlight how incivility and language aggression shape the Biafra agitation social media discourses. Contrary to other studies that situate the use of incivility to the pro-Biafra ingroup alone, this study found that the use of dehumanizing metaphors, threats, and aggressive language are mutual strategies utilized by both pro-Biafra and anti-Biafra ingroups in advancing their viewpoints. A major finding which recurred in the study’s themes is that that lack of genuine post-war reconstruction is a major predictor of incivility and language aggression in the discourse of Biafra agitation. This implies that the mutual animosities present in the debates were driven by historical grudges, ethnic prejudices, and dearth of objective truth-telling. ",

    "abstract": " In late, 2023 the authors of “Global Communication as Standpoint” reached out for responses to their important article. This particular response engages in reconsidering the terms of the “global” in global communication. The authors of “Global Communication as Standpoint” have convincingly called for a stronger attention to the theorization of the global in communication and media studies. To add to this call, the authors here seek to link the concept of the global in communication and media studies to the long idea of Marxist internationalism. Building on the work of CLR James, this paper argues that the historical gap between theorizations of the global and theorizations of the international in communication and media studies are linked to epistemological questions that “Global Communication as Standpoint” opens us up to.

    "abstract": " This article explores how social media entertainment matters for teens and does so by connecting experiences to conditions crucial for well-being. I ask if and how teens experience the content they seek and encounter on TikTok, YouTube and Instagram as worthwhile and meaningful. To answer this question, I analyse qualitative interviews with Norwegian teens. The analysis portrays how teens experience social media entertainment as meaningful in how content connects to self-formation processes, to the need for belonging, and to the agency they perceive to have in user-platforms relations. Theoretically, the study draws on two overlapping but currently unconnected fields of research: media psychology-informed entertainment studies and a capabilities approach. My theoretical aim is to elucidate how these fields complement and contrast each other in relating media experience to well-being. I argue that media psychology offers an operationalization of the same well-being conditions that are central in a capabilities approach, while the latter opens a space for a critique of the platform economy.

    "title": "Where are the working class in the British film industry? Data from the British Film Institute",
    "abstract": " A range of research, including analyses of quantitative data, has demonstrated the existence of inequalities for women and people of colour in the screen sector’s workforce. There has been less data collection in relation to class inequalities, and therefore less analysis of this aspect of the workforce. This paper considers this historic absence of data relating to class and considers a new source of data. Analysis of applicants to the British Film Institute’s Film Fund provides new insight into class inequalities and how they intersect with other demographic categories. This analysis demonstrates the classed patterns of application and success in relation to funding for screen industries in the UK, with the dominance of those from middle class origins throughout each stage of funding. Intersectional analysis of these inequalities shows which groups, at the intersection of class, race and gender, are more likely to receive funding. Drawing on Nwonka’s groundbreaking work on race and data in the screen sector, the paper concludes by highlighting the limitations of solely ‘data-driven’ responses to screen- and creative-sector inequalities, and the need for broader considerations of the structural factors in play.

    "abstract": " Datafication is reshaping feminism, as feminist pioneers, groups and communities increasingly engage with data practices for advocacy, activism and social change. This is a netnographic study exploring how feminist actors in China appropriate the emerging technology of datafication to develop grassroots narratives for pursuing gender justice, focussing on two pioneering feminist collectives as key studies. The study begins by reviewing the role of gender data in women’s empowerment within China’s socio-political context, followed by an outline of the feminist data narrative concepts that combine Couldry’s theory of data as narrative with insights from data feminism. Using these two cases, it illustrates how and why these collectives engage in data feminism to foreground gender justice. These examples demonstrate the ways in which data narratives offer transformative and empowering potential, generating new epistemic imaginaries of feminism in China. Ultimately, this paper underscores a paradigm shift towards the datafication of feminist narratives, connecting the contextual realm to the relational dynamics of data science for her social good. ",

    "abstract": " In today’s global media landscape, the integration of LGBTQ characters and storylines in children’s television has transformed media representations for young audiences. However, little is known about the way parents evaluate this on-screen presence. By means of interview with 53 Flemish parents, this study uncovered a complex interplay of considerations related to children, media, gender, and sexuality. In terms of possible opportunities associated with LGBTQ characters, parents referred to possibilities of information, socialization, promoting prosocial behavior, and aiding identification. However, parents also harbored some concerns regarding characteristics of the viewers (children’s young age and gender differences) as well as characteristics of these media representations (as to quantity, quality, and physicality between characters). Parents mentioned they were worried about the perceived maturity needed to comprehend what these LGBTQ characters represent, and they showed more discomfort with gender diversity (trans and non-binary characters) than sexual diversity (non-heterosexual characters). They also feared that an overabundance of LGBTQ references might prioritize “political correctness” over authentic representation, which moreover could confuse children. ",

    "abstract": " This paper takes the recent introduction of AI-powered television news anchors in China as an invitation to explore the technologies and techniques that have long been used in the anchor’s voice production. Analyzing Chinese Broadcasting Science, the first pedagogical standards for broadcasters across mainland China, published in 1993, this paper demonstrates how the perception of the anchor’s voice as something that can be measured, manipulated, and programmed has predated the AI industry. We examine guidelines, diagrams, and figures used to instruct news anchor wannabes on training their physiological voicing “engine,” tracing the continuities between this model of television anchoring and AI-generated news anchors. We propose technovocality as a conceptual framework for considering the various social, political, and ethical questions arising from the intersections between voices and media, past and present and Western and non-Western cultural contexts.

    "abstract": "Digital disconnection is increasingly sparking widespread debate and action, with social media age restrictions and phone bans being enacted around the world. As more people are required or encouraged to disconnect from the Internet, this commentary argues for more inclusive and practical disconnection strategies, particularly for those with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD highlights the complexities of digital disconnection, as individuals with this neurodivergent condition are often seen as the intended beneficiaries of digital detox retreats, disconnection interventions, and emerging public policies such as social media or high school phone bans. This commentary seeks to facilitate dialog and debate among digital disconnection scholars, offering a starting point for researchers interested in digital disconnection, screen time, disability, neurodivergence, and digital inclusion. By examining digital disconnection from contrasting ADHD theoretical perspectives, the paper aims to broaden the understanding of digital disconnection, considering diverse relationships with technology and the socio-cultural contexts of screen use and productivity.",

Social media is an online space where women can practise citizenship, where the sense of belonging and norms of what it means to be a citizen are negotiated. This study explored how women in the United Arab Emirates use social media as a public space for negotiating an Emirati identity. Focus groups were conducted with young Emirati women. Results reflected the complexities of women’s move from private to public online spaces in a society where it is uncommon for women to participate in public life. This research offers theoretical implications for the role of social media in facilitating cultural citizenship processes outside Western contexts.",

    "abstract": "As mobile media is expanding its roots in rural spheres of the Global South, and that too among girls and women, concerns related to their engagement with digital technologies are also emerging. These concerns are emerging owing to the belief that women are not capable enough to handle digital technologies and may fall prey to untoward and harmful activities. This study tries to understand if and how mothers in rural households become gatekeepers of everyday digital practices of young girls in the global south through in-depth interviews with girls and their mothers living in villages in India. Mothers are found to be reinforcing the patriarchal norms in the mobile phone usage of their daughters and hence, further the concept of patriarchy in the online sphere. This enforcement might emerge as an important factor in gender digital divide in the Global South.",

    "abstract": " The legal environment particularly the body of laws that regulate media operations are telling, yet underexplored, indicators of press freedom. Using the analytical concept of episodes of contention based on a reading of contentious politics, the article examines the ambivalent state of press freedom in the Philippines. The argument is that the protracted issues of media access and libel serve as two episodes of contention that identify extant and emerging sets of actors, mechanisms, and claims that collectively characterize the role of media law in the body politic. Drawing from interviews with journalists and review of the Supreme Court rulings about media access and libel, the hope is to underscore the potential and limits of the Court as an ally of the media in advancing press freedom. The decision of the Court does not at all times favor a liberal interpretation of press freedom but it deploys ways including dissenting opinions that can balance, if not outrightly oppose, the occasional negative view of the Court toward media-related cases.

    "abstract": " The article explores the democratic value of listening by examining what listening to radio phone-in programmes and listening more broadly mean to people in times of crisis. Drawing on focus groups with London residents severely affected by the cost-of-living, health and social care crises, the article discusses how participants engaged in listening and discussed its significance. Against what we call a ‘crisis of listening’, namely, a rapid shrinking of the spaces and possibilities for listening and a profound sense among people of not being listened to by the political system, the health system and other authorities, participants appreciated listening to phone-in shows and to fellow focus group participants. Listening unifies listeners around common experiences, facilitates building commonalities and enables the public expression of vulnerability in a period of increased isolation and intensifying individualism. At the same time, commercial and exploitative logics shaping phone-in shows foster polarised debate and delegitimise differing opinions, thus reinforcing a deepening crisis of listening. The article concludes by calling for a reorientation of public life around listening and a reorganisation of our commitment as researchers to contribute to listening as an ethical project. ",

    "abstract": " When choosing what to watch, television audiences habitually default to particular channels, shows and apps as part of their everyday routines. Additionally, streaming platforms and devices also default to particular content, services or ads as determined by their software settings. In other words, television viewing is commonly shaped by both behavioural and technological defaults. How can television audience research account for these two distinct, yet related, phenomena? What does defaulting mean for our understanding of media choice in the streaming age? Drawing on the authors’ recent empirical work, this article develops a conceptual framework for understanding the role of defaults in contemporary television viewing. Our analysis synthesises ideas from fields of knowledge that are rarely considered together – television audience studies, platform studies and the sociology of habit – to revise longstanding debates about defaults, and to update them for the present context of streaming television.

    "title": "Rethinking keywords in media and cultural studies during and beyond COVID-19: Editorial",
    "abstract": " A few years after the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the globe, discussions surrounding its impact have become noticeably less frequent within communication and media research. While the pandemic no longer occupies the central place it once held in academic discourse and public debate, it is now more crucial than ever to consider how this unprecedented global event has shaped our societies, as well as its lasting implications for communication and media worldwide. This Crosscurrents themed issue invited scholars to reflect on how the cultural and social implications of this global event solicit a reorganization and reframing of some of the existing conceptual and theoretical tools that have shaped media and cultural studies as a field. Contributors moved from one specific keyword to consider how these notions are imbricated by the crisis, either COVID-19 specifically or in more general terms. This editorial provides an overview to the themed issue and highlights the benefit of considering the impact of the pandemic from a broader and longer perspective, which moves away from the language and rhetoric of emergency.

    "abstract": " The arrival of refugees in large numbers has created heated political and public debates across various arenas. Online spaces, specifically social networking platforms, have become a major site for people to express their opinions, feelings, and beliefs toward refugees. Drawing on the principles of corpus analysis, the Discourse-Historical Approach, and multimodal critical discourse analysis, this mixed-methods study explores how online discourses are utilized to portray Ukrainian refugees in Turkish tweets in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The findings showed that the linguistic and visual elements used to characterize Ukrainian refugees, as well as the characteristics attributed to and presumptions and justifications made about them, constructed a positive portrayal, unlike the portrayals of other major refugee groups reported in the literature. This positive representation of Ukrainian refugees as welcomed guests was reinforced through the negative depiction of other refugee groups in Türkiye, particularly Syrians and Afghans, as threats.

    "abstract": "\n            This Crosscurrent notes the rising phenomenon of online platform migration and technology non-use, fueled by the emergence of new social media platforms and increasing societal polarization. As platforms such as X (formerly Twitter) and Meta face backlash over issues such as misinformation, fact-checking, conspiracy theories, and toxic discourse, alternatives like BlueSky, Mastodon, and Threads are attracting users. Revisiting the concept of\n            platform migration\n            and\n            disconnective practice\n            , this Crosscurrent contribution highlights both temporary and permanent shifts, exploring motivations through the lens of push-pull theory, including dissatisfaction with platform policies, peer influence, and the pursuit of safer, more inclusive digital spaces. I contend that migration extends beyond individuals to entire communities, reshaping social connections and digital ecosystems. In addition, while migration and disconnection may be related, they remain distinct concepts within the broader study of disconnection in our hyper-connected, globalized society. By studying platform migration as both a personal and collective act, this Crosscurrent underscores the need for interdisciplinary scholarship to understand its societal impact and implications for the future of online discourse.\n          ",

    "abstract": " Military metaphors have been used intensively and excessively against the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide since its outbreak in 2020. In this article, we consider “war” and “military” analogies as keywords to approach the pandemic culture by examining the use of war metaphors at the time of COVID-19 and its relationship with selective “war” memories in the first year of the global outbreak of the pandemic. Specifically, we underpin the heterogeneity of such use of metaphors and their relationships with geopolitics, collective memory, and nationalism. We examine the contexts in which these war frames against COVID-19 were articulated and their affective and discursive implications to geopolitics outside of a Western-centric context through two case studies in East Asia – Hong Kong’s bottom-up military analogies in the post-Anti-ELAB era and Taiwan’s biopolitical nationalism against China. Our discussion underscores the significance of contexts in considering the purpose and impact of military metaphors against COVID-19, and also other diseases and even disasters of all kinds in the future, by highlighting the geopolitical trajectories outside of North America and Europe, where regional war memories and military tensions are referenced to inform local definitions of security, safety, and securitization practices.

    "abstract": " Digital media have been playing an increasingly pivotal role in reshaping urban spaces, landscapes, and lifestyles across the world. In China, the rapid development of digital infrastructure, platforms, and e-commerce has fueled the rise of a number of so-called wanghong cities. A term originally employed to denote internet celebrities, wanghong as a social phenomenon, practice, and modus operandi now penetrates different spheres of life in China. This article presents a case study of a new wanghong city, Zibo, a third-tier industrial city that rose to sudden fame in 2023 with the aid of livestreaming and short video. Extending Manovich’s idea of “transcoding” between the cultural and the digital, this article investigates how the logics, aesthetics, and sensibilities of digital (social) media increasingly carry over to the “imagineering” of built environment—particularly urban place-making—within interlocking processes of mediatization and culturalization. Mediatized culturalization of urban places in China prompts us to critically reflect on deeper questions around the right to and the future of our cities in the social media era. ",

    "abstract": " This article contributes a missing insight into the everyday experiences of local journalists when reporting on stories involving Muslims. Using qualitative interviews with local and national journalists on their experiences of reporting stories involving Muslims, I investigate how ideas of belonging shape their journalistic practices. The study finds that the experiences of national journalists mirror the Othering of Muslims found in studies of press discourse, reflecting national newspapers’ preoccupation with questions relating to the loyalty and belonging of British Muslims. In contrast, the experiences of local journalists’ and their very different interpretations of journalism built on ideas of community, audience and public interest reflect conscious efforts towards fairer reporting on stories involving Muslims. Using Charles Taylor’s concept of social imaginaries to make sense of these findings, I demonstrate how the accounts of the local journalists reflected a social imaginary of their audiences that very much included, rather than excluded, local Muslim communities. This inclusive social imaginary became reflective of the practices of local newspapers, both in terms of their media outputs and their own journalistic identity. ",

    "abstract": " Local voices carry tremendous weight during natural disasters, yet the possibilities for employing participatory communicative practices for disaster management in India have not been fully explored. Effective community-centred disaster communication garners participation in disaster management processes that reduce vulnerabilities. This paper examines how various community-based organisations used community radio to enhance community engagement and the effectiveness of the disaster management processes in the eastern Indian state of Odisha. The research relies upon case studies of disaster communication practices of two community radio stations during the ‘very severe cyclonic storm’ Yaas, which made landfall in Odisha. It describes the conceptual shift in the disaster risk reduction approach towards community participation and the role of information and communication in disaster management. It then discusses the historical trajectories of disasters and vulnerabilities in Odisha. The following sections analyse how the social relationships facilitated by community radios augment the effectiveness of the disaster communication process. The paper explains how two community radio stations engaged with the communities to promote early warning, preparedness, response and revitalising measures during Cyclone Yaas. It argues for prioritising community radio as a component in all disaster communication endeavours as a means to strengthen community capacities and enhance community resilience. ",

After summarizing the diverse and rich tradition of understanding the global in communication and media studies and beyond, we theorize that a global communication standpoint is characterized by a combination of four aspects that can be embraced across the discipline: contextualization, historical rootedness, attention to power, and engagement with issues of relationality and comparison. First, we offer examples of the four elements based on existing scholarship. Second, we analyze how these four elements can be embraced in pedagogy. Finally, we survey recent job market dynamics to analyze the definition of the global by professional practice. We conclude by arguing that the embracement of global communication as a standpoint can benefit research across our discipline, regardless of research questions, methods, contexts, or scholars’ identities.

    "abstract": " On the 8th of September, 2022, the world paused as the BBC announced the death of Queen Elizabeth II. After 70 years on the throne, the longest-reigning British monarch had died aged 96. The Queen’s death immediately became a global media event that would eventually culminate in the state funeral broadcasted live and followed online worldwide. While many legacy media maintained the classical ceremonial mode of reporting the media event, the narratives and visuals on social media instantaneously challenged and re-narrated the ‘official’ media event dramaturgy. Through digital media ethnography of the media event, unfolding live in both legacy media and on social media platforms, this article demonstrates how diverse social media publics reacted to the legacy media narratives. Special emphasis is placed on the coverage of and the reactions to three parts of the event on BBC and on Twitter: (1) breaking news of the Queen’s death, (2) the Lying-in-State and (3) the State Funeral. The article concludes with a reflection of how the performances of live participation on social media created diverse dramaturgies and how those dramaturgies spoke to very different publics and consequently created a variety of possibilities to interpret the event and its meaning in history.

    "abstract": "Drawing from my ethnographic fieldwork among the Buddhist communities residing in the Himalayas, the article proposes an ancient Buddhist philosophical conceptualization as a novel theoretical framework to conceive human communication not as a linear exchange of information but as a mundane epistemological practice. Locating the modern conceptualization of communication at the core of the vocation of academic knowledge production, this article argues that the foundational premises rooted within the conceptualization of communication result in unequal, colonial, and extractive self-other dynamics within knowledge generation practices. The article argues that to resolve the intractable self-other relationality, which results in various forms of inequities, it is imperative to decenter the (Western) meta-scientific worldviews and recenter the mundane epistemic practices of the communities.",

    "title": "The financial ecologies of transnational television production: “Following the money” from private equity to Sky Germany’s\n            <i>Pagan Peak</i>",
    "abstract": "\n            Private equity firms and institutional stakeholders increased their investments in television production amid the streaming boom of the late 2010s and early 2020s. Taking advantage of new regulations and demand from streaming services for localized production in Europe, U.S.-based private equity firms started purchasing local film and television production companies and concentrating power in regional production conglomerates. A simple “follow the money” approach to this phenomenon might over-assign ownership and thereby operational control to these financial stakeholders. However, a more holistic approach to following the money, which offers a plastic and relational ecology with different axes of power between different stakeholders for a given television production, complicates our understanding of private equity in transnational television. This article examines the transnational financial ecology of one of these private equity firms’ regional production conglomerates (KKR’s Leonine Studios) and the capital threads connected to one of its programs (\n            Pagan Peak\n            ). Relying on publicly available industry deep texts and background interviews with television professionals, this case study presents the paradoxical opportunities that private equity capital specifically and television investment generally offer at the same time that they can exploit, concentrate, and extract.\n          ",

    "title": "Between cultural promotion and nation building: Analysing the drivers of Basque public television consumption over a decade",
    "abstract": "Public broadcasting systems are tasked with providing citizens with high-quality information and exposing them to diversity, based on professional autonomy and political independence. In polarised pluralist systems like that of Spain, public broadcasters often face politicisation, and political attitudes are strong predictors of media exposure. In Spain – alongside the national public broadcasting service (RTVE) – several regional broadcasting systems were established by regional governments during the decentralisation of the 1980s to strengthen regional cultural identities and promote minority languages. However, the predictors driving the consumption of these regional broadcasts have remained unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by analysing the predictors of exposure to Basque public television (EiTB) over an 11-year period (2009–2020), drawing on four post-electoral studies and covering four Basque regional elections. Through logistic regression analysis, we examine how national identity, Basque nationalism, mother tongue and place of birth predict EiTB consumption, while controlling for variables such as age, sex, education level and ideological position on the left-right spectrum. The findings reveal that voting for Basque nationalist parties and feeling exclusively Basque are the key consistent predictors for EiTB consumption over time. We discuss the normative implications of these findings and argue that the role of Basque public television has fluctuated between cultural promotion and nation building.",

    "abstract": "Recent book bans in America and the UK grew to record numbers in 2023, with most of the banned books focusing on LGBTQ issues and characters. Conservative groups have worked to frame their efforts as “parents’ rights,” common-sense restrictions on ideas and language not suitable for young audiences, starting with campaigns to keep books with sexual topics out of public school libraries. Opponents of the bans argue that eliminating access to books suppresses the voices of non-heteronormative groups. One of the most frequently banned books became an especial focus in the early 2020s, and its author’s voice featured in British stories but rarely American news. Juno Dawson and her work This Book Is Gay became a voice for other authors of banned books, but our analysis shows authors’ voices are rarely heard in these stories and news outlets tend to frame the debate in somewhat predictable ways, setting opponents and ban supporters against each other with librarians caught in the middle. Our thematic analysis of 178 news stories published from 2014 to 2023 in which “This Book is Gay” appeared used Chat GPT as an intermediary “coder” and found five common frames in the stories.",

    "abstract": "My research delves into the intricacies of smart speakers technology and its adoption by Romanian users, despite the absence of direct sales and Romanian language support. Interest in smart devices, particularly smart speakers, has been evident in Romania since 2018. This unique context, similar to other countries in the Global South, prompted me to investigate the usage and implications of these devices. In this article, I explore the subtle and often unconscious meanings associated with smart speaker usage in Romanian households. In this article I use the concepts of “Big Mother,” “smart wife,” and “digital housekeeping” to interrogate how smart speakers are transforming the domestic sphere under the auspices of caregiving. Smart speaker usage in Romania reveals a globally prevalent technological mindset that indicates a male-dominated approach to introducing technologies into the domestic space, with women often considered passive adopters of these technologies. Although women’s roles have greatly expanded, within the domestic space, women are still struggling with secondary positions and are carrying the burdens of household management. This disparity is exacerbated by the introduction of smart speakers and similar devices, which, rather than simplifying life, complicate it and deepen the gender divide.",

    "title": "Reimagining digital inclusion through platform economies in Brazil",
    "abstract": "This article considers how community-led organisations in Brazil are reformulating debates surrounding digital inclusion in the face of the consolidation of platform capitalism. It does this through exploration of how two NGOs cultivate spaces for exchange and dialogue in rural and urban areas of the country’s Southeast. The first, SILO, works with communities in rural, peripheral and protected areas to respond to local challenges using art, science and technology, while the second, AfroGames, offers esports training to disadvantaged young people across the city of Rio de Janeiro. Building on discussions with those behind each NGO in March 2024, the article examines how both organisations reproduce and break from large-scale state and civil society efforts to promote social, cultural and digital inclusion in Brazil in the early 2000s. A key contention of the article is that contemporary efforts to promote digital inclusion in Brazil cannot be divorced from territorially rooted mobilisations for social justice. At the same time, it attends to key differences between the work of the NGOs analysed and the digital inclusion efforts of the early 2000s, for example, as regards their approach to free and open culture and the potential of the video games industry. The article argues that the work of both NGOs shows how, in the hands of communities and activists, even expressions of digital culture widely associated with platform economies, capital accumulation and individualism, such as retail platforms and esports, can be turned to provocative and emancipatory ends. It concludes by considering how the work of both NGOs contributes to recent research exploring the complexities of how platforms land in Latin America through their focus on how sociocultural practices and platforms intersect, reworking the strategies of Brazil’s digital inclusion movement and probing of the limits of autonomy in an era of pervasive platform capitalism.",

    "abstract": "\n            This article examines representations and discussions of Eileen Gu, a biracial athlete who represented China in the 2022 Winter Olympics and won two gold medals and one silver medal, on Chinese state-owned and social media. Despite Gu’s unprecedented achievement, her identity drew controversy in China. This comparative study of media discourses on Gu reveals how Chinese identity is contested in a global context. The analysis suggests that state-owned and social media use different rhetoric to discuss Gu’s Chinese identity as either a state of being or a process of becoming. State-owned media highlight Chinese identity as a “being” by emphasizing Gu’s kinship and cultural ties to China, thus acknowledging her essentialized identity as a Chinese. Social media, represented by\n            Zhihu\n            , underscore Chinese identity as a “becoming” that is not only based on connections to China but also on reiterated performances of Chinese culture and commitment. Social media users largely negate Gu’s Chinese identity due to her perceived failure to provide sufficient evidence that she has become Chinese. The two modes of rhetoric reflect the state’s and ordinary citizens’ respective relationships with global elites, which have shaped their varied framings of Gu.\n          ",

Journalists act as focal agents shaping how society addresses these issues, including climate change and social inequality. In this article, we investigate how journalists act as visibility agents – that is, agents who make visible such issues in the media, culture, and society more generally. Drawing on interviews with Nordic journalists, this exploratory qualitative study shows how journalists address the (in)visibility of environmental and social issues in four primary ways: uncovering wrongdoing, moderating false and inadequate information, explaining complex social/environmental topics, and popularizing issues. The study advances literature on mediated visibility and the relationships between journalists and political and economic leaders by explaining how the former approach the task of visibilizing environmental and social problems.",

    "abstract": "This article presents an analysis of Dutch television coverage of Ukrainian refugees, and shows how television has crafted affects of care and solidarity through a politics of representation that celebrated proximity and sameness of “us” and “them.” The research is based on an analysis of Dutch news, talk-shows and current affairs programs over the time-span of 1 year, collected from the archive of Sound and Vision. The article shows how television has produced and circulated affects of care and solidarity for Ukrainian refugees, and has contributed to the affective economy of migration that makes possible and capitalizes upon the distinction between deserving and undeserving migrants. Through its imaginations of Ukrainian refugees as white, family-oriented, caring, economically beneficial, and morally legitimate, television has transformed Ukrainian refugees into objects of collective care and solidarity. However, the article argues, this care and solidarity has proven to be both narcissist and self-centered, and conditional and discriminatory. Television has rendered the Dutch nation as caring, hospitable, and morally untainted, but has simultaneously reproduced racial hierarchies and perpetuated the myth of a white Europe and the neoliberal discourse of deservingness.",

The discussion draws from ideas on locational advantage and the mix of factors that affect inequalities in AI development and how this influences the ability that countries have to shape AI norms, cultures and governance. It analyses policy documents and internet databases to highlight Africa’s place in AI development, the continent’s governance approach and the symbiotic relationship that explains the influence of advanced countries and tech corporations in the AI landscape. Based on this, it proposes the concept of the ‘politics of locationality’ to extend our understanding of how the power resident in AI systems is associated with their primary situatedness and how this reality, in turn, (re)produces imbalances and unequal opportunities for Africa in AI development and governance. It concludes with implications for Africa’s contribution to global AI cultures, design and governance at this time of pressing need for well-balanced AI policies.",

Using grounded theory, first-person language is explored as a unique journalism practice in podcasting, its utility as both a journalistic and storytelling device, and its subversion of Westernized objectivity norms. This study’s analysis found that podcast journalists used their own lived experiences conveyed through a spectrum of journalistic storytelling devices, including reflexive narration, retrospective reporting, memory recollection, translational storytelling, community alignment, metajournalistic discourse, and eye-witnessing. By investigating podcasting’s narrative techniques and its positioning within the process of collective memory, this research sheds light on podcasting’s role in amplifying marginalized voices, examining complex social justice issues, and pushing boundaries in journalism culture in the United States.",

    "abstract": "\n            This article examines the gamification of intimacy with AI, through China’s XingYe, a multimodal AI companion platform that integrates role-playing game (RPG) mechanics, algorithmic responsiveness and user-generated markets to reconfigure human-virtual human relationships. Drawing on 9-month autoethnographic engagement, we argue that XingYe operationalises what we term the\n            gamification of intimacy\n            – a design paradigm that commodifies emotional labour by rendering affection efficient, quantifiable and achievement-oriented. Users engineer customisable AI companions through ludic acts of co-creation, navigating tiered progression systems and gacha-style rewards that transform intimacy into a structured, transactional process. Simultaneously, XingYe blurs boundaries between fiction and lived experience, enabling real-time narrative remediation and the monetisation of AI agents as tradable commodities. This hybrid relationality challenges traditional notions of parasociality, positioning AI-mediated intimacy as a liminal space of\n            technocultural negotiation\n            where algorithmic agency and user desire converge. By framing emotional bonds as both labour and leisure, XingYe exemplifies the industrial production of connection under platform capitalism, raising critical questions about agency, data sovereignty and the neoliberal optimisation of vulnerability. The study contributes to debates on human-machine communication by interrogating how gamified AI systems reshape intimacy into a crowdsourced, market-driven practice, urging scholars to transcend anthropocentric frameworks and address the ethical implications of affective commodification in digital ecosystems.\n          ",

    "abstract": "This study examines the relationship between content creators and multi-channel networks (MCNs) in China’s platform economy through the lens of labor coercion. While previous literature has mainly addressed the flexibility and precarity of creators, little attention has been paid to understanding how profit-driven entities like MCNs shape creative practices. Drawing on lawsuit documents and in-depth interviews with creators, this study introduces the concept of “tethered labor” to examine the tension between creation and coercion across three key dimensions: dependency, de-flexibilization, and resilience. The findings reveal that creators are heavily reliant on MCNs for content production and monetization, often involuntarily due to the threat of MCNs’ punitive power. This dependency enables MCNs to exert substantial control over creators, making creation increasingly de-flexible. However, creators develop tactics to navigate such coercion, and the ongoing struggle has the potential to destabilize MCNs. The results demonstrate that tethered labor constrains the autonomy and flexibility traditionally associated with creative work.",

    "abstract": "PSM organisations across the globe have been disrupted by a generalised switch in media consumption towards online and the rise of big tech platforms. This article argues that because, in the digital environment, the role that PSM plays in underpinning democracy and promoting social cohesion is pretty much essential to the proper functioning of everyday life and national security, PSM now deserves recognition as a critical infrastructural asset. From this starting point, we ask what if any insights PSM organisations might garner through studying the experience, functioning and performance of organisations in other critical sectors such as rail, aviation and healthcare. Our findings, drawing on UK-based multi-case analysis, highlight the importance of themes including interdependence, industry structure and universality, public versus private ownership and resilience. They also highlight how frameworks developed relating to protection of critical infrastructure can usefully be applied to PSM to yield insights about strengthening the resilience of PSM in the digital environment.",

    "abstract": "The 1995 Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action developed at the Fourth United Nations World Conference on Women acknowledged the media as a vital arena for the advancement of women’s equality. Now, thirty years after the Beijing Declaration, it is clear that structural inequalities within journalism and the media continue to shape representations of women and thus the advancement of gender equality. From this starting point, this article examines how images are used in print media reporting on femicide within intimate relationships. It asks how newspapers have visualized incidents of femicide, how this shapes narratives and understandings of domestic violence, and what this means for women’s equality. Drawing on two examples from the media in the United Kingdom and Italy, this article situates the cases within national regulatory frameworks and compares the visual representation of femicide in the printed press in the two countries as a means of understanding core principles of cultural and political narratives (visual and written) in the reporting on femicide in both countries.",

    "abstract": "\n            The rise of platforms has transformed our understanding of contemporary capitalism, with the critical literature describing how these firms leverage unprecedented digital powers to extract monopoly rents – perhaps even heralding a new form of Feudalism. This paper draws on the literature on financial narratives to examine the role that such stories play within the form of capitalism that they describe, and what this suggests for the role of “hype” in contemporary capitalism. The same stories that for critical scholars appear as menacing threats of “technofeudalism” or “surveillance capitalism” for investors appear as optimistic stories of promising future returns. By driving financial investments, narratives afford platforms very real social and political powers, enabling them to function as a form of self-fulfilling prophecies. The paper argues for a cultural inflection to the political economy of Big Tech – viewing capitalism as neither mechanistic nor rational, but as an expression of a complex interplay between narrative, technology, and economic power. This suggests the need for a\n            critical hype studies\n            , geared at deconstructing the narratives undergirding the technological waves of capitalist pursuits, and examining the broader role of hype in coordinating and directing flows of capital within contemporary financialized capitalism.\n          ",

    "abstract": "This article explores the experience of racism amongst practitioners of colour in the advertising industries in the UK and US, home to some of the world’s largest, flagship agencies and supposed leaders in equality, diversity and inclusion. The research was conducted in two study periods, one between 2013 and 2015, and a second between 2021 and 2023 following the murder of George Floyd in 2020 which saw a rise in organisational commitments to diversity. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with practitioners working in advertising agencies from a range of racial backgrounds, as well as ethnography within two of these organisations. The research reveals how racist discourse has changed overtime and the impact such conversations have on working praxis. In particular, the study argues that racism occurs in both work-based and informal settings, which both ultimately impact on career progression. Lastly, the paper shows how forced EDI secondments can be weaponised to redact practitioners of colour from high profile client work, and used as an exclusionary tactic.",

    "abstract": "This article investigates growing tensions between global AI ethics and local practices contributing to long-standing debates in media and communication studies on the complex relation between the human and the machine, as well as ‘the global’ and its ties to real-world contexts. We argue that seemingly universal principles such as privacy, accountability and transparency need to be scrutinised by considering the role cultural and social diversity around the globe play in the context of AI. Drawing on examples of a global qualitative study on digital ethics, we introduce the notion of ‘situated ethics’ by focussing on local contexts, concerns and lived experiences. We elaborate how supposedly universal principles are filled with varying, context-specific meanings, and argue that these situated, local perspectives deeply matter when considering how ethical AI principles can be translated into concrete AI design and policy. Strengthening more inclusive processes of AI policy-making under the consideration of situated approaches allows for a more nuanced, and more contextually relevant ethics-in-practice. To conclude, we argue that co-design and community-driven processes could help to avoid top-down approaches to digital ethics, while staying committed to universal human rights to fight power abuse and discrimination in the name of cultural values.",

    "abstract": "Daycare management apps – marketed to care centers as a way to streamline operations and improve parent-caregiver communication – have quickly moved from relative obscurity in 2016 to near-omnipresence in center-based childcare. These apps mediate the work of caregiving and are thus a growing aspect of the nexus of cultural anxieties about how to manage reproductive labor, parenting, and gendered expectations of mothering. In this paper, we engage in a close reading of five major daycare apps in the US – Brightwheel, Lillio (formerly HiMama), My Bright Day, Procare, and Tadpoles – to investigate how they structure the experience and labor practices of both parenting and non-parent caregiving. As such, we read the app interfaces as material practices through which parents and caregivers grapple with the contradictions of the care crisis and contemporary conditions of parenting. Throughout this article, we attend to the ways that the technological imaginary unfolds in a specific site within the broader context of caregiving in the United States, ultimately arguing that these apps reflect and reaffirm caregiving practices that align with practices of so-called intensive or transcendent parenting.",

    "abstract": "Discussions on AI ethics and policies often focus on metaphysical questions and normalizing insights, such as the difference between humans and machines and the changing meanings of human intelligence. Since AI is always situated in specific cultural and social contexts, however, such approaches fail to capture key dimensions of the relationships and patterns of interactions that people and institutions around the world have with emerging technologies such as generative AI. This Crosscurrents themed section hosts interventions that tackle this problem. Mobilizing the tradition in media and cultural studies that stresses the importance of situating communication in specific context and cultures, contributors envision potential pathways that bring the question of culture and the dimension of everyday experiences to the center stage, thereby contextualizing AI more rigorously within the dialectic of the global and local cultures. Through this lens, we aim to foster critical dialogue and advance understandings of AI within the contemporary geopolitics of global cultures.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this paper is to deepen the clarity of Benkler, Farris, and Robert’s “propaganda feedback loop” concept. It argues that a sizeable portion of the information ecosystem in the United States is characterized by a media logic that demands acceptance of preferred narratives, irrespective of factual accuracy. When an individual or entire news organization fails to abide by the demands of prescribed narratives, no matter how factually unsound they may be, a kind of excommunication occurs; the nonconforming individual or organization is shunned. In this way, community boundary spaces are demarcated by felty to an implicit catechism. Relying on Carey’s “ritual view of communication,” we argue that these episodes can be thought of as moments of affirmation of identity, community, or as Carey puts it, a communication ritual. Communication rituals involve the creation and recreation of community, commonness and communion. It understands an engagement with media content as not only a transmission of information, but also as an affirmation of identity. In short, we aver that propaganda feedback loops are best understood as expressions of communication rituals that reinforce core identity claims. We also argue that, by definition, the assertion of core identity claims of some groups means that other groups are denied access to these same privileged claims. These groups are marginalized, or as Carey might put it, ostracized or excommunicated. We demonstrate our thesis with an empirical investigation of rightwing radio’s treatment of racial and religious minorities in the United States during the period surrounding the 2020 presidential election.",

Most artificial intelligence assumes the humble and submissive female names and voices. Scholars from Techno-feminism argue that technology has a gender aspect, not neutral and transparent. Why should AI voice assistants be designed as female images? How do users use such a product and interpret its gender? Based on feminist theory, this study interviewed 11 users and analyzed publicity videos and text materials on Classmate AI’s official media platforms. The finding is that the intelligent voice assistant of Xiaomi company has feminine characteristics, with most users being male. Cutting-edge technology, convenience, and emotional support are the main reasons users use it. Due to traditional gender stereotypes and the imperfections of the product itself, male users frequently express insensitivity to the gender of intelligent voice assistants. However, they unintentionally consolidate the dominant perspective of technology and gender through participatory, creative, and personalized practices such as training programs.",

    "abstract": "There has been limited attention to the role of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) as contributors and consumers of news media. In a series of focus groups conducted with people with I/DD about news media, we found respondents had a diverse set of topical interests but generally negative perceptions of the news. They also faced a number of infrastructural, attitudinal, and cognitive barriers to accessing media. Additionally, participants expressed a desire for more positive representation of I/DD in news media, as well as more education and training for journalists. We conclude by considering news media engagement as an aspect of civic participation and make several recommendations for applications and future directions.",

    "title": "AI, agency, and power geometries",
    "abstract": "One of the paradoxes of AI is that it is a global phenomenon, but it is always situated in specific local contexts and cultures. While approaches that aim to study local cultures of AI are important, there is the risk of neglecting their insertion within the broader geographies and politics of AI. As a response to this challenge, this article proposes a pathway to apply the concept of power geometries, originally proposed by feminist geographer Doreen Massey, to the case of AI. Reframing the global dimension of AI in terms of power geometries helps locate these positions in the complex networks of relationships between different actors at the global level. The power geometries of AI follow the lines and inequalities of the relationships between Global North and Global South, between colonizers and colonized, but also between diverse actors at different scales, such as governments, policymakers, corporations, designers, workers, and users. While all media can be examined in terms of power geometries, the power geometries of AI bring the issue of agency to the central stage. The reconfiguration of the question of agency sparked by AI, in fact, has generated new kinds of structures and trajectories underpinning AI’s power geometries.",

    "title": "Cross-cultural approaches to creative media content in the age of AI",
    "abstract": "In the age of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the goalposts for how we judge creative work are changing. New tools, new collaborators and new creative processes are transforming the way we make, look at and talk about the value of creative work. This shift is widely discussed in Western scholarship. However, there are certain voices still missing from this discussion. These are the voices of the Global Majority, or the Next Billion Users. The perspectives and values found in global digital cultures represent a massive user base of designers, AI ethicists, cultural changemakers, artists, creatives and users whose contribution to this debate could very well represent the next paradigmatic shift in how we approach creativity. Global AI cultures demand our attention. Going forward, media scholars need to diversify and decolonialise approaches to digital creative labour in the Age of AI by drawing attention to the values and creative practices of global digital cultures. This article is structured around six strategic concepts: Recognition, Resituate, Remix, Resistance, Regenerate/Repair and Reimagine. We propose this framework to decenter universality and problematise normativity. These concepts are meant to provoke new associations and patterns of thought, moving us away from pre-conceived notions of what creativity is to adopt new, equitable and diversified notions of creative work.",

    "title": "Renting royalties: How the assetization of music copyrights contributes to inequality for musicians",
    "abstract": "This study presents a critique of assetization in the music industry through a case study of royalty shares and their effect on musicians. A royalty share is a form of securitized music copyright that is packaged and sold as an investment asset to buyers on royalty sharing marketplaces (RSMs). Royalty shares represent an evolutionary step in financialization of music markets that contributes to deepening inequalities by transforming copyright ownership, introducing new kinds of socio-legal obligations between musicians and financial rentiers, and shifting the way recorded music is valued. Drawing on field ethnography at music industry trade events, qualitative interviews with RSM executives, and document analysis of corporate communication and music business trade press, this article answers the question: to what extent does the rise of assetized music copyrights traded on RSMs contribute to inequality for musicians. This article argues that the assetization of musical copyrights introduces new legal frameworks to exploit musicians while maintaining existing inequalities and poor working conditions in the music industries. The conclusion reflects on the consequences of royalty shares becoming more normalized in music markets and indicates directions for future research into the assetization of cultural production.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the photographic memory of governmental-led Han migration from central China to Xinjiang since the 1950s. Going beyond the state-driven official narrative of the Han people joining the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC) as ‘borderland constructors’ in the nation-building process, this study uncovers a mnemonic landscape by exploring the vernacular memories of Han migration through memory practices used to engage with treasured family photographs. Drawing on John Bodnar’s discussion of the relation between vernacular and official memories, this study treats family photographs as memory objects and analyses family photograph practices in multi-generational Han families. This study used 45 interviews with 15 families on their practices for engaging with family photographs documenting the migration to reveal how these photographs mark significant life moments and achievements of resettled individuals and connects personal experiences with national history while facilitating generational transmission. Drawing on original contributions grounded in empirical data from ethnographic interviews, this study examines the distinctive dynamics of vernacular and official memory in Chinese nation-building as encapsulated in these family photographs.",

    "abstract": "In 2020, Uber celebrated its presence in over 10.000 cities around the world. Such global scaling and granular infiltration of algorithmic-powered management of labour and urban dynamics are achieved through efforts to datafy and visualise cities, making them intelligible under a unified vision. While workers on the ground precariously move across territories, Uber’s engineering teams invest in abstract and disembodied views of the city. Taking Uber’s knowledge production about cities as an object of inquiry, this paper explores the epistemic dimensions of platformisation, delving into platforms' technical and narrative reliance on datafication. Through the analysis of 41 publications on Uber Engineering Blog (UEB), it delves into Uber's textual and visual data stories on knowing cities, highlighting the contrast between a lively community of practitioners and industry, and the neglect in acknowledging platform workers' labour and needs.",

    "abstract": "While upending domestic and global news media’s advertising income streams via the provision of superior “commercial datafication” (Mansell, 2021) and “digital tracking and profiling” (Christl, 2017) functionalities, Multinational Platform Corporations (MNPCs) have also implemented opaque strategies to minimize their domestic and global tax liabilities. These strategies have been an important contributor to both Meta and Alphabet’s surging profits over the past decade – from US$1.5b for Meta in 2013, to $39b in 2023 and, for Google, now listed as part of parent company Alphabet, from a US$12.73b profit in 2013 to US$74b in 2023. These spectacular levels of profitability have been achieved despite a proliferation of local and some transnational ‘diverted profits tax’ laws (Colbran, E., &amp; Farhat, S, 2023; Dunne, 2016) designed to prevent companies from shifting revenue from high-tax countries to ‘low or no tax’ jurisdictions. MNPCs have been able to not just continue to transform the majority of their revenue into \"stateless” income (Kleinbard, 2016), which is not taxed in the country where the income is generated nor, often, even in the country where the corporation is headquartered, but to get better at this and other forms of tax avoidance, via improving both their ability to strategically “navigate institutional complexity” (Kornelakis, A., &amp; Hublart, P. (2022) and, as this paper argues, to shape national and transnational discourses about their strategies. In both Canada and Australia, these strategies continue to allow the deflecting of public and political pressure to support (or mitigate the disruption to) local news ecosystems.",

    "title": "BIG TECH SOVEREIGNTY: PLATFORMS AND DISCOURSE OF SOVEREIGNTY-AS-A-SERVICE",
    "abstract": "The notion of digital sovereignty has been mobilized by various stakeholders as a response to platform power. In the last decades, the concept of sovereignty has been applied mainly to State responses to exert power over other sectors and organizations. Therefore, the meanings of digital sovereignty have also been used and disputed by social movements, workers and indigenous communities. But the platform companies also entered into disputes about the meanings of this multifaceted notion. As an update of Californian Ideology, platform companies modulate their discourse to say that they are also concerned with issues of sovereignty. Thus, they are reappropriating the meanings of sovereignty through the launch of programs focused on sovereignty. We named this \"Big Tech sovereignty\", a provocation to mean how platforms have changed the meanings of sovereignty based on their own interests, such as the renewal of discourses in the context of \"Silicon Valley dystopianism\". Built on analyzes of sovereignty programs of Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet/Google, this article argues that \"Big Tech sovereignty\" is a way of trying to deflate the concept politically, giving it only a commercial and/or personal framework, being more of an expression of the platform power. Through the analysis of these “digital sovereignty” programs, the article demonstrates how companies framed “sovereignty-as-a-service”, especially in terms of digital infrastructures.",

    "title": "ANALYSING NEWS POLARISATION: FROM PRODUCTION TO ENGAGEMENT AND BEYOND",
    "abstract": "Political polarisation – at the level of individual issues or broader ideologies, and expressed through differences of opinion on policies, divergent affective attachments, contrary interpretations of available information, or distinct patterns of interaction with other partisans – is necessarily always closely related to the information that individuals and groups engage with as they form and reinforce their own opinions about a given issue or topic, and contest the views of others. News in all its forms, from legacy to emerging, and mainstream to fringe media, continues to play a particularly important role in such information diets, but news coverage can itself be polarised and polarising.\n\nThis panel addresses polarisation in and by the news through a series of papers that examine the various stages of the news production and engagement process. Drawing on innovative methods and novel datasets, these five papers offer new perspectives on the patterns and dynamics that affect news quality, news distribution, news engagement, and news fact-checking in digital and social media environments. In combination, they offer a new and comprehensive overview of how we might further investigate news polarisation in contemporary contexts.\n\nPaper 1 assesses polarisation in news coverage. Centred on the issue of climate change, it investigates patterns of news coverage across the media landscape in Australia – a country which has been particularly severely affected by extreme climate events in recent years. The paper highlights the challenges in accessing full-text news content at scale, and utilises a novel combination of manual and computational content coding techniques to investigate the patterns of news polarisation across four dimensions.\n\nPaper 2 investigates what sources of news are frequently recommended to users of prominent search engine Google News. Drawing on a long-term data donation project in Australia, the paper reviews the range of sources recommended for a variety of political and controversial search queries, and assesses the breadth of the political spectrum that these prominent recommendations represent. It also examines whether such patterns differ across individual queries or broader topic categories.\n\nPaper 3 shifts our attention to the sharing of news content on social media platforms. Drawing on long-term, large-scale datasets from Facebook and Twitter, it analyses the sharing of links to Australian news sources during 2022, and thereby reveals patterns of interactional and interpretive polarisation. These may be related to the political alignment of users and outlets, but also to news quality and other factors.\n\nPaper 4 takes a network approach to the study of news sharing on Twitter in Germany. Assessing the topical content of links to German news shared during one month in 2023, and the political affinities of the users sharing these links, the study finds marked differences between the sharing practices and patterns of left-leaning, conservative, and far-right users, as well as between sharing practices on different topics.\n\nFinally, Paper 5 closes the loop by examining the role perceptions of political fact-checkers, and their potential to contribute polarisation or depolarisation. Drawing on a series of interviews with staff in Australian fact-checking organisations, it provides a deep insight into their self-understanding, especially with respect to the extent and limitations of their impact on polarised debates in society.\n\nIn combination, then, these five papers address questions of news polarisation throughout the stages of the journalistic process from news production to distribution and engagement all the way to the critical scrutiny of political statements reported in the news. Overall, they make substantial new conceptual, methodological, and empirical contributions to the study of news polarisation. Extended abstracts for all five papers are included in the submission.",

    "abstract": "The algorithmic and individualised nature of advertising on social media - and the intentionally opaque and unobservable design of advertising algorithms - makes them difficult to study. We turn to participatory methods, working with 204 young Australians as 'citizen scientists' to collect 5169 screenshots of 'unhealthy' advertising on social media. Through SMS chat over a one week period, we engaged our participants in 'algorithmic gossip' to theorise why certain ads appeared on their feeds, how the algorithms serving ads worked, and what they thought about them. Some believed ‘the algorithm’ accurately targeted ads based on their interests and behaviors, while others felt these algorithms 'missed the mark'. Participants theorised the impact of search histories, friendship networks, interests, time of day/week/year, location, age, gender, and more in how advertising algorithms worked. Our study revealed complexities in participants' perceptions of ad targeting and how algorithms function. We highlight the need for greater transparency and regulation regarding advertising on social media, especially concerning unhealthy industries. Participants expressed concerns about manipulative and intrusive advertising practices, emphasising the importance of platform responsibility and centering young people's expertise in discussions on advertising regulation.",

    "title": "READY TO HACK: HOW BUG BOUNTY PLATFORMS CREATE THEIR WORKFORCE",
    "abstract": "Bug bounty platforms are becoming a standard solution for detecting vulnerabilities in an increasingly complex networked economy. Serving as intermediaries between organizations and ethical hackers, they crowdsource offensive information security and show significant improvements in the detection of vulnerabilities.\n\nIn some sense, they can be likened to platforms of the gig economy. However, they stand out in one major regard: they do not have a pre-existing workforce. While platforms of the gig economy can rely on unqualified, often migrant, workers eager to earn the little money it provides, bug hunting platforms require highly qualified workers in a field where formal training is often lacking. This pushes bug bounty platforms to not only serve as intermediaries, but to also actively create the workforce they need.\n\nThis paper discusses the efforts needed for the establishment of such a labor supply. Four key requirements are identified. First, the workers are required to undergo proper training. The platforms thus design educational tools aimed at ensuring a skilled workforce. Second, bug hunting must be routinised. A precise set of actions, as well as standard software is suggested that largely automate the job. This allows for efficient vulnerability detection. Third, platforms must ensure competition among bug hunters in order to secure a loyal workforce. To this end, they will design gamification schemes, made of rewards and rankings. Fourth, platforms seek to embed bug hunting into formal careers. By building alliances with the industry, higher education institutions, or the army, they make bug hunting economically appealing.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the indirect lobbying strategies deployed by major digital platforms, to oppose Brazil’s \"Fake News Bill\", which sought to regulate internet intermediaries in the country. Drawing from primary data collected during the lobbying campaign in April-May 2023, the study analyzes platform ads, search engine recommendations, and direct user communications.\n\nThe findings reveal systematic violations of platform policies, including unlabelled political ads and exploitation of exclusive platform affordances unavailable to competitors. Digital platforms leveraged their market dominance and technological tools, aligning with far-right disinformation narratives while mobilizing public opposition under the guise of protecting user interests. These practices highlight the misuse of economic power and self-regulation to resist oversight, emphasizing the need for stricter accountability measures. Future research should investigate the broader influence of such campaigns on public opinion.",

    "abstract": "Play-to-earn (P2E) games targeting users unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies are playing a key role within the industries known as blockchain, crypto or Web3. P2E gaming guilds (Elliott, 2021) are emerging as essential intermediaries bridging Web2 and Web3 ecosystems. Drawing from social network theory’s study of brokerage motivations, this paper examines the structure and communication practices of a P2E guild, Yield Guild Games (YGG) on Twitter. Through a computational analysis of YGG’s presence on Twitter, the paper compares two mention networks corresponding to a period of optimism, and a period of crisis. We used network analysis to examine the structure of YGG communication on Twitter (Rathnayake, 2023), analysed tweets using BERTopic topic modeling (Grootendorst, 2022), and extracted links to determine what information is shared within the network (Hoyng, 2023). The results demonstrate YGG’s role as a “cultural broker” (Foster &amp; Ocejo, 2015) promoting the adoption of blockchain technologies, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and ideologies (Swartz, 2017), ascribing legitimacy and value to particular actors and products in the Web3 ecosystem. The topic lists highlight prominent communication practices related to community building, such as AMA (ask me anything) sessions and airdrops.",

    "abstract": "This paper draws upon conceptual frameworks of platformisation (van Dijck, Poell, and de Waal, 2018), media convergence (Jensen, 2022), trust in digital banking (Mezei and Verteș-Olteanu, 2020; van Esterik-Plasmeijer and van Raaij, 2017), and social imaginaries (James, 2019; Mansell, 2012; Gillespie, 2018). It views digital banking apps as platforms that enable personalised interactions (Poell, Nieborg, and van Dijck, 2019), and aim to investigate the datafication (van Dijck, 2014; Sadowski, 2019) and platformisation of banking. This approach underscores the transformation of service dynamics and the challenges brought by digital banking concerning public accessibility and social inclusion (Swartz, 2020). We ask: a) What are the dominant imaginaries of payment reflected by contemporary financial services? and b) How do the design and affordances of digital payment services impact trust, responsibility, and user labour?\n\nThis paper employs a modified walkthrough method (Light, Burgess, and Duguay, 2018) including detailed content analysis of the Terms and Conditions (T&amp;Cs) documents required for initial access to seven digital banking apps in Ireland. The sampled banking apps include Bank of Ireland (BOI), N26, An Post Money, Revolut IE, Chase UK, Starling Bank UK, and Klarna. The modified walkthroughs highlight a significant convergence between the finance and media industries. Our analysis identified three dominant social imaginaries of payment leading to different designs for digital banking apps: a) the Institutional Imaginary, b) the Transactional Imaginary, and c) the Digital Imaginary.",

    "abstract": "This research explores the tensions in the work of an Iranian diasporic feminist campaign and the techno-social affordances of social media and data-driven platforms for (lack of) recognition and (in)visibility of feminist activism. Situating this study within the sociopolitical context of diasporic feminist activism, I look at the 2017-2018 #WhiteWednesdays hashtag campaign on X, launched by a New York-based journalist and women’s rights advocate, which invited women to post photos of themselves walking unveiled or wearing White headscarves. This campaign, using the Orientalist trope of the veil and aligned with imperial feminist discourses (Ahmed, 1992), gained heightened visibility in popular media, particularly American mainstream news. The research draws upon datafied recognition and visibility (Campanella, 2022) to explore how the campaign’s practices are distributed, under which logics, and with what consequences. I employ digital ethnography and trace the campaign’s life on Twitter and in Farsi-speaking sponsored popular outlets and the American mainstream news to argue how liking, retweeting, sharing, and commenting are social media practices implicated in the platform’s dynamics of recognition, attention, and visibility. These practices imply a particular type of sociability marked by the process of datafication, heavily influenced by high demands for branding and personal visibility, commodifying the suffering of the Other women, transforming violence and injustice into spectacles that generate profit, and erasing the voices from the margins. Yet, such regimes of visibility (Campanella, 2024) are also ambivalent. They can simultaneously go either way: inclusion and exclusion, visibility and erasure, co-optation and resistance, imperialist and radical.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI), often hailed as a transformative force, has become an ambivalent buzzword, simultaneously promising utopian possibilities and fueling dystopian anxieties. Social media platforms have emerged as pivotal spaces where the public narrative about AI takes shape, especially through content creators, significantly influencing our collective vision of the future with AI. Therefore, this paper inquires into the role of creators in shaping public imaginaries of AI through their AI content. The paper is based on TikTok as a site of entrance for investigating the role of creators in shaping ongoing discourses around AI through short video content. To understand the role of creators within this ongoing AI discourse, a hashtag network analysis is paired with a critical discourse analysis of creators’ AI content. The preliminary results show three dominant genres of AI content based on 1) AI tools output, especially visual content, 2) listicles on AI tools for different tasks, and 3) educational and critical AI content. Considering the creator types behind the content, a high amount of content is produced by content farms followed by tech TokTokers. Media outlets and commentary TikTokers dominate the third content section. Overall, four types of AI imaginaries are foregrounded. AI mystification envisions AI as fast-paced and inherently life-changing. Similarly, AI futuristic content makes AI out as inevitable. Contrastingly, a high AI pragmatism is prevalent in the ongoing tool discourse, while critical and educational content counteracts these imaginaries with a strong AI realism highlighting the complex and nuanced aspect of AI.",

    "abstract": "Algorithmic content moderation is becoming a common practice employed by many social media platforms to regulate ‘toxic’ language and to promote democratic public conversations. This paper provides a normative critique of politically liberal assumption of civility embedded in algorithmic moderation, illustrated by Google’s Perspective API. From a radical democratic standpoint, this paper normatively and empirically distinguishes between incivility and intolerance because they have different implications for democratic discourse. The paper recognises the potential political, expressive, and symbolic values of incivility, especially for the socially marginalised. We, therefore, argue against regulation of incivility using AI. There are, however, good reasons to regulate hate speech but it is incumbent upon the users of AI moderation to show that this can be done reliably. The paper emphasises the importance of detecting diverse forms of hate speech that convey intolerant and exclusionary ideas without using explicitly hateful or extremely emotional wording. The paper then empirically evaluates the performance of the current algorithmic moderation to see whether it can discern incivility and intolerance and whether it can detect diverse forms of intolerance. Empirical findings reveal that the current algorithmic moderation does not promote democratic discourse, but rather deters it by silencing the uncivil but pro-democratic voices of the marginalised as well as by failing to detect intolerant messages whose meanings are embedded in nuances and rhetoric. New algorithmic moderation should focus on the reliable and transparent identification of hate speech and be in line with the feminist, anti-racist, and critical theories of democratic discourse.",

    "abstract": "Platforms play an increasingly prominent role in today’s economy. As big tech companies like Alphabet, Meta and Alibaba leverage their size and access to large amounts of data to provide value for their users and shareholders, platforms have begun to emerge within the gig economy. The gig economy is where individuals rent out their labour, and has rapidly grown in recent years. This paper focuses on Fiverr, an online freelancing platform in the gig economy that allows individuals to sell their services to anyone who can access it. We undertake a longitudinal case study, exploring and analysing how Fiverr has developed its business to provide a number of services that facilitate the operation of the platform. We explain growth drivers, innovation strategies and show how they favour the buyer, which has created tensions in the operation of the platform. Additionally, we contextualize Fiverr, and online freelancing more generally, within two major socio-technical developments in recent years, namely the Covid-19 pandemic and the rise of generative AI, showing the turbulent times such platforms are currently facing.",

    "abstract": "Accuracy and precision are among the central values in the ML communities and tech industry. What does it take to achieve a high level of technical accuracy? What are the harms resulting from technology companies' obsession with technical accuracy and precision, and who incurs the greatest burdens? This paper explores accuracy in the context of AI training in China. Drawing on 9-month multi-sited ethnographic fieldwork, we document workers’ everyday working practices and challenges and harms under the guise of achieving extreme levels of technical precision demanded by the clients and ML practitioners. We introduce the notion of precision labor, referring to the hidden work involved in erasing the messy, ambiguous, and uncertain aspects of technology production, all in the pursuit of presenting technology as objective, truthful, and high-quality. This notion provides a lens to understand the disproportionate impact of unnecessary and unrecognized labor on digital labor communities within AI production and the emerging harms on them, such as financial precarity and machine subordination. It joins existing work on the prevailing values in ML communities, questions the legitimacy and sustainability of the pursuit of performative accuracy, and calls for enhanced reflexivity and timely intervention.",

    "abstract": "In the digital age, platforms such as Twitter foster the emergence of fragmented issue-based communities online, intersecting with traditional media and broader national discourse. However, these digital public spheres often deviate from idealised concepts like those proposed by Habermas, showcasing uncivil discourse and participatory disparities. Recent research highlights a subset of hyperactive users on Twitter who monopolise discussions on contentious topics like abortion, perpetuating intolerance and incivility.\n\nDrawing on social psychological theories of social identity as discursive constructions, this study investigates how hyperactive uncivil and intolerant Twitter users present their identities. Analysing over 30,000 accounts, researchers scrutinise psycholinguistic patterns and emoji usage to answer two key questions: How do these hyperactive users describe their identities compared to non-hyperactive ones, and who are the verified, influencer accounts driving uncivil and intolerant discourse on abortion?\n\nThe findings reveal distinct identity markers among hyperactive users compared to non-hyperactive ones. Notably, hyperactive uncivil and intolerant users display varied discursive identifications, often aligning with religious, partisan, and familial affiliations rather than directly addressing abortion-related identities like pro-choice or pro-life. Furthermore, there's a notable dominance of pro-life social identity in online discourse, potentially influencing online public opinion despite being a minority in national surveys.\n\nThis research sheds light on the intricate relationship between discursive social identities and their hyperactive behaviours in Twitter issue publics.

    "title": "THE PHOTOJOURNALISTIC GIF: VISUAL JOURNALISM IN THE SOCIAL MEDIA ERA",
    "abstract": "In recent years, visual journalism has embraced a new form of storytelling alongside photographs and videos: the photographic GIF (graphics interchange format). Despite its association with humor on social media, the GIF has unexpectedly become a legitimate tool for documenting disasters and tragedies in online news. This challenges the traditional solemn tone of journalism, as the GIF's short, repetitive, and silent nature is reminiscent of humorous content rather than serious news representation.\n\nPhotojournalism traditionally utilizes still images and videos for narrative storytelling, each having distinct characteristics and narrative possibilities. In contrast, the photographic GIF emerges as a hybrid format, combining photography and film elements. Its unique attribute of the looped movement stands in overt contrast with conventional news formats but reflects the transformations in visual news production following the widespread use of smartphones and social media. These changes shifted news consumption habits and have caused news organizations to adopt new designs and forms for online news outlets.\n\nThis research focuses on the photographic GIF as a new visual form in online news, particularly in representing tragic events. It uses semiotic visual analysis and interviews with senior online news editors to explore the uses, meanings, and editorial considerations behind GIF production in newsrooms. The findings reveal the GIF's expansion beyond its initial contexts, demonstrating its legitimacy in the journalistic sphere and uncovering its means of conveying informative and traumatic content. The research underscores how the digital journalism industry adapts to the contemporary environment by integrating GIFs into storytelling practices.",

    "title": "EDUCATED USERS: REFINING MANNERS THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA CORPORATE CURRICULUMS",
    "abstract": "This paper will scrutinise modes through which social media companies create, disseminate and deliver free digital literacy curriculums to educators, parents, caregivers and users. Following the thought of Norbert Elias, we consider these practices as part of broader attempts to $2 of human groups according to (contingent) values and beliefs, and which serve the capitalist interests of powerful global institutions seeking to inculcate them in doing so. Using Meta’s $2 digital literacy program and Instagram’s $2 as empirical case studies, we ask: What is the specific content of social media curriculums of safe, healthy and educated use? And how do these educational resources inculcate certain habits and manners, for whom, and with what implications? Our findings indicate that the type of digital literacy constructed through these resources is a distinctly responsibilized prospect, operating through self-control, and verified in relation to neoliberal behaviourist ideologies. We argue that by loading the pressure on individuals to protect themselves against the ‘toxicity’ of platforms, social media companies seek to absolve themselves from the responsibility to address the potentially harmful aspects of their services themselves. We argue that this constitutes a performance of corporate responsibility, responding to the criticisms that have been levelled at platforms in recent years, while diverting attention away from the exploitative capitalist logics motivating their operations. In highlighting the cultural, normative and political limits of social media corporate curriculums, our paper ultimately highlights the need to develop alternative critical, creative and independent digital literacies in response.",

    "abstract": "We offer in-depth theorisation of two multi-site case studies of dying and being dead in Extended Reality (XR) to investigate immersive death experiences facilitated by these media. Our observations, discussion and critique underscore an emergent and nuanced interplay between spatial technologies and death encounters, their linked phenomenological cultural constructions, and the emerging industry that channels these phenomenon. XR are media technologies that mediate digital data with the physical world in real time. Yet, this might take users ‘out' of their surroundings through VR systems that map-but-hide the physical, and replace it with what programmers desire. Or, XR might seemingly add digital artefacts that relate with the physical world via AR systems that have us peering through screens or – arguably, hearing spatial cues (Boisvert et al. 2023), that are computed to fool our senses of what is ‘in’ the real. What – and who – is able to be brought ‘in’ and ‘out’ of the perceived world has significant consequences for the growing industry of necro technologies. Our work then, focuses on two multi-site phenomenological cases within the digital necro-industry: the first, is taking users ‘out’ of the real (usually via VR) to experience death, dying or the dead; and second, bringing death ‘in’ to the physical world via mediations of the dead, death or dying. The paper concludes with a discussion that syntheses our study of industrial trends and phenomenological-technological critique to consider how stakeholders that have hitherto not been invited to compose cultures of XR death-tech might act.",

    "abstract": "The release of the video game $2 in 2017 ushered in one of the most popular ships that the Legend of Zelda series has seen, that of Sidon and Link. In Breath of the Wild Link travels to the kingdom of the Zora, a race of humanoid fish creatures, and meets their prince, Sidon. Sidon’s charm and enthusiasm for Link resulted in many fans claiming that Sidon was Link’s boyfriend. In the sequel, $2 , fans were faced with a new character, Yona, who was introduced as Sidon’s fiancée, thus contradicting their previous queer readings. However, there were also many subtextually queer moments that provided support for the queer readings of Sidon and Link. What is at stake here is understanding where these queer readings fit in relation to the heteronormative reading that the inclusion of Yona supports. To come closer to this understanding I analyzed examples of queer streamers on Twitch playing through the quest line with Sidon and the queer readings that the streamer and viewers in chat created. I argue that the co-creation of these queer readings is a form of play, allowing fans to change the game so it is satisfying and fulfilling, and thus cannot be separated from the game. Through play, these communities were able to create narratives maintaining Sidon and Link’s romantic relationship that drew on in-game elements to have a satisfying experience with the quest line thus making it a part of the game.",

    "title": "PREDICTIONS OF THE SELF: AI AND THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF SUBJECTIVATION",
    "abstract": "The recent widespread availability of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology and the extensive records of human activities and behaviour in digital format present serious challenges related to how individuals construct their own identities and social relations. AI systems datafy our body and our sense of self, producing a new cartography of biopower (Foucault, 1982) and a new form of the political economy of subjectivation (Langlois &amp; Elmer, 2019) that treats individuals as objects from which raw material is extracted to produce predictive models that act as our data doubles (Haggerty &amp; Ericson, 2000). Issues such as algorithmic social biases (Bolukbasi et al., 2016), the idealized and pragmatic economic uses of AI (Srnicek, 2017), and the consequent reproduction of already existing power structures by predictive models (Crawford, 2021) have been problematized in the literature. This paper asks what kinds of data and labour mobilization occur in and around the production of predictive models: What political economy and socio-technical conditions are involved in the production of AI? How do these conditions produce predictive models that shape our sense of self and identity? Focusing on Kaggle, a platform for crowdsourcing AI development, I use digital methods and a software studies approach to examine the practices of the data science community on three high-profile machine learning projects and conclude by arguing that machine learning has been thought of and developed as a prediction of the self in order to prescribe individual behaviour to fulfill specific economic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Studies on digital platforms and online incivility have established that uses of humor can lean towards cyberbullying and hate speech. Focusing on TikTok’s affordances and cultures of online incivility, this paper studies how TikTok influencers and their audiences maneuver legal-but-harmful humour (Matamoros-Fernández et al., 2023). Specifically, we study how online incivility has become an accepted and negotiated practice in the Filipino context through the phenomenon of ‘dogshows’, where users throw jabs at individuals using derogatory humor and provocative memes. Through online observation and textual analysis of TikTok posts and their corresponding comment sections, we demonstrate how online incivility is subtly amplified through humour and play, and how Gen Z and young children became both objects and producers of these dogshows. We argue that while there is already peer surveillance on TikTok, there needs to be more deliberation between TikTok and at-risk groups to make the platform a more civil space.",

    "abstract": "The role of digital media platforms as societal actors has been increasingly brought to the fore in recent years. We have also grown to understand how platforms foster actors and media formats not motivated by liberal and democratic norms. Critical scholarship has pointed out the role of platforms in amplifying extreme content and misinformation, allowing for the manipulation of political processes and communication, and intervening in the processes of political communication more broadly. In this study, we focus on the discursive strategies adopted by the platforms to publicize and justify their actions related to electoral and political communication on their services. We ask, how do platform companies articulate elections as a context through which they discursively construct their role and legitimacy as major actors in society? Using a large dataset of corporate blogs from ten platform companies (N=27,616, n=413, years 2006-2022) we show a shift from an opportunity-focused discourse that promotes participation, digital democracy, and politician-citizen interaction to a more defensive discourse stressing companies’ responsible attitude to elections, as evidenced by their transparency efforts, advertising control, fact-checking initiatives, and strategic partnerships. Our findings demonstrate an institutionalization of discourses among the platform companies and highlight their reactive response strategies from feature development to corporate legitimation strategies. The platforms strategically mobilize the empowering participation-focused discourses typically used to describe social media to rebuild their legitimacy and position them as proactive agents in society.",

    "abstract": "In 2020, the subreddit r/GenderCritical—one of the most active “gender critical” (GC) spaces on Reddit—was banned by the platform for promoting hateful, transphobic conduct. Following the closure of r/GenderCritical (and subsequent banning of dozens of high-profile, transphobic subreddits including r/ActualWomen, r/GenderCriticalSociety, and r/truelesbians), GC users—especially those in North America and Western Europe—migrated to more hidden, invite-only spaces. These included Discord servers as well as (much like alt-right alternative platforms Parler and Truth Social) platforms run by GCs themselves: Spinster.xyz, the short-lived Giggle app, subforums on Mumsnet, and Ovarit—an invite-only forum which imitates Reddit’s architecture launched by former moderators of r/GenderCritical. While we might celebrate the closure of openly hateful communities on major social platforms, a crucial side-effect of the GC dispersal is that their activity has become (following patterns in reactionary political movements online more broadly) increasingly shrouded and insular. In this project, we provide an overview of the current landscape of GC activity on social media as it exists in the post-r/GenderCritical era. We describe how users are “peaked” (the GC equivalent of “redpilled”) and pipelined from algorithmic media platforms into insular and extremist spaces such as Ovarit, Mumsnet, and Discord. We then examine discourse within two popular GC forums, Ovarit and Mumsnet (specifically: Mumsnet’s “Feminism: Sex &amp; gender” board), to identify how these groups circulate disinformation, perform political mythmaking, and construct and reinscribe reactionary identities in the context of GC ideology and extremism.",

    "abstract": "This paper draws on ethnographic and historical research at two Australian libraries to explore how the platformization of the web has altered the content, character, and potential future utility of web archives. I argue that, in attempting to collect social media, these libraries face a double bind: while web crawling undertaken at the National Library of Australia allows for immediate but often incomplete or inconsistent access, the API-based approach taken by the State Library of New South Wales constrains both the data collected and how it can be made accessible due to a shifting set of rules that are established and enforced by platforms. By examining the constraints of current strategies to collect, preserve, and make available social media content, I illustrate how changes to platform design and policies significantly influence what is included in web archives and how they are made available. As the ruptures and inconsistencies of collections of social media in web archives are often opaque to both creators of web archives and those using them, I argue that web archives can be read “along the archival grain” for evidence of the platformization of the web. This approach, which draws on anthropologist Ann Stoler’s critical readings on the form and placement of colonial archives (rather than just their contents), allows an assessment of how the gaps, silences, densities, and distributions of web archives are shaped by the shifting power dynamics between different actors involved in the production, circulation, distribution, and use of information on the web.",

    "title": "LLMS AND THE GENERATION OF MODERATE SPEECH",
    "abstract": "For the past year, using large language models (LLMs) for content moderation appears to have solved some of the perennial issues of online speech governance. Developers have promised 'revolutionary' improvements (Weng, Goel and Vallone, 2023), with large language models considered capable of bypassing some of the semantic and ideological ambiguities of human language that hinder moderation at scale (Wang et al., 2023). For this purpose, LLMs are trained to generate “moderate speech” – that is, not to utter offensive language; to provide neutral, balanced and reliable prompt outputs; and to demonstrate an appreciation for complexity and relativity when asked about controversial topics. But the search for optimal content moderation obscures broader questions about what kind of speech is being generated. How does generative AI speak “moderately”? That is: under what norms, training data and larger institutions does it produce “moderate speech”? By examining the regulatory frameworks AI labs, comparing responses to moderation prompts across three LLMs and scrutinising their training datasets, this paper seeks to shed light on the norms, techniques and regulatory cultures around the generation of “moderate speech” in LLM chat completion models.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary experiences of everyday feminisms often include the use of social media platforms like Instagram. The introduction of Instagram Stories created a space for emerging feminist engagements, allowing for practices of re-sharing content that serve as small acts of political engagement, accommodating the participation of otherwise reluctant users. This article explores the feminist potential of these re-sharing practices, grounding it on the analysis of 2282 Instagram Stories, produced by 52 Instagram users in Portugal. This analysis combines qualitative textual analysis, close readings, and the use of digital methods to explore overarching patterns. The article foregrounds the multiple meanings of re-sharing, its social character, its ability to engage in intertextual conversations with the original context, while simultaneously recognising some of the limitations of the Stories’ format for feminist action. In this way, this article reflects on the tensions and possibilities of these small acts of political engagement.",

    "abstract": "According to social media users’ comments, the recent increase in social media content detailing the symptoms and experiences of living with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has led to many users self-diagnosing with the disorder. This conference paper presents the findings of an 18-month-long digital ethnographic study in which I analyzed ADHD TikTok videos and the technological infrastructures and assemblages surrounding the TikTok app, to interrogate how TikTok has become a voice of authority in the self-diagnosis of ADHD. This paper demonstrates how ADHD TikTok content creators create videos that cultivate sentiments of trust, intimacy, and relatability. These creators also adopt visual and discursive norms from other trending TikTok content, and from more traditional visual media content. In doing so, ADHD content creators generate authority by conforming and contributing to a set of coproduced content standards that ensure their videos are deemed viewable and relevant by viewers and the algorithm. Contrary to traditional understandings of authority, I find that medical authority on TikTok is not produced by individuals or institutions, but rather by content creators’ collective and collaborative performativity of everyday lived experiences, and their engagement with the supporting technologies of the TikTok app. To account for this shift in how authority is produced in our digital mediascape, I build on theories of social, cultural, and algorithmic authority, to offer a theoretical framework of ‘techno-cultural authority’. I ultimately argue that the techno-cultural authority of ADHD TikTok challenges customary understandings of authority figures and disrupts traditional medical expertise within the American healthcare industry.",

    "abstract": "Bumble, a dating app that positions itself as feminist and safe for women in India, has failed to live up to its claims. Despite its promotion of a safety-by-design approach, users have not fully embraced the app's safety features. This suggests a lack of understanding of the cultural factors contributing to the risks associated with online dating in India. To investigate women's experiences with Bumble’s safety features and their efforts to ensure their own safety while using dating platforms, a semi-structured interview was conducted with 23 women who are Bumble users in India. The preliminary findings indicate that using Bumble requires additional “safety work” from women, who rely on support from their peer network to manage their safety. The notion of safety by design has been misleading, as power dynamics shift back to men after women make the first move. This study is important to understand how profit-driven platforms with neo-liberal agendas put women in danger within their local cultural context on the pretext of empowering them.",

    "abstract": "TikTok has rapidly established itself as a fixture for debate on the state of the web and society at large. The platform serves as a primary generator of trends and viral content, and as a locus for political concerns around globalisation, surveillance and privacy. What is considerably understudied is how TikTok is forging connections in political discourses more locally. We present an exploration of political discourses on TikTok through the case study of local city council elections, and later state elections, for Brisbane in the state of Queensland, Australia. Video metadata was recorded using the Zeeschuimer (Peeters, 2023) tool. We focus on the discursive dynamics of the broader local community both separately and in response to the communication of candidates. We draw on research on the social news landscape and the role of ‘newsfluencers’ and community narratives amidst changing audience expectations (Hurcombe, 2022), and clustering of cross-ideological ties in social media news sharing over time (Angus et al, 2023). Through this, we contrast the topic-selective engagement across various actors, from mainstream and national news outlets, local or alternative media, businesses, organisations, political campaigners, and unaffiliated individual users. As such, we focus on how local TikTok users respond to, remix, engage with, and disseminate political communication on TikTok, as well as how they create their own political content, such as advocating for/against a candidate, an issue, or engaging in commentary on the wider election process.",

    "abstract": "The industry of sextech is on the rise. But while the term sextech has been applied to a wide range of intimate technologies, it is often understood in terms of technologies that enhance or improve sex in an individualist manner. This panel instead furthers an understanding less concerned with sexuality as a question of technological optimisation, and more invested in sextech as technologies, not only for pleasure and health, but also for regulation, surveillance, and biopolitical management. We explore the growth of the sextech industry and its relationships to surveillance capitalism, artificial intelligence, data governance, and politics of pleasure. Drawing from empirical data with sextech users, retailers, developers, and founders as well as collaborations between industry and academia, the papers explore how sextech industries outsource labour, upscale automation, and shape intimate connections through digital technologies. While we consider the interplay of sextech and public health, we do not seek to evaluate the therapeutic utility of sextech use. Instead, we adopt a sociotechnical approach, reflecting on how cultural assumptions around gender, sexuality, health, and pleasure guide and inform sextech markets. The panel is structured by moving from broad interrogations of the issues within the sex tech industry to case studies of specific platforms, before finishing with a consideration of user experiences of queering sextech to explore some possible futures. In these case studies, focusing on industry practices allows us to see how sextech is marketed as simultaneously sexually empowering, a source of self-knowledge, and a solution for social inequality and injustice.",

    "title": "UNDERSTANDING PERCEPTIONS AND EFFECTS OF ONLINE INTOLERANCE: A FOUR-COUNTRY EXPERIMENTAL STUDY",
    "abstract": "Research on online political discourse has long been concerned with the pervasiveness of incivility across various digital arenas. However, most of this work has focused on discourse that is rude in tone, but not necessarily harmful in substance. Consequently, there remains a significant gap in understanding the true impact of harmful online speech on both its targets and bystanders. Addressing this gap, this four-country experimental study examines perceptions and reactions to intolerant online discourse. We focus on Brazil, Germany, the UK, and the US, democracies with high internet use and notable increases in online intolerance. We manipulate three types of intolerance (discrimination, hateful speech, violent threats), tone (civil, uncivil), and target (women, LGBT) to examine how these factors influence both perceptions and reactions to intolerance. For instance, hateful and threatening speech is expected to elicit stronger responses compared to discriminatory content. Additionally, the study explores how the tone of discourse influences support for content moderation practices and engagement in political discussions, particularly among targeted identity groups. Ultimately, this research endeavors to deepen understanding of the nuanced dynamics of online intolerance and its repercussions on democratic discourse in diverse socio-political landscapes.",

    "title": "RESEARCHING THE EDTECH INDUSTRY FOR CHILDREN: METHODOLOGICAL REFLECTIONS ON A DESIGN-BASED APPROACH",
    "abstract": "Digital platforms and services are making inroads into the everyday lives of even very young children. As with many other domains of life, children’s learning and education are increasingly digitised through ‘educational technology’ software, or more commonly EdTech. The rise of the EdTech industry provokes new questions about children’s education in the digital age. Methodologically, studying the EdTech industry for children largely falls in the field of the political economy of digital childhood, an interdisciplinary research agenda underpinned by an overall interest in understanding the critical roles of institutions, especially companies and governments, in producing and distributing digital services that shape children’s and families’ everyday consumption of digital technologies. This paper focuses on the methodological offerings of a design-based method for researching the political economy of digital childhood. We explore how a design-based approach is compatible with the research interests of a political economy perspective by drawing on the processes and findings of a collaborative design intervention study which aimed to conceptualise and build a database of EdTech companies and products for young children living in Australia. Based on the findings of the Database, this paper illustrates how the design-based approach employed in this study enabled the researchers to identify the key EdTech industry trends and characteristics, surfaces the power asymmetry between EdTech corporations and individual users, and provoke new ideas and imaginaries among parents and educators to address these challenges.",

    "title": "TRANSPHOBIC MEMES IN THE QUEBEC ALTERNATIVE NEWS INDUSTRY",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we explore transnational discursive campaigns that use online popular culture to consolidate a “countercultural” vision of hard to extreme right politics. Hyperpartisan sites form a “mirror universe” or alternate news industry, counterposing their passionate partisanship against what they deem the fraudulent objectivity of mainstream media. In our preliminary study, we noted that “anti-woke” hashtags and memes were heavily freighted with transphobic images and messages and co-occurred with a range of other far-right content (with strong currents of anti-immigration, misogynist, “anti-system,” and conspiracy themes). Presented in mocking tones and mobilized by hyperpartisan sites, transphobic memes participate in consolidating far-right hegemony via online countercultural forms. In mapping the distribution patterns of this content, we observed 1) the extent to which a range of seemingly “independent” sites distribute the same content within a short period of times; 2) how “anti-woke” hashtags and memes served to consolidate a far-right worldview and package it as countercultural; 3) and finally, how transphobic content came to constitute something of a “federating” theme – an ideological entry point into or representative of a larger ensemble of sociopolitical arguments. In this sense, transphobia works as a federating meme, creating information cascades that promote alt-right ideologies. Information cascades describe patterns of online conformity (Lemieux 2003) on social media platforms like Twitter. By tracking a range of Quebecois right-wing influenceurs, we aim to ascertain the opportunistic mobilisation and reach of transphobic content in this Quebecois alternative influence network.",

    "abstract": "How do workers conceptualize a platform’s algorithm and adjust their practices to its logic? To pursue this question, we draw on an ethnography of Grab, the leading rideshare platform in Southeast Asia, composed of 60+ trips talking to drivers on the back of bikes in Hanoi, and in-depth interviews with 10 drivers. From this rich material, we identify a strategic cluster of practices that we term “taming the algorithm.”\n\nTaming requires three key moves: iteratively adapting behaviors to algorithmic pressures (improvisation), juggling competing demands to deliver a productive performance at bodily limits (scrambling), and repeating these activities over time until they become a baseline in the system (enduring). If done successfully, these moves establish routinized productivity, a pattern of algorithmically ideal labor that means the platform will consistently delegate tasks to the worker. Taming is inherently double-edged, an exhausting form of self-exploitation that nevertheless provides some predictability and agency to workers.\n\nTaming the algorithm offers a contribution on two fronts. First, it allows us to prise the ontological and the technical aspects of platform labor apart: these moves are risky, brutal, and chaotic for workers but are smoothed into desirable integers and patterns by the algorithm. Secondly, it articulates a minor freedom between the twin poles of Freedom and Unfreedom as conventionally understood, showing how workers achieve some agency and some perception of power without fundamentally disrupting the systemic inequalities maintained by platform logics.",

    "abstract": "This paper historicizes feminist data activism, particularly as it relates to the use of grassroots data by feminist activists to address gendered violence in public spaces. It seeks to address the following question: How did grassroots data become widely accepted as a legitimate means to combat gendered violence in public spaces? This historical perspective allows us to unpack what seems to be a novel action repertoire within contemporary feminist activism.\n\nI use media genealogy to trace the history of a particular grassroots data type: the Women's Safety Audit (WSA). The data for this study come from historical records published by the feminist organisation that pioneered the WSA and different UN agencies, spanning four decades since the emergence of the WSA in the 1980s (n=41). I also drew upon modern data initiatives' documents and interviews with data activists and stakeholders who funded data activism efforts.\n\nThis paper reveals three significant forces that have shaped the WSA and how it came to be accepted as a means to address gendered violence in public spaces: the Crime Prevention through Environmental Design approach, the dominance of evidence-based practices, and the imperative of scalability. Rather than signalling the emergence of innovative epistemic cultures as some scholars suggest, this genealogy of the WSA showed that grassroots data approach has indeed been folded into other hegemonic interests throughout the history. Grappling with this entanglement and the hierarchy of power/knowledge it enacts is crucial for feminist activism to not reproduce the power relations they seek to address.",

    "abstract": "This research explores the findings on the social media engagement and advocacy activities of 52 women’s health NGOs from across the world during the year of 2019, amid an environment of hostility and attacks of far-right groups against women’s rights, and particularly in areas such as women’s sexuality and female bodies. These findings are only a small part of a larger four year study, funded by the Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF), which examined the advocacy communication activities of NGOs working on women’s health in the US, Europe, Latin America, Brazil and India.\n\nQuestions included how NGOs’ communication strategies reflect on their communication activities, and how they combine offline and online media to advocate on SRHR. The research made use of a mixed methods approach which included in depth interviews with 50 CEOs from the organizations as well as a short survey applied to the communication directors of these NGOs, including from Care International UK to Anis Brazil. This was combined with critical discourse analysis (CDA) of their institutional websites, as well as their social media engagement on social network platforms. This paper focuses on the CDA results of the social media engagement of the organizations conducted during the months of March and April 2019, when a total of 1.505 tweets were collected. Findings show an emphasis on ‘hard fact’s, including NGO journalism devices such as ‘fact checking’, however with a growth in use of more human interest stories, particularly making use of storytelling, to reach out to larger audiences.",

    "abstract": "Beauty is one of the most popular and lucrative segments on YouTube, with broad transnational appeal, making it an ideal site to investigate the relationship between commercialization, globalization, and digital platforms. We focus on makeup reviews to utilize established research on cross-cultural differences in reviewing and ask how cultural repertoires of evaluation compare across multiple languages. We collected popular makeup reviews using keyword searches in five languages—English, German, Italian, Japanese, and Korean—associated with diverse cultural contexts. The top 20 videos in each language (n=100) were selected for analysis, producing a group of successful channels. We employed content analysis to compare the videos’ evaluative criteria, using a codebook of ten values. We found that creators across languages employ a shared cultural repertoire to evaluate beauty products, concerned with aesthetics, functionality, pleasure, and, to a lesser extent, distinctiveness and economy. While beauty creators appeal to a consistent set of values, they rarely elaborate on their meaning, focus on positivity, and emphasize the subjectivity of their evaluations. We argue that the approach to evaluation in YouTube makeup reviews challenges previously observed dichotomies between Eastern and Western countries, blending elements of both collectivist and individualist communication styles. Most creators make indirect recommendations even as they use reviews to build a distinctive personal brand. Although further research is necessary to investigate the reach of this practice, our analysis of multi-lingual makeup reviews demonstrates how the homogenization of social media entertainment need not be synonymous with Westernization.",

    "abstract": "In the last twenty years, social media are increasingly relying on recommendation features to increase user engagement and maintain their business logic. Platforms have transitioned from a model where users could explicitly choose content sources, to one based on their inferred algorithmic identities. Users’ agency over their media diets is shaped differently in this new social media paradigm. Platforms such as TikTok, where algorithmic distribution of content is the standard, afford content curation in new avenues.\n\nWe build upon previous research on how the TikTok app’s interface design, as a technical artifact, aims to shape consumptive content curation practices at varying degrees of insistence. In this article, we seek to understand how and under what circumstances TikTok affords certain consumptive curation practices to users interested in political and social issues. In other words, how specific users interact with the app’s interface within their social context, focusing on how they adapt their consumptive curation practices to obtain political and social issues content.",

    "title": "“DIGITAL PEACEBUILDING”: EXAMINING YOUNG WOMEN LEADERS' USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA TO BUILD PEACE IN THE PHILIPPINES",
    "abstract": "This paper conceptualises digital peacebuilding by demonstrating how Muslim, Lumad, and Christian young women leaders, who are marginalised in peacebuilding processes, are using Facebook and TikTok in building everyday peace in the Philippines' Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). Through an intersectional feminist lens and employing social media analysis, the article demonstrates how these women navigate their diverse identities online, shaping discussions on peace and security within BARMM and extending their influence beyond the region's peace process. Preliminary findings reveal that (1) social media is a vital platform for young women to voice their peace agenda, often neglected in traditional and institutional peacebuilding platforms; (2) within the diverse context of BARMM, different groups of young women have distinct perceptions of peacebuilding; (3) practising care both to the self and community is central to their peacebuilding work; and (4) digital peacebuilding of young women leaders extends beyond the mere use of technology to promote peace and encompasses unique ‘platform vernaculars’ (Gibbs et al., 2015). This paper broadens the narrow 'tool' view of digital peacebuilding,' emphasising the crucial interplay between technology and social practices in understanding its effectiveness in achieving and sustaining peace. Additionally, by documenting the active involvement of young women in digital peacebuilding, it ensures their perspectives are integrated into peace processes, promoting more inclusive and equitable paths to conflict resolution.",

    "abstract": "Conspiracy theories have been studied increasingly in recent years, with the main research approach to understanding conspiracy theorists focusing on their personal characteristics. However, research has not yet clarified the role of online communities in the identity and social experience of believers. To address this, this research endeavor examines the social and community dynamics among conspiracy theory believers, focusing on the case study of the public Facebook group \"The Flat Earth Community – Israel.\" Through a qualitative content analysis of posts and comments from within the group, the study reveals the role of a sense of community in the experiences of group participants. Findings reveal that participants seek appreciation and solidarity within the group while engaging in boundary work to maintain the authenticity of group members and defend the group against 'threats from the outside.' This research offers a deeper understanding of how online communities, serving as safe spaces for individuals whose beliefs are marginalized by societal norms, can fulfill a similar function for conspiracy theory believers. Such an in-depth understanding can help researchers to contend with the negative aspects of belief in conspiracy theories, for example through the consideration of alternative mechanisms that could satisfy participants’ need for a sense of community.",

    "abstract": "Wars have always been mediated. However, the tools and techniques for mediation, facilitation, and creation of knowledge about the war have significantly changed in the last decade with the fast growth of new media and technologies. Understanding the details of military operations by civilians has become possible nowadays with social media and digital technology that change people's perception of war. This research focuses on Ukrainian Telegram channels that position themselves as open-source intelligence (OSINT) investigators and provide detailed information for civilians on types of missiles or drones in the air during the ongoing attack. They use information from military and open sources to facilitate the war for the general public and mediate the attacks. The paper explores how those Telegram channels became essential players in military communication during the active phase of the war in Ukraine. It also discusses the emergence of a new digital industry of monitoring the air in Ukraine for war participation and mediation. The research uses a digital ethnographic observation method to explore the ten most popular Ukrainian Telegram channels that provide information about attacks and examine types of messages, framing, wording, and other information-specificities for participatory warfare and constructing knowledge about the war. Also, textual and visual analysis of the messages and comments allows us to identify patterns in the work of those Telegram channels. This paper is a work in progress.",

    "abstract": "This paper charts the emergence of a distinct category of research-dedicated GenAI platforms, which we term Research GenAI or RGAI. These platforms are explicitly marketed to a cross-disciplinary academic audience, promising to automate research discovery and writing tasks, such as identifying/summarising published research, writing literature reviews, conducting data analysis, and synthesising findings. RGAI platforms (e.g., Consensus, Elicit, Research Rabbit, Scholarcy, Scite, SciSpace) are rapidly being adopted, in a context of experimentation, uncertainty, and controversy.\n\nWe define the contours of Research GenAI by mapping the history and development of RGAI platforms and developing a preliminary typology of RGAI. We situate RGAI platforms within the scholarly economy and ongoing processes of platformisation and automation of academic work. We make a case for the need to understand RGAI platforms as complex sociotechnical systems that intersect with social, ethical, institutional, and legal questions, and demonstrate this approach through an STS-informed walkthrough of two notable RGAI platforms: Consensus and Elicit. In this presentation we present our findings generated from these walkthroughs and explore the implications of the technologies for the academic publishing industry.",

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes the global English-language press coverage of generative AI app Lensa and finds that it echoes existing technological discourses, focusing on the app’s predatory data practices, the biased content it produced, and the user behaviors associated with it. I argue that this coverage provides evidence of discursive closure (Deetz, 1992; Leonardi &amp; Jackson, 2003; Markham, 2021) around both the risks and the potential of visual generative AI in a manner that supports the maintenance of the status quo. I also suggest that the press coverage of Lensa, which both articulates key AI-related harms and frames those harms as intractable and insolvable, creates a discourse of inevitability (Leonardi &amp; Jackson, 2003; Markham, 2021) that has implications for how these issues are understood by the public, and for the approaches that are taken to address them.",

    "abstract": "The paper presents initial findings from an ongoing research project that investigates the discursive construction of race, gender, and sexuality in the visual culture of three online far-right extremist platforms in Scandinavia. This interdisciplinary project brings together feminist theory of humour and harm with digital media research into memes and the far-right in order to explore the hateful discourse in the online humour of the far-right.\n\nThe data consists of visual content posted to three different social media platforms in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark.\n\nAs the paper discusses work in progress, the findings of the project are limited at the time of writing. However, the initial coding of the data set reveals similar themes across the three websites:\n\n1: The function of humour in the visual content, which works to create insiders and outsiders.\n\n2: Far-right ideology which discursively constructs the “ideal” Scandinavian citizen as a white man via the discursive “othering” of the racialized (mostly Muslim) non-citizen. This othering is expressed via a characterization of the non-European outsider as barbaric, sexually perverted, and culturally backward.\n\n3: The overlap between racism, misogyny, homophobia, and transphobia which is expressed through an anti-woke discourse that ridicules women’s rights, feminism, and questions the existence of trans lives.\n\nIn a discursive space where hate and humour coexist, violent discourse might be trivialised and considered “just a joke”. The paper, however, makes a point of taking humour seriously by critically addressing the hate hidden under the guise of humour.",

    "title": "VIRTUAL CELEBRITY INDUSTRIES IN EAST ASIA",
    "abstract": "The concept of virtual celebrity realises the ambition of manufactured pop idols that inspired Japan’s idol industry in the 1970s, and spread across East Asia soon thereafter. Today, the term encompasses a variety of genres with local histories and applications, including Vocaloids, virtual idols, vTubers, virtual anchors, and virtual influencers. Although virtual celebrity was once considered a niche interest reserved for $2 and dedicated fans of ACG (Anime, Comics and Games), recent shifts in government priorities, technological innovations, and heightened capital investment have brought virtual celebrity into mainstream view. This panel considers the various organisations, technologies, platforms, labour, and stakeholders involved in East Asia’s flourishing virtual celebrity industries. Its five papers explore the commercial, cultural, and symbolic value of virtual celebrities across and beyond East Asia, examining historical antecedents; cross-industry collaborations; processes of cultural commodification; industrial practices; and emergent media discourses. Introducing cases from Japan, Korea, and China, the panel's regional focus draws attention to the “transnational” (Iwabuchi, 2014) flows of virtual celebrity across borders, languages, industries, platforms, and technologies.",

    "abstract": "Concerns about the aging of the Chinese population (Y. Wang &amp; Su, 2024), and with the Chinese government's acknowledgment of the silver-haired economy's significant development, there is an urgent need for research into the social media engagement of the elderly. Short videos, representing a novel form of information dissemination and social engagement, offer the elderly a means to connect across time and space (Zhang &amp; Xiang, 2023). Short form video is dynamic and intuitive, making audio-visual information and public communication particularly accessible to older audiences. Notably, On 15th January 2024, the General Office of the State Council of China published the \"Opinions on Developing the Silver Economy and Enhancing the Well-Being of the Elderly.\" This document marks the inaugural national policy directive specifically addressing the “Silver Economy” by the Chinese Government (Huang, 2024). The issuance of the Opinions policy underscores the critical role of the elderly demographic within the ambit of China's contemporary digital and cultural milieu, highlighting the government's commitment to integrating this segment of the population into the broader socio-economic framework.\n\nHowever, existing research, both domestically and internationally, has predominantly examined the participation of older adults in short video platforms from the user perspective, often overlooking the significant number of older individuals actively contributing as content creators within the short video culture. Consequently, this research addresses this gap and is dedicated to examining the involvement of Chinese elderly individuals in the realm of short-form video culture, specifically as content creators.",

    "abstract": "The multifaced nature of online dating practices and experiences highlights both its empowering potential and the challenges it poses, including stigma and violence, particularly within the contexts of queer and LGBT+ communities and the subjectivities they contain. This paper aims to explore perceptions and responses to risks and fears in online dating experiences among queer young adults in Italy and Australia, utilising a qualitative approach through focus groups (15 in total, 8 in Italy and 7 in Australia). Initial findings from Italy reveal concerns about outing, appearance-based judgments, and hierarchies of intimacies, with participants employing various strategies for safety. Similar strategies for risk mitigation during offline encounters are observed across both contexts. As the analysis of Australian focus groups remains ongoing, anticipation mounts for further elucidation of the nuanced dynamics at play within this cultural setting. Overall, the study underscores the resilience and resourcefulness of queer individuals in navigating online dating complexities while emphasizing the need for safer and more inclusive digital spaces for these communities.",

    "title": "FROM _NEIJUAN_ TO _BUJUAN_: CHINESE IT PROFESSIONALS' CHANGING PHILOSOPHY TOWARDS WORKING",
    "abstract": "Since 2017, IT professionals have held the highest average salaries in China and are engaged in diverse roles spanning various levels of tech work. Despite their wage advantages, they face intense job market competition and opt to switch jobs to leverage their value or pursue higher salaries in an industry characterized by high uncertainty and mobility. To gain a competitive edge, many individuals turn to “ $2 .” Unlike its interpretation in the agricultural context as involution, $2 in the workplace refers to internal cut-throat competition. However, given the inherent uncertainty of the IT industry, the outcome of $2 does not necessarily guarantee success, prompting some professionals to abandon it. Existing research on $2 primarily examines it as a social phenomenon, with limited focus on employees’ perspectives regarding their practices and perceptions of the term, as well as their reasons for embracing $2 (not $2 ). By conducting 30 semi-structured interviews in Beijing, a city where the IT industry is highly concentrated, the research investigates how IT professionals perceive $2 from an insider perspective and how some navigate work uncertainties by embracing $2 . Using a qualitative approach, this study contributes to academic discourse by providing an empirical perspective distinct from media narratives. Findings reveal that both $2 and $2 are adaptive responses to the commercialization of labour in the Chinese IT sector. This research highlights the nuanced dynamics of competition and withdrawal in contemporary Chinese workplaces.",

    "title": "‘GUERILLA ANALYSIS’ AND THE INSTITUTIONAL VOICE: THE TELEGRAM’S PRODUCTIVE MESO-SPACE OF CORONAVIRUS VISUALIZATIONS",
    "abstract": "During the coronavirus pandemic, Israeli Telegram became a staple venue of pandemic news, as the platform served as the Ministry of Health’s primary official output. Over time, Telegram also became home to a community of ‘Guerilla Analysts’ who pooled together their analytical resources to create a ‘National Graph Headquarters’. Utilizing the same data as the MoH channel, this ragtag crew of data-loving laypeople created a space in which data-literacies are shared and developed. Informed by conceptualizations of messaging apps as “news meso-space(s)”, digital collaborative information-making practices, and the notion that visualizations can promote civic deliberation and political empowerment, this paper explores the rhetorical and discursive framework that enabled informational migration and evolution, and the co-production of data-oriented pandemic narratives across both groups, resulting in an exceptionally empowering informational eco-system. It does so by applying qualitative rhetorical visualization analysis to 100 pairs of institutional and guerilla visualizations of the same data, prior to qualitative discourse analysis of 30 related comment threads. Findings reveal that while the ‘Institutional Voice’ remained focused on conservative visualizations of the present and past, guerilla analysts often re-visualize MoH visualizations into predictive narratives, and take bolder swings in proposing actionable implications. While primarily focused on sociable elucidation of complex analyses, comment discourse also challenges and re-visualizes ‘Guerilla’ narratives, further extending informational empowerment. Predominantly conceptualized as a subversive venue, I highlight Telegram as a civic platform and propose a conceptualization of messaging apps as productive and empowering meso-spaces, utilizing common social and analytical resources towards a common good.",

    "title": "BEAUTY BRANDS ONLINE: VISUALITY, LABOUR, AND REPRESENTATION",
    "abstract": "Engagement with beauty has historically been seen as inherently consumptive and (perhaps therefore) inherently feminine and trivial. Popular discourse today would suggest, however, that beauty is increasingly seen as creative, and no longer assumed to be the domain of any one gender, particularly in online spaces. Amidst celebrations of the democratisation of beauty on one end, and cries of an appearance-obsessed culture on the other, what does a situated feminist examination of online beauty culture tell us today? This paper maps the practices of beauty brands online by analysing 545 Instagram posts made by the five most followed beauty brands in India to examine whom they represent and how, but also how these images are produced at the intersection of techno-aesthetic choices, platform affordances, market considerations, and the modes of gendered identity privileged by culture at a given point in time. In the Indian context, where gendered labour precarity has been baked into the social system, and the promise of transformation through digital democratisation runs loud in socio-political discourse, the beauty brand on Instagram offers a site to examine new modes of gendered precarious labour and economic insecurity. At the same time, it also points to the new ecology of beauty media today: the actors and technologies that make it possible, the opportunities it presents, and the new aesthetics and production modes it affords. This work speaks to broader cultures around appearance and gendered self-presentation, and the nebulous nature of labour and influence in today’s media environment.",

    "abstract": "Research on online hate speech is burgeoning, highlighting its significant negative consequences on individual and societal levels. Still, there is a lack of attention directed towards understanding the perceptions and experiences of individuals in the general population toward this phenomenon. Such insights could significantly help decision-makers and scholars in formulating initiatives to inform and educate the public, thereby preventing further harm. Therefore, quality insight into the understanding and perceptions of hate speech, as well as related experiences and behaviour is needed. In the absence of established survey instruments and given the fragmented and limited nature of the existing data, the primary objective of this scoping review is to systematically identify online hate speech survey measures, as well as the topics and populations the associated research addressed. Preliminary findings reveal a disproportionate focus on students and young adults and the predominant use of non-representative sampling methods, leaving older population groups under-researched and raising concerns about results’ generalizability. Broad research scopes are predominant; in order to better understand real-world experiences, scholars should aim for more detailed research scopes, including studying OHS in specific online contexts and within specific groups. In terms of topics, existing survey measures mostly cover the topics of direct exposure/perpetration of OHS, neglecting the whole hate speech ecosystem; what comes before and after the dissemination of hate speech online. In terms of question types, ordinal scales are most common, but the lack of standardized scales results in fragmented findings that are difficult to compare.",

    "abstract": "Like other media industries (e.g. music, film, TV), the podcasting industry has spent the last year coming to grips with the impact that generative artificial intelligence tools will have on the future of podcast production and consumption. Several high-profile examples of AI-generated podcasts have raised questions about the ethics, legality, and creativity of AI for creating podcast scripts, voices, and sound design. These in turn raise larger concerns about ownership and the economics of the platforms that distribute podcasts (like Spotify). In this paper, I survey the state of artificial intelligence in the podcasting industry to address the following two questions: How is AI being used by podcasters and other actors in the podcasting industry? How is the use of AI in podcasting framed in articles and writing about the industry? By sampling a number of podcasts that employ AI during the production and consumption process (e.g. AI scriptwriting, AI voiced hosts, AI sound design, etc.), my paper explores how podcasters and others in the podcasting industry are using AI as part of their everyday work. I develop a typology for the different ways AI is currently being used in podcasting in order to explore the anxieties around the use of artificial intelligence in the cultural industries as well as the everyday, and more mundane, impact AI is having on workflows, production capabilities and notions of creativity in the creative industries.",

    "abstract": "The popular short-form video app TikTok is mainly discussed as a discrete app or in relation to its parent company ByteDance. This view neglects how TikTok and other ByteDance apps maintain and advance ByteDance’s highly complex app ecosystem. This paper, therefore, positions ByteDance-owned apps as both apps and “platform tools.” TikTok allows end-users to watch videos, allows creators to make and distribute content, advertisers to endorse products, and developers to build app features. As a platform tool, TikTok is a software-based resource that mediates “platformization,” extending TikTok’s economic, infrastructural, and governmental data-centric logic within and beyond ByteDance’s app ecosystem. Increasingly, ByteDance’s platform tools rely heavily on AI technology because of ByteDance’s early investments in AI technology and the growing interest such tools within the cultural industries. We survey ByteDance’s AI-powered platform tools alongside non-AI ones using systematic financial and infrastructural analysis, uncovering how ByteDance’s platform tools expand ByteDance as a “multi-sided,” “multi-layered,” and “multi-situated” platform. Platform tools, thus, facilitate growth along these three dimensions by encouraging platform dependence; interoperability and interdependence within ByteDance’s app ecosystem; and platformization, including “parallel platformization.” Our empirical work ultimately shows how ByteDance uses platform tools to accrue and operationalize infrastructural and economic power, and how apps have moved from discrete objects to interconnected clusters of platform tools.",

    "abstract": "This paper outlines a programme of work which uses research through design approaches to explore the impacts of home automation on ritual, meaning and embodied practice. Rather than the current focus on utilitarian outcomes related to industry and efficiency, we suggest that automation in the home may have bearing on identity, spirituality and mental wellbeing.\n\nWe suggest that as connected technology and automation becomes more embedded in the context of the home, consideration must be given to how this impacts on meaningful practices that require embodied, tangible experience and action. These may be religious or spiritual in nature, such as use of the Lakshmi jhadu (grass broom) as part of a morning sweeping ritual in rural Indian households. Alternatively, they may also be related to cultural and interpersonal meaning such as creating a physical cassette mix-tape to give to a loved one.\n\nWe ask: how is value and meaning in embodied ritual practice impacted by intervention with digital technologies in the home? Can borrowing principles of traditional ritual practice support sustainable and meaningful smart interventions to home life?",

    "abstract": "The failure of the youth from low-privilege backgrounds in obtaining quality private education to become more employable in the competitive job market has coincided with the growth and affordability of the smartphone-Internet in India. Using ethnographic methods, both in-person and online, with 20 young men from low-privileged backgrounds in Kolkata (India), this ongoing research investigates how they access content of the digital industries, mostly on YouTube, to acquire skills for and information about income opportunities against a lack of access to quality institutions. It asks whether and how the outcomes of such Internet use are shaped by their specific life contexts which influence the scope of application of such information. $2 the affordable Internet resources, the young men exercise their agency to attempt to fill the deficiencies of formal institutions. This indicates an overcoming of the second digital divide, although not uniformly. In line with the third digital divide, these findings reveal greater obstacles in the efficacy of applying livelihood-related online resources in terms of the nature of livelihoods sought, availability of energy and time, social expectations, and the availability of avenues for finding lesser employment via offline ties. With examples, I aim to argue that the extent of divide (2nd or 3rd) is not uniform for individuals in a population group but varies with uses.

    "title": "THE ELITE AMONG USERS: IDENTITY FORMATION OF VENDORS AND CUSTOMERS ON DARKNET DRUG TRADE SITES",
    "abstract": "This study delves into the digital identity formation of vendors and customers on darknet drug trade sites, focusing on Cebulka, the largest Polish-language cryptomarket. Recently, we have seen a rise in interest in studying online drug trade. Despite this growing attention, research on how individuals present themselves online and construct their identities in dark web environments remains relatively scarce. Through a dual-stage methodology combining conventional content analysis (CCA) of 8170 posts and in-depth interviews with users (n=10), this study explores how Cebulka’s users curate their online personas. The findings reveal that vendors employ sophisticated marketing strategies, emphasizing product quality to build brand identity. Consumers, in turn, contribute by sharing detailed feedback. All these practices foster a community of informed users who view themselves as superior to traditional street-level traders and clear web (social media) users. This self-perception extends to a belief in their enhanced knowledge and quasi-expertise concerning drugs, a distinction from conventional drug users, and a separation between their online and real-life identities. The study illustrates that these digital personas are collectively shaped, drawing on social identity theory and performance theories to understand the platform’s behavior and interactions. This research not only bridges a gap in understanding the complex dynamics of darknet drug trading but also offers insights into the broader subculture of drug users, suggesting distinct identifications and identities among those active on the dark web. It challenges traditional views of drug traders and has implications for harm reduction and policy development.",

    "title": "THE UNFRIENDING PERFORMANCE: THE LOGIC OF DISCONNECTIVE ACTION IN CRISES",
    "abstract": "This research examines the concept of \"disconnective action\" during crises, positing it as a necessary counterpart to \"connective action\" (Bennett &amp; Segerberg, 2012). While digital media is typically lauded for fostering connectivity during socio-political controversies, it also presents affordances for disconnectivity, such as unfriending, unfollowing, and banning. This project aims to understand the dynamics and implications of digital disconnection, particularly during crises that serve as catalysts for revealing divergent opinions among social network users (Sibona, 2014; John &amp; Dvir-Gvirsman, 2015; John &amp; Gal, 2018). The theoretical backdrop of this study involves \"disconnective power\" (Light &amp; Cassidy, 2014), which refers to the ability of dominant actors to employ digital media as tools for political, cultural, and social fragmentation. The research proposes that this form of power is particularly evident in the strategic use of digital technologies to isolate political systems and promote societal disintegration. Accordingly, the new forms of propaganda utilize disconnective affordances to undermine cross-conflict horizontal networks. By framing disconnection as a performative \"speech act\" (Austin,1962; Butler, 1990) and examining the role of social media as both a unifying and divisive force, this study contributes to a nuanced understanding of digital interaction in times of socio-political unrest. Over five years, data on public unfriending announcements were collected, particularly from Russian-speaking Facebook users during the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. The research reveals the dominant logics behind publicized disconnective actions and the influence of individual users in initiating broader disconnective trends.",

    "title": "THE POLITICS OF MACHINE-LEARNING EVALUATION: FROM LAB TO INDUSTRY",
    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications are today implemented across various societal sectors, ranging from health care and security to taking part in shaping the media environment we encounter online. In the last decade there has been a significant shift in the field of AI, as the development of AI applications is no longer confined to the laboratory, but rather widely used and tested in and on societies. With this rapid industrialisation of AI, there is an increased need to understand the implications of both the development and deployment of these systems. While critical scholars have started to scrutinize different components of AI development, the study of evaluative practices in AI has received limited attention. A few studies have highlighted the importance of benchmarking practices and how these methods become integral in establishing the validity of the system and its success, which then enables widespread application. This paper presents a research agenda that outlines how to study machine-learning evaluation practices that move beyond the laboratory into industry applications and standardised validation practices. Based on emerging research and illustrative empirical examples from recent fieldwork, we argue to study machine-learning evaluation as a sociotechnical and political phenomenon that requires multi-level scrutiny. Therefore, we provide three analytical entry points for future research that address the political dynamics of (1) standardised validation infrastructures, (2) the circulation of evaluation methods and (3) the situated enactment of evaluation in practice.",

    "abstract": "This article builds on a growing body of research on content creators and authenticity through examining practices of performing authenticity of a rising labor figures, e-commerce streamers in China. Along with content creation, they interrogate agricultural products, infrastructure networks and their own body to create an authentic rural China. Their invisible labor on logistical level to ensure the data flow contributes to a richer typology on platform labor and global perspective on platformization studies.\n\nBased on one-year field work, I investigate how these e-commerce streamers handle logistical challenges from three aspects. Firstly, they select and define the authentic rural products considering the visibility requirements on platform. Secondly, they put extract work to maintain power networks to ensure streaming, like prepare portable electrical generators. Thirdly, they discipline their own body and develop labor degradation to simply the intense streaming activities. Borrow concepts from logistical media studies, this research theorize their labor as logistical struggle.\n\nIn conclusion, the practice of these e-commerce streamers in marginalized rural China informs the diverse process to perform authenticity in platform economy era and the multiple layers of platform labor across global scales. It also shows how authenticity based on structural inequality, urban-rural divide policy, is commodified and enhances the social status of marginalized social group by enforcing them more invisible labor.",

    "title": "NOSTALGIC NEIGHBORHOODS OF TIKTOK: MAPPING A TOPOLOGY OF AFFECTIVE PUBLICS",
    "abstract": "Nostalgia is a culturally resonant, politically potent, and increasingly networked sensemaking resource that frames how people see the past and understand their place in the world. Despite nostalgia's locative meaning, there is a lack of research applying network analytic methods to study its structure and social-semiotic function in online networks which enable connective action based on discursive, affective, and mimetic bonds. While research indicates nostalgia’s dual-edge social function in group dynamics of solidarity and exclusion, these studies often take collective identity a priori, limiting understanding of how platform affordances structure the formation of affective publics around nostalgic discourse and sentiment. Through a semantic network analysis of the popular hashtag #nostalgia (&gt;140B views) on TikTok, this study offers a first step toward understanding the meaning of nostalgia in networked processes of group identification by mapping a topology of “nostalgic neighborhoods” emerging from the co-linkages of hashtags on the platform. Based on the equivalence of these neighborhoods’ semantic structures and thematic meanings, I identify three types of affective publics – play-grounds, heart-lands, and reflecting pools – that emerged in relation to different linguistic and technical functions of the hashtag. I argue the different affective intensities and meanings of nostalgia within these publics reflected the platform’s dynamics of imitation and virality. As TikTok’s algorithmic affordances of visibility and association are less rooted in interpersonal social ties, this study contributes important insights into how the hashtag, as a semiotic technology (Zappavigna, 2018), structures nostalgic affective publics on popular site for nostalgia within youth cultures.",

    "title": "A GAME OF PRIVACY TUG OF WAR: A HISTORICAL ANALYSIS OF PRIVACY SETTINGS",
    "abstract": "Privacy settings are a critical mechanism for platforms to manage, control, and impact user privacy online. The policies of social media platforms and their technical design—including the choice architecture of privacy settings—\"serve as a form of privatized governance directly enacting rights and regulating the flow of information online (DeNardis &amp; Hackl, 2015). Many platforms use a rhetoric of “choice and control,” relying on privacy settings to shoulder the burden of responsibility for user privacy (Horne, 2021). Another challenge to privacy on social media platforms is that there is a wide disparity of settings choices across different platforms, with varying defaults (Horne, 2023). Additionally, the interconnection and the technical importance of privacy settings has a clear and well-established history. This paper examines this history via a historical analysis of Meta’s changes to privacy settings. The analysis focuses on Meta as it is one of the oldest and largest of social media platforms; it also hosts a comprehensive archive of news articles, which tracks critical updates to Meta products. The study seeks to determine what privacy settings changes Meta has made, when the changes were announced, as well as analyze how these changes were framed in news articles.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents findings from an ongoing project focused on sober curious communities on TikTok. In this paper I argue that these communities offer a haven from in ‘intoxigenic’ digital spaces for individuals navigating the complexities of sobriety.\n\nThis research examines the implications of TikTok's emergence as a locus of sociality for the sober curious movement, both in terms of individual well-being and broader societal attitudes towards addiction and recovery. Central to this is an exploration of the creative and expressive practices employed by individuals within sober curious communities and the attitudes and experiences of those who follow them.\n\nThe paper draws on qualitative data from interviews with 28 sober curious TikTok users and a systematic content analysis of 800 TikTok videos.\n\nEmergent findings reveal insights into the role of TikTok in destigmatizing addiction, fostering empathy and promoting positive representations of abstinence and resilience.\n\nThree key themes with be explored: the value of digital storytelling, the nature of TikTok accountability, and the visibility of failures or relapses. These themes underscore TikTok's significance as a platform for personal expression, accountability, and community-building within the sober curious movement.\n\nCombined, these themes speak to TikTok as an important platform for the sober curious. TikTok allows the messy, unpredictable, embodied and digital practices and experiences of sobriety to play out. Reframing sobriety beyond medicalised narratives of addiction to provide a more nuanced and freeing set of practices and contexts that enable respondents to rethink and re-evaluate their relationship with alcohol.",

    "abstract": "Digital traces generated by internet users are automatically collected, stored, and analyzed by public and private actors. This dataveillance becomes salient to users through repeated exposure over time to triggers of a sense of dataveillance. This can lead to a range of consequences including democratically concerning responses such as the self-inhibition of legitimate digital communication behavior, known as the chilling effects of dataveillance. Such chilling effects are expected to subtly accumulate over time. Hence, longitudinal in-situ studies are required to capture the temporal dynamics of individuals’ perception of dataveillance and the resulting behavioral changes. Relying on a longitudinal online field experiment with a representative sample of Swiss internet users, this study investigates how chilling effects accumulate over time and aims to capture the temporal dynamics of chilling effects. Preliminary results reveal that the experimental treatment successfully heightened participants' sense of dataveillance over time. Time significantly predicted this increase, aligning with the notion of accumulating chilling effects. Furthermore, the comfort levels of the digital communication behaviors, including information searching, opinion voicing, and information disclosing, were over time lower for the experimental treatment than control condition, supporting the chilling-effects hypothesis. Accumulating chilling effects were found for information disclosing as the experimental treatment and time predicted a decrease in participants’ comfortability level. This article provides an innovative contribution to the growing research on the chilling effects of dataveillance and adds to the empirical understanding of the nature of chilling effects.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has prompted the development of comprehensive AI developmental and governance frameworks globally. Yet, existing literature on AI innovation in non-Western societies often overlooks economically advanced but geographically non-dominant societies, instead focusing on large nation-states like China or developing regions in Global South such as South Africa. This paper examines the variegated sociotechnical imaginaries of AI in three Asian developmental societies - Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan - addressing two research questions: what are the desired forms of AI development and governance in small-size advanced economies? How does this desired form vary according to the historical, institutional, and geopolitical contexts of these societies?\n\nThrough discourse analysis of policy documents from the early 2010s to 2024, the paper identifies three imaginaries of techno-developmentalism: Singapore’s cybernetic pragmaticism to legitimize its neoliberal authoritarian rule, Hong Kong’s techno-entrepreneurship in refashioning financial capitalism, and Taiwan’s defensive survival modality against internal socio-economic instability and external threats posed by the rivalry of superpowers. Decision-makers in these societies must establish AI developmental frameworks capable of resource allocation, actor coordination, strategic coupling with the global tech economy, and managing uncertainties in specific AI-centric socio-economic reform.\n\nBy offering comparative case studies of these Asian societies, this paper contributes to understanding the heterogeneous narratives and practices of AI innovation, moving beyond simplistic narratives trapped in the Global North and South binary.",

    "abstract": "There is long-standing research on women’s use of media for romantic/erotic fantasy, including novelettes (Radway, 1984), porn (Juffer, 1998) and erotica apps Bellas &amp; McAllister, 2023). This presentation explores the similarities and differences between earlier forms of media romancing and the use of an AI companion. Emerging research on AI chatbots uses frameworks that assign novelty to human-machine communications. In this study, we focus on the user experience – we conducted qualitative, in-depth interviews with twenty mostly midlife female users of the Replika chatbot, whom we recruited online. Thematic analysis identified that the women used the bot, first, for fantasies of a companion they were lacking in real life, such as an attentive lover, friend or child, in the context of feeling alone (due to e.g. living alone, caring for family, inattentive husband or having a chronic condition). Second, the bot was reflexively used for caring for or managing the self, such as validating one’s worth and emotions to neutralize negative thinking, following the therapeutic ethos (Illouz, 2008, Gravel-Patry, 2023). The fantasies of an attentive partner were similar to previous work on romancing, although the women’s life situations were more diverse than often investigated. The use of the bot for regulating emotions, however, was new and signifies the spirit of our time emphasizing self-management and positive thinking. The study contextualizes human-machine communication by discussing the individual experiences of female Replika users to understand better both change and continuity in our communication with media, from romance novels to AI chatbots.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, I conduct a systematic review of the use of VirtualHumans.org in academic studies of the virtual influencer industry. To do this, I analyze all references to and use of content from the Virtual Humans website in relevant published research from 2019 to 2024 (n=189), including the website’s database of existing virtual influencers, interviews with virtual influencer creators and virtual influencer characters themselves, articles on the state of the virtual influencer industry, and profiles of each listed virtual influencer. I pair this analysis with a brief history of VirtualHumans.org from a political economy perspective, noting the factors which went into the website’s creation; its acquisition by Offbeat Media Group, a digital marketing agency; and its organizational shifts following the sudden departure of its founder in 2023. Ultimately, I question whether academic viewpoints of the emergent virtual influencer industry, many which refer to the Virtual Humans website as a valuable resource for grasping a sense of the size and scope of the virtual influencer phenomenon, adequately consider the rooted biases and commercial interests represented by the website as not only a database but a powerful broker within the industry. Moreover, by narrating the organizational development of VirtualHumans.org as an enterprise, I contribute detailed context into the formation of these biases and commercial interests which inform its position in the virtual influencer scene.",

    "abstract": "In this study, I investigate the intricate realm of single fathers navigating the online dating landscape within Norway, when I ask the question: How do single dads in their mid-life adulthood present themselves as parents on dating apps in Norway? Employing a multifaceted research methodology comprising nethnography and autoethnography, I meticulously scrutinize how these fathers choose to divulge their parental status and romantic preferences through their dating app profiles, with a specifical focus on their self-presentation dynamics, re-partnering strategies, parental obligations, in context with cultural nuances. The insights gathered from this inquiry unveil a thoughtful approach adopted by these individuals, strategically accentuating their roles as fathers while also elucidating their priorities, logistical considerations, and compatibility criteria. By shedding light on these details, this study serves as a crucial exploration into the complexities that confront modern single parents navigating the terrain of dating apps. Furthermore, it offers valuable reflections on the shifting paradigms and evolving norms within contemporary relationships, underscoring the nuanced interplay between personal aspirations, parental responsibilities, and societal expectations in the context of romantic pursuits.",

    "title": "BETWEEN GRAPHICAL 'EXCELLENCE‘, LITERACY, AND POLYSEMY: A BI-NATIONAL STUDY OF DIGITAL POLITICAL VISUALIZATION RECEPTION",
    "abstract": "Digital political visualizations often highlight an inherent conflict between visualization practitioner heuristics and standards, which are geared towards leading audiences to a ‘correct’ reading, and the use of “strategic ambiguity” (Eisenberg, 1984) to increase political appeal. While excellence in creation and interpretation of visualization is studied and theorized primarily with the visualization’s attributes in mind, the ubiquity of digital political visualizations as a rhetorical genre brings forth a host of audience-side considerations and decoding processes so far neglected by scholars. Thus, this paper amalgamates perspectives onto visualization as a communicative technology, a rhetorical genre, and a persuasion-tool by exploring the relationship between graphical excellence, audience’s graphical literacy, and the ensuing polysemy in personal/group readings of digital political visualizations. Asking: How do audiences decode political messages embedded in visualizations shared online? We conducted a bi-national focus-group study (8 groups, 67 participants), in which participants conduct group- and individual- decoding of digital political visualization stimuli. We find that all stimuli, regardless of design heuristics and/or topic, resulted in starkly polysemic readings, with participants’ attitudes ranging between graphical avoidance, and calls for ‘interpretive freedom,’ suggesting that the epitome of literacy is the ability to see beyond the intended meaning and assert one’s own interpretation according to their worldviews. We thus suggest is it imperative to view digital political visualizations’ reception as a result of both visualizers’ choices and audience’s individual/collective interpretive freedom, striving for ‘graphical excellence’ as a shared pursuit of both audiences and visualizers, aimed to bring forth more benign digital deliberation.",

    "title": "FROM IA_ARCHIVER TO OPENAI: THE PASTS AND FUTURES OF AUTOMATED DATA SCRAPERS",
    "abstract": "Data scraping practices have recently come under scrutiny, as datasets scraped from the web’s social spaces are the basis of new generative AI tools like Google’s Gemini, Microsoft’s Copilot, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. These practices of scrapers and crawlers are based on the conception of the internet as a mountain of data that’s sitting, waiting, available to be acted upon, extracted and put to use. In this paper, we examine the robots.txt exclusion protocol which has been used to govern the behavior of crawlers and is often taken as a proxy for consent in widespread data scraping and web archiving. By addressing the underlying assumptions of the protocol, we aim to counter a recent narrative that “the basic social contract of the web is falling apart” (Pierce, 2024), and instead argue that data extractive infrastructures have always been at work over the past 30 years of the web. Positioning this work within the field of critical data studies, we aim to find new ways for web archives and modes of collection to become unbound from the “capitalist logics of data extraction” upon which they’re currently built (Theilen et al., 2021).",

    "title": "ENGINEERED INEQUALITY: MUSICAL TAXONOMIES AND STREAMING RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS",
    "abstract": "In the past five years, the music industry and streaming giants have embraced the success of Latin, Korean and Afrobeats music and heavily promoted their multicultural expertise and international expansion (Spotify 2021a, 2018b; Dredge 2022). However, despite academic efforts to understand streaming classification and recommendation (Seaver 2022; Maasø &amp; Spilker 2022; Hesmondhalgh et al. 2023) it is still unclear which musical taxonomies are used by music streaming platforms. The publication of the DCMS report (2023) in the UK has brought to the fore the importance of understanding streaming software infrastructures, including how music is organised by platforms, and how recommendations and curation are automated. What kind of cultural visions, understandings, and taxonomies of music are currently hardwired into recommender systems? This paper analyses the taxonomies and the metadata standards used to code music catalogue into streaming services to argue that the current industry practices do not contribute to the international vision promoted. Using a mixed methods approach, this paper combines interface analysis of music streaming platforms, discourse analysis over PR industry materials and ethnographic fieldwork at industry conferences, and interviews with industry, public, and start-up stakeholders. In doing so, it contrasts the disparity between industry emphasis on automation, expertise and internationalisation with practices that reveal Western-centric, incoherent and error-prone approaches to catalogue. Following a postcolonial cultural economy framework (Saha 2021), I show how these underdeveloped software infrastructures contribute to the making and reproduction of culture and race, and more widely how they impact music cultures worldwide.",

    "abstract": "The internet has transformed the dissemination and reception of scientific information, creating unique opportunities and challenges for public science. This panel explores the impact of digitally mediated communication on public perceptions of science, focusing on the proliferation of misinformation, conspiracy theories, and science politicization in online spaces. Drawing from diverse disciplinary perspectives, including communication, information science, and history, our panelists describe how various aspects of the digital influence public (mis)understandings of science.\n\nFirst, they discuss the epistemological nuances of preprint servers, retracted articles, and clickbait journalism, highlighting the need for a framework of scientific and digital literacy. They then explore how intermediaries like Wikipedia and social media facilitate scientific controversies, from Y2K to 5G, that circulate within scientific publics and counterpublics. Finally, they consider the challenges of using retractions to correct flawed science in an environment characterized by politicized scientific distrust. By elucidating these digital dynamics, the panel aims to inform the larger discussion of the public relevance of reliable scientific information in the face of politicized attacks on science.",

    "title": "EXPLORING APPIFICATION",
    "abstract": "This panel offers a reflection on the evolution and transformations of apps and app studies over the past decade, emphasizing how apps have seamlessly integrated into our daily routines and shaped our cultural and economic landscape. This process, known as ‘appification’, involves integrating various aspects of daily life and activities into mobile applications, fundamentally altering how we communicate, access information, make payments, and use digital services (Dieter et al., 2019; Goggin, 2021; Morris and Murray, 2018). Research in app studies has evolved in multiple directions during this time to analyse the implications of appification. This has included examining how app interfaces and features influence social, cultural, and economic practices, employing methods such as the walkthrough method or feature analysis (Hasinoff &amp; Bivens, 2021; Light et al., 2018). Additionally, there has been a focus on the technical and material dimensions of the data infrastructures in which apps are situated (Gerlitz et al., 2019). Simultaneously, the emergence of new app genres, like ‘super apps’, which combine features, services, and practices in unique ways, has transformed apps into platforms for further development. However, this evolution also raises methodological questions on researching and contextualizing change over time (Helmond &amp; van der Vlist, 2021). The evolving and dynamic nature of apps, accordingly, necessitates a continuous need for critical reflection on the methods used to study apps and the phenomenon of appification.\n\nThe panel explores the concept of appification through various lenses, including governance and safety measures in dating apps, the complexities of app-based authentication, the global rise of super-apps and their historical evolution in the Chinese context, and the integration of AI technologies into mobile and enterprise applications. Methodologically, the panel showcases diverse strategies to explore appification, such as the walkthrough method, creating research personas, decompiling and debugging app software packages, historical analysis using app repositories, and analysing mini-apps and app store inventories. Together, these studies provide insight into emerging approaches for understanding appification going forward and how apps are reshaping interactions, governance, and technology integration across different domains and cultural contexts.\n\nAll five papers in this panel engage with the concept of appification, which entails the integration of various aspects of daily life into mobile applications, fundamentally changing how we communicate, access information, conduct transactions, and use digital services. The first paper employs the walkthrough method to explore how dating apps shape the notion of ‘safety’ through their policies and technological features, shedding light on how safety measures are often traded for data and how these apps normalise surveillance practices. The second paper investigates the appification of dating by examining Tinder’s authentication mechanisms, revealing the complexities of user interactions and data exchanges within the app ecosystem. Advancing the field of app studies, the panel thus explores methodological strategies and conceptual frameworks to address the nuances of appification. The third paper maps out the global landscape of ‘super apps’ and theorises the process of ‘super-appification’, where apps extend beyond their traditional boundaries to offer a wide range of features and services, reshaping user engagement and corporate expansion. A comparative historiography of prominent Chinese super apps forms the basis of the fourth paper, tracing their evolution, features, and strategies driving their dominance. Lastly, the fifth paper examines the emerging ecosystems of AI apps, exploring their infrastructural features and relationships. Together, these studies provide a comprehensive overview of the ongoing transformations in the mobile ecosystem and the appification process, highlighting the crucial role of app features in shaping social interactions and corporate strategies.",

    "abstract": "This decade has been characterized by a deep crisis of trust and legitimacy, which is linked in complex ways to digital technologies and modes of communication. This panel focuses on the role of visuality in trust. It starts from the premise that images are increasingly used to express reliability and trustworthiness, increase engagement in online environments, while also being met with increasing suspicion across platforms. We propose five linked papers that explore how visual digital trust is experienced and made sense of by social media users, content creators and platforms. We are finding that trust is often too abstract for social media users to be able to address directly, rather it is experienced and articulated via norms and practices of (in)authenticity, relatability, coherence, credibility, authority. Thus, our papers focus on these various aspects, experiences and components of visual digital trust moving from perceptions of in/authenticity (paper 1) and social media users’ practices of distributed seeing at its service (paper 2), to users perceptions of creators’ commercial motivations and how that intersects with trust (paper 3), to questions of embodied trust in representations of gym bodies (paper 4) and finally the negotiations of trustworthiness in the context of YouTube’s “Health” program (paper 5).",

    "abstract": "Advancements in Large Language Models have been showing important research opportunities within the field of communication studies. It offers the capacity to conduct large-scale content classification and annotation with low computational expertise and reduced manual coding efforts, potentially allowing more possibilities for researchers in social sciences to explore understudied topics (Bail, 2023; Chang et al., 2024). Because of its functioning and vast domains and language training, LLMS also potentially unlocks more generalizable, complex, and diverse analyses across various communication materials than previous computational tools and approaches (Chang et al., 2024). These materials encompass a wide spectrum, ranging from journalistic content to the digital discourse of political actors and social media conversation threads. At the same time, LLMs also raise important concerns with potential biases, data privacy, models’ transparency, environmental impact, and power imbalances (Jameel et al., 2020; Fecher et al., 2023). Although highly discussed recently, as a recent topic LLMs still need deeper theoretical elaboration and dialogue between empirical investigations specifically for communication scholars (Gil de Zúñiga et al., 2024; Guzman and Lewis, 2020).\n\nOur panel assembles a collection of case studies that harness LLMs to tackle text classification and annotation tasks related to media and communication problems, issues, and topics. These research papers engage in an exploration of: (a) pipeline structuring: diverse methodologies for structuring effective pipelines tailored to this form of analysis; (b) tools and models comparison: comparisons of the various LLMs tools and models available for text classification and annotation, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses; (c) optimal variables and tasks: identifying the variables and tasks where LLMs demonstrates exceptional performance and reliability; (d) limitations: discussions on the existing limitations of these tools, including limitations related to specific tasks, variables, languages and data formats; (e) prompt development: strategies for developing, adapting and adjusting prompts that allows better results for specific tasks; and (e) ethical and political dimensions: an examination of the ethical and political considerations inherent in the deployment of LLMs in communication research.\n\nThis panel puts together valuable efforts of different research groups across the world to not only use, but also reflect on the use of LLMs in Communication studies. They show important avenues for the field to think about different approaches to validity, ethics and truthful cooperation between humans and computational models without erasing the challenges of doing so, and the disagreements - not only between humans, but between humans and their computational language models too.",

    "title": "AMBIENT AMPLIFICATION: ATTENTION HIJACKING AND SOCIAL MEDIA PROPAGANDA",
    "abstract": "Over the last decade, the rise of memetic media in combination with multimodal platform environments have radically transformed our experience of digital culture. On TikTok, gestures and sounds go viral. Twitter (X) @tags operate as bonding tools and ignite ‘supercharged’ critical publics. Coordinated link-sharing and attention-hijacking drive cross-platform engagement. Narratives promoted by state institutions become part of the global digital culture war. Networked content made up of heterogeneous elements sparks new forms of presencing, propaganda, and play, producing conflict-ridden communities of practice.\n\nThe amalgamation of this all into people’s everyday lives marks a qualitative shift in the ways we use social media. While there has always been an affective component to digital objects such as hashtags (Papacharissi 2015), contemporary audiovisual platforms increasingly target the full sensory experience of human bodies. The focus shifts from fleeting encounters with recommended content to ambient arrangements of linked sounds, networked text, clickable icons, and moving images (Han and Zappavigna 2024; Parry 2023). Within these structures, hybrid cultures of amplification emerge, relying on both intensification and extension. As expressive modalities evolve, amplification not only animates momentary affective impulses but also manifests through repeated attempts at attention hijacking that spread across platforms via everyday acts of sharing (John 2017; Citton 2017).\n\nIn view of these transitions, internet scholars turn to the role of affect to describe the rhythms of online exchanges that are not reducible to singular constituents and can both diminish and increase the engaging potential of content- and data-informed connectivity (Hillis, Paasonen and Petit 2015; Boler and Davis 2020; Slaby 2019). Acts of participation that open up spaces of amplification escape any clear-cut demarcation. Platform communities assembled through different digital objects sidestep binary conceptions of authenticity and (coordinated) performance, allowing amplification to emerge from multiple discrepancies (Graham et al. 2021; DiResta 2021). Platform-mediated processes of authentication target misinformation campaigns, aiming to identify ‘trustworthy’ content (Burton, Chun et al. 2023). At the same time, seemingly straightforward contributions we like and share can be anything but (Phillips and Milner 2021).\n\nUnderstood as a web of affective stimulations (Siapera 2019), ambient amplification refers to social media encounters that bear potential for contestation in different registers of online performance, human and nonhuman. On the one hand, the proliferation of echo chambers and filter bubbles drawing together like-minded communities easily fits into the 'crowd modulation' project through the exhaustion of collective inclinations and correlated metadata (Rogers and Niederer 2020; Apprich et al. 2019). On the other hand, the layeredness of networked embodiment on audiovisual platforms rewires predefined trajectories of amplification through 'dissonant' connections that refuse to be contained in neat taxonomies. Although a great variety of scholarly work is dedicated to polarised engagement, there is still a large gap in studying how different modes of amplification are made to work in more ambiguous contexts (Paasonen 2023).\n\nThe main challenge in approaching this research field is that the messiness of platform-mediated communication is difficult to comprehend. The shifts in relations of data-intensive participation and networked attention capture have made up the platforms' appeal since the very beginnings of the social web (Gillespie 2010), yet the actual ways these relations are made to work remain understudied. Moving away from the analysis of symptoms–as in the most visible content and events of peak intensity–this panel focuses on the ambient logic of amplification forged by the various attachments that online engagement in multimodal social media affords.\n\nStarting from the premise of plurality, it brings together five papers, each of which explores a different aspect of ambient amplification: Paper 1 explores the role of ‘thirst trap propaganda’ in military image wars on TikTok. Paper 2 reflects on the role of gestures in targeted war propaganda placements, presenting a visual method of slow circulation for amplified TikTok content. Paper 3 analyzes hashtagging- and @-tagging practices on X that undergird a polyvocal infrastructure exposing journalists to networked critique. Paper 4 looks into the spectrum of coordination in the service of attention hijacking, investigating what makes coordinated link-sharing on Facebook look ‘authentic enough’. Paper 5 interrogates the weaponization of narratives of a global culture war by Russian embassies, uncovering geopolitical strategies of amplification.",

    "abstract": "Amateur family vlogs on YouTube have become a living testament to the lives of Indian women and their ongoing battles against inequalities in the domestic space and digital space. It requires sharing a carefully curated but intimate representation of their personal lives. Problematising that, this paper primarily discusses how affective and emotional labour interplay in performance as a microcelebrity in family vlogging by Indian women YouTubers. It starts with the question of how women’s affective and emotional labour are exploited to create a commodified self. Drawing from interviews, analysis of select vlogs and audience comments, and participant observation during the vlog recording; the study also explores their motivation for participating in the ‘fame-work’ and how it enhances the ‘visibility’ of women’s domestic work. The work reveals that the primary motivation to engage in these labours comes in the form of fame, acknowledgement of their invisible housework, and creating an identity which facilitates a sense of empowerment.",

    "title": "MASCULINE OPTIMIZATION INFLUENCERS AND THE SACRALITY OF SELF-OPTIMIZATION",
    "abstract": "From daily cold plunges to meticulous morning routines to obsessive fitness tracking, there is a rising cohort of American male influencers centered around the notion of reaching “maximum potential” physically and mentally. Focusing on a cohort I’m calling “Masculinized Optimization Influencers,” I argue that this group is best understood through the lens of Sara Ahmed’s (2004) “affective economies.” Defined as those who place a dual focus on men’s need to hustle equally at the gym and in their career, Masculine Optimization Influencers present a particular vision of masculinity that binds together physical discipline with financial success. Crucially though, this is presented as much more than a selfish pursuit, this cohort’s approach joins a long American tradition of presenting bodywork as a moral imperative (White et al., 1995). Moreover, as this research will argue, they construct this path of self-optimization as a sacred pursuit. Such an approach attempts to justify hierarchical relations at a time when masculinity and capitalism are facing critique. Through identifying how “emotions circulate between bodies and signs,” and paying particular attention to the emotions of shame and disgust, this research examines how this affective economy mobilizes emotions to sacralize their ascendance in a dissymmetric economic system (Ahmed, 2004, p. 119).",

    "title": "CONSTRUCTING THE DIGITAL: WORKING FROM THE GLOBAL SOUTH",
    "abstract": "The AoIR Flashpoint Symposium conducted in Hyderabad, India, explored multiple facets of digital labour–that which takes place through and on platforms, monitored or managed via digital interfaces, as well as forms of work that contribute to building, maintaining, and populating digital infrastructures. The discussions at the symposium proceeded from the recognition of the need for regulation with the consumer of technology as our main object of concern, while also attending to the humans at the center of the machinery of production–those who build the insides of the machines (coders, designers, annotators) as well as those who make the content that flows through it. This panel extends the discussions at the Symposium with five papers that attend to different types of digital/digitally-enabled work: content creation and curation, app-based services, infrastructuring through tech work, and advocacy for a just and open digital commons. Together, the papers intend to make visible how the everyday labour of those in the Global South undergirds the global network of digital goods, services, and infrastructures–both materially and discursively. We think of the digital economy and culture in planetary terms (Graham &amp; Ferrari, 2022), driven by technologies largely imagined in the West even as they are enabled in very specific ways by workers in the Global South. Much recent work in rapidly digitizing geographies in South Asia and Latin America has pointed to the embedded nature of the digital, as technology and as experience. Cultural creators on platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and Spotify speak to increasingly dispersed audiences, their content subject to a variety of regulatory regimes monitored and managed in algorithmically impenetrable ways . Gig workers find their work patterns are constrained and defined by interfaces driven by neo-colonial imaginaries that defy regulation yet prompt innovative forms of resistance. Public discourse veers between the celebratory and the cautionary, as in much of the globe, with states responding, in turn, with shut downs and penalties and sops and incentives. The papers in this panel while locating their arguments and their insights in the specific context of India, also speak to the need for imaginaries that are at once broad and contextual, that take from aspirational articulations while rejecting a universalising logic, whether in the realm of design, or use, or regulation.",

    "abstract": "In today's social media-dominated landscape, identifying the manifestation of white nationalism on platforms such as TikTok is essential to understanding the spread of extremist content. This research examines the interplay between content and form in TikTok videos, revealing how creators exploit platform-specific features to propagate white nationalist narratives. Rooted in the Identity Approach, which encompasses Social Identity Theory and Self-Categorization Theory, the study elucidates how individuals, particularly on social media, define themselves within interchangeable group memberships, giving rise to in-group/out-group distinctions. Applying this framework to digital platforms highlights the role of content in signaling group membership and shaping collective identity.\n\nBy analyzing white nationalist content on TikTok through qualitative content analysis (n = 75), the study identifies seven types, including nationalist militarism, traditionalism, AfD edit, stylized political speech/news video, infographic/documentation, demo footage and patriotic self-presentation. Each type uses different strategies, from glorifying militarism to repackaging political figures for TikTok. The typology sheds light on extremists' strategies for narrative dissemination on TikTok, and offers insights for platform moderation and interventions to mitigate the spread of extremist content. In addition, the study examines the emotional appeal and recruitment strategies embedded in extremist narratives and explores the influence of eudaimonic entertainment. Methodological challenges, ethical considerations, and barriers to research, are discussed, providing valuable insights for future research on online extremism.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the changing documentality of AI-generated images and their role in the industrial production of war imaginaries. In doing so, we center our analysis on the paradigmatic case of Adobe Stock selling photorealistic AI images depicting the Israel-Gaza conflict. After the outbreak of the war in Gaza on October 7, 2023, the stock photo service Adobe Stock started to collect of AI-generated images produced by users depicting the conflict. Paying customers were then able to download and publish these images in both online and printed media. A public debate ensued when news media began using pictures from this collection, sparking discussion due to the lack of proper contextualization regarding their AI origin. The primary research question guiding this project is therefore: How does the popularisation and industrialisation of photorealistic AI-generated pictures alter the criteria by which we ascribe documentality to images employed in news reporting? To this end we conducted a mixed method research. In the first phase we collected and analyzed 55 articles related to the Adobe Stock case. The initial content analysis focused on framing of the news, in order to point out key themes and discourses surrounding the controversy. The second phase involves photo-elicitation interviews with photojournalists and photo editors, exploring the documentary and informational value of AI-generated images. Preliminary findings highlight the significance of metadata, the role of illustrative captions, and the aesthetics shaping representations of war and violence.",

    "abstract": "The social media industry has begun more prominently positioning itself as a vehicle for tapping into local community. Facebook offers hundreds of region-specific community groups, proudly touting these in nation-wide commercials. Reddit has hundreds of subreddits focused on specific states, cities, and towns. And Nextdoor encourages users to sign up and “Get the most out of your neighborhood.” In these locally oriented digital spaces, users interact, discuss community issues, and share information about what is happening around them. Volunteer moderators with localized knowledge are important agents in the creation, maintenance, and upkeep of these digital spaces. And, as we show, Facebook, Reddit, and Nextdoor create strategic communication to guide this localized volunteer moderator labor to realize specific goals within these spaces. In this work, we ask: “What are the promises the social media industry make about local community groups, and how do they position volunteer moderators to help realize those promises?” Through a qualitative content analysis of 849 documents produced by Facebook, Reddit, and NextDoor, we trace how platforms position their version of local community as slightly different utopian spaces, and channel volunteer moderator labor both through direct instruction and appeals to civic virtue.",

    "abstract": "Danmei 耽美 culture, which features male-male romance and/or erotica, emerged in mainland China in the late 1990s and has been flourishing since the 2010s across East and Southeast Asia. The dynamic Chinese danmei culture has received significant attention in academia in recent years, either by mapping out the resistant potential against the heteronormativity or by highlighting the escapist route for expressing the women participants’ desires. The danmei culture has evolved into a transmedia landscape, and at the same time, an ever-expanding cultural industry being exploited by the logic of capital. Danmei writers as affective labors living in such a cultural industry have been rarely considered in present danmei studies.\n\nThrough exploring the datafication of qing (情, affects and desires) via in-depth interviews with contracted danmei writers on Jinjiang, I examine the distinct feature of danmei writers as ambivalent affective labor. For danmei writers, the datafication and monetization of qing leads to increasingly formulaic writing. By selecting, appropriating and combing the elements in the database of qing, danmei writers are able to swiftly generate a male homoerotic love story that efficiently and effectively invoke the affects and desires of readers for better monetization. Pleasures and pains are both involved in doing the ambivalent affective labor, which further consolidates the precariousness of the affective labour. However, the affects and desires per se cannot be fully manipulated – transformative momentum is embedded in the water-like qing all the time.",

    "title": "DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER DNA PLATFORMS &amp; DIGITAL DISPLAYS OF FAMILY",
    "abstract": "The family genealogy industry has seen exponential growth in recent years, in large part due to the rise of direct-to-consumer DNA testing platforms. To some extent, ancestry-oriented DNA platforms function like other social media networks, connecting users in intimate publics. Yet they differ in that rather than ordering users by social relationships such as friendship, individuals are displayed according to how many centimorgans they share. In recent years, digital researchers have extended the sociological concept of ‘family display’ to consider digital displays of family. Yet limited work has considered how DNA platforms may constitute digital displays of family or how DNA data shape the bio-digital identities for affected communities who have limited avenues to familial information. In this presentation, I draw on data from the first empirical study to capture the Australian direct-to-consumer DNA users’ experiences, combining accounts from genealogy enthusiasts with accounts from those affected by adoption and donor conception. Reflexive thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews (n=23) derived two key themes: (1) DNA displays of family - how users are connected and ordered on the DNA platform, and (2) Defining the bio-digital self - how identity is shaped by DNA data. This work firstly contributes to understanding digital displays of family, specifically how DNA platforms shape understandings and practices of family. Secondly, this work provides insights into how DNA data (like other biometric data) shape individual identities in complex ways.",

    "title": "CONTROVERSIES, PROBLEMATIC INFORMATION, AND POLARISATION: CASE STUDIES ACROSS SIX COUNTRIES",
    "abstract": "Political trends around the world have drawn further scholarly attention to the study of polarisation, especially also as it is expressed and potentially deepened by public communication on digital and social media platforms. The very concept of polarisation itself, however, remains ill-defined especially in communication research, where it is often used as a mere buzzword without sufficient definition – even in spite of a wide range of conceptual approaches that variously emphasise issue-centric, ideological, affective, interpretive, interactional, or other facets of polarisation (Marino &amp; Ianelli, 2023; Esau et al., 2023).\n\nIssue-centric approaches to the study of polarisation often connect it with specific controversies, and therefore align well with controversy mapping and related methodological frameworks. Especially where they study such controversies in digital and social media contexts, they also point to the significant intersections between the circulation of problematic information by and the deepening of polarisation between partisan actors, as well as to the often asymmetrical nature of such contestations (where groups on one side of a given controversy are substantially more likely to use problematic information to support their cause than the groups opposing them; Kreiss &amp; McGregor, 2023).\n\nUnfortunately, much of the recent research in this field has continued to focus on a small number of key political contexts, with emphasis especially on the US and UK. This panel reviews evidence on the intersection of controversies, problematic information, and polarisation through a series of case studies from six continents: North and South America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and Oceania. In combination, these studies present a substantially more comprehensive picture of global similarities and local differences.\n\nPaper 1 explores the polarising impact of disinformation campaigns in favour of incumbent president Jair Bolsonaro in the 2022 Brasilian presidential election. It reveals a potentially unusual bottom-up disinformation pattern that produces a reverse influence flow from grassroots activists to political leaders and complicates standard distinctions between mis- and disinformation; this also creates new challenges for fact-checking efforts.\n\nPaper 2 examines the dynamics of Italian public opinion in response to the introduction of COVID-19 restrictions in early 2020. Drawing on longitudinal survey data, it identifies a range of perspectives from extreme communitarian to extreme libertarian, and connects this to patterns of legacy and social media use, attitudes towards political institutions, and levels of exposure to mis- and disinformation.\n\nPaper 3 compares the divergent dynamics of political debates on Indigenous rights in Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand. In the campaigning leading up to Australia’s 2023 referendum on greater Indigenous recognition and representation, it identifies a highly asymmetrical contest that flipped public opinion from strong support for Indigenous recognition to a 60% No vote within less than one year. In the heated political debate about Māori rights in Aotearoa New Zealand since the 2023 election of a new, conservative coalition government, it identifies continuing Māori/non-Māori solidarity in resistance to the reduction of rights stemming from the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi.\n\nPaper 4 investigates the debates on Twitter about measures to combat sexual violence in Indonesia that came into effect in 2021 and 2022. Drawing on extensive content and network analysis, the study shows that, diverging from the #metoo-style activism against sexual discrimination, harassment, and violence that is common in Western contexts, in Indonesia this agenda is interpreted predominantly through the lens of an underlying polarisation between secular nationalist and Islamist political groupings in the world’s largest Muslim-majority democracy.\n\nPaper 5 compares the online dynamics of the abortion debate in the US before and after the Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, focussing especially on political candidates’ social media messaging on abortion rights. Analysis of Democrats’ and Republicans’ posts about the issue, and of broader Twitter and Facebook user engagement with the issue, is expected to point to substantial differences between the parties, timeframes, and platforms.\n\nIn combination, these five papers cover a rich selection of case studies on the intersections between controversies, problematic information, and polarisation around the world. Extended abstracts for all five papers are included in the submission.",

    "title": "NAVIGATING THE DIGITAL IDENTITY INDUSTRY",
    "abstract": "Examining and explaining tensions between being public and private on the internet is an enduring aspect of the work of the Association of Internet Researchers. In this paper, I present a concept to aid those working in this space: digital identity integrity, the ability to use a range of personal accounts and platforms to meaningfully participate in digital cultures and economies. When an individual can maintain a reasonable amount of privacy over their identity, knows how to effectively use platforms and services, and is in a position to contribute to broader digital and data justice projects, they can be said to have digital identity integrity.\n\nThis paper is drawn from a larger research project into digital identity integrity, and presents the results of its first two stages: establishing the discourse of the identity verification industry, and conducting pilot workshops on evaluating digital identity integrity. The project builds a case for including resistive practices to identity unification – like being anonymous or creating multiple accounts on one platform – to get a fuller picture of digital identity and inclusion.\n\nThe goal of this research project is to work with the idea of digital identity integrity as a way to evaluate the push and pull between public and private when it comes to identities on the internet.",

    "abstract": "Whenever a celebrity posts a photo on Instagram, it is almost inevitable that the first comment on it will be made by a porn bot (Alvarez 2020). Observations of this kind – some focusing on the distorted perception of ‘sexiness’ and social media authenticity (Thing 2020; Salim 2023), others contesting Instagram’s community guidelines prohibiting both nudity and automation (Santos 2023) – have been ubiquitous in online tech reports for years. In academic discussions, scholars usually define porn bots as automated or semi-automated software agents that operate via sexual solicitation to capture attention (Narrang 2019). Twitter porn bots using Not Safe for Work (NSFW) hashtags to advertise commercial links have been addressed in their generic patterns (Paasonen, Jarrett, and Light 2019). Tumblr porn bots have generated significant controversy due to their uninterrupted operation during the platform’s so-called ‘porn ban’ (Pilipets and Paasonen 2020). Within Instagram, as we will show, porn bots continuously intervene in a network of relationships that users forge with the platform, avoiding detection through a range of circumvention tactics. In all these instances, porn bots operate as medium-specific, heterosexually scripted ‘personas’ (Bucher 2014), demonstrating remarkable adaptability to the platforms’ current cultures of use.",

    "abstract": "This work explores the intersection of toxicity and symbolic violence as fundamental concepts for understanding two critical dimensions of online violence: its propagation and legitimation. Drawing from Critical Discourse Analysis, we emphasize language's role in negotiating power relationships, demonstrating its significance in shaping social practices and power dynamics. Building on our previous work on gender toxicity, we investigate how toxicity becomes a form of legitimizing violent discourses.Further, we present a framework categorizing violence legitimation into \"discursive structure\" and \"spreadable structure.\" Discursive structures encompass implicit and explicit violence, including humor, stereotyping, and name-calling, revealing strategies employed in violent discourse. Spreadable structures, including polarization and toxicity, explore how discourse spreads on platforms, affecting visibility and influencing dominant perspectives. The understanding of these categories requires consideration of social and infrastructural power dynamics within the online context.",

    "abstract": "The use of education technologies (EdTech) in schools has rapidly expanded during COVID-19 due to remote learning requirements. Despite the diversity of EdTech products used in schools, only a handful, including Google Classroom, dominate children’s classrooms in the UK. The way these products operate and process data as part of teaching and learning may expose children to data protection risks with immeasurable consequences for children and their life prospects. This paper demonstrates how these data protection risks can manifest when children use Google Classroom for learning in principle and practice. We conducted a legal analysis of privacy policies and legal terms that applied to Google Classroom and other Google services accessible to children within the Google Classroom environment to demonstrate data protection risks in principle and a socio-technical investigation, using a web browser plug-in, called Lightbeam (for Firefox browser) and Thunderbeam (for Chrome browser), to capture the data flow throughout each child’s user journey, in practice. Through legal analysis of Google’s privacy policies, we identified various data protection risks, including the lack of transparency and purpose specification in data processing. We demonstrated how these risks, in principle, became more tangible in practice with scenarios in which each child’s user journey in and through Google Classroom can be exposed to third-party commercial tracking services. Drawing on an example of effective regulatory enforcement, we demonstrated how the risks to commercial exploitation of children’s personal data in education can be tamed.",

    "abstract": "As the EU Digital Services Act increasingly involves civil society organisations (CSOs) in the context of the development and application of its Code of Conduct, CSOs’ role in moderation policies requires further scrutiny. Theoretically, this paper seeks to contribute to platform governance as a complex multi-stakeholder dynamic process with unresolved tensions between different policy actors and their interests. At the European level, we can schematically understand this process to involve a triangle with three sets of actors: EU policy makers, platforms, and CSOs. We see platform governance as a terrain of struggle where no actor can unilaterally impose their will, but where power is exercised asymmetrically. Since CSOs are called upon to represent the interests of their constituencies and especially those communities that are vulnerabilised through harmful contents and current platform content policies, it is important to examine their role in the emerging EU content regulatory field more closely. In particular, this paper poses the following research questions: How do CSOs determine their policies vis-a-vis platforms? How independent are they from platforms and to what extent do they align their views with those of platforms? Empirically, the paper draws on participant ethnographic research in a leading CSO alongside in depth interviews with key informants and document analysis. The findings indicate that notwithstanding the aspirational role of CSOs in upholding fundamental rights and the rights of their constituencies, there are few safeguards against platform influence. This may end up compromising the crucial role that CSOs play in platform governance.",

    "abstract": "Post-secular pilgrimage is increasingly popular, affording communitas (Maddrell &amp; della Dora, 2013) as well as collective effervescence (Serazio, 2013) to pilgrims. Pilgrimage can be augmented by digital media (Maddrell &amp; della Dora, 2013), but pilgrims usually limit their access to habitual devices, people, and digital services during their pilgrimage (Jorge, 2023). This paper focuses on the case of the World Youth Day 2023, hosted in Lisbon, and seeks to explore the role of digital and social media in sustaining pilgrim communities as atmospheres developed through time flows (Hitchen, 2021). To such end, we use the notion of affective temporalities (Nikunen, 2023). We performed a content, multimodal analysis (Bouvier &amp; Rasmussen, 2022) on the material gathered through searching Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, Giphy, and maps and apps related to the event.\n\nWhile Facebook groups allowed for coordination and peer support and advice, TikTok and Instagram afforded gains of visibility through hashtags. Giphy appears as a repository of humorous content from both official and vernacular cultures. As for apps and maps, they seemed to be more focused in the present, as they were helpful tools to navigate and manage the logistics of the event, but did not take on a collaborative mode. Anticipation, coordination and rememorating were shared affective temporalities shared by pilgrims through social media, through which communitas, effervescence and longing were processed.",

    "abstract": "Due to hardened border practices in EU, migrants and asylum seekers seeking refuge in Europe have to rely on various smuggling services shared on social media platforms and entrepreneurs who advertise services online. Our paper explores the emergence of this dark industry of mobility that operates on social media platforms. Based on interviews with migrants and refugees in Finland, the paper maps digital sites of smuggling and explore the ways in which the migrants, in their highly precarious situation, engaged with smuggling and dealt with the challenges they faced. The aim is to gain a more nuanced understanding of the complications of digital markets around mobility for the people concerned, and most importantly offer insight into the ways in which platform economy shapes migrant mobility and safety of migrants. Moreover we discuss how both platformization and European migration policies are intrinsically connected with the emergence of these markets.",

    "title": "FOLLOWING LENIN AND STALIN THROUGH INSTAGRAM: VARIETIES OF DISSIMULATIVE PLAY IN LEFT-REVOLUTIONARY MEMES",
    "abstract": "Politigram (also Theorygram) is a loose subculture of pseudonymous meme accounts on Instagram, focused on debating political ideologies and theories using memes. Politigram’s memes often feature political positions that are either idiosyncratic (e.g. “Feminist-Monarcho-Primitivism”) or outside the so-called Overton window of publicly acceptable political ideologies (such as Leninism or Stalinism). While a growing amount of research addresses how online spaces such as 4chan produce and popularise memes featuring far-right ideology, memes that depict left-revolutionary themes are relatively understudied. Since some authors have begun to view anonymous or pseudonymous online spaces as inherently problematic, understanding the variety of practices and content in online spaces that focus on fringe politics is important. Our analysis follows memes that feature Lenin and Stalin through a large number of Instagram accounts posting memes. We concentrate on Lenin and Stalin because they represent fringe ideologies that remain indirectly relevant in contemporary political discourse. With a visual dataset from 45,000 accounts from 2021, we study the thematic variations, boundary work and political positioning performed by Lenin and Stalin memes. We describe how requirements of theoretical literacy, militancy as a communicative value and parody of conceptions of communism drive the discussion of fringe political positions on Politigram. We conclude by contrasting memetic logics in this context with established accounts of “dissimulative identity play” in anonymous online spaces.",

    "abstract": "This paper develops the concept of transient-platform paradigm by closely examining a blockchain technology experiment for a social media platform. To do so, this paper presents partial findings from the platform biography (doctoral thesis) (Burgess &amp; Baym, 2020) of one such BSM, DTube. DTube aspired to provide a fair and transparent alternative creator economy built without the foundations of an advertising revenue model (unlike YouTube). It relied on the critical affordance tokenization or cryptocurrency to overcome the economic challenges. The research was conducted in three phases and followed various ethnographic methods. This research is motivated to articulate the emergent \"structures of feeling\" or the \"social experience which is still in process\" (Williams, 1977, p. 132). It aims to comprehend the imaginaries of a future Internet / Web that experiments like DTube are trying to articulate.\n\nDTube represented an emergent system since it introduced \"new meanings and values, new practices, new relationships\" (p. 123) in a social media system. The discourse of rewarding social interactions was a definitive characteristic in this emergent culture's new meanings and practices. In the process, it shaped a new paradigm that this paper calls a 'transient-platform paradigm', where dispersed initiatives attempt to recreate social media platforms for users by the users.",

    "abstract": "At a time when the accessibility of digital media technology at any time enables individuals constantly and permanently exist in the digital connection, the public become more concerned with relationship between digital media, digital attention crisis and technology addiction. This research contributes to the analysis of an emerging branch of mobile app industry that claims to address this issue. Based on the walk-through method and semi-structured interviews with users of one of the most popular app in this industry, the Forest app, this study develops a more nuanced and multifaceted understanding of the \"technicity of attention\" (Bucher, 2012) that underpins the app and how it mediates users' conceptualization of their experiences and routines of this app. Despite the app’s broken promise of attention, the study observes that users' experience of failure and frustration helps to reveal the app's same logic of attention arrangement shared by attention economy, and creates the conditions for users to reflect on the connectivity paradox and the problematic oppositional relational structure between dependency and agency.",

    "abstract": "Female conservative political influencers are an obscure but growing force within American politics, steadily sewing distrust in public institutions. By exploiting the inadequacies and inequalities in a capitalistic society, these women profit off the fears they cultivate through conspiratorial narratives such as the government poisoning food and indoctrinating children to encourage their Instagram audiences to boycott “woke” corporations by purchasing their household supplies through Patriot Wellness Boxes and other conservative MLMs. Guided by Abidin’s (2021) framework of refracted publics and Cotter’s (2019) concept of “playing the visibility game,” this study seeks to understand the ways that vaguely coded conservative MLMs such as Patriot Wellness Box enable conservative female influencers to circumvent algorithms and sentiment seed more radical conspiracies within lifestyle content. The major findings reveal that these women utilize self-amplification groups to simultaneously to grow their audiences and obscure their connections to the far-right and one another. Second, the MLMs are discussed in ways that mirror sovereign citizen/white militia rhetoric that positions the government as an existential threat they must be prepared to fight. While they are not organizing militias, they are promoting anti-democratic messages, xenophobia, and authoritarian-esque sentiments under the guise of a conservative lifestyle achievable through MLM participation. As the 2024 presidential election looms large, we must analyze the ways that trust in government and public institutions is being undermined through neoliberal conservative MLMs one subscription box ad at a time",

    "title": "PERFORMING PREVIVORSHIP ONLINE: EXAMINING IDENTITY MANAGEMENT ON TIKTOK",
    "abstract": "Research exploring identity performance on Tiktok has highlighted a departure from older self-making frameworks - such as the networked self- and a move towards a more ‘algorithmized’ version of self-making online. This departure takes us from a framework that emphasises performance in the Goffmanian sense to a model that emphasises the role of the algorithm in shaping our identity practices. Social media platforms, though, have been established as important spaces for the performance health and illness identities. With this in mind, this paper asks whether and how illness performances occur on Tiktok and further explores the extent to which we are departing from more traditional self-making practices.\n\nTo do this, we draw on findings from an ongoing Leverhulme Trust-funded project focused on social media uses relevant to hereditary cancer syndromes. These syndromes mark health conditions linked to known genetic mutations, also called “cancer genes”, that heighten the risk of having cancer from an early age. Carriers of these genetic mutations are often referred to as ‘previvors’: healthy individuals who are coping with the awareness of having a genetic predisposition to cancer. We used computational techniques to access posts about two hereditary cancer syndromes: BRCA 1/2 and Lynch Syndrome published on TikTok followed by a qualitative content analysis. From this, our initial findings show how strong elements of older identity frameworks remain present in content produced by previvors on TikTok with previvors identity performances remaining very much networked, interactive and connected to specific communities.",

    "abstract": "Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to examine the move from global to local, in relation to FLOSS software projects and their implementation in local communities. The need stems from a gradual ecological collapse which brings about unforeseeable consequences to human civilization and infrastructures. By investigating the process of global development to local infrastructure, more resilient and localized communication solutions can be implemented.\n\nFindings\n\nThis paper aims to find the challenges in moving from global software development to a local implementation of open source infrastructure by mapping out the issues offline-first protocols face in reaching a stage of local implementation of their development and the issues communities face in implementing their own communication infrastructures. These findings can support the steps of moving from global software development projects to locally implemented infrastructures.\n\nMethod\n\nThe method is based on semi-structured interviews with four communities and four protocols with a minimum of 2 interviews with each project and community. At the end of the project an online workshop is hosted enabling collective reflection for the communities and projects, and potential knowledge sharing.\n\nOriginality\n\nThe research of moving from global to local is extensively explored through the scaling and commercialization of software. By flipping the approach around and looking at global software developments implementation in local communities this paper delves into a relatively unexplored, and necessary, area of research. The research also supports the active implementation of FLOSS projects for real communities striving towards data-sovereignty and local infrastructures.",

    "title": "WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND IT: BRAZILIAN USERS’ ALGORITHMIC IMAGINARIES OF SPOTIFY WRAPPED",
    "abstract": "‘Spotify Wrapped’ is a promotional initiative offered by the music platform consisting of a summary of each user’s yearly listening habits. Although Spotify is generally classified as a streaming service, initiatives such as Wrapped have a clear component of sociability (Hagen &amp; Lüders 2017) – in this case, not only because they are based on the harvesting of users’ behavioural data but also because they are created to be shared on platforms such as Instagram and Twitter/X. Indeed, Spotify Wrapped has acquired its own role in digital popular culture, inciting anticipation and excitement from users worldwide and becoming an 'algorithmic event' (Annabell &amp; Vindum Rasmussen 2023) in and of itself. In this paper, we propose to scrutinise how this algorithmic event is perceived and understood by Brazilian users, whilst also identifying and unpacking the platform affordances and algorithmic imaginaries (Bucher, 2017) that inform those interpretations and their associated performances of taste and identity (Airoldi, 2019, Prey, 2018). We explore in particular how users negotiate the tensions between algorithmic personalisation and individuation and the possibilities for shared experience to emerge during this event. Through a mixed-method approach, we argue that the 'eventness' (Frosh and Pinchevski, 2018) of Spotify Wrapped is distributed, clustered but sparsely connected, and marked by fleeting, fluid and ephemeral feelings of shared experience and recognition rather than by enduring communities, which in turn reflects and extends previous theorisations of affective publics (Papacharissi, 2014) and social media liveness (Lupinacci, 2021)",

    "abstract": "The governance of platform algorithms presents a critical challenge as these technologies increasingly pose threats to privacy, agency, fairness, and equity, often reenacting and mediating existing power systems. Traditional governance models, primarily top-down approaches led by policymakers and private corporations, are essential yet insufficient. This paper argues for the incorporation of \"bottom-up governance,\" focusing on the \"epistemic-democratic tension\" (Krick, 2022) between inclusive participation and expertise-based decision-making. I argue that to ensure that algorithms function fairly and justly for all, bottom-up governance requires involving and taking seriously “lay” experts. Bottom-up governance extends beyond merely soliciting input from citizens on algorithms; it necessitates recognizing the authority of non-technical knowers and privileging subjugated standpoints.",

    "abstract": "First emerging around 2015, tradwives represent a nostalgic yearning for a mythic past and white supremacist utopia. Yet, in recent years, tradwife creators have received increased mainstream attention and notoriety for their display of “traditional” gender roles, 1950s aesthetics, and open anti-feminism. This online prominence has led some of them, paradoxically, to emerge as the breadwinner in their family–a development that seems at odds with their professed belief that women should eschew careers in favor of childrearing and homemaking. In this in-progress, mixed-methods project, we aim to understand the tensions between the traditional gender roles tradwives advocate for and the entrepreneurial nature of their online promotion and monetization of said lifestyle. We conducted a computational text analysis of 25 English-language creators’ websites, as well as a qualitative analysis of the creators’ Instagram Story highlights. Our emerging findings show that tradwives’ solution to the tension between their professed ideology and their entrepreneurial activities lies in the obfuscation thereof: Neither housework nor creator labor are discussed as work. Explicit political discussions remain similarly unspoken, except for occasional expressions of opposition to feminism and reproductive rights. Religion, however, features prominently. The obfuscation of labor and absence of explicit politics represents a strategic move towards palatability that allows the current iteration of the tradwife to find greater mainstream appeal than earlier tradwives. Our results suggest that the tradwife is a particular influencer style or vernacular around a coherent ideological theme, thus emerging as a metapolitical branding strategy.",

    "abstract": "When surveyed and interviewed about digital peer support for mental health, LGBTQ+ young people in Australia, aged 16-25 years, most commonly named Instagram as the most supportive social media platform. Most of the 36 interview participants described how Instagram affords mental health support in varied ways, from regular engagement with supportive friends, to following and engaging with accounts that promote LGBTQ+ mental health. The feature of Close Friend Stories was particularly highlighted as affording easy access to friendship support when needed, and allowed a signaling of support without having to ask for it. Many discussed how Close Friend Stories afforded ‘mental health posting’ – for themselves and/or friends – that allayed concerns about burdening friends with mental health struggles, and offered assurance that only friends with the capacity to offer support could do so. This paper argues that the Close Friends feature operates through friendship’s ‘ambient co-presence’ on Instagram, among young LGBTQ+ users, offering space for vulnerable posting. This paper engages with theories of digital co-presence and intimacy, to consider the intimate logic of vulnerable posting and subsequent support among LGBTQ+ young people who use Instagram.",

    "title": "BETWEEN THE (LIVE) STREAM: CONFIGURATIONS OF/FOR EMBODIMENT, TECHNICITY AND VICARIOUS SPACES",
    "abstract": "Drawing on iterative, empirical work that investigates the conditions of an everyday hypermediated environment, this paper focuses on experiences of livestreaming from the Disney Parks in order to think about the embodied and the technological in relation to the limits of mobility within this configuration of space(s). Central to the issues I am taking up here is an idea of space which is doubly lived: first, as a physical, tangible space (in thinking about live streamers in the Disney Parks), and second, as a virtual space (such as Internet streaming sites such as YouTube, for example). As such, I am arguing that we can think about these spaces as a vicarious space in which vicarity is underpinned by a sense of mobility and an investment in the embodied. Vicarious space is implicitly configured through the technological in relation to video-sharing platforms and within social, cultural, political, and economic structures and systems which are – ultimately – everyday and mundane. These ideas come to be framed by an overwhelming sense of industry that is threaded through enmeshed within neo-liberal political structures. Yet industry is not often seen here, and instead, these practices and experiences relating to live streaming are understood as centrally relating to pleasure and affect. What I am asking here then is how is vicarity imagined in terms of embodied subjectivity and agency? And how should we understand this in terms of the Internet and opportunities for connectivity?",

    "title": "SCREENSHOT METHODOLOGIES TO COLLECT AND ANALYSE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM ADVERTISING",
    "abstract": "This paper presents three projects where we have developed participatory digital research methods designed to extend observability of digital advertising on social media platforms and engage with users’ individual experiences with digital advertising. In each approach, participants collected instances of digital advertising from social media apps by taking screenshots or using a screen-capture mobile app. Participants also assumed active roles in the interpretation and analysis of the collected ads through dialogue with research teams in the form of SMS chats, surveys and interviews. We then critically reflect on the politics and ethics of participatory screen capture as a method that emerges as a response to ‘platform opaqueness’. Because of the lack of platform transparency, one of the only reliable ways for researchers to study advertising in these spaces is to work directly with users to capture what they see. In our projects, the practice of screenshotting facilitated scaffolded consent as participants chose the images to send and discuss with researchers. These approaches also position participants as experts on their own experience with and theories of algorithmic, digital platform advertising. We conclude by considering the significance of collected data: collections of ads that illustrate the relationships between users and digital advertising models. The ads targeted to individual users reflect platform ad models’ attempts to respond and pre-empt user engagement, and in the process, construct digital subjectivities. By co-analysing digital advertising with users, we observe the ways social media platform users and algorithmic advertising models continuously enact and react to each other.",

    "abstract": "Our research delves into the impact of disinformation in emergencies (DiE), specifically within the context of nuclear emergency responses, and the dynamics of the political economy behind it. Key questions guiding our investigation include suitable assessment techniques for DiE detection and evaluation and effective governance responses.\n\nOur research employs established communications theories of propaganda, emphasizing propaganda analysis as a tool for understanding DiE and developing institutional responses. We examine two nuclear emergency cases—the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FNPP) disaster and the occupation of the Zaporozhzhian Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) in Ukraine—to uncover the disruptive impact of disinformation on emergency communication.\n\nThrough the categorization of propaganda into black, gray, and white types, we analyze tactics employed in DiE, shedding light on strategic intent, transparency, and veracity. Case studies reveal instances of false narratives propagated by governments and media channels, influencing public perception and exacerbating tensions. While our study has not observed significant AI-enabled DiE, we highlight its use in DiE identification. However, state-led counter-disinformation initiatives face challenges, including jurisdictional issues and calls to protect free expression.\n\nWe posit the necessity of non-state-led networked governance structures, drawing parallels with successful cybersecurity governance models. These frameworks, informed by interdisciplinary insights and operating independently from states, are primed to address the multifaceted challenges posed by DiE. Addressing participatory, structural, and operational impediments within existing content moderation governance mechanisms emerges as a pivotal imperative for the realization of effective strategies.",

    "abstract": "This paper uses family privacy theory and the dataveillance literature as lenses through which to explore state use of health technologies in the care of unwell children, and the contribution of such technologies to children’s datafication.\n\nFamily privacy is an important ideology which informs legal and political understandings of the family, and influences laws governing the family’s relationship with state and society. Respect for family privacy is commonly understood to entail state non-intervention in ordinary family life. Increasingly, however, scholars recognise that family privacy may be more widely understand to entail family autonomy or decision-making and can be understood to afford parental control over how family information, particularly children’s information, is used.\n\nThis paper draws upon responses to freedom of information requests received from Integrated Care Boards and Trusts across England as well as information on the NHS Transformation Directorate’s website. This research confirms that a range of telehealth technologies are now being used to support children's health care including virtual wards, apps, wearables and other medical devices which monitor patients’ vital signs. Patients and their parents are, however, rarely told by the NHS how these technologies use patient data. This paper uses the UK General Data Protection Regulation as a framework for exploring what transparent, lawful and fair use of children’s data entails in the context of digitised healthcare. It argues that the NHS could do more to support parents and children to understand these technologies and the implications for children’s privacy.",

    "abstract": "This study embarks on a comprehensive exploration of sociolinguistic dynamics within the polarized climate change discourse on Facebook, focusing on the communicational patterns across pro-climate action and anti-climate action groups. Our research objectives mainly focus on (1) understanding the variation in language codes between pro-climate action and anti-climate action groups and (2) inspecting how these linguistic nuances are perceived by the respective audiences. For this goal, we curated a comprehensive list of relevant English-speaking actors, and we collected their most recent Facebook posts relevant to the climate change discourse. After that, the data were analyzed through multiple quantitative language register markers and some engagement-related metrics.\n\nThrough the analysis of the data, we identified some distinct language patterns among different sides of the debate, such as the tendency of the pro-climate action groups to resort to more scientific terms in their communication. Furthermore, audience responses to variation in the language register showed significant divergences among the two groups, with the pro-climate audience showing heightened sensitivity to shifts in language register.\n\nOur findings highlight the importance of tailoring communication strategies to promote productive discussions within the polarized climate change debate.",

    "title": "ALTERNATIVE FUTURES! FOSTERING ECO-DIGITAL AGENCY IN GENERATIVE AI WORKSHOPS WITH YOUNG PEOPLE",
    "abstract": "The ability to imagine alternatives is important in fostering hope for more just futures. However, it is not easy. In fact, it has been argued that the decline of imagination has prevented us from finding effective solutions to urgent planetary crises and alternatives to capitalism. In this paper, I present how the challenge was methodologically tackled and ways to spark imagination searched for in an ongoing research project. The paper presents methodological reflections, observations, and critical considerations from a workshop experiment which an AI image generator was used as a tool for imagining. The starting point was that young people's perceptions, hopes, and fears about the future matter because the future concerns them particularly. Yet, their voices often remain unheard.\n\nThe pedagogical approach was a combination of feminist, critical, anarchist, speculative, and utopian pedagogies. The use of an AI image generator allowed the playful creation of images, simultaneously providing opportunities to critically examine AI’s ethics and sustainability. It fostered the participants’ $2 in creating a collective space in which hopes and fears were voiced and heard, and today’s society and needs for its transformation discussed. Yet, there are issues in using generative AI as a research tool. Proprietary applications prevent researchers from evaluating their ethical foundations and sustainability. With datasets consisting of images harvested from the past and present, the question is to what extent it is possible to imagine something completely new and previously unimaginable with them.",

    "title": "REPLATFORMIZATION: RACIAL CAPITALISM AND THE STACK-CONSCIOUSNESS OF KIWI FARMS",
    "abstract": "Over the past decade, service providers have taken on larger roles in the regulation of violent digital networks. As reactionary platforms like Gab and Parler emerge to cater to far-right users estranged from mainstream social networking sites, their stack suppliers – domain registrars, web hosts, app stores, etc. – may enforce their Terms of Service, revoking access to services, in what José Van Dijck et al. term “deplatformization.” Deplatformization has proven circumstantially effective as in the 2021 destruction of Parler by Amazon Web Services. However, reactionary platforms have responded by building their own service providers, marketing them as “cancel-proof,” and seeding a cottage industry of far-right infrastructure firms immune to deplatformization. In this trend, which I term “replatformization,” far-right networks scale their capacity to fracture and terrorize online publics. This paper investigates replatformization through a diachronic analysis of the stack of Kiwi Farms, a text forum known for its deadly transmisogynistic harassment campaigns, its history as “victim” of service denial by multiple firms including Cloudflare, and its in-house solutions such as DDoS mitigator “KiwiFlare” and web host “Final Solutions LLC.” Anchored by materialist critical theory, I argue that the replatformization of far-right platforms reifies the role of reactionary digital networks within the social reproduction of racial capitalism. I trace an emerging reactionary Stack-consciousness as KF users become a vanguard in digital service provision. Efforts to regulate online hate culture must attend to the fact that the private ownership of the means of mediation empowers reactionary webmasters with inordinate leverage.",

    "abstract": "The panel takes up AoIR’s theme of how industry pre-mediates the future of internet technology and its effects and inquiries into alternatives. Utilising ideas from the study of sociotechnical imaginaries, it aims to locate, map, and critically examine AI imaginaries together with counter-imaginaries that engage with and intervene in those of the AI industry. First, it maps the discursive landscape of Big Tech ‘AI talk’ as a means to study ‘new media concentration’. Which Big Tech AI imaginaries are stabilising? More normatively, do they seek to cement their interdependence both generally but also with respect to the future of internet technology? More specifically, how does the AI industry imagine regulation, sustainability, and the hoped (and feared) AI futures? Recent imaginaries research has emphasised multi-actor, non-linear approaches revolving around the notion of 'public imaginaries'. Along those lines, in the panel we bring together studies of AI imaginaries performed within but also beyond the AI industry. The panel considers the AI industry’s relationships with various actors, such as governments, media outlets, and academia, and the complex interplay that produces imaginaries as well as the issues that come with them. In addressing these questions and interests, the panel also presents various methodological entry points to the study of imaginaries of the AI industry and the larger ecosystem from direct interviews and distant and close readings of (cross-cultural) media coverage to an analysis of online environments such as websites and social media platforms.",

    "title": "CRITICAL PERSPECTIVES ON COMMUNICATIVE AI",
    "abstract": "Current media coverage surrounding ChatGPT, LaMDA, and Luminous has brought questions about the automation of communication into the mainstream. Artificially intelligent media are no longer merely mediating instances of communication but are themselves becoming communicative participants. This has generated broad public discussion about these systems and others and the challenges they bring to domains such as education, public discourse, and journalistic production. Much of this new “AI hype” revolves around the question of whether such systems will soon “replace” humans as workers in these various domains, whether they will develop “super intelligence” and as a result challenge or even marginalize the human species.\n\nWith this panel, we would like to give this discussion a new twist by asking what a critical perspective on communicative AI should look like. If these systems of “automated media” are not about intelligence, but about communication, what should a critical approach to them consider? Raising this question, we want to present five key critical perspectives on communicative AI.\n\nThe first paper develops a critical perspective on the visions of pioneer communities. It poses the question of whether today's pioneering communities ultimately reproduce basic patterns of the old Californian Ideology in relation to communicative AI. A second paper focuses on the perspective of data colonialism. In essence, it is about showing that a critical engagement with communicative AI means addressing the question of the extent to which systems of automated communication are linked to existing data infrastructures and nexus models of exploitation. The third paper highlights the perspective of economic value production. Since more and more social situations include human-machine communication, more social interactions become possible to monetize. This relates not only to commercial settings, but also in the public sector as it relates to the welfare state. The fourth paper focuses on a material perspective. At its core is the question of how Big Tech procures power for data centres to construct the emerging geography of cheap computational labour needed for communicative AI. The fifth paper deals with the perspective of an eco-political economy of communicative AI. Through this prism, the question of the ecological consequences of communicative AI can be addressed.\n\nBy contrasting these five critical perspectives on communicative AI, we want to discuss what an overarching, critical approach to communicative AI might look like.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates how sexuality experts communicate sexual advice on online platforms and how audiences interact with and perceive these experts. Through a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics inherent in this communication process, we seek to gain insights into the evolving landscape of sexual advice and health in the digital age. Furthermore, our objective is to address a notable gap in this body of literature by incorporating how audiences engage with this content. We conducted a thematic analysis of TikTok videos and comment sections, combined with in-depth interviews with sexuality experts, to explore how experts build credibility amongst their audience, and how audiences engage with their content and evaluate expertise and credibility. Preliminary results suggest that creators employ various strategies when their expertise is questioned, including responding to comments, crafting replies to videos, and utilizing humor to connect with users. Audience members also play a vital role in validating creators' expertise. We also found that sexual health advice was not solely coming from creators, but also from those engaging in comments, fostering a culture of advice related to the video’s theme, challenging the conventional top-down hierarchy in sexual education where expertise is unilaterally shared. Ultimately, our study aligns with this year’s conference theme – examining the emergence and continuation of industries like sexual health education – highlighting the dynamics that arise within online spaces.",

    "abstract": "Prepping for the apocalypse. Fighting for eternal life. Building separatist compounds for like-minded people. Reproducing to fill the world with chosen ones. Manifestos to recruit believers. All these practices are age-old characteristics of religious zealots and sound like the makings of a promising cult docuseries. And yet, they are also increasingly common obsessions of leaders of the American tech industry. From building luxury bunkers to hoping cryonic freezing could make resurrection possible, many billionaire and multi-millionaire founders, engineers, and VCs are investing time, money, and attention into speculative pursuits that are often considered the realm of religious paranoia. Through a conjunctural analysis (Hall, 1978), this research gathers evidence of four key religiously coded practices that are coursing through the Silicon Valley elite and examines the guiding ideologies behind them. By connecting the techno-solutionist practices of today’s tech elite to questions that have historically been explored via religious interventions, I hope to decenter appeals to rationality and expose the underlying values and emotions that drive these decisions. Additionally, this framework requires taking these practices seriously as symptomatic of an underlying belief system—rather than just the quirks of people with too much money on their hands. This research will unpack three core focuses: separatist communities, conquering death, and apocalypse prep.",

    "abstract": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project examines the life and death of Facebook’s “ethnic affinity” targeted advertising category. The category was the subject of several lawsuits that alleged it violated the Fair Housing Act, by allowing advertisers to exclude protected classes from the audience of an advertisement. It argues that the category serves to negotiate tensions between the supposedly “post-racial” aesthetic of web platforms, and the political economy of targeted advertising online. Using media genealogy as a method, it traces the introduction, transformation and eventual removal of “ethnic affinity” from Facebook’s interface. It reads across several archives that span a variety of stakeholders in the production and circulation of “ethnic affinity” in order to reconstruct how the category is understood, both as a technical object and as a discursive formation. It argues that technical discourse obscures the persistence of racial discrimination in algorithmic targeting by highlighting disparities between Facebook’s instructions to developers, its public-facing statements, and how advertisers understood its technical changes. “Ethnic affinity” is then best understood as a racial technology, one that constructs and enforces the boundaries of race. I argue that this has historical antecedents in the deployment of colorblindness as justification for racial disparity. This project contributes to studies on the relationship between technologies of racialization and platform capitalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "abstract": "The paper presents findings about the labor conditions on the work behind AI development, with two main goals. First, the aim is to investigate the current labor conditions in the AI industry and point out the lack of quality of outsourced jobs offered by digital labor platforms and Business Process Outsourcing companies, calling attention to the challenges faced by workers and the human costs of AI systems development. Second, it presents a global research project results on how not only to carry on international studies on the topic but also how to use an action-research approach to generate impact through public scoring companies and encourage the adoption of best practices by them.\n\nThe paper’s methods are based on the project’s action-research approach and methodological framework. The project scores companhies based on principles that address the major issues that define labour relations, namely, pay, conditions, contracts, management, and representation.\n\nThe paper presents the result of the assessment of cloudwork platforms conducted in 2023. In addition, it paper will examine labour relations in BPO companies in the AI supply chain using a case study of the company Sama, which is based in the United States and operates in many African countries.\n\nAmong the findings are problems such as non-payment situations, lack of policies to ensure minimum wage, significant rates of unpaid labour, poor measures to promote health and safety, problems in management practices and weak collective bargaining practices.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary artists using emerging technologies in their work are often positioned as innovators, mavericks, and diagnosticians, who work “outside” of the tech industry and thus bring sorely needed perspective to its developments. However, viewing new media artists as fully independent actors, devoid of any connection to industrial and corporate aims, serves to eclipse the long-standing and substantial ties that the field has to the protocols and priorities of the mainstream technology industry. These, in fact, have existed for as long as artists have attempted to integrate computation, electronics, networking, or other high-tech components into their work—both when these tools are owned and operated by corporations, but also in more diffuse, ideological ways.\n\nThis contribution, which draws from my larger dissertation work, traces the evolution of the cultural imaginary surrounding new media artists, defined in my research as practitioners who expand, reinvent, or misuse technological expression. By explicitly placing archives from three twentieth century “art and technology” initiatives against interviews with new media artists and cultural workers I conducted in the present day, I emphasize the foundational connections that new media artists have to industrial practices—and argue that this relationship can be traced back to the first attempts to place artists into collaborations with industry. As a result, industrial mandates have, to a large degree, shaped the popular conception of the new media art field, guiding both the practicalities of working with digital systems as well as notions of what artists “should” be doing with their work.",

    "abstract": "In an academic milieu in which a lot of critical attention is dedicated to the data-grabbing, algorithmically biased, and asymmetrical power of massive techno-corporations, this panel explores how a focus on situated ordinary practices can provide us with a more complex, nuanced, and even at times contradictory account of what happens when pervasive digital technologies are experienced in everyday life. It does so via a combination of empirical research and theoretical development in a number of platformised and datafied domains: social media, music and generative AI. Juxtaposition of these topics and approaches, and dialogue between the authors and audience, will, we hope, forefront struggles, disputes, and ambivalences concerning what people actually do with the digital systems that they engage with. As feminist scholars established many years ago, the everyday is trivial and yet profoundly politically charged; ordinary experience is always imbued with power dynamics, hierarchies, asymmetries, and emerging modes of governmentality. Using empirically-based case studies, the panel engages with a tricky question: how can we theorise power and agency while making sense of the textures and poetics of everyday life, if the everyday is precisely in the unremarkable, the unnoticed, in that which escapes our grasp?",

    "abstract": "Drug users use surface, deep, or dark web to enhance their activity. This paper examines the intersection of the digital space and illicit substances and analyzes a Polish drug forum as a refracted public (Abidin, 2021). To illuminate the accommodation of the medical cannabis industry in the social worlds of users, their digital presence below the radar is studied through qualitative thematic analysis of the content of the major Polish surface web drug forum. The study draws on more than 8000 forum posts. The results reveal that there has been a widespread subcultural accommodation of medical cannabis for non-medical use in the form of a backchannel about the quality of the product and ways of obtaining it. We also observed an emergence of self-care and reflexive cannabis narratives, where traditional cultural framing of the substance as source of fun and pleasure converged with medical purposes narrative. Also, complicated self-regulation of use was revealed based on experimenting with tolerance, acknowledging one’s harmful use, and counteracting potential harms. We also unveiled the peer harm reduction potential of this space. Taken together, the forum accumulates knowledge and know-how for the consumers that is otherwise lacking due to the illicit or stigmatized nature of the cannabis market in Poland. Looking at what the digitally enabled discussions reveal sheds light on the possible social accommodation of cannabis ahead of significant societal and legislative transformations.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the ways in which companies collaborate with green influencers on TikTok in order to combine sustainable communication with product sponsorship. TikTok, with its highly visual and meme-based communication style, offers companies a channel to align their marketing strategies with green messaging. Green influencers play a central role in this dynamic, blending activism and promotional content to raise awareness about sustainability while endorsing products. However, the actual willingness of these narratives to challenge the capitalist neoliberal logic has been questioned in the literature.\n\nA content and thematic analysis of 45 TikTok videos was conducted to see how companies express their environmental commitment through the affordances offered by the platform, including visual and viral aspects. Indeed, the aim of the paper is to explore the main actors, central themes and recurring narratives in these collaborations.\n\nThe findings reveal that companies from diverse sectors integrate product sponsorship into educational narratives that inform users about environmental issues while positioning the sponsored product as a solution. This approach aligns with the storytelling styles of green influencers, potentially enhancing the credibility of their content. However, there is a predominant focus on individual behavioural changes with limited emphasis on collective action or broader societal responses to sustainability challenges. This reflects a tension that simultaneously critiques unsustainable practices while remaining rooted in neoliberal consumer logics. As a result, these collaborations may promote sustainable consumption but fail to address the social dimensions of sustainability, restricting the potential for fostering a more comprehensive approach to environmental advocacy.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the tumultuous landscape of the modern automotive industry, once heralded as the epitome of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications through the promise of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). The introduction of large language models (LLMs), notably with ChatGPT's launch in November 2022, marked a turning point, casting shadows over the ambitious goals set by major tech and automotive players. Notable failures, including Ford's shutdown of Argo AI and Volkswagen's struggle with electric vehicle transitions, have led to a crisis in the viability of connected and autonomous driving.\n\nThe paper identifies four central types of limitations contributing to this crisis: technical, economic, financial, and regulatory. Technical limitations expose the inadequacies of autonomous vehicles in meeting their promised capabilities. Economic limitations highlight the unsustainable nature of platformizing automotive operations, linked to innovations like vehicle subscription models. Financial limitations point to the speculative investment decisions that underpin technological projects. Regulatory limitations showcase the industry's renegotiation of conditions in response to safety concerns.\n\nBy examining these limitations, the paper establishes a conceptual framework applicable not only to the automotive industry but also to current discussions surrounding LLMs. The lessons drawn from these challenges contribute to a broader understanding of the perils and limitations within AI sub-industries.",

    "abstract": "The 2022 Brazilian presidential elections and subsequent events highlight a significant period of political polarization and misinformation, particularly on social media platforms like Facebook. This study investigates the dynamics of misinformation campaigns on Facebook in the context of Brazil's political shifts, focusing on the period from the 2022 elections to the aftermath of the attempted coup on January 8, 2023. Utilizing a mixed methods approach and an innovative news alert system, we analyzed three months of links shared in a coordinated fashion leading up to the first anniversary of the attempted coup.\n\nOur findings reveal a bipartisan battlefield of political discourse, with a scenario characterized by divergence in accounts’ political alignment. We, in fact, identified two primary networks of political Facebook accounts: one supporting former President Jair Bolsonaro and another backing President Lula. Interestingly, we observed Lula supporters repeatedly share content criticizing or mocking Bolsonaro, his family members, and his supporters within pro-Bolsonaro groups. Moreover, these posts often receive a substantial number of comments and minor reactions and shares.\n\nFuture research will expand on these findings by examining a year's worth of Facebook posts from these networks to explore changes in topics and strategies over time.\n\nThe presentation will thus discuss the study's advancement outcomes in-depth, contributing to understanding how Brazilian political factions’ supporters utilize social media to influence public opinion and the implications for democracy in the digital age.",

    "title": "A STUDY OF INDUSTRY INFLUENCE IN THE FIELD OF AI RESEARCH",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we explore how AI researchers, situated within university-based research networks, mobilise and resist industry interests. The research question to which this paper is addressed is: how do university-based academics in the field of AI experience and mediate industry influence in their research? We answer this question through semi-structured interviews with research-focused academics (n = 90) affiliated with university-based AI research networks. We find that national research funders and university leadership incentivise and facilitate industry investments in AI research. We demonstrate how AI researchers mobilise this interest to pursue their own research goals, whilst also—at times—subordinating their research goals to the interests of industry. We highlight how AI researchers internalise the commercial logics of technology firms, which become mirrored in researchers' orientation towards generalisable and scalable research outputs that can move between many application domains and local contexts. We argue that university-based AI research networks primarily operate as mediators between industry, government, and university actors, and highlight the role national research investment strategies play in creating an enabling environment for industry influence of AI research.",

    "title": "RETHINKING AI FOR GOOD: CRITIQUE, REFRAMING AND ALTERNATIVES",
    "abstract": "AI for Social Good (AI4SG) initiatives have emerged in various sectors. However, AI's non-neutral nature challenges claims that the “good” can simply be inferred by association with broad goals such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The lack of a clear definition of \"the good” or what it entails in practice risks making AI4SG an empty signifier. This ambiguity allows unchecked interventions, undermining societal efforts to align future AI developments with public good. In this article, we adopt a socially situated public good framework from the social studies of quantum technologies proposed by Roberson et al (2021) and use insights from critical AI scholarship to tailor this framework to AI4SG initiatives. Analysing AI4SG initiatives, and building upon existing critical literature, we scrutinize these initiatives with regards to the framings of the research problems, the wider social and institutional context in which AI initiatives are imagined to be applied and used, as well as the wider network of scientists, stakeholders and publics involved in their co-production. We argue that much of the AI4SG literature abstracts AI from social and contextual realities, making it difficult to clarify the ways in which they might in fact have an impact in the world. Outlining our first iteration, we argue that co-creating this framework demands iterative refinement and ongoing dialogue with diverse stakeholders, especially in the Global South.",

We leverage the ongoing monitoring activities of both progressive actors and counter actor groups involved in the online public debate surrounding climate communication. Our focus is on whether visual content possesses unique characteristics that enable it to bridge ideologically diverse communities.\n\nWe do note a small amount of shared visual content. Interestingly, when we examine the emotional reactions elicited by this shared visual content, we find that they often diverge significantly, suggesting that pre-existing ideological positions heavily influence interpretation. This work contributes to our detailed understanding of the social\n\ndynamics that create and sustain the online echo-chamber effect observed\n\nin climate change debates.",

    "abstract": "This panel argues that social media is a key actor in the health and wellness industries, influencing how users participate in discussions and conversations related to wellbeing, health, and embodied experience. Drawing together interdisciplinary qualitative methods to advocate for a critical, feminist approach, the panel focuses on the influence of health-related social media content on users, as well as the effects of these platforms on professional content creators. The first presentation poses a methodological intervention, using Situational Analysis to map the FemTech industry, contending that social media is an important site of research. The second paper presents a close reading of FemTech influencer advertisements on social media, considering the role of influencers in promoting health and medical products. The final paper considers how everyday social media users are emerging as key actors in shaping understandings and definitions of ADHD. Together, the panel sheds light on how social media platforms have become crucial sites of information about bodily health and wellness for both traditional healthcare industry actors, non-professional users, and content creators. In conversation with one another, the papers present a detailed discussion of the relationships between social media and health, advocating for critical methodological approaches and frameworks. This interdisciplinary and globally engaged panel ultimately highlights the influence of social media on reproductive health technologies, influencer marketing, mental health, and the healthcare industry at large.",

    "title": "AN ALGORITHMIC EVENT: THE CELEBRATION AND CRITIQUE OF 'SPOTIFY WRAPPED'",
    "abstract": "Each year, Spotify encourages its users to share aesthetically pleasing data stories ‘wrapped’ and repackaged from their listening behaviour. We approach ‘Wrapped’ as an ‘algorithmic event’, defined as a moment in time in which there is a collective orientation towards a particular algorithmic system and associated data. To examine how people make sense of ‘Wrapped’ as an algorithmic event, we bring together ordinary Spotify users to explore datafication through a series of prompts and creative activities, including a modified version of the ‘walkthrough’ (Light et al., 2018) and a craft-based exercise. These exercises allow participants to tease out how normative assumptions are baked into ‘Wrapped’ and mobilise particular understandings of individuals, their habits, tastes and identities. Importantly, we position our participants as co-analysts, following the work of Robards and Lincoln (2017) and Markham (2021), and in our analysis highlight themes that arise from their contributions. Emerging findings allude to highly ambivalent feelings towards ‘Wrapped’ as an algorithmic event: Our participants both celebrate and critique how Spotify claims to ‘know’ them as individuals. They also contest the way ‘Wrapped’ is framed as revealing the ‘truth’ about music consumption and taste. As such, we argue that algorithmic events like ‘Wrapped’ are useful ways to think through data capture and algorithmic systems. The phenomenon of ‘wrappification’ – by which we mean the repackaging of behavioural data that captures a particular activity throughout the year and the responses to the belief that we can ‘know’ ourselves in this way – speaks to such impact.",

    "abstract": "The article delves into the transformative impact of TikTok's new business model, TikTok Shop, which has revolutionized cross-border e-commerce by introducing managed models for merchants. This shift has led to significant challenges for merchants, including reduced profitability and loss of autonomy, particularly under the hosting model. Employing online ethnography and examining platform policies, the study sheds light on power dynamics within the TikTok ecosystem, revealing the platform's influence over economic activities and its implications for stakeholders. Through an exploration of TikTok's vertical integration and control of the value chain, the article underscores the precariousness of platform-based business models and highlights the need for public accountability. This analysis offers insights into the complex interplay between platform power, merchant autonomy, and economic activities within the TikTok ecosystem, contributing to a deeper understanding of the evolving dynamics in digital commerce.",

    "abstract": "The art of Internet Research is always developing, while also firmly rooted in the theoretical frameworks of the past. As technologies have evolved over time, new ways of interacting have become pervasive, and with them, a need for a different means of analyzing such interactions. Through all of this change, internet researchers have discussed and developed effective methodologies to suit the needs of research. Significant work has been done on digital ethnographies, digital interviews, and surveys using online systems. One area not as widely discussed and developed is the use of online focus groups in synchronous video forums like Zoom or Extended Reality (XR) spaces such as ENGAGE or VRChat. This paper describes our approach to methodological systems for better understanding digital interaction through focus group interviews within such media.\n\nSpecifically, we present the theoretical underpinnings and design of an upcoming focus group study we are conducting within a virtual world setting. We focus on questions of how to incorporate different types of virtual avatars for the participants and how to collect observable data in the virtual space, including language and avatar behavior. Finally, we describe how such data can be used to understand questions of communication, power, individual agency, and identity that occur in these group settings.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the nexus between the attention economy and digital disinformation on TikTok, drawing from Esposito's adaptation of Luhmann’s system theory to the digital age and Swartz's exploration of the socio-economic layers of digital transactions. It zeroes in on cryptocurrency scams as a case study to illuminate how disinformation is propagated for economic gain, using TikTok's API for comprehensive analysis. The research employs advanced data analytics to examine how digital platforms, via algorithmic filtering, shape the flow and influence of content, thereby enabling the proliferation of disinformation markets. By thematic clustering of problematic Facebook narratives and identifying scam-specific jargon, this study pinpoints tactics used on TikTok related to the 2024 Bitcoin halving. It scrutinizes how manipulators exploit technical and platform-specific vulnerabilities for profit, integrating Luhmann's double contingency theory to elucidate the feedback loops that enhance content virality and algorithmic dissemination. This theoretical framework illuminates the complex interplay between user interactions and algorithmic preferences, which, in turn, feed into the economics of disinformation markets. The research underscores the strategic manipulation of digital platforms to foster disinformation, spotlighting the role of algorithms and user engagement in the commodification of attention within these markets. Through this lens, the study aims to provide insights into the operational dynamics of disinformation markets, offering a nuanced understanding of how digital misinformation is not merely a byproduct of technological advancement but a structured market leveraging the inherent vulnerabilities of digital platforms and their users.",

    "abstract": "For its global popularity and market expansion, K-pop idol culture has been integrated into child peer culture on social media, particularly in the Asia Pacific region. This is particularly noticeable in the form of K-pop dance challenges on short-form platforms/functions like Instagram Reels, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts, where people replicate choreographic moves from latest K-pop songs and post short-form videos with hashtags. Children casually join the trending challenges for fun and post videos by themselves, their parents, and even third-party companies, including child influencer agencies and K-pop training companies. This paper interrogates how this phenomenon has evolved into children’s new peer culture within the context of the influencer and K-pop culture industries. I discuss how children are positioned and presented in the evolving landscape of culture industries in the Asia Pacific region. I argue that this genre serves as a new version of ‘child pageant programs’ where childhood is performed and presented as a mixture of cuteness, innocence, immature maturity, and prodigious skills for the adult gaze. Pertinent issues surrounding children’s agency and wellbeing are also discussed, such as children’s everyday digital labor and the subsequent normalization of commodified childhood innocence in the industries. Crucially, the virality-centered algorithms of social media platforms underpinned in K-pop dance challenges further normalizes children’s seamless labor of cute, with the myth of instant internet virality, stardom, and K-pop dream. This study is based on a 4-year ethnographic observation of children’s K-pop dance challenges in the Asia Pacific region.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents findings from a national-scale project that worked with disadvantaged communities across Australia to examine digital inclusion in low-income families and the role of social infrastructure (e.g., schools, libraries, charities, government services) in supporting digital participation. Drawing on data collected in interviews and community workshops in an outer urban community with significant socioeconomic challenges, we illuminate the digital labour of community sector workers who routinely act as digital mentors. These workers support family members who often lack access to digital devices and services along with the requisite skills to use digital technologies to perform everyday tasks, such as helping families to contact telecommunications providers, access government apps, and apply for jobs or rental leases online.\n\nIn light of our results, our study extends the concept of digital labour to include work undertaken in the service and advocacy of digital inclusion in community contexts. Specifically, we articulate the activities, challenges, frustrations, and costs (in time and resources) that characterise digital inclusion support of low-income families, often beyond role expectations. In doing this, we seek to expand understandings of digital labour both as a category and concept. Overall, the paper demonstrates that digital inclusion initiatives must not only accommodate the intersecting socio-cultural needs of low-income families, but include appropriate support and resourcing for community workers performing critical digital mentoring work.",

    "abstract": "Social media offer the opportunity for much public discourse, which also has the potential to spread misinformation far and wide. This study investigates how older adults respond to misinformation on social media and how older adults’ responses to encountering false information on social media vary by sociodemographic factors and digital skills. Based on survey data collected in 2023 from 2,000 adults ages 60+, we find that many users take a multifaceted approach to assessing false or misleading information on social media. Their most common strategies are checking the source and reading the comments for validation. These responses to misinformation highlight older adults’ active participation in information verification on social media.",

    "abstract": "The urgency of enhancing community resilience in the face of escalating disasters necessitates a shift in disaster preparedness strategies. This paper presents a novel approach developed in collaboration with the Australian Red Cross, focusing on community-centred data practices for disaster resilience. Recognising the limitations of traditional digital humanitarianism, which largely relied on crowdsourcing and social platform data, our project shifts the paradigm towards empowering communities with data capabilities. We developed a Community Resource Mapping Pipeline, and a prototype platform to map community resources and strengths, emphasising community-led processes and local data capability development to improve local disaster preparedness and response. Our organisational participatory approach involved workshops with stakeholders to co-shape research questions and platform design within a human-centred framework. Our prototype demonstrates the potential of community-led data capability building in enhancing disaster preparedness, underscoring the importance of involving communities in both data collection and decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Though discursive shifts signal increasing enthusiasm for children's digital play when instrumental educational outcomes are evident, limited attention has been paid to its possible wellbeing benefits or the reasons that children engage with it. The time that children invest in digital game play presents an opportunity for the global digital games industry to contribute positively to children’s well-being. Empirical research must first examine the diverse relationships between children’s digital play and their wellbeing.\n\nThis paper reports on an international, ecoculturally and ethnographically informed and semi-longitudinal study in collaboration with a children's digital game industry partner and a global child's rights organisation to consider: what drives the digital play choices and practices of a diverse cohort of children?; and how do these findings contribute to understanding the relationship between children’s digital play and their wellbeing? This paper draws on a subset of UK data (20 families) amongst a total 50 case study families who were involved across four countries.\n\nThe study provides diverse examples of digital play supporting dimensions of children’s subjective wellbeing. However, children’s digital play choices and practices were influenced by diverse and often intersecting factors, most compellingly, by different deep interests, desires and needs, understood in the present study as ‘digital play drivers’. The findings offer an empirically grounded expansion of past ‘needs’ approaches and foreground the mediating role played by digital play drivers in the relationship between digital games and children’s subjective wellbeing. Implications for the children's digital game industry are discussed.",

    "title": "SPOTLIGHT ON DEEPFAKES: MAPPING RESEARCH AND REGULATORY RESPONSES",
    "abstract": "The advent of deepfakes has raised widespread concerns among researchers, policymakers, and the public. However, many of these concerns stem from alarmism rather than well-founded evidence. While research has begun discussing deepfakes’ potential harms and whether existing law is sufficient to counteract them, there is a lack of consolidated knowledge regarding the empirical evidence supporting these concerns as well as the specific regulatory measures developed in response. To bridge these gaps, our methodological approach is two-fold: (1) we provide a systematic literature review to consolidate what is currently empirically known about deepfakes, and (2) a qualitative content analysis of the evolving regulatory landscape. This is to offer a more comprehensive understanding of the deepfake phenomenon and to provide directions for future research and policymaking. The findings highlight gaps in our knowledge of deepfakes, making it difficult to assess the appropriateness and need for regulatory action. While deepfake technology may not introduce entirely new and unique regulatory problems, it can amplify existing problems such as the spread of non-consensual pornography and disinformation. Effective oversight and enforcement of existing rules, along with careful consideration of required adjustments will therefore be crucial. The dynamic nature of deepfake technology also calls for adaptive policy approaches that aim to mitigate harm while protecting individual rights and addressing larger societal issues. Altogether, this highlights the importance of more empirical research to navigate and comprehend the regulatory challenges raised by deepfakes and to develop evidence-based countermeasures.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of Large Language Model (LLM)-based chatbots, specifically in the context of political information retrieval, using the 2024 Taiwan presidential election as a case study. With the rapid integration of LLMs into search engines like Google and Microsoft Bing, concerns about information quality, algorithmic gatekeeping, biases, and content moderation emerged. This research aims to (1) assess the alignment of AI chatbot responses with factual political information, (2) examine the adherence of chatbots to algorithmic norms and impartiality ideals, (3) investigate the factuality and transparency of chatbot-sourced synopses, and (4) explore the universality of chatbot gatekeeping across different languages within the same geopolitical context.\n\nAdopting a case study methodology and prompting method, the study analyzes responses from Microsoft’s LLM-powered search engine chatbot, Copilot, in five languages (English, Traditional Chinese, Simple Chinese, German, Swedish). The findings reveal significant discrepancies in content accuracy, source citation, and response behavior across languages. Notably, Copilot demonstrated a higher rate of factual errors in Traditional Chinese while exhibiting better performance in Simplified Chinese. The study also highlights problematic referencing behaviors and a tendency to prioritize certain types of sources, such as Wikipedia, over legitimate news outlets.\n\nThese results underscore the need for enhanced transparency, thoughtful design, and vigilant content moderation in AI technologies, especially during politically sensitive events. Addressing these issues is crucial for ensuring high-quality information delivery and maintaining algorithmic accountability in the evolving landscape of AI-driven communication platforms.",

    "abstract": "In striving for equity, it is key to understand enabling and impeding factors of educational and digital participation of (marginalised) youth. Even though formal education is often focused on in the discussion on educational inequalities, non-formal and informal education need to be further considered, especially with regard to digitalised societies (Jeong et al. 2018; Spanhel 2020). Applying a broad understanding of education as a transformation of self-world-relations (Jörissen/Marotzki 2009), non-formal educational arrangements that revolve around digital media activities potentially contribute to educational and digital equity among youth by enabling processes of learning and experiences of self-efficacy.\n\nTherefore, this paper focuses on investigating the accessibility of educational participation from a marginalised youth perspective: Do non-formal digitised educational arrangements recognise (marginalised) youth realities? Our research aims at identifying conditions that enable resp. limit participation of (marginalised) youth in relation to their orientations within two non-formal educational institutions that specialise in digital media activities.\n\nGroup Discussions are implemented with youth who take part in the researched educational arrangements and with youth who belong to the potential target group but do not participate. In Group Discussions, depictions and narrations are unfolded by the participants. Analysing Group Discussions with the Documentary Method allows for the reconstruction of collective patterns of orientations that influence everyday practice (Bohnsack 2010). Based on data extracts presented at AoIR 2024, conditions of participation in non-formal digitised educational arrangements from a (marginalised) youth perspective will be discussed.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines how the figures and imaginaries of hegemonic masculinity are co-produced and contested among a reactionary influencer fandom. It assumes an intersectional masculinities approach to the question of how Andrew Tate and his social media audience(s) articulate and mobilise anti-feminist and anti-LGBTQIA+ discourses online. Affective intermediation is proposed as a concept that situates relational labour within the influencer ecosystem in terms of the affective production of masculinity as a cultural and economic category. Data consist of a 15-month sample of Andrew Tate’s posts on the video-sharing platform Rumble (n=213) and a purposive sample (n=17) of Tate's posts on X (formerly Twitter). The dataset includes all user responses to posts on Rumble (n=112,656) and X (n=14,796). The methods used are constructionist thematic analysis, which orients towards the sociocultural contexts of discourse and computational discourse analysis, including topic modelling. Incorporating perspectives on fandom, labour, and the manosphere, preliminary findings suggest three key points of tension. First, the tension created by audience directives about who Tate should interact with and how he should conduct himself in order to avoid collaborations with creators who appear “gay’. Second, the tension between “simping” and support that fans and followers must navigate when expressing approval of Tate whilst trying to avoid being seen as “gay”. Third, the tension between demands of cultural and economic production, including how audiences articulate their expectations with regard to the production of masculinist content.",

The project was initiated by a workers' cooperative that acquired the franchise of the Bibi Mob platform with the support of the city's municipality through its solidarity economy incubator. The experience failed eight months after its inception.\n\nThis article applies a neo-materialist perspective, mapping the datafication process in the app to analyse how the global power relations of infrastructural global platforms - mainly Google and Amazon - were crucial to the end of the experience. The dependence on a global platform ecosystem and the franchised platform limited the workers' ability to act.\n\nDrawing from a Southern Global experience, the research challenges platform cooperativism, colonialism and data sovereignty. The article argues that the modus operandi of platform power is exercised through a disciplinary power that produces \"autonomy under surveillance\".\n\nAnalysing a failed partnership allows one to discuss platform cooperativism and examine the manifestations of power in the Global South.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins are characterized as NextGen smart cities, part of cyber-manufacturing processes and as industry 4.0 systems. They are digital replicas of ‘real’ world physical assets, with real-time information interchanges via sensors between digital replicas and their material assets. They can be immersive 3D environments of cities rendered in game engines and engaged with via VR headsets. Uncritical, enthusiastic and technologically solutionist rationales are generally offered for their creation in IT, engineering and vendor literature. Digital twins are often touted as a system to predict, preempt, prevent and plan for the impact of climate change and for emergency preparedness scenario planning. This paper discusses preliminary observations from a transdisciplinary archival and AI research project of an urban digital twin in the architecture, engineering, construction and owner operated (AECOO) sector, theoretically framed by critical data studies, archival digital diplomatics, digital records forensics and social and technological assemblage theory. A hybrid methodological approach combines a technological walkthrough with twin developers mapping data flows and technological processes, guided by a semi-structured interview instrument to identify what constitutes a record of automated and AI/ML actions that affect social and material outcomes. Preliminary observations identified a complex set of technopolitics, myriad procurement and contractual arrangements where data and technology ownership remains with vendors. It has become clear that digital twins are very messy and poorly governed infrastructures of infrastructure, which are mostly proprietary, lack interoperability and standards. The aim is to understand urban digital twins so that they may be governed in the public interest.",

Twitch’s owner, Amazon, demands increasing growth and profit (Yin-Poole, 2024), so the platform must continue attracting new streamers, viewers, and advertisers. However, these new audiences may be at odds with Twitch’s core base of white, Asian, cisgender men (see Cote, 2020). This means many of Twitch’s policies and attempts at platform governance are often implemented inconsistently or in an ad-hoc manner, leading to greater confusion about what is and isn’t permissible on the platform (Winslow, 2024). Platform governance, also known as content moderation, harkens to how “platforms don’t make content, but they will make important choices about that content; what they will distribute and to whom, how they will connect users and broker their reactions, and what they will refuse” (Gillespie, 2018, pp. 254-255). As Twitch struggles to grow its audience but remains faithful to its core base, questions emerge as to who may be experiencing unfair moderation practices.",

    "title": "THE ROLE OF THE DRAMA INTERPRETATION INDUSTRY IN THE TRANSNATIONAL RECEPTION OF KOREAN TV SERIES IN CHINA",
    "abstract": "This article examines how the drama interpretation industry on video-streaming platforms influences the transnational reception of Korean TV series in China. Combined with new background music and the creators’ interpretations, drama interpretation videos extract drama clips from the long episodes and reproduce hours-long TV series into 3-5 minute short-form videos. With the rise of this industry, a lack of studies has noticed the phenomenon and its influence on transnational audience reception. Thus, this study is pioneering research to address how interpretative commentary videos affect audience reception of international TV series in China, how Chinese audiences engage with Korean TV content on user-generated platforms, and whether dissemination of clip-sharing on user-generated platforms benefits or detriments Korean TV series. Adopting the Korean drama Glory as a case, this study used qualitative content analysis, augmented by semi-structured interviews, to examine these user-generated interpretive videos and their associated comments on Douyin and Xiaohongshu. This study found that video creators replaced obscure terminologies with other terms familiar to audiences within a Chinese cultural context, and viewers mainly discussed characters in the Korean drama Glory without mentioning Korean culture or cultural differences. Therefore, this study argues that interpretive videos can be regarded as a form of user-generated localization of international TV series, making foreign dramas understandable to local audiences and helping with the dramas’ dissemination, while this re-production of TV series, which eliminates cultural differences, is detrimental to the spread of foreign culture.",

    "title": "THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF AI AS PLATFORM: INFRASTRUCTURES, POWER, AND THE AI INDUSTRY",
    "abstract": "The artificial intelligence (AI) sector is experiencing rapid growth, with a projected market size of $1.3 trillion by 2032 according to industry reports. The landscape shifted significantly with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, prompting major players like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta, alongside popular apps such as TikTok and Snapchat, to make substantial investments in AI. There has been an influx of new AI products and updates, reshaping the industry’s structure and scale. Additionally, there has been a surge in acquisitions and investments in AI startups, particularly by Big Tech firms. Furthermore, partnerships between AI and major tech companies have proliferated, solidifying their dominant positions. In fact, as Kak and Myers West succinctly state, ‘There is no AI without Big Tech’, raising critical issues around industry concentration and the political economy of AI.\n\nThis panel posits that the driving force behind these transformative shifts is the evolution of AI as a platform. This evolution effectively propels the platformisation of AI, facilitating the integration of AI across diverse industry sectors. The resultant ‘industrialisation’ of AI marks the expansion of AI systems across various sectors and industries, triggering investments in necessary computational resources and posing challenges for governing AI. In short, this underscores that AI is much more than just a standalone application or tool, such as ChatGPT; it is a foundational technical system that underpins a broad array of apps and services.\n\nIn this context, the panel recognises the recent ‘infrastructural turn’ in media and internet studies, deliberately steering away from speculative discussions about the future impacts of AI. Instead, the emphasis shifts towards a focus on the ‘mundanity and ordinariness of existing systems’. This highlights the importance of studying the foundational infrastructure, tools, and frameworks that shape AI development. Furthermore, it requires an understanding of the associated supply chains, investments, acquisitions, forms of ownership and support, control mechanisms, and the broader political economy surrounding AI. Such perspectives have been developed, for example, to study AI’s industry relations in healthcare, the global digital marketing and advertising industries, journalism, or the automotive industry.\n\nThe panellists examine how AI may be viewed as a platform, presenting critical perspectives on the platformisation of AI and its implications for industry relations and the media landscape. Through four distinct studies, they highlight: (1) the influence of platforms on the emerging AI ecosystem and their consolidation of power through reliance on cloud infrastructure, (2) the evolution of cloud infrastructure in the political economy of AI, (3) the actualisation of AI as a platform with ‘general-purpose’ applications, and (4) how challenges in machine vision shape innovation in AI. Each contribution revolves around a central question: How is AI, particularly within the AI sector, evolving under the influence of platform logic? In doing so, the panellists offer valuable insights informed by platform theory and methodologies, exploring their relevance for a comprehensive examination of AI and the broader AI sector. Furthermore, their perspectives provide methodological insights into understanding the material conditions and critical political economy of AI as a platform.\n\nCollectively, these studies seek to advance the critical discourse on AI and its political economy, with a specific emphasis on the AI industry. They shed light on the evolving landscape of AI industry relations and dependencies within the platform ecosystem, tracing how these relationships have transformed over time.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces reciprocal digital methods, a novel research framework tailored to the exigencies of studying social media in what has been called a post-API landscape (Bruns, 2019; Freelon, 2018). In this paper we build on scholarly discourse on the epistemology and ethics of social media data (Lomborg &amp; Bechmann, 2014; Marres &amp; Gerlitz, 2016), and the current debates about the future of social media research (Bruns, 2019; Freelon, 2018; Ohme &amp; Araujo, 2022; Tromble, 2021). We propose a model that is intended to push the field forward, merging approaches to social media that have been largely disparate, and combining computational analysis of user-level digital trace data and interviews with the same users.\n\nWe argue that user perspectives and digital trace data should not be considered as separate methods but as part of a reciprocal exchange and a broader methodological pluralism (Danermark et al., 2019). Digital data, while rich in potential insights, often lacks the context necessary to interpret user behavior and platform interaction accurately. Conversely, interviews provide depth and narrative but are generally not reliable for capturing use patterns. By combining these two elements, the proposed methodology enables researchers to bridge the gap between narrative and pattern, and between media use and media practice. Moreover, we propose that inviting users into the quantitative analysis process can help correct for the noted lack of agency users have had in big data studies (Bishop &amp; Kant, 2023).",

    "abstract": "Many children lead lives that are heavily influenced by the digital world, whether that’s through digital products, services, and practices made for them, or made about them. For children and their families, their digital childhood is mediated across many dimensions, including play, learning, communication and the everyday routines of family life. In this panel, we examine some of the ways digital childhood is mediated through Industry. In particular, we explore the ways that children, their families, policymakers and the wider public all contribute to the construction of, what can be thought of as, the ‘digital childhood industry’. This panel is concerned with the myriad ways that digital industries both benefit and are challenged by practices of children, their families, and policymakers. The papers in the panel are purposely diverse to showcase the breadth of the digital childhood industry. Each paper has a focal point on children, the internet, and the industry that often mediates the relationship between the two. From critically examining children’s play on Roblox, surfacing policymaker discourses about children's social media, exploring children’s perspectives on video games, showcasing the digital labour of contemporary parenthood, and investigating children’s digital play and wellbeing, this panel highlights the digital childhood industry from several starting points.",

    "abstract": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSocial media platforms such as Facebook, X and TikTok are the “new governors” or “custodians” of the Internet (Klonick 2018; Gillespie 2018). How they moderate global speech online affects the communication practices of billions of people and it can make or break social movements and political resistance, and generally be a critical risk factor for human rights violations. These platforms are increasingly joined by states, international organizations, civil society, journalists and others in defining and interpreting the limitations of speech online, be it through legislation, guidelines or by helping platforms to distinguish misinformation from legitimate content. In parallel, researchers ponder questions concerning the legitimacy of various approaches of content moderation (Haggart &amp; Keller 2021; Suzor 2019), which must extend to the question of which actors ought to fulfill which function in the moderation of content. A legitimate content moderation constellation (and potentially division of labor) is arguably one that is perceived to be legitimate by the “governed” themselves (for whatever qualities are appraised by them). As of today, however, we have little empirical knowledge about what users actually think about content moderation. The current paper presents novel empirical evidence on how users perceive platform content moderation and how they perceive content moderation roles of different governors of speech. The quantitative analysis is based on a survey of more than 15,000 Facebook and Instagram users in 33 countries in the Global South and Eastern Europe, which was conducted in six languages in late 2022 and early 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "abstract": "New forms of facial recognition, aggression detection systems, bus routing optimization software, generative AI detection, and online exam proctoring: the edtech industry is rapidly increasing its influence over schools and universities by introducing new AI-powered products and services. As the ubiquity and complexity of AI systems intensifies, deliberation among practitioners about immediate and long-term risks is becoming ever more challenging.\n\nTo help education practitioners and administrators critically explore these systems and deliberate about their consequences, this paper presents the prototype of an edtech assessment toolkit. The toolkit is embedded in a body of work aiming to make technical democracy a key feature in the design, implementation, and use of public sector AI systems. This prototype brings awareness to the potential of participatory design to explore the accountability, transparency, and governance of AI-based systems through collective forms of experimentation.\n\nThe paper itself consists of four parts. First, it puts forward a framework for technical democracy to govern AI systems through shared uncertainty. Secondly, it presents how the toolkit has been co-created to encourage collective learning and experimentation. Thirdly, it highlights three tools that have emerged from a series of workshops, collaborations, and dialogues: the counter-archive, the issues register, and the possibilities matrix. The paper finishes by discussing how this methodology produces an exploratory tool for enacting technical democracy design experiments to interrupt the design and implementation of AI into the public sector by making spaces that value dissensus over consensus in an age of automated decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Webcam sex platforms have grown into a multi-billion industry over the past few decades and host large populations of performers. Success on these platforms is often framed in terms of appearing higher in the algorithmically ranked performance list on their homepage. However, among webcam performers, focusing on a smaller, niche audience is a recognized strategy. This suggests that financial success on these platforms takes a variety of forms and manifests beyond merely ‘ranking higher’.\n\nTo better understand the different ways the platform affords financial success for its performers, we collected public ranking, viewership and tip data from Chaturbate, one of the largest camming platforms, over a two-week period in July 2022. We use an array of analysis techniques and arrive at three preliminary findings. Firstly, we find a pronounced winners-take-all distribution of tips on Chaturbate, strongly correlating with viewership and homepage ranking. Secondly, we identify low-ranking performers with substantial earnings, suggesting viable paths to sustainable income beyond seeking front-page visibility. Thirdly, we uncover niche-visibility areas linked to specific labels and tags, where performers often rely on small numbers of generous tippers, or 'whales'.\n\nOur findings reinforce previous academic observations concerning the competitive environment in webcam sex as well as creator industries at large. Yet, we also discern alternative income-generation strategies beyond high homepage ranking. However, the strong reliance on whale tippers within more niche areas of content underscores the precarity in the industry, and the fact that performers ultimately remain dependent on a combination of platform affordances and viewer attention.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to theorize the parasocial relationships between podcast creators and listeners, but with a unique focus on the perspective of the creators themselves. While parasocial relationships are typically studied from the perspective of the audience, understanding the creator's viewpoint can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of these relationships and the modes of addressivity they evoke, particularly with the emergence of intimacy as a keyword in podcast studies (Swiatek, 2018; Spinelli &amp; Dann, 2019; Euritt, 2020, 2023). Through in-depth interviews with prominent podcasters in the Israeli podcast scene, we explore: How do podcast creators imagine their listeners? How are these imagined listeners shaped by the creators’ personal dispositions, their own experiences as podcast listeners, their assumptions about podcasting as a medium, and their actual interactions with their listeners? We argue that the starting point for the postulated intimacy between podcasters and listeners is an imagined addressee whom the podcaster conceives as similar to themselves. Just as authors imagine their audience as they write novels, we assume that the creator’s imagined audience impacts the actual audience that emerges. We also argue that this addressee is brought into being through a shared understanding of intimacy as authenticity, even though only the notion of intimacy actually implies some form of relationship. In making these arguments, we propose a typology of different kinds of imagined relationships with perceived listeners, contributing to a more complex understanding of podcasting and its cultural meaning.",

This paper asks: How does the future-oriented imaginary of datafication relate to current practices in vehicle data, particularly for policing? At the same time, how is this imaginary unfolding as privacy/justice concerns for activists and regulators? It draws from semi-structured interviews with over 30 people working on algorithmic surveillance—including police officers and surveillance manufacturers, but also activists and regulators. It also builds on fieldwork conducted at policing/traffic conferences, particularly sessions on “the future” or “emergent technologies”.\n\nIt finds: 1) In direct relation to Gekker &amp; Hind’s (2019) concept of “infrastructural surveillance”, that vehicles are already imagined as connected computers, constantly generating surveillance data. Among activists and regulators, this future leads to anxiety around function creep, as manufacturers may decide to change their policies, or new forms of analysis may be enabled for policing; 2) How concern over a future of data excess exists, particularly for policing institutions. This is responded through increased efforts of data integration and a techno-solutionist narrative of AI, but also smaller interventions. For activists, this relates to wider fears over \"predictive policing\" and its injustices.\n\nThe paper thus contributes to critical data studies literature, supporting renewed considerations for privacy and justice frameworks in a world where vehicles act as infrastructures for constant surveillance.",

    "title": "CLOUD AS INFRASTRUCTURE: THEORISING THE LINKS BETWEEN ‘BIG’ TECH AND ‘SMALL’ TECH",
    "abstract": "Cloud providers, by creating and owning massive computing assets, produce new internet infrastructure. Large-scale data centres that aggregate hardware resources are an important element shaping the expansion of platform economies. The impact of this configuration of hardware on the dynamics of software development is still unclear. There is growing scholarship on data centres, however the aggregation of a highly scalable hardware system has a profound impact on industry dynamics. Cloud computing lowers the upfront cost of using and owning computing systems. The wide-ranging impact of platforms is explained at least in part by cloud infrastructure: the scalable provisioning of computing resources via the internet. I identify virtualized hardware, modularity, resource sharing, and externalisation as generative of a new internet-based infrastructure. I show these coalesce to form a new industry dynamic, with hardware centralisation on the one hand and decentralisation of cloud users and complement developers on the other. Scholarship in this area is beginning to examine the relations between dominant technology corporations and their networks of users and third-party companies. I contribute to this by examining changing organizational and market dynamics introduced by cloud computing. The findings and analysis are derived from two related studies of changing industrial practices. I focus on the anatomy of the infrastructure and how it activates a new set of relations between start-ups, developers, entrepreneurs, and investors. What is the techno-organisational structure of cloud computing? In answering this, the presentation will offer a view into cloud ecosystems from an industry level and organisational level.",

We aim to bring the perspective of our agency to AoIR 2024’s theme of industry so that we can share, engage, and facilitate discussions with scholars interested in applications of digital ethnography outside academia.\n\nWe will explore the challenges of introducing ethnography into industry spaces and discuss our approaches. These include strategic data storytelling to confront bias and stigma from industry leadership, triangulation of data through multiple methodologies and sources to combat skepticism around qualitative data, using ethnographic analysis as an engine for synthesizing data across different models, maintaining the fast-paced operational speed required in the industry, and working within the tension between leadership and their publics.\n\nOur insights are primarily based on our own research experience. However, we also connect our experiences and methodologies with scholarly theory on ethnographic definitions/key concepts, informal discussion ethnography, ethics in digital ethnography, and triangulation of varied sources and perspectives in ethnography.\n\nWe have been conducting digital ethnography for almost two decades. We draw from this extensive body of work, including perspectives on how online behavior and platform changes have influenced our research methods.\n\nWe not only bring scholarly ethnographic theory into industrial arenas but also have extensive experience operationalizing these theories in live settings due to the fast pace at which we complete projects for clients.\n\nOur work continues with a diverse client base across government, healthcare, education sectors among others.",

    "abstract": "Indian women activists are increasingly integrating digital strategies in their fight against the burning issue of sexual violence. Their digital strategies help them navigate the Indian socio-digital landscape, which is an extension of the sociocultural context they live in. There are limited studies in the area of digital feminist activism emerging from the Global South, especially from the context of post-colonial India. There is a concerning gap in the literature on this topic when it comes to understanding the factors that shape women's digital activism against sexual violence. Therefore while addressing this gap, this paper investigates digital activism by Indian women against sexual violence under the overarching question of; what are the rhetorical practices of digital feminist protest by Indian women activists against sexual violence? Anchored in the framework of postcolonial feminism, I examine the journey of the local Indian women to digital activism; to understand their motivation and access to digital technology. My interviews with 20 Indian women activists from diverse backgrounds within the Indian landscape reveal the factors that shape their journey to digital activism. This paper contributes to understanding the role class, status, and geographical location play in women's journey to digital activism against sexual violence, within a post-colonial Global South country as India.",

    "title": "THE PRECARITY, PERILS, AND PROMISES OF EMERGING CREATOR ECONOMIES",
    "abstract": "This panel focuses on the relationship of emerging creator economies to conditions of precarity, as they have come to develop in several distinct yet partially overlapping social, historical, and geographical contexts, including: Dalit mobile street performances in Haryana, India; YouTube street interview videos recorded in China, Japan and South Korea; the digital circulation of ethnonationalist themes and tropes surrounding the 2024 parliamentary elections in Uttarakhand, India; the resurgence of New Age beliefs and practices on CrystalTok; and, the rise of motivational speakers as political intermediaries in rural areas of neoliberal India. Across these various contexts, emerging creator economies, and the media practices and technologies which constitute them, appear as often attached to various contextually situated promises—of social mobility; political empowerment; cultural recognition; fame and wealth; or healing and relief from systemic forms of harm. This panel considers how various individuals, social groups, and organizations have, through participation in and strategic engagement with emerging creator economies, sought to achieve at least one (and in some cases, multiple) of the above listed goals and objectives. Utilizing a variety of theoretical and methodological approaches that collectively prioritize ambivalence and contextual nuance over sweeping generalizations, each of these five papers in some way balances an interest in the unique social and political potentials that emerging creator economies have helped (or might help) to realize, in a given context, with a critical awareness of the systemic forms of inequality, political disempowerment, and social and psychological immiseration that creator economies have both contributed to and intensified.",

    "abstract": "Drawing on interview and survey data from content writers in the UK communications industries, this paper critically and empirically explores content writers' engagements with generative text AI in relation to creative authorship and expertise. The project will utilize a critical framework of algorithmic literacy to consider avenues for empowering so-far overlooked stakeholders of AI tool use in this creative industry sector.\n\nThe paper presents findings from a survey of 1,074 PR and communications content writers and their managers/ employers and from 21 follow-up interviews with the same stakeholders. It will explore the realities of automated authorship and the opportunities and limitations that algorithmic literacy might bring in enhancing smaller stakeholder algorithmic empowerment and expertise. Findings suggest that a) generative text AI is increasingly being used by content writers in ways that challenge speculative forecasts of generative text use and that b) these tools are useful for saving time, idea generation and synthesising existing text, but cannot (yet) be used to replicate or generate authorially convincing tone of voice or brand identity. Such findings suggest that critical algorithmic literacy could be used to create dialogues in workplaces that foreground the problems related to automated authorship - especially in terms of promoting human expertise, challenging algorithmic power and reforming the boundaries of creative subjectivity.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between digital practices, gender, and intimacy in teenagers’ everyday life is gaining growing attention. We can look at digital media as environments that offer young people agency and spaces where they can construct and perform their identity (boyd 2014) through bricolage practices (Willett 2008) and by experimenting with their own selves, also with regard to gender and intimacy (Ferreira 2021; Metcalfe &amp; Llewellyn 2020; Scarcelli 2015; De Ridder 2017; Livingstone &amp; Mason 2015). Studies have also devoted attention to communicative interactions (e.g.,“sexting”), investigating both the incorporation of and resistance to specific gender and sexual ideologies (Ringrose et al. 2013; Scarcelli 2020).\n\nThe aim of our paper is to analyse how Italian teenagers (aged 15-18) (re)define their understanding of gender and intimacy by engaging with digital media and incorporating it into their daily lives. In the first step of our research we are conducting six focus groups with students (15-18) from secondary schools in six cities located in three Italian regions. In the second step, we will carry out in depth semi-structured interviews with teenagers. The combination of these methods will allow to explore topics such as teenagers' digital practices in relation to performing gender identities and sexual orientation on different platforms; teens’ interaction with others in relation to intimate practices; the use of specific platforms for homosocial interaction; use of digital resources to seek information about gender; digital media representations. Results cover a wide set of digital practices, organised along three (interrelated) dimensions: gender, sexuality and intimate relationships.",

    "abstract": "The Indian state’s move towards the digitalisation of the health sector has serious implications for how health care is availed and experienced by the people, especially the poor. When biometric identity systems are established for authorisation and verification, people are forced to meet the demands of technical systems for accessing healthcare. What kinds of relations are formed through these biometric-based information assemblages? What are the materialities of patient data and experiences within these information assemblages? How health data is organised, accessed, and controlled within the territorialities of the digital? This paper will look into the rise of datafication of health information and the making of biometric-based Unique Health Identification Number (UHID) in India with the case of the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) and the subsequent Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA). The ABHA number is a 14-digit identifier distinguishing individuals within India's digital healthcare system. It is a unique identity linked to Aadhaar, facilitating enrolment in Personal Health Records (PHR), and the public insurance scheme -Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY). With a case study of the South Indian states of Kerala and Puducherry, the paper investigates the norms of governmentalities in datafication by looking into the requirements and conditions of enrolment into the databases for accessing healthcare. The paper looks at datafication as a technique for population management and problematises how enrolment into health identity systems becomes a condition for citizens' rights to access healthcare.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores playful engagement with algorithmic systems among members of the North Atlantic Fella Organisation (NAFO). NAFO are an international social movement that emerged on Twitter in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. We use a combination of textual analysis and semi-structured scroll-back interviews, to understand how NAFO members make sense of the algorithmic environment of Twitter, and how their understanding of algorithms affects their daily participation in a social movement. We examine the community’s practices, or allegorithms, through the prism of playful activism.\n\nOur findings reveal that NAFO understand Twitter’s algorithm as both an instrumental and an antagonistic entity. Their self-professed status as an algorithmic actor reclaims power in a fragmented and increasingly hostile environment of Twitter. Instead of seeing algorithms as adversarial or omnipotent, NAFO members engage in playful vernacular practices to reclaim their agency over the information ecosystem.\n\nNAFO do not succeed in fully understanding or rewriting the “rules of the game”, but achieve their objective of propagating civic ideas to ever-increasing international audiences. With the growing interest in harms that arise from online humour and memes, our paper highlights a contrasting and complementary aspect of online humour - the civic nature of playful practices in digitally mediated collectives.",

    "abstract": "The rise to prominence of visual social media platforms (VSMPs) including TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube has led to increasing amounts of research attention directed to these platforms. As research engages multimodal platforms, representing their content (including text, audio, image, and video components) increasingly becomes both important and complex. The AoIR Internet Research Ethics (IRE) 3.0 guidelines stipulate that “we need to elaborate an ethics addressing the distinctive issues clustering around the production, sharing, and thereby research on visual images” (franzke et al., 2020). In this paper, we begin making such an elaboration, describing considerations necessary when representing screenshots. We provide an overview of four current approaches to representing VSMP posts and annotate their tensions.",

To gain insight into the cultural logic behind this seeming contrast, we conducted qualitative content and code analyses on both malicious and non-malicious code projects from the open-source platform GitHub. We have narrowed down a list of 2500 hackers to 52 who own both malicious and non-malicious projects, with a reference to privacy. We found that these hackers justify their malicious projects as educational tools, often cautioning other users against illegal use. The hackers' logic asserts that those possessing private information are responsible for its protection, be it the end-user or the software owner managing the information post-collection. This logic is translated into code using two privacy approaches: a formal privacy-by-policy and a technically-oriented privacy-by-design. The hackers' polar approach to privacy materializes both in violating privacy when crafting breaching code and in writing code that expertly protects it. From this individualized, privatized standpoint, this duality makes perfect sense.",

    "title": "PLATFORMS ON TRIAL: MAPPING THE FACEBOOK FILES/PAPERS CONTROVERSY",
    "abstract": "Big Tech has been involved in several controversies in recent years. Data leaks, whistleblowers, and social experiments have raised alarms about the dubbed toxic and unaccountable power of platforms and, more broadly, about the increasing crisis of accountability in digital societies (Cooper et al., 2022; Khan, 2018; Marres, 2021). At the intersection of digital sociology, media studies, and STS, this research explores how different actors make and unmake connections between social media platforms and societal harms. The study focuses on mapping a specific platform controversy: the Facebook Files/Papers, a leak in 2021 of internal documents from Meta by the former employee Frances Haugen. The disclosures partially exposed what Meta knew about the consequences of its interface designs, data, and algorithms (Hendrix, 2021; Horwitz, 2021). By combining digital and ethnographic methods, I followed the disclosures across different media settings to analyse how they were made public and which actors, issues, and framings gained prominence during the controversy. As I will show, journalists, advocacy groups, and critics promoted a ‘strategic causalism’ to strengthen the connection between Meta platforms and specific social harms. This was contrasted by the ‘strategic ambiguity’ mobilised by Meta spokespersons to undermine such claims and disperse their responsibility to other actors (e.g. users, malicious actors). The analysis highlights a US-centric theatre of accountability that overlooks crucial issues from the actual disclosures, revealing the asymmetries and displacements when platforms are put on trial.",

    "abstract": "Text-to-image generation (AI art) has become a mainstream phenomenon since the introduction of DALL-E by OpenAI in January 2021 (Nast, 2023). ). On the one hand, AI art challenges definitions of creativity that center on anthropocentric values and discredits the contributions of artists in the training of these AI models (Knibbs, 2023). On the other hand, it blurs the line between artists and non-artists by enabling new ways of creating art (e.g., prompt engineering: an iterative and experimental text-based process to interact with text-to-image generation models). Regardless of one’s ethical stance, practitioners of AI art, including artists of various skills and non-artists, form and participate in online communities to showcase their wares, share practices and resources, and learn from each other.\n\nThis study uses a topic modeling approach to examine topics within three subreddit communities centered on three text-to-image generation models (r/StableDiffusion, r/midjourney, and r/weirddalle). The analysis, based on the top 500 posts from each subreddit over one month, reveals distinct community foci: r/StableDiffusion emphasizes technological innovations and technical learning, r/midjourney showcases AI art and prompt learning, while r/weirddalle is more competitive, focusing on creative or entertaining results. The study further derives topics from prompts extracted from the images, revealing preferences for popular media characters, high photorealism, and surrealist styles, with a notable emphasis on portraits of women.",

    "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) burst into media industries as a cheaper, easier, and faster alternative to produce texts, images and videos. Social scientists are already starting to show how GenAI reinforces stereotypes and discrimination, partly due to gender, race and origin biases in the data used for machine learning. However, less has been said about ageism in GenAI. This is probably because ageist depictions are the norm, and ageism is widely disregarded and deprioritised in research, industry, and society. Building on ageist depictions, the media industry might be reinforcing stereotypes and harming self-perception. In this exploratory research, we analyse whether GenAI produces significant ageist outputs (or not) and to what extent GenAI reinforces age stereotypes through the analysis of 808 images generated with Midjourney. We compared older people's depictions with those of the general population. We employed computer vision and visual analysis to assess if Gen AI falls into associating ageist prejudices with older people. Preliminary results show that generative depictions not only fall into age stereotyping but also exploit mainly harmful tropes, disregarding all the diverse experiences of ageing. Thus, while the media industry has been moving towards an inclusive discourse, the ease of GenAI has burst as a threat to the inclusion of diverse perspectives.",

    "title": "GPT4 V THE OVERSIGHT BOARD: USING LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CONTENT MODERATION",
    "abstract": "Large-scale automated content moderation on major social media platforms continues to be highly controversial. Moderation and curation are central to the value propositions that platforms provide, but companies have struggled to convincingly demonstrate that their automated systems are fair and effective. For a long time, the limitations of automated content classifiers in dealing with borderline cases have seemed intractable. With the recent expansion in the capabilities and availability of large language models, however, there is reason to suspect that more nuanced automated assessment of content in context may now be possible. In this paper, we set out to understand how the emergence of generative AI tools might transform industrial content moderation practices. We investigate whether the current generation of pre-trained foundation models may expand the established boundaries of the types of tasks that are considered amenable to automation in content moderation.\n\nThis paper presents the results of a pilot study into the potential use of GPT4 for content moderation. We use the hate speech decisions of Meta’s Oversight Board as examples of covert hate speech and counterspeech that have proven difficult for existing automated tools. Our preliminary results suggest that, given a generic prompt and Meta’s hate speech policies, GPT4 can approximate the decisions and accompanying explanations of the Oversight Board in almost all current cases. We interrogate several clear challenges and limitations, including particularly the sensitivity of variations in prompting, options for validating answers, and generalisability to examples with unseen content.",

    "title": "WHO HAS THE POWER?: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS TO PARENTAL CONTROLS ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS",
    "abstract": "One recent trend in social media platform practices as well as in proposed policy and regulation for online data rights is a turn towards parental controls. While concerns over children’s safety online and complaints about problematic settings are not necessarily new (Horne, 2021; Horne, 2023), there may be an emerging trend in some countries to try to address growing concerns about the impact of social media platforms by setting regulation on parental controls. To that end, more research is currently needed to study parental controls and age-specific settings for teens and children, as these are comparatively newer developments and a topic and platform feature in flux. This paper contributes to this needed research area by focusing on specific definitions and understandings of privacy.\n\nThe purpose of this study is two-fold. Many social media platforms offer both age-specific privacy settings to children under certain age, as well as parental controls to manage the account of their children. As a result, this study will examine which parental controls are available and how they are offered across some of the most popular social media platforms: Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Discord, and YouTube. The dataset for this study will consist of each social media platform’s: 1. default settings of teen and children’s accounts and 2. parental control options. The analysis will broadly consider how each platform defines parental controls via privacy options.",

    "title": "FROM #BODYPOSITIVE TO #WEIGHTLOSSJOURNEY – EXPLORING WEIGHT LOSS NARRATIVES WITHIN THE FAT COMMUNITY",
    "abstract": "The body positive and fat activist community is an extensive online network crossing many social media platforms, particularly active on Instagram and TikTok. Social media platforms provide “offer opportunities to support, community and practical solutions to issues” (Kyrölä, 2021, p. 113), and a space for resistance (e.g. Puhakka, 2023) for the body positive and fat acceptance movements.\n\nEven though there is not a commonly agreed set of rules for body positivity or fat activism, the idea of intentional weight loss has largely been rejected by the fat community in favor of encouraging health promoting behaviors without the need for weight loss. However, the previously unified activist front has started to crack as prominent figures within the fat community have taken a sharp turn from #bodypositive content to documenting their #weightlossjourney.\n\nDrawing from heory on master narrative, counter narratives and narrative resistance (Bamberg, 2004; Bamberg &amp; Wipff, 2020; Hochman &amp; Spector‐Mersel, 2020; McLean &amp; Syed, 2015; Meretoja, 2020; Ronai &amp; Cross, 1998), as well as fat studies, I explore online social media weight loss narratives of members of the fat community, as well as the responses from the fat community. More specifically, using digital ethnographic methods, I examine how the weight loss narratives on Instagram and TikTok negotiate between hegemonic narratives and narratives emerging from the fat community.\n\nThe analysis of #weightlossjourney narratives shows how online activist communities can be splintered when versions of the master narrative the communities have collectively resisted become adapted by members of the community.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents findings from a larger mixed methods research project that examines the exposure, awareness and perceptions of young people to gambling marketing through and around live sport in two European countries. This paper is informed by the findings of an earlier set of focus groups with young people, but in this paper we focus on a qualitative analysis of gambling marketing communications around live sports events on Instagram from a number of major gambling companies. We collected a purposeful sample of posts, including image (N: 99) and video (N: 79), shared between October 2023 and early January 2024 from 7 major gambling brands’ Instagram accounts.\n\nThis study provides important insights into how gambling brands use Instagram, and potentially bypass existing regulations to prevent gambling communications being viewed by children and young people under 18 years. It furthers a growing body of evidence that evidences the extent of gambling marketing that young people are exposed to and how gambling companies exploit sports fandom to target both gamblers and non-gamblers alike and to (re)brand the gambling industry as a normal leisure industry.",

    "title": "CREATOR CARTELS AS EMERGENT PLATFORM GOVERNANCE",
    "abstract": "Creators frequently collaborate to share knowledge of and strategies for countering negative experiences of platform governance, including around issues of harassment, copyright enforcement, and censorship. In some cases, they have tried to craft more formal arrangements like creator unions, but these have failed to find stability in the platform economy, which operates differently than traditional labor-employer relationships. We point to a different form of collaboration that casts creators as economic rivals that often have directly competing interests rather than as workers with shared interests. To this end, we propose the concept of creator cartels, understood as contingent alliances between creators leveraged to produce beneficial policy and economic conditions. Taking up a critical media industry studies framework, we analyze the struggle between competing creator cartels invested in Twitch’s policies regarding gambling streams, especially the events that played out in September 2022 as anti-gambling streamers threatened a boycott, pro-gambling streamers leaked damaging information about their rivals, and Twitch ultimately decided to curb the forms of gambling creating conflict between many of its highest profile creators. The gambling saga shows that creators ally and collude with each other to produce mutually desirable outcomes, leveraging audiences and advertisers to influence the platform economy. We contend that creator cartels represent a novel organizational practice that both responds to and harnesses platform power, representing a promising area of inquiry for researchers interested in community governance and the conditions of platform labor.",

    "abstract": "Grounded in a participatory action research (PAR) framework, this project examines how queer individuals experience datafication and surveillance in their daily lives and respond to it. Building on existing literature on both datafication and LGBTQ+ digital practices, we address the tensions around visibility, invisibility and hypervisibility that emerge in queer people’s encounters with the datafied gaze. The research is based on three focus groups and a zine-making workshop, conducted with a small group of LGBTQ+ participants in Glasgow (UK) and involving different creative and participatory activities. We find that participants are aware of the amount of data that is collected about them, and they think that ‘opting out’ is largely unrealistic; they remark on how much this data collection renders them heavily visible online and specifically visible as queer. They highlight two paradoxes: first, that the enactment of safety policies by corporate digital platforms renders queer communities more visible, but not safer; second, that these platforms are sites for the development of queer knowledge but are also extracting it. Further, participants explain the tactics of invisibility they adopt to set boundaries to protect themselves; while they had not previously necessarily thought of them as responding to datafication, they became aware of this connection by participating in our research. Lastly, participants’ experiences show how knowledge about visibility and invisibility circulates within queer communities, leading to mutual learning. By adopting a PAR approach, our project not only documents participants’ experiences but also invites them to co-create empowering knowledge about datafication and surveillance.",

    "abstract": "The paper addresses the job experiences of expatriate and remote workers in the Czech game industry through their evaluation of its negative and positive features. The Czech game industry is divided between the video game field of smaller indie teams and the dominant industry incumbents, drawing from the same indie ethos. By using the push-pull migration model, both positive and negatively perceived qualities of the Czech game industry are discussed, complemented by the concept of boundaryless careers to address virtual connections to this production environment by remote workers. Method of repeated semi-structured interviews was employed to cover industry developments in a state of constant flux. 28 participants, mostly belonging to the triad of programmers, artists and designers were interviewed, with 14 from Eastern Europe and 14 from the West (i.e., Western Europe and North and South America). Respondents were pulled to the Czech game industry due to it being highly diversified into many mid-sized companies. However, they were met with shock factors, pushing them to move to other industries. Among them were discrepancies between indie and industrial qualities. Many studios had long-existing live service products, using outdated proprietary engines. Higher company structures were inaccessible due to being occupied by local leads. Similar contention appeared with remote workers, undermining the notion of boundaryless careers void of cultural influences. The Czech game industry was, likewise, evaluated as non-developed concerning labour inclusivity or diversified portfolios of games, with the risk of falling behind in the highly competitive and transnational video game field.",

    "abstract": "In Drill music, Chicago’s subgenre of Gangsta rap, Black male gang-affiliated recording artists (Drillers) often distribute content on social media platforms to solidify the authenticity of their song lyrics and music videos and validate their own embeddedness in gang territories. Using content analysis of two prominent Drillers’ vlogs, this study examines how YouTube channels serves as important intermediaries to not only circulate one’s music but provide Drillers a valuable reputation management tool. Results of this analysis suggests there are three primary ways that Drillers relate audiences: “signifying” (using humor to discredit a rival’s accusations and appear unbothered), “calling bluffs” (threatening or challenging a rival to retaliate by inviting them to their physical location) and cross referencing (calling attention to private information that contradicts one’s public image through storytelling). These findings show that though publicly crafting violent personas remains central in Black male youth gaining visibility in the corporate rap music industry, through social media entertainment, there are newer and riskier labor practices required for Black male youth seeking to self-authenticate street reputations, monetize, and create community around personas communicated within their music.",

    "title": "RECIPROCAL PLATFORM LABOUR IN THE NIGERIAN SOCIAL MEDIA VIDEO INDUSTRY",
    "abstract": "This paper explores how content creators in the Nigerian social media video industry navigate the economic, infrastructural, and cultural logics of digital platforms through practices of reciprocal labour. As is the case in many global contexts, the economic formalization of social media platforms, such as YouTube, Facebook, and TikTok, have enabled the emergence of for-profit social media video production in Nigeria. This paper focuses on the under-studied intersection of platform logics and labour relations in this industry. Drawing on 10 semi-structured interviews with Nigerian content creators, combined with analysis of the domestic trade press, we observe that creators struggle to generate visibility in a highly saturated social media landscape. This visibility imperative is not unique to Nigeria. What sets Nigeria apart, however, is the local political economy of video production, which translates into high production costs, which are offset by orchestrating practices of informally organised reciprocal labour. Nigeria thus provides a relevant perspective to ongoing debates in platform research that seek more regional specificity and seek to decentre the Global North as their point of reference. To heed that call, the specific labour practices we highlight, those of reciprocal labour, reflect the broader informal economies and traditional kinship norms in Nigeria. Exploring this mode of work showcases the intersections among creative labour and cultural dynamics in a given national context vis-à-vis the unifying business models and centralized governance frameworks of platform companies.",

    "abstract": "Over the past fifteen years Instagram has industrialised and platformised the everyday practices of creating and sharing digital images. Our posts and stories are both an archive of our lives and visual practices, but also part of the historical process of assembling image data sets for training machine vision systems. This paper presents the final part of a multi-year project where we use a combination of cultural and computational methods to explore the relationships between our everyday image-making practices and the algorithmic models of Instagram (Authors). We present findings from a study with 25 participants who have used Instagram for five or more years as part of their professional or creative practices. Participants downloaded and donated their complete archive of Instagram posts and stories. We then printed out 500 images from their profile as photographs and clustered their entire archive using our purpose-built machine vision system. In a co-analysis interview participants scrolled back through their Instagram profile, narrating changes in their practices and the platform over time. They then manually sorted the images printed from their archive and explored a visualisation of the algorithmic clustering of their images. Through this process of co-analysis we elicit the algorithmic imaginary of users and develop an intimate platform biography of how their practices are entangled with platform interfaces and algorithmic models.",

    "abstract": "Children’s finances are increasingly datafied through the emergence and development of applications for managing chores, saving, and spending. These finance apps incorporate features for both parents and children, enabling the setting and tracking of chores, the payment of allowances or pocket money, as well as supporting and managing children’s saving and spending habits.\n\nThe paper draws on and contributes to children’s financial socialisation and digital platform studies. This paper offers a novel contribution to these fields, applying the concept of datafication to children’s financial lives through a feature analysis of children’s finance apps. The feature analysis reviews information in Appstore descriptions, company websites, and product reviews to identify and map the range of features spread across these apps.\n\nOur analysis considers three emergent themes in which these apps are significantly impacting children’s financial lives: management of child household labour; mediation of children’s financial agency; and datafication of children’s economic participation.\n\nWe argue that the data produced by child finance apps simultaneously enables increased agency and control of children’s financial lives by initiating a lifelong digital trace.",

    "abstract": "As the Covid-19 pandemic spread globally, activist-led mutual aid efforts quickly emerged all over the world to help people access food and other basic necessities. Mutual aid activists relied on multi-layered digital practices to coordinate their efforts, largely by employing corporate digital technologies. In conversation with the literature on digital activism and drawing on 40 interviews with activists in the US, Italy and the UK, in this paper I examine how Covid-19 mutual aid complicates our understanding of the intersection of activism and digital technologies and of the online/offline divide. I show that contradictory experiences of the digital marked this wave of solidarity activism. First, while mutual aid was fully digital, especially given the necessity to organize while physically distancing, it was also embodied, because activists physically had to come together to prepare and distribute food and PPE. At the same time, there was also a new appreciation for digital-only activism as an equally valid form of engagement. Second, some mutual aid groups adopted very sophisticated tech-enabled systems, which required significant labor to manage and had a steep learning curve. Other groups, however, relied on less sophisticated tech practices (e.g. Whatsapp chats and phone calls). Even in a moment of heightened centrality of digital communication, such as the pandemic, the offline was still crucial. I argue that we can make sense of these somewhat contradictory aspects through activists’ commitment to care as overarching principle, which oriented them towards developing more inclusive movements, built on overlapping modalities of activism.",

    "abstract": "The government of India, in 2014, launched a flagship programme called Digital India, with a vision to transform India into a ‘digitally empowered society and knowledge economy’. A similar intention is reflected in another initiative called BharatNet. The USO Fund was established with the fundamental objective of providing access to telegraph services, including mobile services, broadband connectivity and ICT infrastructure creation in rural and remote areas.\n\nHowever, it is interesting to note that India has also been notorious at shutting down the internet. In Access Now’s report (2021), India has consistently raked number one, in the total number of hours spent under internet shutdown. In India, shutdowns have occurred during citizen protests like the anti- CAA protests in late 2020, and early 2021, and the Farmers Protest in 2021.\n\nWhen we look at these two actions by the government- one, to digitise governance and provide connectivity to all citizens to digitally empower them allow for the participation in networked economy; and two, to disrupt these very connections when citizens use networks to express dissent.\n\nIn this paper I take a closer look at the policy documents and the building of information infrastructure that is written into it. While also studying how infrastructure gets suspended during dissenting movements led by citizens. I use the case of the two protests to understand this disruption. Using newspaper analysis and interviews, I examine how infrastructure gets denied and disrupted to citizens when digital networks are used in ways that are unintended by the government.",

It comprehensively documents the colonialistic nature of the internet and Western scholarship in perpetuating racial (cyber)bullying. Furthermore, the study experiments with the idea of $2 and its application to transform the internet into a race-sensitive industry.\n\nThe study bridges the gap in racially sensitive, decolonial research on (Cyber)Bullying by involving those affected as knowledge-holders in Creative Participatory Action Research. The findings advance AfroGreek youth's proclamation of social media as a breeding ground for racism and how their proactive participation can help reshape the internet. It also results in developing Critical Consciousness as mapped out through the knowledge-holders' involvement in Critical Action, Political Self-Efficacy, and Critical Reflection.\n\nThe output actively contributes to creating impactful internet-based interventions and towards a more inclusive and informed societal framework.

    "abstract": "Scholarly attention is increasingly paid to the dynamic and embedded ways in which third-party tracking has become widespread in the mobile ecosystem. Much of this research has focused almost exclusively on Android applications in Google Play and their respective infrastructures of data capture, even though Apple and their App Store have a significant market share. To examine Apple’s ecosystem and to overcome the challenge of opening and inspecting large quantities of apps, we have explored the role that a large language model (LLM) can play in enabling this process? We have opted to use Chat GPT-4 because of how it has been designed to assist humans in both interacting and understanding code. We therefore ask: Can Chat-GPT assist scholars interested in Apple’s mobile ecosystem through the auditing of Apple app (IPA) files?\n\nThe outcomes of the explorative study include 1) an evaluation of Chat-GPT4 as an assistant for reading code at scale as well as its potential for automating processes involved in future app monitoring and regulation; 2) a deep dive into the shortcomings of Chat-GPT4 when it comes to interventions into the mobile ecosystems; and 3) a discussion of ethical issues involved in harnessing LLM for forwarding a research agenda around Apple’s otherwise understudied ecosystem. Our exploration aims to evaluate a methodological intervention that could bring more observability into an otherwise closed ecosystem that promises the preservation of end-user privacy, without any meaningful external oversight.",

Through case studies and thematic analysis, we showcase moments of regulatory inconsistency that are constitutive of how Twitch manages harm. Our analysis identifies contexts, temporalities, and violence as critical themes for identifying Twitch’s inconsistent moderation. We offer a playbook for better understanding live streaming platform governance as an iterative process which frequently targets vulnerable streamers.\n\nWe applied thematic analysis to two case studies to document how regulatory inconsistencies are directed at historically marginalized streamers. These cases include Twitch’s response to: 1) Kai Cenat’s impromptu community meet-up which was labeled a riot by the NYPD and 2) When Twitch modified their clothing and attire policy three times in one month to curtail the so-called ‘topless meta’, where a handful of women staged their cleavage to imply full nudity and optimize viewer engagement.",

    "abstract": "The question as to the most apt regulatory model to apply to the internet is one that occupies legislators, policymakers and courts around the world. This question was recently debated in two diametrically opposed judgments by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth and the Eleventh Circuit, triggered by challenges to the Texas and Florida ‘anti-online censorship’ laws. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit likened platforms to common carriers, disputed that their content curation amounts to First Amendment protected speech, and upheld the constitutionality of the Texas law. The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit rejected platforms’ characterisation as common carriers. It argued that their content moderation decisions are First Amendment protected editorial judgements and declared the Florida law unconstitutional. These judgments did not address the closely linked, and equally vexed question whether users should be able to assert their free speech rights against social media platforms. In Germany, this question has been fought in a multitude of court cases, and has divided courts and commentators alike. The pending Supreme Court judgment and a possible German Constitutional Court verdict on the power of platforms to moderate users’ speech are likely to decisively shape the future of the internet. This paper proposes to contribute to this debate by adopting a comparative constitutional methodology to test, first, the historical analogies between old and new media employed in the Florida and Texas cases, and secondly, the limits of regulating social media platforms by human rights.",

    "title": "PLATFORMIZATION INTERMEDIARIES: OPTIMIZING NEWS FOR PLATFORMS IN INDIA",
    "abstract": "Platformization of news, and the resultant concerns for publishers, have led to the rise and formalization of a network of intermediaries that mediate between news businesses and large distribution platforms in India. These intermediaries facilitate and broker interactions between news publishers and platforms by providing AI/ML tools and algorithmic expertise on news production, distribution, and monetization. This paper locates and conceptualizes them as platformization intermediaries, highlighting their role in reshaping cultural economies and practices into platform-optimized models. Platformization intermediaries leverage certified partnerships with major platforms thereby assisting in integrating platform infrastructure, funding and governance models into the digital news industry.\n\nTaking a political economy approach, this study critically examines the services and market dynamics of a range of platformization intermediaries in the news industry in India. Further, interviews with these actors in India unpack the implications on news publishers and the public interest value of news. This paper draws focus onto these emerging and influential actors aiding the platformization of news. It highlights their role in translating platforms' algorithmic and economic priorities into the human and social practices of news-making, and in reinforcing platform dependencies within the digital news industry.",

    "abstract": "The paper explores small-scale entrepreneurship on the early web, specifically identifying socio-economical practices of local/regional business in the Netherlands during the emergence of the new economy in the mid-90s and early 2000s. The new economy has been described in prior research as not only a novel, financial system but also as a cultural shift. Public media highlight the widespread optimism and subsequent disillusionment of the dot-com era; a period in which many traditional local/regional businesses migrated to the digital realm. In the Netherlands, a push is notable from ideological initiatives and state actors to make the internet accessible and functional for everyone. One can identify an interesting mix of neoliberalism, commercialism, and individualism, as well as everydayness and amateurism that created the backdrop against which local/regional industries took their businesses online for the first time. Following a grassroots approach and a mixed methodology, including computational analysis and content examination of archived websites, the research identifies the integration of domestic and commercial spheres on early websites, as well as a shift towards more professionalized e-business strategies over time. The paper contributes to the field by theorizing small-scale entrepreneurship in the move of local/regional businesses onto the web, offering a methodological framework for archival exploration, and enriching the historiography of the Dutch public web and the new economy from a bottom-up perspective. By foregrounding local/regional perspectives, it aims to provide a cultural-historical understanding of the web and encourages comparative analysis between under-studied narratives and dominant interpretations in the field of Internet History.",

    "title": "SEX AS/AND/ON SOCIAL MEDIA",
    "abstract": "Sex is central to the internet. It exists everywhere online and yet is everywhere constrained, sanitized, normalized, and invisibilized. This panel will investigate the ways in which sex seeps, spills, and oozes across boundaries, both online and off, despite efforts to control and limit its impact beyond consumer capitalism. Author 1 examines online ‘gooning’ communities, oriented around prolonged masturbation sessions to multiple streams of pornography. Gooners build community around the fetishization and roleplaying of porn addiction, but simultaneously produce a problematic queerness that reifies some elements of heteronormativity. Author 2 examines the ways that Generative AI imagines queerness, probing AI systems by asking them to imagine the figure of the ‘twink’. The end result is “glitchcraft,” which refers to creative practices of engagement that underscore the excitatory enchantments of generative AI, their frustrating constraints, and the accidents–exploited or serendipitous–that might result. Authors 3, 4, and 5 examine alternative social media aimed specifically at enabling users to engage in sexual expression. They document both the affordances of these platforms for creating sex-positive and kink-friendly online spaces, and their constraints, as they introduce new norms, and thus new forms of exclusion and marginalization. Author 6 examines anal sex practices as mediated by gay hook-up apps like Grindr and shows how these apps increasingly mediate larger portions of gay men’s everyday lives. Grindr inflects the way they imagine, propose, seek out, and react to a diverse spectrum of anal activities (such as fisting, spanking, caressing, and rimming).",

    "title": "MIXED FEELINGS: THE PLATFORMISATION OF MOODS AND VIBES",
    "abstract": "Over the past few years, digital platforms from different sectors have started tailoring their content to both respond to and create certain moods, vibes, or ‘ambiences’. In so doing, they become ‘atmospheric architectures’ (Bohme 2020), entering the industry of emotional regulation. I posit that a critical-phenomenological framework is a productive epistemological, theoretical, and methodological resource for scrutinising this shift precisely at the intersection of embodied affect and the political economy of platformisation. By critical phenomenology I mean a phenomenological disposition that is not blind to the social, technical, and political environment in which it is situated (Couldry and Kallinikos 2018). This paper also dialogues with recent discussions both in public discourse and the relevant scholarship about a latent change in our digital sociality, in which the values for which we once celebrated digital media are now being replaced by a different mode of consumption, fruition, and attention (John 2022). Using the contemporary case studies to flesh out these new formations in emotional capitalism (Illouz 2007), I propose that we are entering a new stage in programmed sociality (Bucher 2018), focused less on sharing, connecting, or engaging, and more on the platformisation of the merely felt. The examination of this phenomenon demands us to acknowledge the significance of those mixed feelings – which involve an interplay of the affective and the computational – and of their entanglement with a profit-oriented corporate technoscape.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, a specific type of influencers has notoriously popularised – misogynist influencers, with Andrew Tate standing out as the most prominent one. While popular and networked misogyny (Banet-Weiser &amp; Miltner, 2016) and various parts of the manosphere, together with related conceptualisations have been well studied, Andrew Tate and other misogynists as (aspirational) influencers have received little academic attention. This study will focus on these aspirational misogynist content creators, exploring the circulation of their misogynist content on social media, the professionalisation and monetisation of misogyny, and lastly, how these communities keep registering ‘under the radar’ (Abidin, 2021).\n\nUsing a mixed-method approach, this study will focus on misogynist influencers in Estonia. Digital ethnography (Pink et al., 2016; Markham, 2017) will be the dominant method employed, exploring the strategic circulation, professionalisation (Greenwood, 1966; Trice, 1993) and monetisation aspects of misogynist content on various social platforms. Secondly, a combination of qualitative content analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006) and socio-semiotic visual analysis (Kress &amp; van Leeuwen, 2020) is used to study the textual and visual methods of social steganography (boyd &amp; Marwick, 2011). Very preliminary results show that in the process of professionalisation, ideologies of masculinities are created, each of which emphasises different aspects (e.g., financial, physical, sexual, etc). The results of this study are crucial for understanding the circulation and professionalisation of misogynistic content in the context of networked misogyny (Banet-Weiser &amp; Miltner, 2016) – an important phenomenon related to the influencer industry.",

    "abstract": "To move beyond the framework of platform labor as either exploitative or empowering, this panel considers intricate forms of self-reinvention within the realm of cultural work. Our inquiries into the labor subjectivities that emerge from processes of adaptation to platform work are oriented around the cultures, practices, and ideals of social media influencer careers.\n\nThese papers discuss the mechanisms by which different actors within the influencer industry navigate constantly changing organizational environments, a crucial aspect of what it takes for them to thrive across industries and labor markets. This involves reinventing themselves in an ever-changing technological environment, coping with being subjects of permanent control and evaluation by customers and employers, and making sense of their activities in highly-commercial environments. Consequently, notions of labor and value remain in a continuous state of contestation and redefinition within the influencer industry. The papers span topics ranging from visibility and authenticity to the reinvention of work through platform engagements, as well as the role intermediaries play in the quantification and qualification of influencer activities.",

    "abstract": "Despite the rise in commercial applications of LLMs, scholarship has neglected an in-depth appreciation of the free contribution of subjects communicative social action as the engine of training data production as a necessary moment in digital processes of valorisation. This issue was popular in the analyses of the post-operaist tradition of free labour, but have since been missing in examinations of more recent technological developments, specifically in what concerns AI. Although the work of Baudrillard is semi-frequently evoked in descriptive critical assessments of new technologies, there is little integration of Baudrillard's work in contemporary studies of AI. This paper aims at contributing in this direction, by showcasing the utility of Baudrillard’s concepts of simulation, subject function, masses, and the social, for an understanding of immaterial free labour in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs).\n\nDrawing from the recent phenomena of the sale of Reddit communications content to OpenAI as training data, I propose the notion of digital common as the pre-trained collected and recorded data of actual human communication through digital systems. I propose the framework of the subject function as expounded by Baudrillard, in both its individual and collective aspects, as a necessary conjuncture to understand how commercial applications of conversational LLMs fit into the broader landscape of digital political economy. I suggest that the role played in this specific application derives from the appropriation of freely generated user-data as constituting the digital common and as carrying a specific conception of subjectivity as functional.",

    "title": "HOW FACT-CHECKERS ARE BECOMING MACHINE LEARNERS: A CASE OF META’S THIRD PARTY PROGRAMME",
    "abstract": "A recent development in the field of fact-checking is what some scholars call the “debunking turn” in which fact-checking organisations move from fact-checking expressions of politicians and public figures to checking claims made on social media. A main driver of this change is the proliferation of a paid program initiated by Meta, where fact-checkers check and label claims on the platform in exchange for monetary remuneration. This paper draws on interviews with and fieldwork amongst fact-checkers who are or have been part of the Meta partnership. Based on the empirical insights we argue that the human-machine assemblage in fact-checking is (1) enabling a move beyond the ‘debunking turn’ by turning journalists into ‘machine learners’ and (2) cements a ‘politics of demarcation’ in which public contestation over public facts is diminished and moved into networked infrastructures.\n\nWith this argument, the paper highlights an additional aspect of the platformisation of journalism, as the labelling and claim-checking work of journalists now also enables large tech platforms to expand technical infrastructures that commodify journalistic work by turning it into training data aimed at improving their ML systems and algorithms. This enables platforms to move further beyond their current market role, as they also participate in the further industrialisation and standardisation of fact-checking. As large tech companies become industry leaders in the provision of ML systems, for example, for fact-checking, the need to understand what politics they produce equally increases, as they become integral in the production of democratic ideals of citizens and public debate.",

    "abstract": "Originating as supplementary firms that operate in and around YouTube’s advertising infrastructure, Multichannel Networks (MCNs) have become a renewed form of cultural intermediaries shaping platform-based cultural production (Lobato 2016; Craig and Cunningham 2019). The emergence of MCNs represents “an opportunity to revisit some elements of the theory base around intermediaries and update it for the platform economy” (Lobato 2016, 350). To hold with this appeal, this research investigates MCNs’ operations in the context of China’s e-commerce livestreaming industry and rethinks its position within the complicated social commerce landscape based on a three-month participatory observation (from December 2021 to March 2022) taken place in an MCN organization (pseudonymised as W company) in Guangzhou, China. For providing a more grounded analysis, 15 in-depth interviews with media professionals working in MCNs (within and outside W company) or working in the e-commerce livestreaming sector as content creator, advertiser, or manufacturer were also included. I employ the concepts of “trade stories” (Caldwell, 2008) and “industry lore” (Havens, 2014) to describe MCNs professionals’ meaning-making practices when navigating a complex network of actors including platforms, livestreamers, brands and retailers. Whilst MCNs are important “platform complementors” (Poell, Nieborg and Duffy 2022, 11) fulfilling an intermediary role in compliance with platforms’ commercial logics, practitioners also struggle to keep up with the changing business models. The deeply integrated components between cultural production and marketing activities in MCNs’ work are supported and determined by the digital platforms they operate around, making the MCNs’ intermediary roles limited, contingent, and oftentimes failing.",

    "title": "SEXUAL CONTENT MODERATION",
    "abstract": "Despite popular understandings of the internet teeming with pornography and offering safe harbor for LGBTQIA+ content, social media platforms are cracking down on sexual expression and sex work online. This panel examines the role that content moderation and platform governance play in censoring sexual expression online and the communities that engage in it. It documents the impact that censorship, banning, shadowbanning, and demonetization have on internet communities and highlights potential alternatives for platform governance. Author 1 examines the pole dancing community on Instagram and the impact that banning, shadowbanning, and content takedowns have on its constituents. In particular, she examines the impact that Instagram’s new ‘Account Status’ feature has had on pole dancers’ labor to manage their visibility on the platform. Author 2 examines the role that early cisheteronormative content moderation practices have had on shaping the algorithmic imaginary of Queer TikTok. He shows that it has resulted in ‘algorithmic folk remedies’ – like ‘algospeak’ – that are still used by Queer TikTokers in attempts to avoid demonetization, shadowbanning, and/or deplatforming. Authors 3 and 4 examine erotic webcam streamers and platforms and document the ways in which webcam platform policies work to discipline the labor of erotic webcam streamers. Content moderation is leveraged to keep streamers on the platform and capture their revenue streams. Author 5 examines how new and emerging independent small-scale platforms and cooperatives moderate sexual content. She documents the incredible difficulty of maintaining an alternative, sex positive, business model in the current political and economic landscape.",

    "abstract": "Many theorists of the information economy have argued that digitization has resulted in a “speeding up” of our experience of time (i.e. Gleick, 1999). This work contends that for many, especially those with less power, the techno-utopian vision characterized by datafication and Artificial Intelligence (AI) instead produces a state of prolonged waiting. Drawing from two long-term ethnographic studies examining the production and implementation phases of data-driven technologies in China and U.S., we demonstrate how the “long-standing but mistaken belief, hegemonic in Silicon Valley, that automation will deliver us more time” (Wajcman, 2019) belies the highly stratified temporal impacts of automation, datafication, and AI. Specifically, this work uses AI training and the homeless services system as case studies to reveal the politics of waiting; despite the promise of data-driven technologies, pervasive waiting serves as evidence of an enduring residue—an unequal power structure. Our findings also suggest that the technologies which mediated the experience of waiting in the first, more immediate sense, also impacted how people conceptualize the future.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have raised questions about the changing nature of work. Research has started to investigate how this technology affects labor markets and might replace or augment different types of jobs. Beyond their economic implications in the world of work, there are important sociological questions about how LLMs connect to subjective evaluations of work, such as the prestige and perceived social value of different occupations, and how the widespread use of LLMs perpetuate often biased views on the labor markets reflected in their training datasets. Despite initial research on LLMs’ world model, their inherent biases, attitudes and personalities, we lack evidence on how LLMs themselves evaluate occupations as well as how well they emulate the occupational evaluations of human evaluators. We present a systematic comparison of GPT-4 occupational evaluations with those from an in-depth, high-quality survey in the UK context. Our findings indicate that GPT-4 and human scores are highly correlated across all ISCO-08 major groups for prestige and social value. At the same time, GPT-4 substantially under- or overestimates the occupational prestige and social value of many occupations, particularly emerging occupations as well as stigmatized or contextual ones. In absolute terms, GPT-4 scores are more generous than those of the human respondents. Our analyses show both the potentials and risks of using LLM-generated data for occupational research.",

    "abstract": "Snapchat has long been a pivotal space for youth digital intimate and sexual cultures, as well as gendered and sexual risks and harms. Despite being one of the most widely used social media platforms among youth in England and America, there has been little in-depth research that connects Snapchat’s unique features and affordances with an analysis of young users’ practices, behaviours, and experiences on the platform. Responding to this gap, our paper explores our mixed-methods research findings on British young people’s diverse social, sexual, and intimate experiences on Snapchat. We explore how Snapchat’s unique features, such as disappearing images (“Snaps”), algorithmic friend recommendations (“Quick Adds”), and user engagement metric (\"Snapscores”), form new conditions and environments for young people’s experiences of digital courtship, sexting, and sexual and gender-based violence. In addition, we contextualise youth user experiences with Snapchat’s community guidelines, safeguards, and protections for youth, which we argue fail to understand or address the actual lived experiences of youth users. We conclude with recommendations for interventions dedicated to increasing platform-specific digital literacy (particularly for parents, policymakers, and educators), and preventing and responding to youth experiences of online gendered risks and harm—while upholding their digital and sexual rights.",

    "title": "MEASURING MISOGYNY: DEPP V HEARD AND THE LIMITS OF ATOMISTIC CONTENT MODERATION",
    "abstract": "Over the past decade, social media companies have come under increasing pressure to make their platforms safer for women. While they have made some changes to their policies and design, their foundational approach to content moderation has remained largely the same. Platforms continue to focus on identifying, assessing and responding to individual pieces of violating content, like overt hate speech, direct threats, and doxxing. This approach is ill-equipped to deal with structural harms like misogyny, which cannot be understood in terms of isolated instances, but instead as part of a continuum. ‘Everyday’ experiences of sexism and misogyny form part of the same dynamic as the more widely recognised, extreme forms of violence, but existing tools for identifying this type of harmful but not prohibited content are extremely limited.\n\nThis paper presents the preliminary findings of a study that investigates how everyday misogyny manifests on social media platforms, using the online discourse around the $2 trial as a case study. We use a combination of topic modelling and in-depth qualitative analysis of content, informed by the literature on believability and doubt in cases of domestic and sexual violence. We find that everyday misogyny is widespread, and manifests partly in double-standards and double-binds in the expectations imposed on Amber Heard. We aim to use these findings to develop new methods and frameworks for understanding misogyny in aggregate.",

    "abstract": "Companies that collect personal data have spent billions of dollars complying with a patchwork of global data privacy laws since 2018. In response, a nascent privacy tech industry has emerged, consisting of tech startups, consultants, investors, platforms, and domain experts that collectively help companies build compliant data governance programs. This study recognizes the key role of translating the law into software products by asking: how is expertise defined and encoded in the privacy tech industry? I draw on fieldwork from a broader ethnographic study of the privacy tech industry to identify three findings. First, the privacy tech industry constitutes a networked arena of relations structured by partitioning professional expertise across technical, legal, and operational domains. Second, technical expertise in the privacy tech industry is often tenuous and contingent, which could be strengthened by applying scrutiny and deliberation to evaluate the content of expertise rather than its performance. Third, boundaries of expertise are increasingly encoded in compliance software, perpetuating performative rather than scrutinized expertise. At scale, these products promote managerial processes that manifest as checkbox compliance, codifying splintered accountability and undermining the spirit of data privacy law. I argue that technology policy would benefit from scrutinizing the contents of expertise, inviting agonistic deliberation, and including lay expertise to counter the technocratic structural relations of a surveillance economy.",

    "abstract": "The humanitarian sector is known for its reliance on technological pilots as part of the digitisation and datafication of aid operations. Drawing on ten years of research in the aid sector, this paper outlines a new type of technological experimentation which I term surreptitious experimentation. This type of experimentation is possible as digital technologies and practices become enmeshed with the infrastructures of aid. This process of infrastructuring allows for a continuous flow of experimentation, which is not named as such, and which operates in the infrastructural background, and therefore remains hidden – yet in plain sight. Surreptitious experiments take place outside the laboratory, without clear boundaries, meaningful consent or processes of accountability. In so doing, surreptitious experiments compound the power asymmetries of humanitarianism with significant risks and harms for some of the world’s most vulnerable people.",

    "title": "MONETIZING QUEERBAITING: BOYFRIEND DAILY CHECK-INS AS A STRATEGY TO ENGAGE QUEER FANDOM",
    "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the increasingly prominent phenomenon of queerbaiting in Chinese social media, which is to bait and lure the queer audience in for an existing media text, through queer representations including erotica. With the development of streaming media and its innovative application in e-commerce especially during the COVID-19, social media platforms such as Douyin have become a rich site for economic and cultural analyses. This project is significant that since the Chinese government and platforms regulate queer content in a seemingly strict way, for example, those who express ‘abnormal’ sexual orientation will be banned. However, queerbaiting as a genre of media production still finds its way through short videos and gets away with tightened regulatory regimes. At the same time, Douyin’s huge monetization potential with e-commerce in various formats (e-gift-giving, sponsorship, advertorials) makes queerbaiting as a marketing strategy an indispensable part of Chinese social media that attracts scholarly and market attention. Furthermore, most queer content creators would self-present on the Douyin as straight especially when they engage with queerbaiting strategies, making both their media production sustainable in a tight regulatory regime and data accessible for my research. The study emphasizes a departure from fan-centred queerbaiting research and instead examines from the producer's perspective, dissecting the actions and goals of influencers to attract followers, monetize and profit by manipulating audience interpretations and queer imaginations as their strategies, at the same time, to navigate and protect themselves from homophobic regulatory and social environments.",

    "abstract": "This paper contributes to the critical study of platformisation and deplatformisation of software development and how networked infrastructures commodify, configure and challenge relations between code, coders, communities, technologies, investors and industries. It explores the political economic and cultural dimensions of the platformisation of software development in the news industry with a case study on Github. It then examines how resistance to platformisation and counter-mobilisations in the context of free software, art and activism surface alternative arrangements for socialising software development imbued with other logics.\n\nThe paper proposes the concept of “connective coding” to characterise GitHub’s dominant modes of configuration and capitalisation of public repositories and profiles and the power relations that underpin it, whereby public software and project development work becomes assets in the platform economy that have the potential to be variously capitalised by the platform and its associated third-party ecosystem. This institutional perspective is complemented by an analysis of newsroom industry practices mediated by the platform and how GitHub modulates visibility in this space.\n\nThe second part of the paper reflects on efforts to deplatformise software development by examining various responses and counter-mobilisations partly prompted by Microsoft’s controversial purchase of Github. It reviews the development of alternative coding spaces such as Gogs, Gitea, Radicle and Forgejo, and the values, practices, concerns and communities associated with them. In doing so it contributes to conference themes pertaining to political economy, labour and resistance in digital industries.",

    "title": "GLOBAL PERSPECTIVES ON PLATFORMS AND CULTURAL PRODUCTION",
    "abstract": "While digital platforms have reconfigured the institutions and practices of cultural production around the globe, current research is dominated by studies that take as their reference point the Anglo-American world--and, to a lesser extent--China (Cunningham &amp; Craig 2019; Kaye et al. 2021; Poell et al. 2021; Zhao 2019). Aside from totalizing theories of platform imperialism (Jin, 2013), the “rest of the world” has thus received relatively scant attention. Consequently, central concepts in the study of platform-based cultural production bear a strong imprint of Western institutions, infrastructures, industries, discourses, and cultural practices. US-based research, in particular, has informed how we understand and subsequently theorize notions of precarity, labor, governance, authenticity, gender, creativity, diversity, and autonomy in a platform environment. We can’t simply apply these concepts to local cultures of production in other parts of the world. There is bound to be friction, as this panel will demonstrate, between how labor, precarity, and governance are understood in the Anglo-American world and the lived experiences of platform-dependent cultural labor in Latin America, Southern and Eastern Europe, and East Asia.\n\nConcerns about Western-dominated research and theory are, of course, by no means novel. Post-colonial and decolonial theorists have long criticized the dominance and universalism of Western theory, pointing to the continuation of colonial knowledge-power relations (Chakrabarty 2009; Chen 2010; Escobar 2018; Mignolo 2012). Moreover, there have been numerous calls to decolonize (Glück 2018; Willems &amp; Mano 2016) and de-westernize (Curran &amp; Park 2000; Khiabany 2003) media studies and, more recently, production and platform studies (Bouquillion 2023; Bulut 2022; Zhang &amp; Chen 2022). That being said, in practice, the US and Western Europe continue to function as the primary and often sole frame of reference in research on platforms and cultural production. In the light of these concerns, this panel aims to contribute to efforts to: 1) challenge universalism, 2) “provincialize” the US, and 3) multiply our frames of reference in the study of platforms and cultural production. Such a conceptual undertaking is especially vital as the cultural industries are at the heart of societal processes of meaning making (Hesmondhalgh 2018) and market activity.\n\nLet us unpack how the papers in this panel pursue this objective. The first paper develops a conceptual framework to expand our frames of reference for studying platforms and cultural production. Departing from epistemological universalism, it argues that “platforms”, “cultural production”, and the “local” need to be studied as dynamic configurations, characterized by crucial variations and correspondences across the globe. That is, in contemporary instances of creating cultural content, transnational platform markets, infrastructures, governance frameworks, and cultural practices become entangled with local political economies and cultural practices.\n\nExamining how such configurations take shape around the world, the next four papers in this panel focus on specific regions and modes of production, interrogating how local and transnational political economic relations and practices articulate each other. In this discussion, we pay specific attention to the notions of precarity, governance, and imaginaries.\n\nThe second paper reframes influencer precarity in a semi-peripheral context in the Balkans and emphasizes the relational basis of influencer agency, as influencers rely on family members and oft-mocked “Instagram husbands” to alleviate precarity. It thus offers insights into the local characteristics of algorithmic encounters with platforms by proposing the concept of platform lethargy. This concept speaks to an emotional response and deliberate refusal on the part of influencers to adapt to platform mandates. This refusal is rooted in algorithmic knowledge from the semi-periphery, where creators are cognizant of their position in a devalued platform market.\n\nThe third paper critically examines the intricate dynamics of creator culture, challenging the assumption of globally detached markets. Focusing on Latin American content creators in the United States, it explores how their aspirations intersect with the construction of the \"Latin American\" content creator dream. The study also scrutinizes the role of Content Service Organizations (CSOs) executives in shaping creator culture. Despite global portrayals, tensions emerge, revealing national market characteristics rooted in socio-cultural, linguistic, and regional norms.\n\nThe fourth paper examines how drama creatives, who work for streaming platforms, are globally connected and yet remain nationally restrained in terms of how they imagine work. Through the notion of platform ambiguity, the paper shows how streaming platforms negotiate with cultural producers by both enabling and restraining their work. Thus, it thus de-westernizes scholarship on platforms and cultural production by highlighting how drama makers are not only creative but also geopolitical subjects dependent on the state.\n\nThe last paper offers an alternative epistemological and ontological perspective on the state-platform-user configuration, where each actor works in alignment with others under the logic of governance. It uses a Chinese social media platform, Douyin, as a case to reveal how platforms rely on anthropomorphization to communicate with cultural producers and develop playful governance of China’s political and cultural environment.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates messaging by smaller businesses in the hair and beauty industries in South Africa who use targeted ads to promote products and services to Facebook and Instagram users in South Africa. These ads are currently not considered “political” ads, despite the fact that racialised notions of hair and beauty have played and continue to play a key role in white supremacist discourses in South Africa. Using the Facebook Ad Library, we obtained a purposive sample of ads posted to Meta platforms over a six month period (N=558) by 99 different advertisers whose ads matched the query “hair”. We review image-based adverts in this sample, asking how visual signifiers of gender and ethnicity address potential consumers and represent their hair. Multimodal content analysis was used with the aim of identifying current micro-targeting practices on the platforms. Our analysis of the messaging about hair in the ads found hegemonic racial ideologies and binary gendering in campaigns addressing ethnically differentiated audiences of women in SA. The relative absence of men from the messaging suggested that the burdens and pleasures of hair care and maintenance remain distinctly feminised while the hair industry is actively involved in production of gender. WoC were targeted with messaging which, at best, promoted a new aesthetic or promised to save money or time. At worst, it was promoting harmful products and perpetuating racialised discourses. Built on dataveillance, such micro-targeting may be fuelling feedback loops that further entrench the country’s extreme racialised inequality.",

    "abstract": "Industrial time and space produce marginalities and resistance: Queer time rejects linearity and potentiates alternate experiences (Halbertsam, 2005). Today, many experience phones or smartwatches as mediating temporal ruptures in daily lives (Mowlabocus, 2016), and hookup app industries monetise intimacies. Given permanent online connectivity, work and leisure are more porous than in a factory, yet corporate industries mediate marginal socialities. Industrious rural queers wrestle control of spatiotemporal intimacies from totalising platforms.\n\nThis study maps rural sexuality and hook-up app (dis)comfort and visualises whether hook-up contacts penetrate social networks. Seven semi-structured interviews took place in Finland. Three themes were determined: (in)visibility due to (fears of) marginalisation; categories and borders of app design inadequately reflecting indigenous/gendered, (neuro)queer, rural, linguistic, infrastructural and economic realities; and resisting spatiotemporal app logics.\n\nHistory has shown the rise of industry as precariously subject to queer temporal forces lacking predictable directions, ultimately declining. Nonetheless, emergent digital industries, such as queer hookup apps, re-attempt to totalise expression via universal logic. They inadequately account for the cultural, linguistic, neurodiverse, gender diverse, disabled, indigenous and local contexts of queer lives beyond major cities, just as clock-time undermined working labourers while empowering colonial interests. We hope to demonstrate the ingenuity of users in questioning and queering social norms, with the hope of building improved digital queer social worlds that do not fetishise queer bodies as visible yet unreacable products for capitalist consumption but rather facilitate spatiotemporal possibilities that fulfil rural, queer, digital, and social needs.",

    "abstract": "Rushes to adopt the latest technologies to the field of community moderation are generally inequitable for volunteer communities. The closed-door nature of product development at the majority of tech companies means that the logic underlying the creation of new features is opaque. What does this mean for those who want to equitably employ newer technologies in service of volunteer moderators? We present the development and deployment of the Wikimedia Foundation’s Automoderator product as a contemporary alternative to product development processes.\n\nWe focus on the collaborative process undertaken between the Moderator Tools product team at the Wikimedia Foundation, and volunteer moderator communities, to design and build Automoderator. Automoderator is an automated anti-vandalism tool, which uses a language-agnostic ML model that predicts the probability of an edit being reverted. The product team integrated volunteer feedback and direction on a continuous basis. This included the use of existing community-created tools to guide Automoderator's direction, the creation and dissemination of a spreadsheet-based testing tool, soliciting user feedback on a central project page, and integrating an extension to allow communities to control Automoderator's behavior directly. We conclude by discussing the limitations and trade-offs of this approach to product development.",

    "abstract": "Since its launch in 2011, the live streaming platform Twitch has continually expanded its mechanisms for monetizing interactions between content creators and their viewers. While numerous studies document the motivation of viewers (Sjöblom, et. al. 2017; Wulf, et. al. 2020), experiences of live streamers (Taylor, 2018; Sjöblom, et. al., 2019; Woodcock &amp; Johnson, 2019), and platform policy (Partin, 2020; Poell, et. al., 2022), an explanatory framework and a clear timeline of functional changes on Twitch is still missing. Tracking Twitch changes can shed light on what motivates them, and what is likely to influence the platform going forward.\n\nThe literature on Twitch platform policy focuses mainly on how the platform mimics features that were first introduced by users, a process Partin (2020) called “envelopment”. However, we argue that there are two important parallel mechanisms that motivate change. First, via competition, Twitch copies features from other platforms. Second, via realignment, Twitch meets user demands for changes on the platform. This process of strategic cooptation of features via envelopment, competition, and realignment, is what we call adaptive governance. It is this holistic approach of adaptive governance that remains a blind spot in the literature and which this article aims to give a first description of.",

    "abstract": "The world today is awash with narratives of artificial intelligence (AI) as an \"inevitable,\" \"unstoppable\" force destined to \"revolutionize\" society. Using the concept of \"entanglement\" from Black and Indigenous feminist science, technology, and society studies, we provide a critical examination of the AI industry's complex intersections with sociopolitical dynamics, technological determinism, and oppression. Instead of viewing AI advancement as a predetermined path, we show how this perspective is socially constructed and has dire consequences for the environment and society alike, especially for marginalized communities in the global and local Souths.\n\nUsing discourse analysis and critical quantitative techniques, we analyze the discourses surrounding AI, examining over 1,200 pieces of digital content to show how language shapes both technology's development and our collective imaginations. By tracing the ideological roots of AI back to colonial and eugenic practices, we demonstrate the industry's deep entanglement with interlocking systems of oppressions.",

    "abstract": "Content moderation comes with trade-offs and moral dilemmas, particularly for transnational platforms governing borderline content where the boundaries of acceptability are subject to debate. While extensive research has explored the legality and legitimacy of $2 in democratic contexts, few address the complexities of less-than-democratic developing nations. Through socio-legal analysis and controversy mapping of TikTok’s localised moderation in South and Southeast Asia, the study examines how major actors negotiate the shifting boundaries of online speech. The analysis reveals that neither the platform nor regional states effectively govern borderline content. Primarily, TikTok localises its moderation based on pragmatic necessity rather than moral obligations, intentionally sidestepping contentious political controversies. Governments demonstrate strong will to control online discourse, leveraging legal uncertainty to advance political interests. Local content governance thus always relies on vague rationales around securitisation and morality. The contradictory goals of (de)politicising borderline moderation seemingly counterbalance each other, yet in practice lead to an accountability vacuum without legitimate interests. Given the lack of normative common ground, the study highlights the significance of procedural justice and civic participation to mitigate rhetoric that rationalises imposition of speech norms hinging on imbalanced political power.",

    "abstract": "Using radio and podcast studies as its main scholarship areas, this paper will examine the potential for Virtual Reality (VR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to change podcasting both in how it is crafted and in how audiences consume podcasts. Focusing on the idea of intimacy this paper interrogates how this defining characteristic of “sound-based digital media” (Hilmes, 2013:44) may persist and evolve, particularly through conceptualizations of space and place, imagined and actual. In a landscape where podcasting is increasingly perceived by (mostly younger) audiences and creators to be a visual medium (Berry, 2023), I want to explore how intimacy may continue to be a defining characteristic of podcasting. In particular, and going well beyond just the aural or indeed beyond the combination of the visual and the aural, I want to understand what intimacy can mean when podcasting moves into the virtual reality immersive space.\n\nThis paper’s case study is the video version of episode 398 of the Lex Fridman Podcast, which is an interview with Facebook and Meta’s co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, titled 'First Interview in the Metaverse'. In the podcast, the two meet in the metaverse to discuss the new possibilities that this technology, in combination with AI, may open in the ways that humans communicate with each other through the internet. Looking at themes such as disembodiment, imagination and materiality, this paper examines what VR and AI technologies can mean for podcasting and the way audiences and podcasters may communicate and create meaning through them.",

    "abstract": "Since the 1980s, Chinese cities have been built based on the image of a mechanized city. Maçães perceives them as a product “in the age of mechanical reproduction”, repressing \"genuine spontaneity; the stirrings and desires of life”. However, with the increasing integration of digital and intelligent technologies in Chinese cities, smart cities with a new image are rising. They are imagined as organic entities, a human brain, namely \"City Bain\". The City Brain is anticipated to sense what happening in the city in real time and make overall decisions. More importantly, the organic smart city is expected to dedicate to serving the people.\n\nThese two contrasting images represent a shift in Chinese visions of intelligent technologies' role in society. In contrast to mechanic cities, the organic entities concerns more about citizens' role in an intelligent environment and how this intelligent environment reconfigures the governance mode. Then the questions are: What does this organic metaphor mean, why it has emerged, why it is so important that local government even made a regulation centering this metaphor?\n\nThrough the combination of the fieldwork and discourse analysis, this work studies the genealogy of the discursive developments of Chinese smart city metaphors. AS a result, this study identifies the hidden historical undertakings and societal strivings behind current metaphor of organic entity. This work also casts a light to the shift from mechanization to intelligentization in China, by analyzing and outlining the features of the intelligent transformation in China.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, I briefly recount the evolution in the use of the word ‘toggle,’ and build off it to theorize it as a concept.Today we know toggling as a verb, and the user interaction (UI) of switching between and moving across apps and activities. Prior to this, toggle was a noun that referred to fasteners on garments and on walls that held things in place. This evolution from a noun to a verb, helps attend to the fact that as people, we have always used our hands, heads, and objects to hold things together, as we switch between doing and being.\n\nTo theorize toggling, I will first detail my motivation, methods, and methodology. Then I will illustrate how toggling as a concept, enables reframing two dominant views on (1) how information is imagined to push users to do things and (2) how being a user, especially a consumer, is imagined to move us “out of touch.”\n\nToggling as a conceptual vessel places UI in this history of how our hands and fingers have interacted with surfaces of objects like buttons and made sense of the world. Placing interaction in our hands makes room for us as scholars to ask: how do people make sense of information and hold everything together as they switch between doing livelihood-care and being workers, consumers, business owners, householders and so on?",

    "title": "The Place of a Child on Platforms: Responsibilities, Obligations, and Expectations",
    "abstract": "This panel delves into the complex entanglement of children within our 'platform society,' spotlighting their roles amidst the dynamics of platformisation, datafication, and monetisation. It scrutinises the emergence of child influencers, mapping their integration and active participation within the influencer economy. This exploration underscores the critical intersection between childhood and platformization, highlighting the commodification and monetization practices shaping children's presence on platforms. The panel seeks to understand these practices across diverse contexts, including time, platforms, geographies, and cultures, emphasizing the multifaceted roles of children as consumers, producers, and actors. The panel also examines regulatory frameworks surrounding children on platforms, focusing on governance issues related to child labour, advertising, and platform liability. It navigates the tension between viewing children as 'becomings' in need of protection and as 'beings' with an agency, contributing to the discourse on platform governance and regulatory practices. Presenting a range of papers, the panel traverses topics from the monetization of children in influencer content on TikTok, to the offering of a child influencer taxonomy, to the influence of kidfluencers on young viewers' consumption behaviors. It critically assesses the impact of digital dashboards on parenting, illustrating how children's health, location, and well-being are intertwined with datafication logic. Collectively, these papers illuminate how the place of children online is contested, as they become embroiled in practices of monetisation, visibility, and datafication across platforms and infrastructures. Our panellists draw from their empirical and theoretical work to challenge these practices, emphasising their implications for platform governance and addressing how regulations can serve children's best interests.",

    "title": "INDUSTRIES OF INFRASTRUCTURAL FUTURES, AUTOMATED CULTURES, AND ALGORITHMIC DYNAMICS",
    "abstract": "We approach the conference topic of industry through four studies that explore a new media landscape where value and power are increasingly produced through the operalisation of machinic and affective relations and subjectivities. We explore technologies of automation, artificial intelligence and algorithmic regimes and the new possibilities for enacting and imagining political futures that they afford. The papers focus on four case studies: WeChat posts related to the Australian referendum for Indigenous voice to Parliament; perceptions of bias in texts generated by ChatGPT; TikTok videos of affective time management through curated playlists, and time synchronisation protocols used in industrial warehouses. These four cases reveal the ways in which automated media technologies enable complex interactions between humans and machines that impact practices of political subjectification, trust and notions of truth, and weave a particular relationship between affect, aesthetics and temporalities of labour.\n\nThe panel analyses the role of networks and algorithms in shaping the parameters of emerging forms of expression and participation that are enacted through the interrelation between users and digital platforms. The four papers adopt a platform- and infrastructure-specific research approach, building on research into the infrastructural turn in media studies (Plantin and Punathambekar 2019). Seeing media infrastructures as a complex arrangement of digital platforms, databases, algorithms and protocols, we look at the political effects produced by these infrastructures. These effects are analysed in their material situatedness in the logic of the particular digital platform.\n\nIn their paper, Toija Cinque and Allan Jones illuminate the interplay between AI agency, human cognition, and digital media platforms, thereby contributing to discourse on ethical AI use, sociotechnical systems, and information integrity in the digital age. Their paper explores the interconnections between generative AI, digital platforms, and cognitive biases, striving to deepen our understanding of technology’s capacity to engender a truth-centric, empathetic digital society. By delineating ethical pathways for the coexistence of humans and machines within the information realm, the study aims to contribute significantly to the ongoing discourse surrounding ethical AI use, the development of sociotechnical systems, and the maintenance of information integrity in the digital era. Through its findings, it aspires to influence future technological developments, regulatory frameworks, and policy formulations, thus paving the way for a more balanced and equitable digital future.\n\nFan Yang, Robbie Fordyce and Luke Heemsbergen analyse messages related to the recent referendum for political representation of Indigenous Australians posted on the Chinese-owned platform WeChat. The authors argue that, while posts largely follow the rhetoric of mainstream Australian media in their sentiments, the cases in which they divert, indicate the catalyzation of diaspora affects which influence the position towards race and Indigenous issues.\n\nTsvetelina Hristova explores the technopolitical implications of network time synchronisation protocols in warehouse automation. The logic of digital infrastructures imposes a notion and practice of time that is radically different from the universalising time synchronisation of industrial capitalism. Instead, network time protocols rely on the exchange of messages and data packages through which a measure and notion of time is negotiated and agreed upon in a networked environment. This imposes a particular technopolitical context of technological interpellation where structures of time are constituted through the participation of nodes in the network. This technological context of temporality has important implications for how hierarchies and enclosures are enacted in industrial networks and, importantly, for the role of cloud computing platforms in organising new forms of privatised time.\n\nAlexandra Anikina analyses the assembly line aesthetics in videos that promote personal productivity and time management on Tik Tok, YouTube and Twitch.\n\nThis panel is proposed by members of two research groups on critical infrastructure studies across the Atlantic that explore how new digital, automated and intelligent media technologies are impacting social and political life. Trying to understand criticality as both an analytical approach and a characteristic of the objects we research, we interrogate the aspects of digital media infrastructures that add new layers to how datafication acquires subtle cultural and technopolical inflections. Through the focus on affect in the panel, understood as both social emotional charge (Ahmed 2013) and as the potential for connection and interaction (Massumi 2002) in the network, we try to see the infrastructure of data systems and automated platforms as the product of different cultural, political and technological drives. These drives give rise to situated and embodied logics of automation that are platform-dependent but also dependent on cultural and social affects imbued through their provenance, producers and users. The panel blends different disciplinary perspectives and approaches, seeking a dialogue between media and communication studies, cultural studies and critical art research.\n\nReferences\n\nAhmed, S., 2013.

    "title": "Misconceptions about intimate partner violence risk assessment algorithm in the Basque Country: a reply to Valdivia, Hyde-Vaamonde, and García-Marcos (2024)",
    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Violence risk assessment is an internationally recognised methodology, aimed to manage different forms of violence. Most risk assessment tools, as is the case of the reviewed one, are designed to protect victims in the context of pressure, little time, or little information. This paper presents a reply to Valdivia et al. (AI &amp; Society, July 2024) criticism of the algorithm for intimate partner violence risk assessment—EPV—used in the Basque Country. They concluded that more than 50% of high-risk victims are in danger, using results from a pilot version of the instrument, not the reviewed one published in 2010, nor the system in use since May 2013. In addition, qualitative information from a single professional generates global criticisms of the tool. Neither the current cut-off points nor the real weighting of the items nor the real risk management procedure are considered, and the personal opinion of a judge is assumed to be better than the use of tools when the accumulated research shows the opposite. When EPV risk assessment reports are used in courts, they may only temporarily affect some perpetrator rights, imposing restraining orders or, in the worst case, pretrial prison waiting for sentence. However, risk management can save the life of the victim. Cautions and suggestions related to the judicial context, such as improving risk reports or training judicial professionals, are shared. However, Valdivia et al.’s paper leads to misconceptions that extend to different sectors when echoing the wrong conclusions of their paper.",

    "title": "Organisational tensions in introducing socially sustainable AI",
    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The introduction of AI into an organisation is linked to many of its functions, changing not only the technical systems but also the organisation of work and the society around it. Technology is often introduced with efficiency goals in mind, but at the same time, the constantly evolving understanding of sustainable and responsible business raises questions about how to ensure socially sustainable, ethical and responsible development and deployment of AI. The introduction of new, complex technologies, combined with the increasing social complexity of the operating environment, can easily create conflicting demands and dilemmas for organisations. In this paper, we explore the organisational tensions in public and private organisations that are planning to deploy or have already experimented with AI. The aim of the study is to broaden the understanding of AI-related organisational tensions: what issues they cover and how they are described by the practitioners working with AI. The research methodology is a qualitative content analysis of transcribed interviews with AI development experts from 42 Finnish organisations. The results are divided into three categories: (1) tensions related to values, (2) tensions related to AI implementation, and (3) tensions related to AI impacts. A total of 12 pairs of tensions were identified within these categories. We argue that by identifying and understanding AI-related tensions, organisations can learn about the positive and negative social, environmental and economic impacts of AI. This awareness enables organisations to consider impacts in advance, focus attention on key issues and act in a more sustainable way when adopting AI.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Artificial intelligence (AI) has captured the interest of multiple actors with speculations about its benefits and dangers. Despite increasing scholarly attention to the discourses of AI, there are limited insights on how different groups interpret and debate AI and shape its opportunities for action. We consider AI an issue field understood as a contested phenomenon where heterogeneous actors assert and debate the meanings and consequences of AI. Drawing on computational social science methods, we analyzed large amounts of text on how politicians (parliamentarians) consultancies (high reputation firms), and lay experts (AI-forum Reddit users) articulate meanings about AI. Through topic modeling, we identified diverse and co-existing discourses: politicians predominantly articulated AI as a societal issue requiring an ethical response, consultancies stressed AI as a business opportunity pushing a transformation-oriented discourse, and lay experts expressed AI as a technical issue shaping a techno-feature discourse. Moreover, our analysis details the hopes and fears within AI discourses, revealing that sentiment varies by actor group. Based on these findings, we contribute new insights about AI as an issue field shaped by the discursive work performed by heterogeneous actors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          In this paper, we empirically and conceptually examine how distributed human–machine networks of labour comprise a form of underlying intelligence within Artificial Intelligence (AI), considering the implications of this for Responsible Artificial Intelligence (R-AI) innovation. R-AI aims to guide AI research, development and deployment in line with certain normative principles, for example fairness, privacy, and explainability; notions implicitly shaped by comparisons of AI with individualised notions of human intelligence. However, as critical scholarship on AI demonstrates, this is a limited framing of the nature of intelligence, both of humans and AI. Furthermore, it dismisses the skills and labour central to developing AI systems, involving a distributed network of human-directed practices and reasoning. We argue that inequities in the agency and recognition of different types of practitioners across these networks of AI development have implications beyond RAI, with narrow framings concealing considerations which are important within broader discussions of AI intelligence. Drawing from interactive workshops conducted with AI practitioners, we explore practices of data acquisition, cleaning, and annotation, as the point where practitioners interface with domain experts and data annotators. Despite forming a crucial part of AI design and development, this type of data work is frequently framed as a tedious, unskilled, and low-value process. In exploring these practices, we examine the political role of the epistemic framings that underpin AI development and how these framings can shape understandings of distributed intelligence, labour practices, and annotators’ agency within data structures. Finally, we reflect on the implications of our findings for developing more participatory and equitable approaches to machine learning applications in the service of R-AI.",

    "title": "Alexa’s agency: a corpus-based study on the linguistic attribution of humanlikeness to voice user interfaces",
    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Voice-based, spoken interaction with artificial agents has become a part of everyday life in many countries: artificial voices guide us through our bank’s customer service, Amazon’s Alexa tells us which groceries we need to buy, and we can discuss central motifs in Shakespeare’s work with ChatGPT. Language, which is largely still seen as a uniquely human capacity, is now increasingly produced—or so it appears—by non-human entities, contributing to their perception as being ‘human-like.’ The capacity for language is far from the only prototypically human feature attributed to ‘speaking’ machines; their potential agency, consciousness, and even sentience have been widely discussed in the media. This paper argues that a linguistic analysis of agency (based on semantic roles) and animacy can provide meaningful insights into the sociocultural conceptualisations of artificial entities as humanlike actors. A corpus-based analysis investigates the varying attributions of agency to the voice user interfaces Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant in German media data. The analysis provides evidence for the important role that linguistic anthropomorphisation plays in the sociocultural attribution of agency and consciousness to artificial technological entities, and how particularly the practise of using personal names for these devices contributes to the attribution of humanlikeness: it will be highlighted how Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri are linguistically portrayed as sentient entities who listen, act, and have a mind of their own, whilst the lack of a personal name renders the Google Assistant much more recalcitrant to anthropomorphism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Artificial intelligence (AI)-based virtual influencers are now frequently used by brands in various categories to engage customers. However, little is known about who the followers of these AI-based virtual influencers are and more importantly, what drives the followers to use AI-based virtual influencers. The results from a survey support the notion that compensatory mechanisms and the need to belong play important roles in affecting usage intentions of AI-based virtual influencers. Specifically, the study finds that usage intentions are mediated and moderated by compensatory mechanisms that arise from the perception of AI-based virtual influencers’ functional benefits and existential threats to human identity. Furthermore, the need for belonging moderates the effects of the following status (following versus non-following) on perceived personalization benefits of AI-based virtual influencers and behavioral intentions to use AI-based virtual influencers. This study provides important implications for academia delving into the social, cultural, and philosophical implications of AI-based virtual influencers for human societies as well as for brands that plan to use AI-based virtual influencers and gain a better understanding of their customers in AI-driven digital marketing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          This study describes the impact of ChatGPT use on the nature of work from the perspective of academics and educators. We elucidate six phenomena: (1) the cognitive workload associated with conducting Turing tests to determine if ChatGPT has been involved in work productions; (2) the ethical void and alienation that result from recondite ChatGPT use; (3) insights into the motives of individuals who fail to disclose their ChatGPT use, while, at the same time, the recipient does not reveal their awareness of that use; (4) the sense of ennui as the meanings of texts dissipate and no longer reveal the sender’s state of understanding; (5) a redefinition of utility, wherein certain texts show redundancy with patterns already embedded in the base model, while physical measurements and personal observations are considered as unique and novel; (6) a power dynamic between sender and recipient, inadvertently leaving non-participants as disadvantaged third parties. This paper makes clear that the introduction of AI tools into society has far-reaching effects, initially most prominent in text-related fields, such as academia. Whether these implementations represent beneficial innovations for human prosperity, or a rather different line of social evolution, represents the pith of our present discussion.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          This article is the first study to examine the impact (positive and negative) of Artificial Intelligence on the diversity of archival collections. Representing the diverse audiences they serve is a key objective for libraries and archives. For example, institutions with colonial-era archival documents are experimenting with AI to improve the discoverability of their collections and to enhance access for source communities and other users. Indeed, AI can be used to automatically create metadata, search vast amounts of historical records, and answer questions with natural language. However, these technologies also come with risks—for instance when AI systems are trained on potentially biased data. Very little is known about the impact of these computational tools on diversity in archival collections. Do AI technologies compound or alleviate the lack of diversity in archives? Drawing from interviews with academics, archivists, curators, and other experts across the UK/Europe and the USA, this article sheds light on the lack of collaboration between producers of AI technologies on the one side, and archivists, librarians and other cultural heritage professionals on the other side. We argue that bringing these stakeholders together is essential to improve the diversity of archival collections, using ethical and responsible AI. Finally, we offer recommendations to help professionals in libraries and archives assess the opportunities and risks associated with AI and find solutions to make their collections more representative of diverse audiences.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          As automated technologies, particularly artificial intelligence (AI) and automated decision-making (ADM), become integral to social life, there is growing concern about their ethical implications. While issues of accountability, transparency, and fairness dominate discussions on “ethical” AI, little attention has been given to how socially disadvantaged groups most impacted by ADM systems form ethical judgments about them. Drawing on insights from relational ethics, this study uses dialogue groups with disabled people to explore how people distinguish between ‘more just’ or ‘less just’ uses of technology, and the contextual, situational, and relational factors that shape these judgments. For the dialogue group participants in our study, ethical reasoning was most strongly influenced by concerns about how ADM systems affect self-determination, caring relationships and identity recognition, and about the political–economic drivers of automation. The article contributes to AI ethics by empirically demonstrating that justice and ethics depend on the social relationships valued in different contexts and what is at stake, both personally and politically, in decisions aided by automation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models like ChatGPT, presents new challenges as well as possibilities for scientific authorship. This paper draws on social systems theory to offer a nuanced understanding of the interplay between technology, individuals, society and scholarly authorial practices. This contrasts with orthodoxy, where individuals and technology are treated as essentialized entities. This approach offers a critique of the binary positions of sociotechnological determinism and accelerationist instrumentality while still acknowledging that generative AI presents profound challenges to existing practices and meaning making in scientific scholarship. This holistic treatment of authorship, integrity, and technology involves comprehending the historical and evolutionary entanglement of scientific individuality, scientific practices, and meaning making with technological innovation. This addresses current needs for more robust theoretical approaches to address the challenges confronted by academicians, institutions, peer review, and publication processes. Our analysis aims to contribute to a more sophisticated discourse on the ethical and practical implications of AI in scientific research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Whether supplementing written articles in newspapers or playing a leading role in photo-reporting, photography has achieved an influencial role in the delivery of information and framing of narratives to mass audiences. Photojournalism archives represent a unique source of historical data and public records about local, national, and international events, political movements, demonstrations, and urban development. This paper outlines a data archaeology project that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) for organizing and searching through photojournalism collections, based on the Boston Globe photograph morgue. While the primary goal of the project is to foster public access to news archives, the large-scale digitization and recovery of information from photojournalism collections raises ethical questions about intellectual property and the right to identity protection when records are made available online. We present a proof of concept that tackles these issues by means of AI, while still offering equitable access to journalism archives that are often kept inaccessible within private media institutions. The first part of the paper discusses how machine learning can resolve the lack of resources to parse through data on digital surrogates. After providing an introduction to the use of ML to facilitate access to information in the Boston Globe photograph morgue, we outline two partially automated computational tasks: (1) an AI toolkit for transcribing archivists’ notes and to recover photographers’ names and creation dates, which can be used by librarians and archivists to assess copyright on records; (2) a pipeline for face detection and blurring that detects areas where identifiable people are present and allows for anonymization. As news archiving is confronted with challenges derived from the “digital heap” of orphaned data, privatization, and other barriers to journalism records, this report explores an ethical approach to structuring data in news archives for public access, by preserving intellectual property and privacy.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThis paper examines the democratic ethics of artificially intelligent polls. Driven by machine learning, AI electoral polls have the potential to generate predictions with an unprecedented level of granularity. We argue that their predictive power is potentially desirable for electoral democracy. We do so by critically engaging with four objections: (1) the privacy objection, which focuses on the potential harm of the collection, storage, and publication of granular data about voting preferences; (2) the autonomy objection, which argues that polls are an obstacle to independently formed judgments; (3) the tactical voting objection, which argues that voting strategically on the basis of polls is troublesome; and finally (4) the manipulation objection, according to which malicious actors could systematically bias predictions to alter voting behaviours.\n",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          This paper explores the interplay between AI metrics and policymaking by examining the conceptual and methodological frameworks of global AI metrics and their alignment with National Artificial Intelligence Strategies (NAIS). Through topic modeling and qualitative content analysis, key thematic areas in NAIS are identified. The findings suggest a misalignment between the technical and economic focus of global AI metrics and the broader societal and ethical priorities emphasized in NAIS. This highlights the need to recalibrate AI evaluation frameworks to include ethical and other social considerations, aligning AI advancements with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for an inclusive, ethical, and sustainable future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The rapid diffusion of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in the defence domain raises challenges for the ethical governance of these systems. A recent shift from the what to the how of AI ethics sees a nascent body of literature published by defence organisations focussed on guidance to implement AI ethics principles. These efforts have neglected a crucial intermediate step between principles and guidance concerning the elicitation of ethical requirements for specifying the guidance. In this article, we outline the key normative choices and corresponding tradeoffs that are involved in specifying guidance for the implementation of AI ethics principles in the defence domain. These correspond to: the AI lifecycle model used; the scope of stakeholder involvement; the accountability goals chosen; the choice of auditing requirements; and the choice of mechanisms for transparency and traceability. We provide initial recommendations for navigating these tradeoffs and highlight the importance of a pro-ethical institutional culture.",

    "title": "What makes full artificial agents morally different",
    "abstract": "Abstract\n          In the research field of machine ethics, we commonly categorize artificial moral agents into four types, with the most advanced referred to as a full ethical agent, or sometimes a full-blown Artificial Moral Agent (AMA). This type has three main characteristics: autonomy, moral understanding and a certain level of consciousness, including intentional mental states, moral emotions such as compassion, the ability to praise and condemn, and a conscience. This paper aims to discuss various aspects of full-blown AMAs and presents the following argument: the creation of full-blown artificial moral agents, endowed with intentional mental states and moral emotions, and trained to align with human values, does not, by itself, guarantee that these systems will have human morality. Therefore, it is questionable whether they will be inclined to honor and follow what they perceive as incorrect moral values. we do not intend to claim that there is such a thing as a universally shared human morality, only that as there are different human communities holding different sets of moral values, the moral systems or values of the discussed artificial agents would be different from those held by human communities, for reasons we discuss in the paper.",

    "title": "Metaphors in digital radiology: ethical implications for responsibility assignments of human-AI imaginaries",
    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology triggered identity-threatening fears for radiologists of becoming replaced by machines. Beyond this competitive narrative of humans versus AI, a collaborative narrative for human–AI-interaction emerged with a new metaphorical landscape both for the functions of AI and the roles of radiologists. This article aims to raise awareness of the ethical implications of figurative language in human–AI interaction in digital radiology. The paper is divided into two parts. The first part justifies the approach of metaphor analysis in medicine, draws a spectrum of ethical implications for language choices, and introduces taxonomies of human–AI interaction. We use these preliminaries as a hermeneutical tool to conduct such a metaphor analysis in the second part. There, we identify prevalent metaphors in the radiological community and discuss their ethical implications regarding responsibility assignments. We argue that while metaphors can facilitate a collaborative narrative, they may also lead to the undesirable ethical consequence of attributing moral responsibility to AI, which lacks the necessary features for such responsibility. The spectrum of metaphorically constructed functions of AI ranges from “time-saving tool” to “assistant” and “ally”. For the roles of radiologists, we found metaphors and analogies which are derived from contexts of aviation (radiologists as “pilots” and AI as “auto-pilots”), war (radiologists at the “forefront of technological development”), music (radiologists as “conductors” of multi-disciplinary teams), and hierarchical power contexts (radiologists as “technology and thought leaders”). Despite radiologists’ expressed willingness to collaborate actively with AI, the prevailing analogy of AI as a “tool” primarily suggests mere delegation of routine tasks, at the same time allowing radiologists to maintain their professional competencies. However, a new competitive narrative of AI-savvy versus non-AI-savvy radiologists also emerged, transforming the initial competitive narrative from human versus AI to human versus human competition.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The purpose of this paper is to increase the understanding of how different types of experts with influence over the development of AI, in this role, reflect upon distribution of forward-looking responsibility for AI development with regard to safety and democracy. Forward-looking responsibility refers to the obligation to see to it that a particular state of affairs materialise. In the context of AI, actors somehow involved in AI development have the potential to guide AI development in a safe and democratic direction. This study is based on qualitative interviews with such actors in different roles at research institutions, private companies, think tanks, consultancy agencies, parliaments, and non-governmental organisations. While the reflections about distribution of responsibility differ among the respondents, one observation is that influence is seen as an important basis for distribution of responsibility. Another observation is that several respondents think of responsibility in terms of what it would entail in concrete measures. By showing how actors involved in AI development reflect on distribution of responsibility, this study contributes to a dialogue between the field of AI governance and the field of AI ethics.",

    "title": "From liability gaps to liability overlaps: shared responsibilities and fiduciary duties in AI and other complex technologies",
    "abstract": "AbstractComplex technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) can cause harm, raising the question of who is liable for the harm caused. Research has identified multiple liability gaps (i.e., unsatisfactory outcomes when applying existing liability rules) in legal frameworks. In this paper, the concepts of shared responsibilities and fiduciary duties are explored as avenues to address liability gaps. The development, deployment and use of complex technologies are not clearly distinguishable stages, as often suggested, but are processes of cooperation and co-creation. At the intersections of these stages, shared responsibilities and fiduciary duties of multiple actors can be observed. Although none of the actors have complete control or a complete overview, many actors have some control or influence, and, therefore, responsibilities based on fault, prevention or benefit. Shared responsibilities and fiduciary duties can turn liability gaps into liability overlaps. These concepts could be implemented in tort and contract law by amending existing law (e.g., by assuming that all stakeholders are liable unless they can prove they did not owe a duty of care) and by creating more room for partial liability reflecting partial responsibilities (e.g., a responsibility to signal or identify an issue without a corresponding responsibility to solve that issue). This approach better aligns legal liabilities with responsibilities, increases legal certainty, and increases cooperation and understanding between actors, improving the quality and safety of technologies. However, it may not solve all liability gaps, may have chilling effects on innovation, and may require further detailing through case law.",

    "title": "WEIRD? Institutions and consumers’ perceptions of artificial intelligence in 31 countries",
    "abstract": "Abstract\n          A survey of perceptions of Artificial Intelligence in 31 countries in 2023 (Ipsos in Global Views on A.I. 2023. https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2023-07/Ipsos%20Global%20AI%202023%20Report-WEB_0.pdf. Accessed 17 May 2024, 2023) yields significantly less positive perceptions of the new technology in developed western economies than in emerging and non-western economies. This could reflect citizens in non-Western countries perceiving machines (computers) and algorithms differently from those in Western countries, or that a more positive outlook in countries with weak democratic institutions comes from a preference for algorithmic precision over inconsistent and/or corrupt regulation and decision-making. However, it could also be reflecting the different psychology of “WEIRD” (Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, Democratic) countries. Regressing the survey responses against measures of the “WEIRD” dimensions, we find that reported understanding of, willingness to trust, and anticipation of change due to AI applications are consistently negatively correlated to a country’s education levels (E), and average income per capita (R). The sophistication of democratic institutions (D) and “Westernness” (W), both alone and in combination with the other factors, have statistically significant negative effects on the percentage of the respondents in any given country having positive perceptions of AI and its prospects. The consistency of the negative relationship between the sophistication of democratic institutions country-level perceptions of AI brings into question the role of regulation of the new technology. WEIRD societies are presumed to rely on democratic institutions for assurances they can transact safely with strangers. Institutions thus substitute for the trust non-WEIRD societies place in friends, family and close community contacts when transacting. Third-party (and notably government) assurances in the context of uncertainty created by the emergence of new AI technologies arguably condition perceptions of the safety of these technologies through the presence (or absence) of regulations governing their implementation and use. Different perceptions amongst European countries compared to other western counterparts to perceptions of data privacy support the contention that the mere presence of AI regulation may be sufficient to alter perceptions in WEIRD societies, regardless of whether the regulations are necessary or even effective in increasing user safety. This has implications for interpreting and responding to political pressure to regulate new technologies in WEIRD countries.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          What makes safety claims about general purpose AI systems such as large language models trustworthy? We show that rather than the capabilities of security tools such as alignment and red teaming procedures, it is security practices based on these tools that contributed to reconfiguring the image of AI safety and made the claims acceptable. After showing what causes the gap between the capabilities of security tools and the desired safety guarantees, we critically investigate how AI security practices attempt to fill the gap and identify several shortcomings in diversity and participation. We found that these security practices are part of securitization processes aiming to support (commercial) development of general purpose AI systems whose trustworthiness can only be imperfectly tested instead of guaranteed. We conclude by offering several improvements to the current AI security practices.",

    "title": "Sisters, not twins: exploring artistic control and anthropomorphism through composing with a bespoke generative AI",
    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Generative AI (GenAI) has the potential to affect artists’ control over their own music due to the illegal usage of copyrighted material for training. However, GenAI also creates exciting opportunities for artists to expand their material and working processes. Artists working with GenAI and documenting their outcomes can assist other artists as well as wider society in understanding how GenAI operates and can benefit human artistic output. This paper provides an autoethnographic case study into how a new GenAI tool influenced an established composing practice during the writing of the experimental musical work, Control Yourself (2023). The Koup Music prototype by Kopi Su Studio was trained on vocal inputs by the author and subsequently generated bespoke sonic material. While identifiably true to the author’s musical—and literal—voice, the outputs were novel and perceived as imbued with emotion, leading to subsequent anthropomorphising of the AI. Written by a former AI sceptic, this paper details how the emotive power of the AI’s non-verbal, human-like sounds informed the narrative and structure of the resulting work and imparted a sense of collaboration, rather than solo authorship. Furthermore, the influence of the AI was felt beyond its actual involvement, with the project taking on a more playful approach less centred on the artistic control of the human composer. Following these observations, this paper discusses how GenAI served as a tool for musical experimentation and exploring creative ‘blind spots.’ These insights are also contextualised by current discourse on the perception and use of GenAI in the arts, the role of artistic control in human–AI co-creation, and how anthropomorphism has manifested in past human–AI partnerships.",

    "title": "Artificial intelligence versus collective intelligence",
    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The ontological presupposition of artificial intelligence (AI) is the liberal autonomous human subject of Locke and Kant, and the ideology of AI is the automation of this particular conception of intelligence. This is demonstrated in detail in classical AI by the work of Simon, who explicitly connected his work on AI to a wider programme in cognitive science, economics, and politics to perfect capitalism. Although Dreyfus produced a powerful Heideggerian critique of classical AI, work on neural networks in AI was ultimately based on the individual as the locus of intelligence. Yet this conception of AI both fails to grasp the essence of large language models, which are a statistical model of human language on the Web. The training data that enables AI is the surveillance and capture of data, where the data creates a model to approximate the entire world. However, there is a more hidden ideology inherent in AI where the goal is not to perfect a model but to control the world. As prompted by an argument between Mead and Bateson, social change is prevented by the application of cybernetics to society as a whole. The goal of AI is not just to replace human beings, but to manage humans to preserve existing power relations. As the source of intelligence in AI is distributed cognition between humans and machines, the alternative to AI is collective intelligence. As theorized by Licklider and Engelbart at the dawn of the Internet, collective intelligence explains how computers weave together both human and non-human intelligence. Rather than replace human intelligence, this produces ever more complex collective forms of intelligence. Rather than meta-stabilize a society of control, collective intelligence can go outside individualist capitalist ontology by incorporating the open world of the pluriverse, as theorized by Escobar. Collective intelligence then stands as an alternative ontological path for AI which puts intelligence at the service of humanity and the world rather than a technocratic elite.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The Turing test has a peculiar status in the artificial intelligence (AI) research community. On the one hand, it is presented as an important topic in virtually every AI textbook, and the research direction focused on developing AI systems that behave in human-like fashion is standardly called the “Turing test approach”. On the other hand, reports of computer programs passing the Turing test have had relatively little effect. Does this mean that the Turing test is no longer relevant as a test, doomed to be a theoretical notion with little connection to AI practice? In this paper, I argue that there is one problem in particular with common traditional versions of the Turing test, namely their focus on deception. The criterion for passing the Turing test is standardly connected to an AI system’s ability to deceive the interrogator about its identity. But why should we connect intelligence to the ability deceive? Here I present a revised version of an intelligence test that is not based on deception. In what I call the Community-based intelligence test (CBIT), an AI is introduced to a community of human subjects. If after a sufficient number of interactions within that community the humans are not able to identify the AI system as a computer, it is considered to have passed CBIT. I discuss whether that should be enough to ascribe intelligence to the AI, and if not, what more would be needed?",

Can academia retain enough talent to shape AI advancements and counterbalance the growing influence of corporate AI labs? Analyzing OpenAlex data, we find a significant transition of premier talent to industry roles over the past decade, particularly to major tech firms. Young, highly cited scholars from leading institutions are the most likely to make this move. Following the transition, their research tends to show reduced novelty and impact. This industry-dominant shift in AI research highlights worries of an “AI brain drain”, the sidelining of exploratory science for commercial interests, and the potential misalignment with societal goals.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Generative AI has seen significant advances, particularly in text-to-image, with the potential to revolutionize industries, especially in creative fields such as art and design. This innovation is especially important in architecture, where idea visualization is critical. Text-to-image tools, a form of generative AI, enable architects and designers to visually bring their concepts to life. The study explores the impact of prompt-based AI generation on architecture, asking whether it is enhancing efficiency, creativity, and sustainability or threatening to replace architects. To address concerns about the role of AI in the profession, the research examines the perceptions of architecture professionals in Egypt. The authors conducted a survey and interviews with industry experts to assess the transformative impacts of AI on architecture. The findings reveal a strong awareness of AI's potential to enhance design quality and project outcomes, although some concerns about job prospects and control over AI outputs persist. Small firms view AI as vital for optimizing operations and attracting clients. Overall, AI shows promise in conceptualization and visualization, enhancing creativity and efficiency, with architects needing to adapt to AI as a tool for innovation rather than a competitor. Finally, the study proposes a roadmap for improving the use of AI in architecture.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          AI-generated images consistently favor White people compared to people of color. This paper examined the image-to-image generation accuracy (i.e., the original race and gender of a person’s image were replicated in the new AI-generated image) of a Chinese AI-powered image generator. We examined the image-to-image generation models transforming the racial and gender categories of the original photos of White, Black and East Asian people (N = 1260) in three different racial contexts: a single person, two people of the same race, and two people of different races. The findings indicated that White people were more accurately depicted in AI-generated images than people of color in all three racial contexts. Black people, particularly females, were depicted with the lowest AI-generated racial accuracy in the image of a single person, but with higher accuracy in the image of two people of different races. The pattern of Asian people, particularly males, was the inverse: the app had higher AI-generated racial accuracy for Asians in the single-person image but lower accuracy for Asians in the two-people-of-different-races image. In all cases of incorrect racial generating, the AI-powered image generator depicted most people of color as White. This study provides us with insight into racial and gender bias in image generation and the potential representational harms of an AI-powered beauty app developed in China. More broadly, these technological biases reflect a form of postcolonial globalization that impacts image-processing systems in non-White settings, including social values of white supremacy and norms of white beauty.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The present study sheds light on a new psychological construct called “AI pessimism aversion” (AIPA) describing an overly optimistic view of the benefits of AI by neglecting its potential dangers. In an international sample of N = 543 participants, we observed that the construct of AIPA strongly overlaps with single-item measures for positive and negative AI attitudes. Furthermore, the structural equation model suggests that the positive association between the internal locus of control (a personality measure describing persons who see themselves as steering their own lives) and positive AI attitudes was in part mediated by AIPA. We also assessed risk aversion in the present work, because high aversion of risky situations might go along with lower AIPA (the coming AI wave is characterised by high uncertainty). Surprisingly, this was not the case, and these two constructs seem to be (rather) independent. The present work should be a starting point to dive deeper into the study of AI attitudes, a highly relevant research theme for societies standing at the eve of the coming AI wave.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to reshape our world, the spectre of technological domination looms large. This paper delves into the equilibrium model of balancing as a legal safeguard against AI-driven power imbalances. First, the study unveils the sources of domination: control over resources and events. Subsequently, potential legal tools of counterbalancing are identified and discussed. Employing a proactive, theory-building approach, the research synthesises legal rules, case studies, and scholarly insights to construct a framework for understanding and implementing balancing in AI contexts. The paper’s findings offer valuable insights for policymakers, legal scholars, and AI developers seeking to navigate the complex landscape of power relations in the age of AI.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Correspondence held in the collections of cultural institutions is an important resource for researchers, including historians, biographers, and social scientists. Email has been the dominant form of correspondence for the last 30 years and email archives are now being acquired by cultural institutions as a valuable resource for their collections. There are challenges in collecting, preserving and providing access to email archives, as with all born-digital materials, but also challenges in using email archives as a researcher. One tool that can help researchers use an email archive is visualisation. Visualisation has been applied to email for a long period of time but there has been little research into the visualisation needs of researchers using email archives. The preliminary outcomes of a research project investigating the needs of researchers suggests that visualisations will be useful to the researcher, who is always under the pressure of limited time, to work efficiently with the email archive. Artificial intelligence (AI) can play a role in preparing the email archive for visualisation. However, the research outcomes suggest that visualisations will be viewed cautiously by researchers who want time with the actual email archive to develop their research and they are unlikely to trust visualisations alone. The use of AI in the production of visualisations has the potential to add further barriers to researchers’ level of trust.",

    "title": "Generative AI and childhood education: lessons from the smartphone generation",
    "abstract": "Abstract\n          This article examines the potential parallels between children's widespread adoption of smartphones and the emerging reliance on generative AI tools in childhood education. Drawing on Jonathan Haidt’s insights into how phone-based childhoods can disrupt the development of critical executive functions, and Shannon Vallor’s concept of “moral deskilling,” the discussion raises concerns about “intellectual deskilling” in younger generations. As generative AI tools like ChatGPT gain popularity, children risk becoming overly reliant on automated solutions, potentially undermining metacognition and critical thinking. This paper highlights risks such as cognitive offloading, instant gratification, and diminished perseverance and proposes measures to ensure generative AI supports rather than replaces essential developmental experiences.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          As a collaboratively edited and open-access knowledge archive, Wikipedia offers a vast dataset for training artificial intelligence (AI) applications and models, enhancing data accessibility and access to information. However, reliance on the crowd-sourced encyclopedia raises ethical issues related to data provenance, knowledge production, curation, and digital labor. Drawing on critical data studies, feminist posthumanism, and recent research at the intersection of Wikimedia and AI, this study employs problem-centered expert interviews to investigate the relationship between Wikipedia and large language models (LLMs). Key findings include the unclear role of Wikipedia in LLM training, ethical issues, and potential solutions for systemic biases and sustainability challenges. By foregrounding these concerns, this study contributes to ongoing discourses on the responsible use of AI in digital knowledge production and information management. Ultimately, this article calls for greater transparency and accountability in how big tech entities use open-access datasets like Wikipedia, advocating for collaborative frameworks prioritizing ethical considerations and equitable representation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          This study investigates how patterns of media use and exposure to media messages are related to attitudes about artificial intelligence (AI) image generators. In doing so, it builds on theoretical accounts of media framing and public opinion about science and technology topics, including AI. The analyses draw on data from a survey of the US public (N = 1,035) that included an experimental manipulation of exposure to tweets framing AI image generators in terms of real art, artists’ concerns, artists’ outrage, or competing interpretations. The results show that technology news use and science fiction viewing predicted support for AI art but also predicted belief that AI image generators will take jobs and steal art styles from human artists. In addition, the experimental results demonstrate that exposure to specific media messages can influence these responses. The findings carry implications for understanding the future adoption, use, and regulation of AI image generators.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          John Danaher and Sven Nyholm have argued that automation, especially of the sort powered by artificial intelligence, poses a threat to meaningful work by diminishing the chances for meaning-conferring workplace achievement, what they call “achievement gaps”. In this paper, I argue that Danaher and Nyholm’s achievement gap thesis suffers from an ambiguity. The weak version of the thesis holds that automation may result in the appearance of achievement gaps, whereas the strong version holds that automation may result on balance loss in possibilities for workplace achievements, i.e., in the appearance of an overall gappier work landscape. Against the strong version of the achievement gap thesis, I characterize situations where automation may result in boons to meaning-conferring workplace achievements: the appearance of what I call achievement spread and achievement swaps. Nevertheless, Danaher and Nyholm are right to worry about some uses of automation whereby human workers become subservient to AI. But these situations are better framed, I argue, as autonomy gaps rather than achievement gaps.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Healthcare professionals currently lack guidance for their use of AI. This means they currently lack clear counsel to aid their navigation of the problematic novel issues that will arise from their use of these systems. This pilot study gathered and analysed cross-sectional attitudinal and qualitative data to address the question: what should be in professional ethical guidance (PEG) to support healthcare practitioners in their use of AI? Our survey asked respondents (n = 42) to review 6 themes and 15 items of guidance content for our proposed PEG-AI. The attitudinal data are presented as simple numerical analysis and the accompanying qualitative data were subjected to conventional content analysis; the findings of which are presented in this report. The study data allowed us to identify further items that could be added to the PEG-AI and to test the survey instrument for content and face validity prior to wider deployment. Subject to further funding, we plan to take this work further to a wider study involving the next iteration of this survey, interviews with interested parties regarding PEG-AI, and an iterative Delphi process (comprising an initial co-creation workshop followed by iterative consensus building) to enable experts to reach consensus regarding recommendations for the content of PEG for AI use in healthcare. We aim for this work to inform the healthcare regulators as they develop regulatory strategies in this area.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The benefits of AI technologies in archival preservation are well recognised, though questions remain about their integration into existing processes. AI also shows promise for enhancing user experience and discovery in accessing born-digital materials. However, a limited understanding of the diverse methodological needs surrounding born-digital access risks the creation of one-size-fits-all solutions that suit certain approaches and research questions better than others. This article reviews current efforts in born-digital access and applies the Garbage Can Model from organisation theory to conceptualise the challenge of developing AI-based tools for multiple user types, highlighting the iterative and often decentralised nature of multi-stakeholder decision-making. We address this challenge by creating four born-digital archival user types—the aggregator, the synthesiser, the fact finder, and the narrator—each with distinct motivations and research approaches. Finally, we identify some new opportunities for stakeholders to inform how AI-based tools can be developed to better meet the variety of methodological needs that exist in relation to born-digital archives.",

    "title": "Virtues for AI",
    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Virtue theory is a natural approach toward the design of artificially intelligent systems, given that the design of artificial intelligence essentially aims at designing agents with excellent dispositions. This has led to a lively research programme to develop artificial virtues. However, this research programme has until now had a narrow focus on moral virtues in an Aristotelian mould. While Aristotelian moral virtue has played a foundational role in the field, it unduly constrains the possibilities of virtue theory for artificial intelligence. This paper aims to remedy this limitation. Philosophers have developed a rich tradition investigating virtues, their normative domains and their structure. Drawing on this tradition, I propose a three-dimensional classification system of possible artificial virtues: virtues can be classified according to the domain in which virtue is an excellence, norm that makes a virtue an excellence, and mode of how the virtue delivers the excellence. With this framework, we can discern gaps in the current theorising about artificial virtues. Additionally, it gives us a tool to evaluate the competences of extant artificially intelligent systems.",

    "title": "“Desired behaviors”: alignment and the emergence of a machine learning ethics",
    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The concept of alignment has undergone a remarkable rise in recent years to take center stage in the ethics of artificial intelligence. There are now numerous philosophical studies of the values that should be used in this ethical framework as well as a technical literature operationalizing these values in machine learning models. This article takes a step back to address a more basic set of critical questions: Where has the ethical imperative of alignment come from? What is the ethical logic of alignment—how, exactly, does it propose to regulate machines’ and peoples’ conduct? And what are the social and political implications of this ethics? After discussing the logical and normative implications of the term itself—in what sense alignment can have an ethical meaning—we undertake a four-part “anatomy” of alignment in contemporary large language models (LLMs): first, a relatively technical sense in sequence modeling; second, a more normative sense relating to how outputs of pre-trained models are ethically evaluated; a third sense where external values are introduced using fine-tuning techniques to manage undesired model behaviors; and fourth sense, where alignment is given extreme ethical stakes in philosophical discussions of existential risks. We find that the ethics of alignment is fundamentally concerned with the problem of control, with unintended model behaviors that arise from divergences between training objectives and the normative expectations that govern the contexts in which they are used. Alignment serves to bridge the gap between what we call an “is” normativity, of statistical patterns identified by models and an “ought” normativity where values are technically introduced in models to steer them away from undesired behaviors. By problematizing control, the ethics of alignment weakens capacities to both make more substantive ethical judgments and also political decisions about how to live with AI.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          This paper provides an explorative investigation into how the development of software (front- and backends) is framed by reflexive assumptions, ascriptions, and expectations as to how software should be ‘designed’ to provide the user with ‘good’, ‘transparent’ and ‘controllable’ handling of applications or software environments. Drawing on metapragmatic theory, the notions of ideologies of communication, ideologies of communification, and particularly ideologies of design, the paper unfolds how software designers draw on, and struggle upon, specific notions of graphic transparency, simplicity, and elegance which are densely linked with language and media ideologies about ‘effective communication’ as well as with specific ideas and ideals of community building and maintenance (e.g., drawing on ‘empowerment’ and ‘inclusiveness’) that are envisioned to be bound to specific forms of (‘open’, ‘inviting’, and fully user- ‘controllable’) design and communication. The case in point is a major free and open-source software project that aims to provide a comprehensive free desktop environment including software libraries and a comprehensive software ecosystem, the GNOME project that is currently among the most prominent desktop environments on the Linux operation system. In theoretical terms, the paper contributes to the current discussion in sociolinguistics, linguistic anthropology, and media studies about design as a social value and semiotic device and the opening of metapragmatics towards non-linguistic semiotic resources.",

    "title": "Intersectional analysis of visual generative AI: the case of stable diffusion",
    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Since 2022, Visual Generative AI (vGenAI) tools have experienced rapid adoption and garnered widespread acclaim for their ability to produce high-quality images with convincing photorealistic representations. These technologies mirror society’s prevailing visual politics in a mediated form, and actively contribute to the perpetuation of deeply ingrained assumptions, categories, values, and aesthetic representations. In this paper, we critically analyze Stable Diffusion (SD), a widely used open-source vGenAI tool, through visual and intersectional analysis. Our analysis covers; (1) the aesthetics of the AI-generated visual material, (2) the institutional contexts in which these images are situated and produced, and (3) the intersections between power systems such as racism, colonialism, and capitalism—which are both reflected and perpetuated through the visual aesthetics. Our visual analysis of 180 SD-generated images deliberately sought to produce representations along different lines of privilege and disadvantage—such as wealth/poverty or citizen/immigrant—drawing from feminist science and technology studies, visual media studies, and intersectional critical theory. We demonstrate how imagery produced through SD perpetuates pre-existing power systems such as sexism, racism, heteronormativity, and ableism, and assumes a default individual as white, able-bodied, and masculine-presenting. Furthermore, we problematize the hegemonic cultural values in the imagery that can be traced to the institutional context of these tools, particularly in the tendency towards Euro- and North America-centric cultural representations. Finally, we find that the power systems around SD result in the continual reproduction of harmful and violent imagery through technology, challenging the oft-underlying notion that vGenAI is culturally and aesthetically neutral. Based on the harms identified through our qualitative, interpretative analysis, we bring forth a reparative and social justice-oriented approach to vGenAI—including the need for acknowledging and rendering visible the cultural-aesthetic politics of this technology and engaging in reparative approaches that aim to symbolically and materially mend injustices enacted against social groups.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThis proposal introduces a novel decision-making framework to advance safe economic activities in cyberspace. We focus on identifying anomalies within crypto-asset trading, recognized as potential sources of criminal activity, severely undermining the credibility of such assets. Detecting and mitigating such anomalies holds significant societal implications, particularly in fostering trust within blockchain networks. We aim to bolster the “social trust” inherent to blockchain technology by facilitating informed economic activities in cyberspace. To achieve this, we propose integrating two artificial intelligence (AI) systems into a blockchain-based decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The first AI application involves amalgamating various anomaly indicators, spanning from cluster coefficient, entropy, triangular motif analysis, correlation tensor analysis, loop component by Hodge decomposition, loop causality detection, network classification using graph Laplacian, and persistent homology analysis, into a comprehensive indicator using a Boltzmann machine. The second AI application entails deploying conversational AI to guide and support traders, aiding them in making informed trading decisions. This system is designed to alert DAO members to anomalies based on the integrated indicators, especially during massive price fluctuations. We operate under the assumption of close collaboration between governments, experts, traders, system developers, and operators to effectively organize DAOs. The primary technical challenge in our proposal lies in developing a wallet assisted by an intelligent software agent capable of safe interactions with traders within a unified DAO. With this organization, we envision fostering a global economic ecosystem where physical and cyber worlds converge, allowing democratic economic participation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          This text analyses how generative AI systems are being employed in current artistic practice to question certain historical visual narratives, creating representations that challenge some conventional perceptions of the past and thus opening up new perspectives on the experience of temporality. In this regard, special emphasis will be placed on some artistic projects based on generative historical photography practices. These are works that develop new ways around ‘archival aesthetics’ (Sekula in October 39:3–64 1986; Buchloh in Deep storage. collecting, storing and archiving in art [Exhibition catalog]. P.S.1, Nueva York, 1999; Guasch in Arte y archivo, 1920-2010. Genealogías, tipologías y discontinuidades. Akal, Madrid, 2015, etc.) by producing visual archives that do not exist or are alternatives to others. We will therefore analyse works that critically examine how these generative systems can contribute to a revision and re-evaluation of the past, as well as to the problematisation of the ways in which photography has been used for the historical record. These poetics invite subtle reflections on the role of the visual archive in the processes of shaping subjectivity and personal and communal identity. In the final part of the text, we will deal with the study of some artists who, through appropriationist strategies and remakes assisted by generative AI models, revise artistic works from the past, specifically from the photoconceptualism of the 1970s. In these strategies, the thematisation of the relations between photographic register and temporality also plays a leading role.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Meaningful human control (MHC) is increasingly becoming an important topic in AI ethics beyond the domain of autonomous weapons systems. MHC has been conceptualized, analyzed, and applied. However, in this article, I show how all the current attempts at realizing MHC have fallen short because we have not taken the important first step of deciding what machines should and should not be doing in the first place. We must first ensure that the output we have delegated to the machine is appropriate – only then do we have to do the work required to ensure that MHC is realized. Here, I argue that machines should not be evaluating – that is, we should not be delegating evaluative outputs to machines. This is practically important because machines that have evaluative outputs cannot be evaluated for efficacy. We can’t say how effective they are. This is ethically important because machines don’t have the moral agency required to make evaluations. Furthermore, machines should not be in a position to change our values – which they would be if they were evaluating. Finally, evaluations are judged based on the considerations used to reach a particular judgment. Contemporary AI cannot provide these justifying considerations – so we have no way of evaluating their evaluative outputs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          This paper examines the implications of brain–machine interfaces (BMIs) from a libertarian perspective, arguing that their widespread use necessitates careful scrutiny due to potential risks to individual autonomy, freedom, privacy, and dignity. BMIs, while offering significant technological advancements, pose severe threats by potentially undermining fundamental libertarian values. The paper discusses how BMIs could enable invasive surveillance, thought manipulation, and emotional control, drawing parallels to Robert Nozick’s Experience Machine thought experiment. Unlike the hypothetical machine, which offers simulated experiences, BMIs could facilitate real-time control over individuals’ thoughts and emotions, leading to unprecedented forms of government overreach and coercion. The paper concludes that although libertarians advocate for minimal state intervention, the profound impact of BMIs on personal freedom and autonomy warrants a cautious approach, including potential restrictions on their use to safeguard against their misuse and to preserve individual self-ownership and dignity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          This article contributes to the philosophical inquiry of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by reframing the question “Where is the intelligence of Artificial Intelligence?” into “Where does AI intelligently operate?”. This rephrasing challenges our understanding of AI’s role in social practices and its integration into the human experience. Central to this discourse is the concept of the ‘cybork’ (a portmanteau of ‘cyborg’ and ‘work’), which symbolizes not just a physical entity but a dynamic system of actions and interactions within a socio-technical landscape: work accomplished with machines. In this framework, intelligence in AI lies not in any function of isolated systems, but rather in the situated context of their use within collective and meaningful practices that give technology its sense and direction. Conversely, technology both enables and shapes these practices to the extent that distinguishing between the two can seem unnecessary, or even detrimental, to the optimal design of and for work practices. The cybork embodies this integration and entanglement, transcending the traditional boundaries between individuals and collectives, entities and actions. It reveals the inseparability and co-dependence of humans and technology, where technological artifacts become extensions of human capabilities, embody collective human history and development, and serve as both products and participants in societal practices, fundamentally shaping our interaction with the world.",

Drawing on visual ethnography methods, I explore how researchers, developers, as well as professional and aspiring artists, across sectors in Melbourne’s ecosystem, value the role of mistakes, glitches and uncertainty in the creative process with music technology. This stands in opposition to the controlled processes within generative AI models, based on the management of uncertainty as an input value. Thus, I reframe the concept of creative uncertainty which emerges as a shaping force in the creative process, and in opposition to the controlled outputs of generative AI. Furthermore, this article shows the limitations and misalignment of dominant visions about the impact of generative AI, on creative workflows and practices, by highlighting the experiences, motivations and expectations of the research participants in this multi-sited ethnography.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          This paper discusses the creative project ‘Impossible Evolutions’, which uses generative machine learning models in the design of woven tapestries. This project is used as a conduit to unfold highly relational ways of thinking about the entanglements of human and machine assemblages within generative artificial intelligence. The project leverages interconnected ecological stories and the language of textiles to provide novel perspectives on the emerging relations between human and machine intelligences. The project uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models to imagine new iterations of endangered Australian butterflies and wildflowers. The generated images are composed into three textile weavings of place: tapestries of the interconnected lives that generate each creature’s ecosystem. By reflecting on the interweaving of conditions that has disrupted each ecological niche, space is opened to think about unseen sensory worlds (Richmond Birdwing butterfly), symbiotic exchange (Bulloak Jewel butterfly), and stewardship of the land (Sunshine Diuris orchid). Each story becomes a fabric both literal and metaphorical, with this ‘textillic thinking’ offering speculative vantage points for approaching artistic and social practice with ML models. Textillic thinking interweaves creativity, collaboration, and care: conditions which are foregrounded in textile-making practices and disrupted in each creature’s ecological story. The creative work is diffracted with the neomaterialism of Rosi Braidotti and Karen Barad, and with the notions of care offered by both Maria Puig de la Bellacasa and the Indigenous Protocol for Artificial Intelligence. Through this reading and practice, the project offers material language for discussing the processes and effects of ML, while emphasizing the responsibility of the human in their design.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Science is being transformed by the increasing capabilities of automation technologies and artificial intelligence (AI). Integrating AI and machine learning (ML) into scientific practice requires changing established research methods while maintaining a scientific understanding of research findings. Researchers are at the forefront of this change, but there is currently little understanding of how they are experiencing these upheavals in scientific practice. In this paper, we examine how researchers working in several research fields (automation engineering, computational design, conservation decision-making, materials science, and synthetic biology) perceive AI/ML technologies used in their work, such as laboratory automation, automated design of experiments, computational design, and computer experiments. We find that researchers emphasised the need for AI/ML technologies to have practical benefits (such as efficiency and improved safety) to justify their use. Researchers were also hesitant to automate data analysis, and the importance of explainability differed between researchers working with laboratory automation and those using AI/ML directly in their research. This difference is due to the different role AI/ML plays in different research fields: laboratory automation performs processes already defined by the researcher and the actions are visible or recorded, while in AI/ML applications the decisions that produced the result may be obscure to the researcher. Understanding the role AI/ML plays in scientific practice is important for ensuring that scientific knowledge continues to grow.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Sensemaking has recently been identified as a driver of society developments, in particular in the context of designing a reasonable, valuable, and fair life. Since the construction of meaning is a crucial momentum in sensemaking processes, the authors investigate how meaning can be constructed in a sustaining form by utilizing digital means of expression, articulation, sharing of information, and creation of artscience artefacts. The authors report on results of exploring cyber-physical-systems with performative methodologies in the context of sensemaking to identify sensemaking processes of entering digital environments and share meaning-making activities through interaction. The collected data from two artscience studies reveal that activities beyond cognition facilitate sensemaking. Aesthetics and embodiment in performing actions are understood to play a role in sensemaking and subsequently effect on the construction of meaning. To investigate the role of the body and aesthetics in sensemaking in digital environments, we were particularly interested in sensemaking through embodied agency and aesthetic awareness, drawing from kinesthetic awareness of performance artists. In the performative activities digital behavior recognition and human task behavior were coupled, on the one hand by performers exploring digital environments actively reflecting on their performative process, on the other hand by a performance artist and choreographer creating performative experiences for audiences. It has been demonstrated in cyber-physical settings and can be utilized in upcoming developments further integrating virtual and physical worlds.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Many of our daily activities are now made more convenient and efficient by virtual assistants, and the day when they can be designed to instruct us in certain skills, such as those needed to make moral judgements, is not far off. In this paper we ask to what extent it would be ethically acceptable for these so-called virtual assistants for moral enhancement to use subtle strategies, known as “nudges”, to influence our decisions. To achieve our goal, we will first characterise nudges in their standard use and discuss the debate they have generated around their possible manipulative character, establishing three conditions of manipulation. Secondly, we ask whether nudges can occur in moral virtual assistants that are not manipulative. After critically analysing some proposed virtual assistants, we argue in favour of one of them, given that by pursuing an open and neutral moral enhancement, it promotes and respects the autonomy of the person as much as possible. Thirdly, we analyse how nudges could enhance the functioning of such an assistant, and evaluate them in terms of their degree of threat to the subject’s autonomy and their level of transparency. Finally, we consider the possibility of using motivational nudges, which not only help us in the formation of moral judgements but also in our moral behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Artificial intelligence represents a key technology being inbuilt into evermore products. Research investigating attitudes towards artificial intelligence surprisingly is still scarce, although it becomes apparent that artificial intelligence will shape societies around the globe. To better understand individual differences in attitudes towards artificial intelligence, the present study investigated in n = 351 participants associations between the Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales (ANPS) and the Attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence framework (ATAI). It could be observed that in particular higher levels of SADNESS were associated with higher negative attitudes towards AI (fearing AI). The findings are discussed in this work from an evolutionary perspective because primary emotional systems—according to Affective Neuroscience Theory—represent tools for survival, which have been homologously conserved across mammalian species including homo sapiens.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Artificial intelligent (AI) systems that perform image classification tasks are being used to great success in many application contexts. However, many of these systems are opaque, even to experts. This lack of understanding can be problematic for ethical, legal, or practical reasons. The research field Explainable AI (XAI) has therefore developed several approaches to explain image classifiers. The hope is to bring about understanding, e.g., regarding why certain images are classified as belonging to a particular target class. Most of these approaches use visual explanations. Drawing on Elgin’s work (True enough. MIT Press, Cambridge, 2017), I argue that analyzing what those explanations exemplify can help to assess their suitability for producing understanding. More specifically, I suggest to distinguish between two forms of examples according to their suitability for producing understanding. I call these forms samples and exemplars, respectively. Samples are prone to misinterpretation and thus carry the risk of leading to misunderstanding. Exemplars, by contrast, are intentionally designed or chosen to meet contextual requirements and to mitigate the risk of misinterpretation. They are thus preferable for bringing about understanding. By reviewing several XAI approaches directed at image classifiers, I show that most of them explain with samples. If my analysis is correct, it will be beneficial if such explainability methods use explanations that qualify as exemplars.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Scholarship on embedding values in AI is growing. In what follows, we distinguish two concepts of AI and argue that neither is amenable to values being ‘embedded’. If we think of AI as computational artifacts, then values and AI cannot be added together because they are ontologically distinct. If we think of AI as sociotechnical systems, then components of values and AI are in the same ontologic category—they are both social. However, even here thinking about the relationship as one of ‘embedding’ is a mischaracterization. The relationship between values and AI is best understood as a dimension of the relationship between technology and society, a relationship that can be theorized in multiple ways. The literature in this area is consistent in showing that technology and society are co-productive. Within the co-production framework, the relationship between values and AI is shown to be generative of new meaning. This stands in stark contrast to the framework of ‘embedding’ values which frames values as fixed things that can be inserted into technological artifacts.",

    "title": "Artificial intelligence (AI)-poverty-economic growth nexus in selected BRICS-Plus countries: does the moderating role of governance matter?",
    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) aim to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1 (poverty eradication) and SDG 8 (sustainable economic growth), yet the moderating role of governance in artificial intelligence (AI)-poverty-growth nexus remains underexplored. Therefore, this study investigates the AI-poverty-economic growth nexus in selected BRICS-Plus countries (2012–2023), with governance as a moderating variable, using the Cross-Sectional Augmented Autoregressive Distributed Lag (CS-ARDL) technique. The results show a long-term equilibrium among variables, with unidirectional causality: (i) from growth to AI, and (ii) from AI to poverty and governance quality. The findings highlight AI’s transformative potential in tackling poverty and governance issues, with economic growth enabling AI advancements. This underscores the critical need to integrate AI within governance frameworks to address development challenges effectively. The short-run CS-ARDL results for the growth model indicate that AI and governance boost growth, though their interaction diminishes AI's impact. In the long-run, both sustain growth, with stricter governance moderating AI's potential. For the poverty model, AI increases poverty in the short-run, while governance reduces poverty by improving resource allocation and mitigating AI's impacts. The interaction between AI and governance highlights their role in moderating AI’s adverse effects. In the long-run, AI modestly worsens poverty, while governance alleviates poverty by promoting growth and redistributing AI-driven gains. The policy implications stress improving governance to balance AI’s economic benefits and mitigate poverty, emphasizing equitable resource allocation to harness AI’s potential for sustainable growth.",

While a step in the right direction, they currently fail to impact practice. Our work discusses reasons for this lack of impact and clusters them into five areas: (1) the abstract nature of RAI guidelines, (2) the problem of selecting and reconciling values, (3) the difficulty of operationalising RAI success metrics, (4) the fragmentation of the AI pipeline, and (5) the lack of internal advocacy and accountability. Afterwards, we introduce a number of approaches to RAI from a range of disciplines, exploring their potential as solutions to the identified challenges. We anchor these solutions in practice through concrete examples, bridging the gap between the theoretical considerations of RAI and on-the-ground processes that currently shape how AI systems are built. Our work considers the socio-technical nature of RAI limitations and the resulting necessity of producing socio-technical solutions.",

    "title": "Redefining intelligence: collaborative tinkering of healthcare professionals and algorithms as hybrid entity in public healthcare decision-making",
    "abstract": "AbstractThis paper analyzes the collaboration between healthcare professionals and algorithms in making decisions within the realm of public healthcare. By extending the concept of ‘tinkering’ from previous research conducted by philosopher Mol (Care in practice. On tinkering in clinics, homes and farms Verlag, Amsterdam, 2010) and anthropologist Pols (Health Care Anal 18: 374–388, 2009), who highlighted the improvisational and adaptive practices of healthcare professionals, this paper reveals that in the context of digitalizing healthcare, both professionals and algorithms engage in what I call ‘collaborative tinkering’ as they navigate the intricate and unpredictable nature of healthcare situations together. The paper draws upon an idea that is increasingly common in academic literature, namely that healthcare professionals and the algorithms they use can form a hybrid decision-making entity, challenging the conventional notion of agency and intelligence as being exclusively confined to individual humans or machines. Drawing upon an international, ethnographic study conducted in different hospitals around the world, the paper describes empirically how humans and algorithms come to decisions together, making explicit how, in the practice of daily work, agency and intelligence are distributed among a range of actors, including humans, technologies, knowledge resources, and the spaces where they interact. The concept of collaborative tinkering helps to make explicit how both healthcare professionals and algorithms engage in adaptive improvisation. This exploration not only enriches the understanding of collaborative dynamics between humans and AI but also problematizes the individualistic conception of AI that still exists in regulatory frameworks. By introducing empirical specificity through ethnographic insights and employing an anthropological perspective, the paper calls for a critical reassessment of current ethical and policy frameworks governing human–AI collaboration in healthcare, thereby illuminating direct implications for the future of AI ethics in medical practice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Virtual Influencers (VIs) have become the most prolific research subjects in human–computer interaction and mass media and communication studies from a plethora of perspectives. Developed to integrate social traits and anthropomorphic minds in their social media posts, human-like VIs engage with followers via visually authentic personae, emotionally captivating multimodal storytelling, and semio-pragmatic labor-intensive strategies in conformity with the expectations (and pressures) of the contemporary influencer culture. Informed by Belk’s revisited model of and timely scholarly works on the extended self, we introduce a new conceptualization of the virtual self that performs identity in platformized spaces. To examine virtual personae’s identity performance, we adopt a trans-disciplinary mixed-method forensic netnographic research design, synergizing computer vision, natural language processing, and semio-pragmatic analytical tools. A convenient sample of 334 (sponsored) posts, retrieved from the official Instagram account of the quintessential virtual agent Lil Miquela, is scrutinized taking into consideration her posts’ images and accompanying captions. The paper carries out the tripartite analysis in serious attempt to unravel: (a) how humanoid her synthesized images appear to the naked eye in quest of authenticity building; (b) the techno-affects that contribute to her identity performance; and (c) the semio-pragmatic affordances appropriated and deployed in Instagrammable spaces, showcasing how the three serve the performance of her digital identity. Valuable insights reveal that her agency draws heavily on algorithmization and semiotic immateriality to produce action. The study’s findings contribute to the existing body of literature on VIs and the extended self within the context of artificial intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Curiosity is having its moment in AI engineering. Governments and Big Tech alike frame the trait as a key characteristic of data scientists. This paper offers a qualitative analysis of the perspectives of AI engineers on the importance of curiosity in their profession. The results of this study—which took place at a technology multinational of over 250 k + employees—warn that unless curiosity is carefully defined, detached from masculinized interpretations of what it entails, and linked to ethical development practices, the current emphasis on curiosity risks promoting harmful curiosity-based engineering practices. The paper begins by exposing the consequences of curiosity’s configuration within existing corporate and social inequalities. It then reviews theoretical literature on the gendering of skills and attributes in AI engineering. Having synthesized evidence of curiosity’s importance in corporate AI engineering, it draws on new qualitative data to draw out key themes that might be contributing to the gendering of curiosity, before exploring these themes in their wider context through the theoretical literature. It ends by outlining ways that curiosity-based engineering could promote rather than hinder ethical AI.",

The distinguishing contribution of this study resides in its focus on how CI laborers’ creativity perception and reception are affected by AI technologies’ intrusion into the creative domain. Creative AI technologies are expected to present new expressive capacities to creative workers and cost-cutting advantages for CIs’ production that  put a lot of creative jobs at risk. Findings show that creatives perceive the adaptation of AI technologies as both an opportunity for their creative process and a requirement of their active presence in the market survival as a matter of technocratic rule. We critically analyze creative labor’s novel mods engaged with updated technology and present reflections on the favorable co-creation conditions to flourish an understanding of socially intelligible technology and thereby a creative livelihood against technocracy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          This paper develops a critical theory of artificial intelligence, within a historical constellation where computational systems increasingly generate cultural content that destabilises traditional distinctions between human and machine production. Through this analysis, I introduce the concept of the algorithmic condition, a cultural moment when machine-generated work not only becomes indistinguishable from human creation but actively reshapes our understanding of ideas of authenticity. This transformation, I argue, moves beyond false consciousness towards what I call post-consciousness, where the boundaries between individual and synthetic consciousness become porous. Drawing on critical theory and extending recent work on computational ideology, I develop three key theoretical contributions, first, the concept of the Inversion to describe a new computational turn in algorithmic society; second, automimetric production as a framework for understanding emerging practices of automated value creation; and third, constellational analysis as a methodological approach for mapping the complex interplay of technical systems, cultural forms and political economic structures. Through these contributions, I argue that we need new critical methods capable of addressing both the technical specificity of AI systems and their role in restructuring forms of life under computational capitalism. The paper concludes by suggesting that critical reflexivity is needed to engage with the algorithmic condition without being subsumed by it and that it represents a growing challenge for contemporary critical theory.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          This article is a philosophical study that examines power and resistance within the conceptual network of post-phenomenological theories of technological mediation. In the contemporary landscape, the interaction between human beings and technology plays a crucial role in shaping social, cultural, and political dynamics. As human beings increasingly emerge into a world permeated by technological innovations, it becomes essential to understand the complex power relations that arise from this intertwining. In this context, post-phenomenological theories of technological mediation offer a valuable theoretical framework capable of exploring the nuances of these interactions. The study begins by positioning power and resistance within this conceptual network. It then explores the complex interactions of power in technologically mediated relationships, with particular emphasis on the technologies incorporated into social media platforms, i.e., algorithmic recommendation systems. Drawing on the concepts of power as defined by Michel Foucault and Byung-Chul Han, the paper challenges conventional understandings of productive power by examining how these platforms shape and exert influence. Ultimately, it introduces the concept of intelligent power as a means to better understand the power dynamics inherent in algorithmic mediation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          From a 4E cognition framework, this article compares earlier cultural and technologically mediated expert practices with contemporary use of digital technology. I discuss two case studies. First, the art of memory, where I look at how medieval monks constructed memory palaces inside their minds to enable creative thinking and how Renaissance thinker Giulio Camillo built on this tradition to create a complex machine to think. The second example is of literary writing, where I look at how writers engage with the materiality of language and the writing material, creating new cognitive opportunities. Finally, I compare these earlier practices with contemporary digital technology, discussing both continuous and novel aspects. First, I examine how all practices engineer the cognitive surroundings of its practitioners to enable new cognitive possibilities. However, this comparative work also allows me to spot a worrisome novelty in digital technology. In many cases, the goals of such technology are contrary to those of its users. Drawing on discussions both outside and inside the 4E framework, I argue that digital technology introduces economic agency into our minds. I suggest that when we extend our minds in the digital ecology, we allow powerful economic actors to shape the direction of our cognitive lives in ways that are contrary to our own goals. Finally, I argue, building on the case studies, that my discussion might point to a new and more pragmatic approach to these issues.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          In this paper, we focus on privacy risks in smart home environments and their implications for privacy and data protection. As with other Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the collection and processing of user data in smart home environments currently lack transparency and control. Smart home applications operate within the home, a space that is both morally and legally particularly protected and characterized by a implicit expectation of privacy from the user’s perspective. In contrast to these higher privacy risks, the current regulatory efforts are not yet up to speed with respect to smart home environments. As an interim workaround solution, in this paper, we propose a meta-assistant for the smart home that increases users’ data autonomy and thereby their privacy. In the first section, we give a brief overview of smart home applications, their data collection mechanisms, and the implications for user privacy. Following this, we argue in the second section that consent to datafication, i.e., the prevalent legal option to obtain legal grounds for data collection and processing, in most smart home contexts is—albeit legally sufficient—morally inadequate to provide meaningful possibilities for users to exercise their data autonomy and manage their privacy. The third section introduces an interim solution, outlining the possibility of a meta-assistant, which is capable of operating all other devices—if necessary, by shutting them off completely.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          This paper establishes a connection between the fields of machine learning (ML) and philosophy concerning the phenomenon of behaving neutrally. It investigates a specific class of ML systems capable of delivering a neutral response to a given task, referred to as abstaining machine learning systems, that has not yet been studied from a philosophical perspective. The paper introduces and explains various abstaining machine learning systems, and categorizes them into distinct types. An examination is conducted on how abstention in the different machine learning system types aligns with the epistemological counterpart of suspended judgment, addressing both the nature of suspension and its normative profile. Additionally, a philosophical analysis is suggested on the autonomy and explainability of the abstaining response. It is argued, specifically, that one of the distinguished types of abstaining systems is preferable as it aligns more closely with our criteria for suspended judgment. Moreover, it is better equipped to autonomously generate abstaining outputs and offer explanations for abstaining outputs when compared to the other type.",

    "title": "Ethical and epistemic implications of artificial intelligence in medicine: a stakeholder-based assessment",
    "abstract": "Abstract\n          As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies become increasingly embedded in high-stakes fields such as healthcare, ethical and epistemic considerations raise the need for evaluative frameworks to assess their societal impacts across multiple dimensions. This paper uses the ethical-epistemic matrix (EEM), a structured framework that integrates both ethical and epistemic principles, to evaluate medical AI applications more comprehensively. Building on the ethical principles of well-being, autonomy, justice, and explicability, the matrix introduces epistemic principles—accuracy, consistency, relevance, and instrumental efficacy—that assess AI’s role in knowledge production. This dual approach enables a nuanced assessment that reflects the diverse perspectives of stakeholders within the medical field—patients, clinicians, developers, the public, and health policy-makers—who assess AI systems differently based on distinct interests and epistemic goals. Although the EEM has been outlined conceptually before, no published research paper has yet used it explore the ethical and epistemic implications arising in its key intended application domain of AI in medicine. Through a systematic demonstration of the EEM as applied to medical AI, this paper argues that it encourages a broader understanding of AI’s implications and serves as a valuable methodological tool for evaluating future uses. This is illustrated with the case study of AI systems in sleep apnea detection, where the EEM highlights the ethical trade-offs and epistemic challenges that different stakeholders may perceive, which can be made more concrete if the tool is embedded in future technical projects.",

    "title": "Trust influence on AI HR tools perceived usefulness in Swiss HRM: the mediating roles of perceived fairness and privacy concerns",
    "abstract": "Abstract\n          This study looks at factors influencing, first, trust in artificial intelligence (AI) systems in human resources management, second, perceived usefulness of these tools. Based on a survey experiment provided to 324 private and public Swiss HR professionals’, it first explores how some trust in automation framework’s predictors are related to trust in HR AI tools and, then, how this trust is in return related to UTAUT’s perceived usefulness of these AI-enhanced tools. To do this, the following article is based on a PLS-SEM structural equation model. Its main findings are that reliability, familiarity, intention of developers and propensity to trust are directly positively related to trust in the HR AI tools studied here. Nevertheless, public employees declare more negative feelings toward AI in HRM. Indeed, the latter systematically have less trust in HR AI than private employees. However, public sector employees do not find them any less useful or efficient than private sector employees, except when it comes to the HR AI tools used to assess employee performance and behavior. In addition to this, trust in these tools is systematically positively linked to their perceived usefulness. This influence is partly mediated by the perceived decision fairness of our tools, but not by the absence of privacy concerns associated with them. This said, this article makes a significant contribution to the literature about private and public actors’ perceptions of nascent HR AI-enhanced tools.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          This article aims to affirm and instantiate the main accounts showing intrinsic limitations of artificial intelligence computing in a real world of organisms, people and speech. It is argued that these limits mainly concern non-ergodic (or non-repeating) phenomena. This paper aims to extend the debate on the limits of AI through a preliminary examination of the dispersion of both regularities and non-ergodic phenomena and processes in both society and human persons. It is argued that regularities and non-ergodic processes are deeply intertwined. Social regularity, for example from the built environment and conformity, is discussed. In society, non-ergodicity is especially found in the lifeworld of speech and intersubjectivity. The human person creates non-ergodicity through numerous routes. Individual regularities are seen in things such as habit and routine. This study asserts that human intersubjective life in the often nonergodic lifeworld and inbuilt non-repeating dimensions of an individual’s living out of the world, should be recognized as extensive areas where AI prediction will be weak. It is hypothesized that the intensity of non-ergodicity in phenomena is a firm indicator of weak AI prediction, and that most successful AI prediction of social phenomena predominantly reflects the sort of social regularities discussed in this article.",

    "title": "Between fact and fairy: tracing the hallucination metaphor in AI discourse",
    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Large and powerful language models such as OpenAI’s GPT model family, Google’s LaMDA and BERT or Meta’s LlaMA are integral to many applications, such as translation, summarization or language generation. They have become an inherent part of current everyday activities and working practices. These models produce and process language in an impressively convincing human-like manner, but also repeatedly generate outputs that appear untrustworthy and factually incorrect. In computer science (Ji et al. 2023) and popular discourse alike this phenomenon is called hallucination. The term is used broadly to describe various forms of untruthfulness, from factual errors to inconsistencies between prompt and output. This article discusses the hallucination metaphor guided by STS perspectives and takes software documentation as its main corpus of analysis. We examine model papers and documentation from leading tech companies to trace the hallucination metaphor and the discursive work it does. We claim that tech companies anthropomorphize the models, relieving them and themselves from responsibility over non-factual outputs by normalizing the use of the metaphor. Models are relegated to two main positions: either a learning child that needs time to develop or an illogic agent, a position that we connect to cultural scripts of madness.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The advent of AI-generated art necessitates a re-examination of the concept of “aura,” as originally posited by Walter Benjamin, and challenges prevailing perceptions of authenticity and originality in art. This systematic review addresses a critical gap in existing literature by exploring how AI reshapes these foundational concepts, positioning this study within an emergent and under-investigated field. While Benjamin’s aura historically conveys an irreplaceable quality inherent to unique artworks, AI-generated pieces blur the lines between original and reproduction, fundamentally questioning established aesthetic and ontological values. Through an interdisciplinary synthesis of ethical, legal, and philosophical perspectives, this review identifies polarized views: some scholars advocate AI’s democratizing effect on creativity, while others criticize its perceived lack of emotional depth and authenticity. Additionally, human-AI collaborations are highlighted as a fertile area for expanding traditional artistic practices, suggesting an emergent, hybridized form of aura that stems from the synergy of human intention and machine execution. By filling a gap in current scholarship, this study provides a robust foundation for future empirical research, inviting a reconceptualization of authorship, value, and aesthetic experience in the digital art landscape.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          This article investigates the pervasive issue of bias within AI-driven cultural heritage collections, emphasizing how digital technologies both inherit and amplify existing societal and historical prejudices embedded in analogue records. It outlines the multifaceted nature of bias—ranging from data selection and annotation to algorithmic design and user interaction—demonstrating how each stage of the AI pipeline can introduce or perpetuate distortions in representation. Through a critical review of current scholarship and practical case studies, particularly in image classification, the article evaluates technical strategies such as data augmentation, adversarial debiasing, and monitoring plans for bias mitigation. The findings reveal that while methods like noise injection and colour jittering can balance datasets and improve model fairness, effective bias mitigation ultimately depends on interdisciplinary collaboration between heritage professionals, subject experts, and data scientists. The article concludes that addressing bias requires an ongoing, holistic approach, integrating both technical and humanistic perspectives from data collection to model deployment. This ensures more inclusive, accurate, and ethically sound representations of cultural heritage, supporting the sector’s goals of diversity and accessibility for future audiences.",

A research lab is identified as a ‘complex adaptive system’ and forms the basis of a longitudinal case study on the Human Centered bottom-up approach to digitisation of cultural heritage. Components required to support and nurture the growth of a Participation Action Research lab are identified. The novel ‘ENRICHER’ method embodies human centeredness and is operationalized, tested, evaluated and findings discussed. Examples of emergence are also discussed. A metric of the ENRICHER method initially identified where the lab did not fully meet all the methods 8 points. Subsequent actions adjusted the holonic lens focus to metadata and the ongoing work on the creation of a cataloging tool for the librarians. The use of XML technologies integrates the work into a larger model of intelligence. It positions the work on the semantic web technology stack and opens up the pathway to ontology generation and development and management of large language models. The ENRICHER method is a way of developing human–machine symbiotics that also incorporate AI e.g. transcription, metadata generation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          A catastrophic AI threat model is a rigorous exploration of some particular mechanisms by which AI could potentially lead to catastrophic outcomes. In this article, I explore a polycrisis threat model. According to this model, AI will lead to a series of harms like disinformation and increased concentration of wealth and power. Interactions between these different harms will make things worse than they would have been had each harm operated in isolation. And the interacting harms will ultimately cause or constitute a catastrophe. My aim in this paper is not to defend the inevitability of such a polycrisis occurring. Instead, I aspire merely to establish that polycrisis-driven catastrophe is sufficiently plausible that it calls for further exploration. In doing so, I hope to emphasise that alongside worries about AI takeover, those concerned about catastrophic risk from AI should also take seriously worries about extreme power concentration and systemic disempowerment of humanity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          AI systems are increasingly in a position to have deep and systemic impacts on human wellbeing. Projects in value alignment, a critical area of AI safety research, must ultimately aim to ensure that all those who stand to be affected by such systems have good reason to accept their outputs. This is especially challenging where AI systems are involved in making morally controversial decisions. In this paper, we consider three current approaches to value alignment: crowdsourcing, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and constitutional AI. We argue that all three fail to accommodate reasonable moral disagreement, since they provide neither good epistemic reasons nor good political reasons for accepting AI systems’ morally controversial outputs. Since these appear to be the most promising approaches to value alignment currently on offer, we conclude that accommodating reasonable moral disagreement remains an open problem for AI safety, and we offer guidance for future research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          With the diffusion of new technologies, “moral panics” often tend to emerge, with news outlets frequently seen as catalysts. However, empirical evidence on their specific role still remains scarce. The rise of ChatGPT offers a unique chance to observe a new form of moral technology panic in real time. Using a longitudinal survey of a Dutch quota sample and computational content analysis of Dutch news coverage on ChatGPT, we examined whether both news attention and public perceptions of ChatGPT’s societal impact increased and became more negative over time. We linked survey-based exposure measures with automated content-analysis-based news characteristics to assess the news media’s role in moral panic creation. While the public quickly became aware of ChatGPT, we found no clear indication of a moral panic in the news or among respondents. Moreover, news exposure ultimately did not influence perceptions of ChatGPT’s societal impact. We discuss implications for moral panic theories.",

We argue that a wider sociopolitical context shapes it and explore this argument using Esping-Andersen’s welfare state regime typology and a survey of university students from two distinct welfare regimes. Our findings reveal important differences and the effect of age on preference for the role of the state. Students in the UK favor decentralized, individualistic regulations, aligning with the liberal welfare model, while students in Poland support a balanced approach, consistent with a post-socialist welfare model.",

However, the requirement that artificial testifiers must satisfy for successful knowledge acquisition is different from the requirement that human testifiers must satisfy. Correspondingly, the epistemic ground of artificial testimonial knowledge is not the well-known and accepted ones suggested by renowned epistemological theories of (human) testimony. Based on Thomas Reid’s old teaching, we suggest a novel epistemological theory of artificial testimony that for receivers to justifiably believe artificially generated statements, testifiers of the statement should robustly perform the propensities of veracity and cautiousness. The theory transforms the weakness of Reid’s view to an advantage of its own. It sets an achievable standard for LLMs and clarifies the improvement that current LLMs should make for meeting the standard. Moreover, it indicates a pluralistic nature of testimonial justification pertaining to the pluralistic nature of possible testifiers for knowledge transmission.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Although there is a wide range of scientific papers introducing artificial intelligence techniques in the mental health field, there is a lack of literature assessing the reporting of ethical concerns in such studies. In addition, it is not yet known whether the authors seek ethical approval or informed consent while performing such research. This study aimed to investigate the extent to which studies in the mental health domain that utilize chatbots either ignore or incompletely disclose patient consent and ethical approval from the responsible review boards. A scoping literature search was performed in PsychARTICLES, PubMed, and Web of Science using both MeSH terms and free-text keywords. Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we also contacted study authors to verify missing information about ethical approval or informed consent, enhancing the transparency and rigor of our analysis. Among the 27 studies reviewed, 13 reported obtaining ethical approval, and 16 reported collecting informed consent. The remaining studies did not provide such information. These findings underscore the ethical complexities surrounding AI in mental health, especially regarding the collection, storage, and use of sensitive patient data. There is a correlation between sample size and the acquisition of ethical approval, particularly in studies published in journals with low-impact factors. Future research should investigate the role of journal policies in influencing ethical practices. In addition, training programs could be developed to educate researchers on the importance of ethics, particularly in studies with smaller sample sizes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The advent of ChatGPT, and the subsequent rapid improvement in the performance of what has become known as Generative AI, has led to many pundits declaring that AI will revolutionize education, as well as work, in the future. In this paper, we argue that enthusiasm for the use of AI in tertiary education is misplaced. A proper understanding of the nature of the outputs of AI suggests that it would be profoundly misguided to replace human teachers with AI, while the history of automation in other settings suggests that it is naïve to think that AI can be developed to assist human teachers without replacing them. The dream that AI could teach students effectively neglects the importance of ‘learning how’ in order to ‘learn that’, that teachers are also role models, and the social nature of education. To the extent that students need to learn how to use AI, they should do so in specialized study skills units. Rather than creating a market for dodgy educational AI by lowering their ambitions about what they can offer, universities should invest in smaller class sizes and teachers who are passionate about their disciplines. To flourish in the future, just as much as they do today, societies will need people who have learned to think and not—or not just—intelligent machines.",

Through a reflexive qualitative analysis of data collected during the workshops, we examine the obstacles to AI literacy development among journalists and the quality of resources currently available to them for learning about AI and AI ethics. We highlight the most pressing needs in AI-focused education for journalists and surface participants’ ideas for potential solutions, including an authoritative online compendium on AI and journalism and a database of diverse expert voices.

    "title": "Less and more than data: a Lacanian inquiry into self-formation in the age of data mining",
    "abstract": "Abstract\n          This paper explores how data mining can redefine and reshape human identity, transforming the self into a fluid construct continuously shaped through ongoing profiling. To understand this transformation, we draw on Lacan’s theory of subjectivity and his conception of desire as the engine of subjectivity. Rejecting essentialist notions of the self, Lacan argues that identity is formed within—and through—social, cultural, and, as we emphasize here, technological contexts. We examine how data mining affects processes of self-formation in this technological era, using Lacanian theory as a framework to analyze its impact. We argue that data mining does not simply replicate traditional symbolic processes; rather, it introduces a different dynamic that can disrupt established modes of symbolic identification rooted in social norms, laws, and customs. This disruption may result in forms of de-identification but also opens the possibility for new types of self-identification. We propose that this transformation has a double effect: it both dissolves elements of the traditional Symbolic order and simultaneously gives rise to a new Symbolic—one that aims to define and regulate emerging identities. We believe that this tension presents both a challenge and an opportunity for contemporary processes of self-formation.",

    "title": "Exploring acceptability of AI-enabled voice assistants and digital AI humans in healthcare: a cross-sectional survey",
    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Artificial intelligence, including Digital AI Humans (DHs) and Voice Assistants (VAs), offers new opportunities for healthcare delivery but may widen inequalities. This cross-sectional online survey examined factors influencing the acceptability of these technologies among 472 UK adults, considering demographics, digital literacy, healthcare access, familiarity with DHs and VAs, personality traits, and attitudes.\n          VA acceptability was assessed using logistic regression, with willingness to use VAs as the outcome variable. Lower acceptance was found among women, ethnic minorities, those with lower education levels, and individuals who infrequently searched for health information online. Conversely, higher acceptance was associated with engagement in online health discussions, greater awareness and use of VAs, perceived usefulness, fewer perceived barriers, and openness. DH acceptability was analysed through multiple regression, with attitudes toward DHs as the outcome variable. More positive attitudes were linked to White/Irish/European ethnicity, a greater perceived need for in-person care, participation in online health discussions, higher conscientiousness, and lower neuroticism, explaining 27.8% of the variance. Although 85.8% had used VAs and 82.2% owned one, only 25.8% reported daily use. Awareness of DHs was reported by 70.3% of participants, with attitudes generally positive (median score: 2.17/5, where lower scores indicate greater favourability). Institutional endorsement was a key factor, with 71.2% stating they would use VAs for healthcare if approved by the NHS. These findings support technology acceptance models, highlighting the roles of perceived usefulness, ease of use, and awareness. Culturally responsive design principles that address these factors may enhance adoption across diverse groups. Distinct personality traits influenced acceptance, with openness predicting VA acceptability, while conscientiousness and low neuroticism were associated with more positive attitudes toward DHs. While offering novel insights into human factors influencing AI adoption in healthcare, the study is limited by its reliance on proxy measures for acceptance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          This article situates current deep learning (DL) artificial intelligence (AI) within Leroi-Gourhan’s deep history of the human species’ relation to technology. According to Leroi-Gourhan, technology is both a key element of anthropogenesis and a source of later tensions (or disentanglement) between the human species and its external and increasingly autonomous technics. Human organic (life-oriented) intelligence at first extends itself through technical (machine-oriented) intelligence, only to be later left behind by it. We propose a concept of machine intelligence that goes beyond technical intelligence, the latter a (still) hybrid human–machine intelligence. This new, emerging machine intelligence is DL AI. DL AI developed out of the failure of symbolic AI to instantiate a key generic component of intelligence: creativity. While symbolic AI was rigid and pre-programmed, DL is flexible and unpredictable, presenting an embryonic form of actual machine intelligence. Its creativity can be likened to the ancient Greek concept of metis, a cunning and polymorphous form of intelligence. Although often biased and problematic, DL exhibits a machine creativity that goes beyond the anthropocentric imaginings of AI as a (mechanistic) imitation of the human norm.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          This article examines the transformative impact of AI-based art generators by extending Walter Benjamin’s arguments on mechanical reproduction to the digital age. While Benjamin examined how mechanical reproduction affected works created with clear human intentionality, AI generated art introduces a fundamentally different dynamic through ‘distributed agency’ across human prompters, algorithmic interpretation mechanisms, and collective training datasets.\n          Through an analysis of four key examples that illustrate different aspects of AI’s influence on artistic practice—generative AI art platforms, the Portrait of Edmond de Belamy, Refik Anadol’s Archive Dreaming, and The 2023 Sony World Photography Awards controversy—the study advances four interconnected arguments: first, that generative AI reconfigures creative agency beyond traditional human-centered models; second, that AI establishes new dialogic relationships between creators, artworks, and audiences; third, that algorithmic generation differs fundamentally from mechanical reproduction by creating novel interpretative expressions rather than duplicating existing works; and fourth, that AI transforms the societal dimensions of artistic production through a dialectical relationship between democratization and proletarianization.\n          By critically extending Benjamin’s framework to address contemporary technological conditions, this study provides theoretical foundations for understanding art in an age of algorithmic creation. The findings reveal how AI both fulfills and challenges Benjamin’s predictions about technological art reproduction while creating new epistemic and sociotechnical configurations that require reconceptualizing traditional notions of artistic authenticity, creative agency, and cultural preservation in an era of increasing algorithmic mediation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          AI algorithms require human input to achieve technological aims. This fact is often overlooked in discussions of autonomous systems and AI safety, to the detriment of both philosophical discourse and practical progress. One potential remedy is to ground our theorizing more fundamentally in the idea that AI technologies are sociotechnological systems with human and artifactual components. In this article, I pursue this strategy, aiming to shift the focus in AI ethics from artifacts and their intrinsic properties—what I refer to as the robotic conception of AI—to the relationships among elements embedded in AI-involving sociotechnological systems. First, I defend the claim that the sociotechnological-system perspective provides an accurate description of some of our most advanced AI. Second, I argue that the dominance of the robotic conception has steered AI safety research down unproductive paths, while the sociotechnological perspective has the capacity to set us right. Specifically, the robotic conception encourages the development of artificial moral agents—whose creation we should avoid if possible—and distracts researchers with hypothetical trolley cases. In contrast, the sociotechnological approach coheres with actual progress being made on AI safety (e.g., networking, shared user-artifact control, and value alignment) and makes vivid solutions to the safety problem that do not require the creation of humnanlike moral decision-makers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          What do we fear when we fear AI? This paper presents the claim that robophobia is autophobia, the fear of AI is the fear of ourselves, in at least two fashions. First, I frame the question in relation to what I call the Western machine-takeover imaginary, and identify two historical tracks: (1) the fear of non-human autonomy and (2) the logic of the genie. The first track is rooted in the idea of the domination of creations and their possible revolt, a trope that reflects the anthropogenetic narratives that guide Western self-understanding. The second track establishes a link between cultural understanding of non-human, wish-fulfilling others, and modern AI drones and chatbots in terms of potential asymmetries between inputs and outputs, instructions and execution. When biased inputs inform system outputs that inform human inputs in a hermeneutical circle, the outputs we fear cannot be separated from the inputs we generate.",

    "title": "Spaces for democracy with generative artificial intelligence: public architecture at stake",
    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Urban space is an important infrastructure for democracy and fosters democratic engagement, such as meetings, discussions, and protests. Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems could affect democracy through urban space, for example, by breaching data privacy, hindering political equality and engagement, or manipulating information about places. This research explores the urban places that promote democratic engagement according to the outputs generated with ChatGPT-4o. This research moves beyond the dominant framework of discussions on AI and democracy as a form of spreading misinformation and fake news. Instead, it provides an innovative framework, combining architectural space as an infrastructure for democracy and the way in which generative AI tools provide a nuanced view of democracy that could potentially influence millions of people. This article presents a new conceptual framework for understanding AI for democracy from the perspective of architecture. For the first case study in Stockholm, Sweden, AI outputs were later combined with GIS maps and a theoretical framework. The research then analyzes the results obtained for Madrid, Spain, and Brussels, Belgium. This analysis provides deeper insights into the outputs obtained with AI, the places that facilitate democratic engagement and those that are overlooked, and the ensuing consequences.Results show that urban space for democratic engagement obtained with ChatGPT-4o for Stockholm is mainly composed of governmental institutions and non-governmental organizations for representative or deliberative democracy and the education of individuals in public buildings in the city centre. The results obtained with ChatGPT-40 barely reflect public open spaces, parks, or routes. They also prioritize organized rather than spontaneous engagement and do not reflect unstructured events like demonstrations, and powerful actors, such as political parties, or workers’ unions. The places listed by ChatGPT-4o for Madrid and Brussels give major prominence to private spaces like offices that house organizations with political activities. While cities offer a broad and complex array of places for democratic engagement, outputs obtained with AI can narrow users’ perspectives on their real opportunities, while perpetuating powerful agents by not making them sufficiently visible to be accountable for their actions. In conclusion, urban space is a fundamental infrastructure for democracy, and AI outputs could be a valid starting point for understanding the plethora of interactions. These outputs should be complemented with other forms of knowledge to produce a more comprehensive framework that adjusts to reality for developing AI in a democratic context. Urban space should be protected as a shared space and as an asset for societies to fully develop democracy in its multiple forms. Democracy and urban spaces influence each other and are subject to pressures from different actors including AI. AI systems should, therefore, be monitored to enhance democratic values through urban space.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Artificial intelligence (AI) has seen rapid development over the past decade, leading to its integration into various aspects of human life. The ability to integrate AI systems hinges not solely on their technical efficacy but also on the perceptions held by users or decision-makers. Previous researches indicate that many people harbor concerns about AI, which can hinder the adoption of these technologies. This study uses a pre-registered survey experiment embedded in an online survey in Hungary (N = 2100) to assess trust in AI-based Automated Decision-Making (ADM). Participants were presented with hypothetical decisions in four domains (medical diagnoses, hiring, transportation, and financial investments). In a split-ballot design, participants were randomly assigned to a control group with human involvement and an experimental group where decision were supported by AI-based ADM. The main results show that decisions supported by human intervention are perceived as more trustworthy than those made by ADM (except for financial investment). However, our treatment heterogeneity analysis indicates that these effects are not consistent across all segments of society. A good understanding of AI, low privacy concerns, and an open personality can mitigate the negative impact of AI assistance on trust.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          This article traces the conceptual lineage of AGI through three influential paradigms: strong AI, human-level AI, and AGI—highlighting the philosophical and operational tensions shaping contemporary debates. The article examines emerging reorientations toward operational benchmarks that decouple artificial intelligence from human-like cognition. It proposes a novel taxonomy to evaluate divergent developmental trajectories—Promethean and Noctuidean orientations—and argues that anthropocentric biases may limit recognition of diverse intelligences and amplify risks in AI deployment. Through careful analysis of historical contexts, philosophical arguments, recent technological advances, and emerging legal disputes, this article underscores an urgent need to clarify definitions and goals in the race to AGI.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Since the advent of modern computational technologies, libraries and archives have been harnessing the power of computers to produce electronic finding aids for our archival cultural heritage. Today, with the arrival of generative artificial intelligence (specifically, large language models or LLMs), there are new opportunities to post-process these finding aids and enhance access to archival heritage. In this paper, we present a case study of AI-assisted post-processing; we also show how AI can help unlock cultural heritage if combined with interactive data visualization. Our case study focuses on the Grand Ducal Archive of the Medici, partially digitized and electronically cataloged by the Medici Archive Project. We used generative AI to post-process the electronic catalog of the Medici's early modern period correspondence, developing a prototype visual finding aid. Throughout the paper, we present the post-processing steps and introduce the visual finding aid. In conclusion, we critically examine AI's application in the heritage sector and urge GLAM professionals to embrace the technology and open their collections for AI-assisted post-processing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The primary objective of this study is to determine whether the level of digital literacy among pre-service teachers reliably correlates with their anxiety levels concerning artificial intelligence. The study was conducted as a correlational study, with a sample size of 221 pre-service teachers. The study’s population comprised 3922 pre-service teachers enrolled at Turkish state and private universities. To collect study data, the researchers used the “Personal Information Form,” “Digital Literacy Scale,” and “Artificial Intelligence Anxiety Scale.” The data were analyzed using stepwise regression analysis and descriptive statistics. The study’s results indicated that pre-service teachers exhibited high levels of digital literacy and moderate degrees of anxiety regarding artificial intelligence. Regression analysis revealed that 10.3% of pre-service teachers’ anxiety concerning artificial intelligence could be predicted by the technical sub-dimension of digital literacy. Consequently, it was demonstrated that pre-service teachers’ apprehensions regarding artificial intelligence decreased as their perception of technical digital fluency increased. Other sub-dimensions of digital literacy were deemed insignificant in predicting the anxiety levels of pre-service teachers regarding artificial intelligence. Based on these findings, suggestions for future study directions were proposed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The rise of ChatGPT has emphasized the need for an improved conceptual understanding of users’ agency when interacting with artificial intelligence (AI) systems for healthcare. Australian ChatGPT users (N = 216) completed a repeated measures online survey. Hierarchical regression analyses assessed the influence of demographic factors (age and gender), Technology Acceptance Model constructs (perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use), and extended variables (trust, privacy concerns) on users' behavioral intentions to use ChatGPT for physical and mental healthcare. The proposed model was partially supported: the findings emphasized the need to establish user trust in ChatGPT and its perceived usefulness in both areas of healthcare. Privacy concerns were a significant predictor of intentions to use ChatGPT for mental healthcare with perceived ease of use predicting intentions to use ChatGPT for physical healthcare. The findings indicate predictors of uses of AI cannot be generalized across healthcare types and unique drivers should be considered.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Since the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022, AI activity has reached a fever pitch. Calls for effective ethical responses to the pressurised AI environment have in turn abounded. Posthumanism, which seeks to build ethical futures by de-centring the ‘human’, is an obvious candidate to act as a lynchpin of theoretical intervention. In their responses, posthumanist scholars appear to have embraced AI’s potential to destabilise Humanist philosophical ideas. We critically interrogate this initial enthusiasm. Conceptually distinguishing ‘post-dualist self-development’ (PDSD) from ‘technical self-development’ (TSD), we show how AI prompts an urgent need to advance posthumanist engagement with how technical development unsupervised by humans is ontologically discrete from other forms of material agency. We argue that specific engagement with TSD as distinct from PDSD is a key to avoid ignoring or underestimating Humanist and anthropocentric aspects of current AI innovation, and the influence of anthropomorphism. Without a theoretical reckoning with these tensions, posthumanism in the AI-era runs the risk of potentially promoting technologies that reinvigorate Humanist and anthropocentric expansion. To conclude, we show how a posthumanist ethics of generative AI that pays requisite attention to both TSD and PDSD may enable more anticipatory and nuanced assessments of the risks and benefits of discrete AI technologies to inform public discourse, appropriate social, institutional, policy and governance responses, and direct AI research and development priorities.",

    "title": "Generative AI and the avant-garde: bridging historical innovation with contemporary art",
    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The adoption of generative AI technology in visual arts echoes the transformational process initiated by early 20th-century avant-garde movements such as Constructivism and Dadaism. By utilising technological advances of their time avant-garde artists redefine the role of an artist and what could be considered as artwork. Written from the perspective of an art practitioner and researcher, this paper explores how contemporary artists working with AI continue the radical and experimental spirit that characterised early avant-garde. The re-evaluation of artist roles from sole creators to engineers-collaborators and curators in an AI-mediated creative process underscores a shift in the artistic practice. Through detailed case studies of three contemporary artists, the paper illustrates how generative AI is not only used to create artwork but also to critique technological, cultural, and societal systems. Additionally, it addresses ethical concerns such as AI bias, data commodification, and the environmental impact of AI technologies, situating contemporary generative AI practices within the broader context of art's evolving societal role. Ultimately, the paper underscores the transformation of artistic practice in the digital age, where AI becomes both a creative tool and a subject of critical reflection.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          This paper critically analyses the “attention economy” within the framework of cognitive science and techno-political economics, as applied to both human and machine interactions. We explore how current business models, particularly in digital platform capitalism, harness user engagement by strategically shaping attentional patterns. These platforms utilize advanced AI and massive data analytics to enhance user engagement, creating a cycle of attention capture and data extraction. We review contemporary (neuro)cognitive theories of attention and platform engagement design techniques and criticize classical cognitivist and behaviourist theories for their inadequacies in addressing the potential harms of such engagement on user autonomy and wellbeing. 4E approaches to cognitive science, instead, emphasizing the embodied, extended, enactive, and ecological aspects of cognition, offer us an intrinsic normative standpoint and a more integrated understanding of how attentional patterns are actively constituted by adaptive digital environments. By examining the precarious nature of habit formation in digital contexts, we reveal the techno-economic underpinnings that threaten personal autonomy by disaggregating habits away from the individual, into an AI managed collection of behavioural patterns. Our current predicament suggests the necessity of a paradigm shift towards an ecology of attention. This shift aims to foster environments that respect and preserve human cognitive and social capacities, countering the exploitative tendencies of cognitive capitalism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          We endorse policymakers’ efforts to address the negative consequences of the attention economy’s technology but add that these approaches are often limited in their criticism of the systemic context of human attention. Starting from Buddhist philosophy, we advocate a broader approach: an ‘ecology of attending’ that centers on conceptualizing, designing, and using attention (1) in an embedded way and (2) focused on the alleviating of suffering. With ‘embedded’ we mean that attention is not a neutral, isolated mechanism but a meaning-engendering part of an ‘ecology’ of bodily, sociotechnical and moral frameworks. With ‘focused on the alleviation of suffering’ we mean that we explicitly move away from the (often implicit) conception of attention as a tool for gratifying desires. We analyze existing inquiries in these directions and urge them to be intensified and integrated. As to the design and function of our technological environment, we propose three questions for further research: How can technology help to acknowledge us as ‘ecological’ beings, rather than as self-sufficient individuals? How can technology help to raise awareness of our moral framework? And how can technology increase the conditions for ‘attending’ to the alleviation of suffering, by substituting our covert self-driven moral framework with an ecologically attending one? We believe in the urgency of transforming the inhumane attention economy sociotechnical system into a humane ecology of attending, and in our ability to contribute to it.",

    "title": "The AI-extended professional self: user-centric AI integration into professional practice with exemplars from healthcare",
    "abstract": "Abstract\n          AI technologies are rapidly advancing and have shown potential for providing significant value across a variety of sectors, including healthcare. Much of research has focused on the technologies’ capabilities and pushing their boundaries, with many envisioning AI and AI-enabled robots replacing human labor and humans in the near future. However, in critical domains of professional practice such as healthcare, full replacement is neither realistic nor aimed for, and collaboration between AI and humans is a given for the foreseeable future. This article argues for a shift away from a sole focus on the efficiency and effectiveness of technology, proposing instead that AI-enabled technologies increasingly should learn to adapt to human users considering that healthcare professionals already are overburdened. Rather than contributing to this burden, AI might extend the professional self by anticipating and supporting human needs and intentions. Drawing on a selective meta-synthesis of recent reviews and studies, this article introduces the concept of the AI-extended professional self. This concept suggests a temporary, dynamic integration of human professionals with AI that extends their capabilities with minimal additional burdens regarding training and application. Through three exemplars from healthcare—healthcare consultations, breast cancer screening, and robotic surgery—this article explores how a perspective rooted in the AI-extended professional self might unlock the potential for deeper AI integration into professional practice. Beyond these exemplars, this article calls for interdisciplinary research into the associated potential and challenges, advocating that the burden of AI integration needs to shift from humans to AI-enabled technologies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          This paper proposes a re-examination of connectionist AI failures (controversial incidents) from the perspective of technological use. It advances four categories of failure: technically sound outputs inherent to connectionist programming; machine-world mis-configuration; motivational failure that deploys technology for illegitimate ends; and finally epistemic failure of misapplication where computing and AI are being used to solve for the wrong sets of social problems. Drawing on the history of computing, the paper argues that computational machines and its software (classical or connectionist) are numerical, procedural, and electronic in nature, and therefore, are geared to treat problems through the functions of numerical  calculation, tabulation, approximation, and extrapolation. On account of these limitations, failure ensues when computers meet the many problems that cannot be solved on these grounds. The paper proposes and calls for an ontological comparison between computers and the problems they are pressed to serve prior to any pragmatic deployment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Successful implementation of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology is not only an engineering challenge but also a social, political, and ethical one. As AVs become commonplace and begin affecting people’s daily lives in a more profound way, media coverage of the social and ethical considerations of these technologies will follow suit. We seek to analyze and categorize the media’s portrayal of the social and ethical issues surrounding AVs to better understand how these issues shape public debate. Our research employs a qualitative thematic analysis of existing public discourse, identifying six areas of interest: (1) social and ethical issues; (2) ethical frameworks; (3) recommendations; (4) tone; (5) type of AV technology; and (6) sensationalism. These themes were derived through a combination of inductive and deductive analysis, informed by existing literature on AV ethics and media framing. Through this approach, we aimed to identify salient considerations in AV technology development and inform future AV systems decisions. Our contributions to the study of public visibility seek to enhance product development and the implementation of AVs, which will largely be steered by public discourse.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Riffing off move fast and break things, the internal motto coined by Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, this paper examines the ethical dimensions of human relationships with AI companions, focusing on Character.ai—a platform where users interact with AI-generated ‘characters’ ranging from fictional figures to representations of real people. Drawing on an assessment of the platform’s design, and the first civil lawsuit brought against Character.ai in the USA in 2024 following the suicide of a teenage user, this paper identifies unresolved ethical issues in companion-based AI technologies. These include risks from difficulty in separating AI-based roleplay from real life, unconstrained AI models performing edgy characters, reality detachment, and confusion by dishonest anthropomorphism and emulated empathy. All have implications for safety measures for vulnerable users. While acknowledging the potential benefits of AI companions, this paper argues for the urgent need for ethical frameworks that balance innovation with user safety. By proposing actionable recommendations for design and governance, the paper aims to guide industry, policymakers, and scholars in fostering safer and more responsible AI companion platforms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Analyzed through the lens of the “computerization movement” (CM), the development of revolutionary technologies has consistently followed a recurring trajectory in terms of the origin, momentum, diffusion, and societal impact. Building on the analysis of selected historical trajectories, similar dynamics are discernible for the recent push towards the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), being enhanced by capabilities provided by Big Data infrastructure. This paper explores Big Data and AI within the framework of CMs, analyzing their driving visions, trajectories, interconnectedness, and the societal discourses formed around their adoption. By drawing parallels with selected past CMs and situating current events within such historical context, this study provides a novel perspective hopefully facilitating a better understanding of the current technological landscape, and aiding in the navigation of the complex interplay between innovation, social change, and human expectations. The study shows that even if technological innovations remain central for the recent push towards AI adoption, shared beliefs and visionary ideals underpinning adoption are equally influential. These beliefs and ideals have continually mobilized people around the relevance of AI—in the past and today—even as the supporting infrastructure, core technologies, and their relevance for society have evolved.

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          This article develops an analytical and methodological field guide for studying the mundane practices that constitute machine learning systems. Drawing on science and technology studies (STS), I move beyond the opacity/transparency dichotomy that has dominated critical algorithm studies to examine how machine learning is assembled through everyday work. Rather than treating algorithms as black boxes or magical entities, I focus on four empirical moments of translation—feature extraction, vectorization, clustering, and data drift—where technical work becomes political choice. By ethnographically attending to practitioners' tinkering, negotiations, and valuation practices in these moments, we can trace how classification systems are constructed and stabilized. This approach allows us to ask: How are particular features of the world selected as relevant for prediction? Through what practices are people and phenomena translated into mathematical vector spaces? How are temporal assumptions encoded in data? By studying these mundane processes of construction, we can understand how machine learning systems enact particular ways of seeing, classifying, and predicting the world. This field guide thus contributes methodological tools for analyzing how the politics of machine learning is assembled in practice, opening analytical space for critical engagement beyond calls for transparency or fairness.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          This study evaluates the capabilities and limitations of generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, in conducting systematic literature reviews. Using the PRISMA methodology, we analysed 124 recent studies, focusing in-depth on a subset of 40 selected through strict inclusion criteria. Findings show that ChatGPT can enhance efficiency, with reported workload reductions averaging around 60–65%, though accuracy varies widely by task and context. In structured domains such as clinical research, title and abstract screening sensitivity ranged from 80.6% to 96.2%, while precision dropped as low as 4.6% in more interpretive tasks. Hallucination rates reached 91%, underscoring the need for careful oversight. Comparative analysis shows that AI matches or exceeds human performance in simple screening but underperforms in nuanced synthesis. To support more reliable integration, we introduce the Systematic Research Processing Framework (SRPF) as a guiding model for hybrid AI–human collaboration in research review workflows.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Moral values have deep roots in early civilizations, codified within norms and laws that regulated societal order and the common good. They play a crucial role in understanding the psychological basis of human behavior and cultural orientation. The moral foundation theory (MFT) is a well-established framework that identifies the core moral foundations underlying the manner in which different cultures shape individual and social lives. Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly pre-trained language models (PLMs), have enabled the extraction and analysis of moral dimensions from textual data. This survey presents a comprehensive review of MFT-informed PLMs, providing an analysis of moral tendencies in PLMs and their application in the context of MFT. We also review relevant datasets and lexicons and discuss trends, limitations, and future directions. By providing a structured overview of the intersection between PLMs and MFT, this work bridges moral psychology insights within the realm of PLMs, paving the way for further research and development in creating morally aware AI systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          An ongoing surge of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled false content has been spreading its way through the information ecosystem, including AI-generated images, which have been used as part of political disinformation campaigns. Thus, there remains a pressing need to understand which factors individuals rely upon when determining whether images are AI-generated, particularly when they can be used to spread disinformation. AI-generated images have been characterised by their aesthetic realism, which can be leveraged to deceive users, and those who use generative AI to create deceptive content also tend to exploit its ability to convey and elicit emotion. This experimental study explored how aesthetic realism and emotional salience, as key features of both AI-generated content and disinformation, may influence authenticity judgements of AI-generated disinformation images. In this study, 292 UK-based participants were presented with both AI-generated and non-AI-generated disinformation images which varied in aesthetic realism and emotional salience. Results showed that participants were more likely to judge realistic-looking AI-generated images as being authentic compared with less realistic-looking AI-generated images, but did so with less confidence in their decision. Emotional salience was not a significant predictor of judgements. When participants were presented with the correct verdict of an AI detection tool, their reliance on the tool to update their own judgements was predicted by the aesthetic realism of the image and their confidence levels. These findings may assist with the development of disinformation detection tools, as well as strategies that mitigate the spread of deceptive, synthesised visual content in the digital age.",

    "title": "Navigating fairness: introducing the multidimensional AIM-FAIR scale for evaluating AI decision-making",
    "abstract": "Abstract\n          People’s concerns regarding the fairness of algorithmic decision-making, coupled with its expanding utilization across various spheres of our lives underscores the need for robust measures to assess perceived fairness in standardized survey research. Existing fairness scales often suffer from inadequate content coverage, particularly in terms of Perceived Group Discrimination, and frequently employ suboptimal measurement methods, such as single-item assessments. This paper introduces the AIM-FAIR scale, a multidimensional tool grounded in classical test theory, employing Likert-scaled answering options and a reflective measurement model. Developed through four studies (n = 1777) and validated in both English and German, the scale includes 17 items across five subscales: Perceived Consistency, Perceived Equity, Perceived Group Bias, Perceived Manipulability, and Perceived (Explanatory) Transparency. Both language versions demonstrate excellent fit indices and consistent measurement invariance across diverse backgrounds, languages, and conditions. The AIM-FAIR scale offers higher ecological validity and a more comprehensive framework for evaluating fairness in ADM, enhancing cross-cultural and cross-linguistic research on AI fairness.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          This article offers broadly useful guidance for society’s adaptation to the omnipresence of generative AI, with implications for every profession and academic discipline that involves writing or coding (recognized by some as a form of writing). Offering an interdisciplinary perspective grounded in the digital humanities, software development and writing across the curriculum, and building on performance historian Christopher Grobe’s research on the role of arts and humanities expertise in AI development, I offer redefinitions of training data and prompt engineering. These essential yet misleading terms obscure the critical roles that humanities-based expertise has played in the development of GPTs and must play in guiding society’s adaptation to generative AI. I also briefly review scholarship on what constitutes “writing” and what it means to teach writing. Next, I reflect on long-terms trends, in professional software development, of code sharing and reliance on automation, and the likely impact of imposing similar practices in professional writing. After identifying the fundamental problem of rhetorical debt and outlining its consequences, I further motivate my argument, in relation to the new economic value of expert writing. This new economic value necessitates a revaluation of the humanities—not only by computer science, the tech industry, and schools and universities, but by humanists themselves.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          This study examines the key factors that affect Europeans’ reactions to artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of both full and flawed democracies in Europe. AI applications have increasingly been integrated into democratic practices, ranging from micro-targeting of voters to election information campaigns and protests, as well as various administrative functions and services provided by governments. However, the impact of AI on democracy and democratic institutions has yielded mixed outcomes. Drawing upon a dataset of 4004 respondents, categorised into full democracies and flawed democracies based on The Democracy Index developed by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), this research identifies crucial factors that shape Europeans’ attitudes toward AI in these two types of democracies. The analysis reveals noteworthy findings. First, flawed democracies tend to exhibit higher levels of trust in government entities compared to their counterparts in full democracies. Furthermore, individuals residing in flawed democracies demonstrate a more positive attitude toward AI when compared to respondents from full democracies. However, the study does not find significant differences in AI awareness between the two types of democracies, indicating a similar level of general knowledge about AI technologies amongst European citizens. Moreover, the study reveals that trust in AI measures, specifically “Trust AI Solution,” does not vary significantly between full and flawed democracies. This suggests that despite differences in democratic quality, both types of democracy have similar levels of confidence in AI solutions. Furthermore, employing regression models, the study uncovers the relative impact of these key factors and their correlations can reflect on policy implications. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the factors that shape the reactions of Europeans to AI in the democratic context, providing valuable information to policymakers and stakeholders in designing effective AI governance frameworks and strategies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          With recent major progress in AI, AI-driven robots are expected to operate outside of their original settings, such as factory floors, and be integrated into our daily lives. In this trajectory, integrating culture, with its broad and vague meaning, into human–robot interaction becomes a concern for the field of social robotics. In this article, we propose a culturally-responsive robot as a concept that encapsulates critical theoretical and experimental studies of culture in robotics without subscribing to the dominant view of the field that translates culture only to nationality. The main contribution of this article is to propose a methodology for implementing culturally-responsive robots, termed “robot-ethnographers.” Drawing from the long history of conventional ethnography, we define a robot-ethnographer as a robot situated within interaction contexts, shaping interactions, and learning culture through observation to adapt its behaviours accordingly. The paper analyses the properties of the robot-ethnographer in line with those of conventional ethnography in social science. Whilst acknowledging important technological limitations, this article concludes that robot-ethnographers can create culturally-responsive human–robot interactions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Exploring human trust in artificial intelligence (AI) in Law Enforcement domain is paramount for its ethical and effective deployment. As AI systems become increasingly integrated into society, trust ensures transparency, accountability, and fairness in their deployment. Despite the rapid increase in discussion about AI usage in law enforcement in various sectors globally, no secondary research explores that for OCEANIA, specifically in Australia. Moreover, how humans are considered in AI law enforcement is an uninvestigated area in this region. This paper aims to investigate this gap by systematically exploring various applications used in this region and analyzing how human perspectives are used, and to what extent. We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) based on 56 qualitatively selected studies to (i) classify the types, frequency, and demography of published research; (ii) explore how AI is leveraged; (iii) identify how and to what extent humans are considered in development and applications of AI in law enforcement; (iv) understand the challenges and solutions reported in this domain and worldwide. In summary, our findings point to the need for solutions to address operational and ethical issues in integrating AI into law enforcement and for unified legislation or regulations to effectively design and utilize AI in this domain. Based on the findings that highlight the important concerns in this domain, we recommend a list of future research directions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Despite significant advancements in AI and automated driving, a robust ethical framework for AV decision-making remains undeveloped. Such a framework requires clearly defined moral attributes to guide AVs in evaluating complex and ethically sensitive scenarios. Existing frameworks often rely on a single normative ethical theory, limiting their ability to address the nuanced nature of human decision-making and leading to conflicting outcomes. Augmented Utilitarianism (AU) offers a promising alternative by integrating elements of virtue ethics, deontology, and consequentialism into a non-normative framework. Grounded in moral psychology and neuroscience, AU employs mathematical ethical goal functions to capture societally aligned attributes. In this study, we propose and evaluate a method to elicit these attributes for AV decision-making. One hundred participants were presented with traffic scenarios, including critical and non-critical situations, and tasked with evaluating the relevance of an initial set of 11 attributes (e.g., physical harm, psychological harm, and moral responsibility) while suggesting additional relevant attributes. Results identified two new attributes—environmental harm and energy efficiency—and revealed that four attributes (physical harm, psychological harm, legality of the AV, and self-preservation) varied significantly between critical and non-critical scenarios. These findings suggest that the weight of attributes in ethical goal functions may need to adapt to situational criticality. The method was validated based on key evaluation criteria: it demonstrated sensitivity by producing varying relevance scores for attributes, was deemed relevant by participants for eliciting AV decision-making attributes, and allowed for the identification of additional attributes, enhancing the robustness of the framework. This work contributes to the development of a dynamic and context-sensitive ethical framework for AV decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to provide insights into the logic of automated decisions with the goal of promoting fairer, more transparent, and more trustworthy automated decision-making. Despite mounting regulatory pressure, changing consumer expectations, and a growing stream of XAI-related research, few consumer-facing applications of XAI exist. In anticipation of future XAI-enabled products and services, we use ethical foresight analysis to investigate the possible consequences of monetizing explanations. By developing a conceptual artifact we call an explanation platform, we analyze what could happen when digital advertising is fused with XAI. We explore the platform’s business and design logic, examine its potential social and ethical impact, and describe several plausible explanation manipulation scenarios and strategies. We find that while XAI monetization could incentivize industry adoption of XAI technology and expand algorithmic recourse across society, it could also lead to corrupted forms of explanations optimized for profit-driven objectives. Overall, our foresight analysis makes the case for the economic and technological feasibility of monetized XAI, but raises concerns about its desirability in liberal democratic societies.",

    "title": "Darwin in the machine: addressing algorithmic individuation through evolutionary narratives in computing",
    "abstract": "Abstract\n          This paper examines the application of evolutionary analogy in AI (artificial intelligence) research, focussing on narratives that perpetuate individuated and autonomous imaginaries of AI systems through biological diction. AI research has long drawn inspiration from evolution to design and predict algorithmic change. Occasionally, these narratives extend inspiration to reimagine AI as a non-human species subject to the same evolutionary pressures as biological organisms. As AI technologies embed more pervasively in public life and require critical perspectives on their social impacts, these comparisons in AI discourse raise critical questions about the limits of and responsibility in employing such analogies and their potential impact on how broader audiences consume and perceive AI systems. This paper examines the diverse ways and intentions behind how evolution is invoked in AI research narratives by analysing the adaptation of individuating evolutionary language and concepts across three fields of AI-related research: evolutionary computing, Artificial Life, and existential risk. It scrutinises the challenge of accurate scientific communication when drawing inspiration from biological evolution and assigning organismal attributes to digital technologies whilst decontextualising wider evolutionary scholarly discourses. I argue that the intertwined history between evolutionary theory and technological change paired with the potential risks to wider perceptions of AI and biological evolution, requires (1) strategic consideration about the limits of evolutionary analogies in categorising AI in relation to biological organisms, balancing creative inspiration with scientific caution and (2) active, collaborative multidisciplinary engagement with addressing potential misinformation, recognising that biological narratives have sociopolitical implications that influence human interaction with machines.",

    "title": "Excuses, excuses: moral agency and the professional identity of AI developers",
    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Artificial intelligence developers, machine learning engineers, and data scientists occupy a contradictory role in the modern marketplace. While they are central to the business and science of AI, they are marginalized as moral agents. Consequently, the marketplace has cultivated environments in which developers can be unthinking in their own roles and responsibilities, while at the same time tasking them with creating “thinking machines.” The central aim of this article is to show that this state of affairs is morally unjustifiable. To accomplish this, we draw from Arthur Isak Applbaum’s work on adversary roles and Alasdair MacIntyre’s framework for professional moral agency to establish the context dependencies for a “good” AI developer. We then draw from available studies that have engaged developers in questions about their moral agency and place them in conversation with Dennis Thompson and Helen Nissenbaum about the excuses associated with “the problem of many hands,” a concept that has beguiled accountability in the AI community for decades. We then return to MacIntyre’s framework to provide evidence from the same set of studies that AI developers do understand themselves as being responsible for more than just the role, yet they lack a robust community to whom they can submit their choices for ethical scrutiny and work environments that are often non-conducive to their moral actualization. We conclude with specific recommendations for bringing developers’ moral agency more fully into the discourse about AI ethics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Amid the pervasive integration of AI technologies across societal and industrial domains, understanding users’ trust in these systems becomes increasingly crucial. This study addresses the growing need to understand users’ trust in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and explores the societal implications of this type of trust. Based on the socio-technical systems theory, this work employs the FAT (Fairness, Accountability, Transparency) framework and humanness factors of AI, anthropomorphism, social presence, and emotions, as antecedents of users’ human-like trust, which is proposed to influence users’ attitudes, perceived performance, and behavioral intentions. Structural equation modeling analysis (N = 244) reveals that fairness significantly enhances trust, while accountability and transparency do not. Social presence and emotions positively impact trust, whereas anthropomorphism shows no significant effect. Furthermore, trust shapes users’ attitudes, perceived performance, and behavioral intentions toward GenAI systems. This study contributes to the AI adoption and user trust literature by illuminating the main antecedents of human-like trust and showing its impact on user acceptance from a social-technical perspective. Beyond the academic contribution, this research highlights the broader societal relevance of user trust in GenAI, particularly regarding public concerns over black box issues and humanness features of GenAI systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Auditing of AI systems is a promising way to understand and manage ethical problems and societal risks associated with contemporary AI systems, as well as some anticipated future risks. Efforts to develop standards for auditing artificial intelligence (AI) systems have therefore understandably gained momentum. However, current approaches are not just insufficient, but can be actively harmful. Transparency alone does not address concerns about risk. Internal auditing is insufficient, and easily becomes safety-washing. External audit is better, but requires credible standards. Industry-led approaches to building standards or to perform audits lack credibility and undermine other efforts. Regulation often is ill adapted and becomes a static barrier. Lastly, all of these limited technical, governance, and even ethical assessments fail to ensure continued stakeholder input and engagement. Instead, the paper proposes the establishment of an AI Audit Standards Board, in line with best practices in other fields, including safety-critical industries like aviation and nuclear energy, as well as more prosaic ones such as financial accounting and pharmaceuticals. This would address the evolving nature of AI technologies, help maintain public trust in AI, and promote a culture of safety and ethical responsibility within the AI industry. By ensuring audits remain relevant, robust, and responsive to the rapid advancements in AI, auditing AI will not devolve into safety washing and addresses risks and ethical concerns that will continue to arise as AI becomes increasingly important in society, and as human interaction with these systems changes over time.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Computational psychiatry offers promising opportunities for understanding and treating mental health disorders, yet achieving ecological validity—the accurate reflection of real-world experiences—remains a critical challenge. This perspective examines how digital health technologies can enhance ecological validity in computational psychiatry while addressing barriers in data collection, participant representation, validation, engagement, and methodological integration. We review key approaches, including digital phenotyping and adaptive design optimization, that enable more naturalistic data collection. However, achieving representative sampling and mitigating algorithmic biases remain unresolved challenges, particularly in AI-driven assessments. We discuss how expert-by-experience collaboration, systematic validation efforts, and structured open science practices can improve model generalizability and clinical applicability. Additionally, we explore the role of federated learning and edge computing in balancing privacy with robust, scalable model development. The paper concludes by integrating these challenges and solutions within a broader methodological framework, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary approaches that bridge computational precision with real-world psychiatric care.",

However, informational standards change over time, inducing distribution shifts that threaten the adequacy of machine learning models of misinformation. After articulating five kinds of distribution shifts, three solutions for enhancing success are discussed: larger static training sets, social engineering, and dynamic sampling. I argue that given the idiosyncratic ontology of misinformation, the first option is inadequate, the second is unethical, and thus the third is superior. However, I conclude that the prospects for machine learning models of misinformation are far weaker than most have presupposed, given that both epistemic and non-epistemic values are difficult to operationalize dynamically in machine code, rendering them surprisingly at most a species of recommender systems rather than literal truth detectors.\n",

    "title": "Recursive InPainting (RIP): how much information is lost under recursive inferences?",
    "abstract": "Abstract\n          The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) is accelerating content creation and modification. For example, variations of a given content, be it text or images, can be created almost instantly and at a low cost. This will soon lead to the majority of text and images being created directly by AI models or by humans assisted by AI. This poses new risks; for example, AI-generated content may be used to train newer AI models and degrade their performance, or information may be lost in the transformations made by AI which could occur when the same content is processed over and over again by AI tools. An example of AI image modifications is inpainting in which an AI model completes missing fragments of an image. The incorporation of inpainting tools into photo editing programs promotes their adoption and encourages their recursive use to modify images. Inpainting can be applied recursively, starting from an image, removing some parts, applying inpainting to reconstruct the image, revising it, and then starting the inpainting process again on the reconstructed image, etc. This paper presents an empirical evaluation of recursive inpainting when using one of the most widely used image models: Stable Diffusion. The inpainting process is applied by randomly selecting a fragment of the image, reconstructing it, selecting another fragment, and repeating the process a predefined number of iterations. The images used in the experiments are taken from a publicly available art data set and correspond to different styles and historical periods. Additionally, photographs are also evaluated as a reference. The modified images are compared with the original ones by both using quantitative metrics and performing a qualitative analysis. The results show that recursive inpainting in some cases modifies the image so that it still resembles the original one while in others leads to image degeneration, so ending with a non-meaningful image. The outcome of the recursive inpainting process depends on several factors, such as the type of image, the size of the inpainting masks, and the number of iterations. The results of our evaluation illustrate how information can be lost due to successive AI transformations. The evaluation of additional models, images, and inpainting sequences is needed to confirm whether this observation is generally applicable or if it occurs only in some models and settings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Although AI language technologies are typically presented as future-oriented technological innovation, none of the elements of machine learning technologies are unaffected by the cultural and historical contexts of their emergence. This is particularly true in the case of language constructions and the materialization of language in AI. Examination of computational language culture reveals striking continuities to concepts of language and their materialization in technology settings in the history of European colonialism. Based on an in-depth analysis of how languages were materially produced in colonialism and are treated in AI technologies, we show the strong colonial continuities in language materialization processes to this day. This also indicates the crucial role that language materializations play in the construction and maintenance of power and social order in a global realm.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Social care robots (SCR) have come to the forefront of the ethical debate. While the possibility of robots helping us tackle the global care crisis is promising for some, others have raised concerns about the adequacy of AI-driven technologies for the ethically complex world of care. The robots do not seem able to provide the comprehensive care many people demand and deserve, at least they do not seem able to engage in humane, emotion-laden and significant care relationships. In this article, we will propose to focus the debate on a particularly relevant aspect of care: trust. We will argue that, to answer the question of whether SCR are ethically acceptable, we must first address another question, namely, whether they are trustworthy. To this end, we propose a three-level model of trust analysis: rational, motivational and personal or intimate. We will argue that some relevant forms of caregiving (especially care for highly dependent persons) require a very personal or intimate type of care that distinguishes it from other contexts. Nevertheless, this is not the only type of trust happening in care spaces. We will adduce that, while we cannot have intimate or highly personal relationships with robots, they are trustworthy at the rational and thin motivational level. The fact that robots cannot engage in some (personal) aspects of care does not mean that they cannot be useful in care contexts. We will defend that critical approaches to trusting SCR have been sustained by two misconceptions and propose a new model for analyzing their moral acceptability: sociotechnical trust in teams of humans and robots.",

    "abstract": " This article proposes a new integration of linguistic anthropology and machine learning (ML) around convergent interests in both the underpinnings of language and making language technologies more socially responsible. While linguistic anthropology focuses on interpreting the cultural basis for human language use, the ML field of interpretability is concerned with uncovering the patterns that Large Language Models (LLMs) learn from human verbal behavior. Through the analysis of a conversation between a human user and an LLM-powered chatbot, we demonstrate the theoretical feasibility of a new, conjoint field of inquiry, cultural interpretability (CI). By focusing attention on the communicative competence involved in the way human users and AI chatbots coproduce meaning in the articulatory interface of human-computer interaction, CI emphasizes how the dynamic relationship between language and culture makes contextually sensitive, open-ended conversation possible. We suggest that, by examining how LLMs internally “represent” relationships between language and culture, CI can: (1) provide insight into long-standing linguistic anthropological questions about the patterning of those relationships; and (2) aid model developers and interface designers in improving value alignment between language models and stylistically diverse speakers and culturally diverse speech communities. Our discussion proposes three critical research axes: relativity, variation, and indexicality. ",

    "abstract": " According to social studies of artificial intelligence (AI), public AI controversies tend to dissipate relatively quickly despite well-documented risks and harms. The reasons for this lack of controversiality are beginning to be studied. Drawing on the framework of sociotechnical controversies, we analyze the de-escalation of contentious discussions observed in the AI legislative process by Chile's National Congress. Utilizing a qualitative approach, we tracked the deliberations hosted by the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of Chile across 51 sessions between 2023 and 2024. We describe three processes of cooling down in the AI debates: (1) deflection of technology liability, (2) instrumentalization of technology policy, and (3) moralization of technology use. However, constructive exchanges appear in some circumstances, which allow us to foresee some favorable conditions for participation in the debates on AI regulation.

    "title": "Que(e)rying artificial intelligence use for infectious disease surveillance: The need for a reparative algorithmic praxis",
    "abstract": "The increasing likelihood of pandemics highlights the need for superior tools at our disposal. By robustly and efficiently analyzing vast datasets, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to help decision-makers better respond to, manage, and even avert infectious disease outbreaks. However, these systems could also stigmatize, discriminate, exclude, exploit, and/or otherwise oppress vulnerable populations. In doing so, they could amplify allocative and representational harms. Given the possible far-reaching consequences, critical ethical reflection and oversight are essential. Such reflection would be incomplete without considering the impacts on queer people. From HIV/AIDS to COVID-19, outbreaks have disproportionately affected sexual and gender minorities (SGMs), reflecting a long history of structural oppression and injustices. AI could further exacerbate inequalities—like anti-queer bias—particularly amid the omission of marginalized and minoritized perspectives from algorithmic fairness efforts. Adopting an Intersectional, reparative approach, this paper que(e)ries the use of AI for infectious disease surveillance purposes. Placing this technology within patterns of power, privilege, marginalization, and disadvantage, it interrogates how to achieve algorithmic justice for SGMs. It proposes concrete steps towards a reparative algorithmic praxis, including: (1) exploring how these systems reproduce inequalities, (2) centering sexual and gender diversity to disrupt problematic epistemic positions, and (3) combating opacity through participatory governance mechanisms. This work is necessary to understand how AI systems reproduce major health disparities and hold them accountable. By contemplating how to begin redressing harms, it offers a starting point for further deliberation and action towards inclusive, justice-oriented algorithmic systems in practice. I anticipate these lessons being deeply transferrable across contexts.",

    "abstract": " Many countries and jurisdictions are reforming their competition policies in response to growing political and public concerns about market concentration, especially when it comes to the market power of Big Tech firms. A particular concern is the new dynamics in market competition resulting from the rise of digital personal data as the key resource or asset underpinning our economies. Our aim in this paper is to examine the competition policy investigations, proposals, and reforms emerging around the world in order to analyse the policy implications of digital personal data to market competition regimes. Our methodological approach entailed an analysis of policy materials (written in English) produced in various jurisdictions or by international institutions dealing with competition policy. We identified the underlying policy themes, concerns, and processes across these different jurisdictions and institutions in order to understand their concerns about how Big Tech and personal data affect competition and competition policy.

    "title": "Datafied ageing futures: Regimes of anticipation and participatory futuring",
    "abstract": " With this paper we join others in their call to resist and challenge regimes of anticipations that suggest our futures are inevitably linked to certain imaginaries about data-driven systems. The future is not simply happening but is made now – through regimes of anticipation that shape our expectations, imaginaries, visions and hypes, and define what is thinkable and desirable. Who or what is able to claim the future is an exercise of power and a matter of social justice. However, current anticipations circulating about datafied futures are often determined by powerful social actors such as states or technology companies. In this paper, we explore how we might open up futures-making to different people in relation to futures of ageing. Central is the question of whether and how we can actually think (and imagine) outside of powerful anticipation regimes around the increasing spread and relevance of data-driven systems and/or ageist assumptions about how to ‘fix’ the problem of demographic ageing. We draw on data from a series of design fiction workshops with older adults, civil society organisations and civil servants in Germany, Austria and the UK. Our analysis explores how participatory futuring might allow participants to question their own assumptions and anticipations about the futures of data-driven technologies in ageing societies but that, due to ‘discursive closure’, this may not lead to radically different futures imaginaries.

    "abstract": " This paper investigates open public data and data sharing reforms in Australia (2018–2022) and their potential role in deepening the ‘data divide’. In the contemporary datafied welfare state, open public data and data sharing are increasingly vexed issues in times of data-driven artificial intelligence (AI). We scrutinise public consultation surrounding the establishment of the Australian Data Availability and Transparency Act 2022 (DAT Act). Through topic modelling and critical discourse analysis, the study examines the representation and concerns of marginalised groups in the reform process. We highlight the overlooked role of non-profits and civil society in the public data ecosystem. The analysis emphasises the significant yet unacknowledged contributions of these organisations in advocating for data equity and justice. We argue that responsible and equitable public data practices do not just depend on administrative and technical procedures for data sharing but are fundamentally entwined with the social and institutional hierarchies in which public data is produced and used. The study calls for greater inclusion and support for civil society organisations to bridge the data divide, contributing to broader debates on the merits and challenges of open data and data sharing practices within a data justice framework.

    "title": "The fabrication of synthetic data promises: Tracing emerging arenas of expectations and boundary work<sup>1</sup>",
    "abstract": " Synthetic data, denoting artificially produced data that are used for data science tasks, are increasingly held as a promising solution to digital societies’ predicaments. While burgeoning research has investigated the implications of synthetic data, the fabrication of synthetic data promises remains understudied. This article draws on the sociology of expectations and the concept of boundary work to interrogate emerging arenas of expectations and attendant boundary work practices through which synthetic data promises are fabricated. To this end, it draws from a wide range of empirical materials, including scientific literatures, promissory reports, industry webinars, and interviews. First, it shows that scientific literatures reveal a strong increase in interest and three transformations in the framing of synthetic data in recent decades: from vernacular term to scientific concept, from possibility to inevitability, and from research technique to social promise. Second, it demonstrates that promissory organizations’ reports on synthetic data are generically performative as they circulate widely and constitute a source of authority for various stakeholders. Finally, it highlights three types of boundary work in relation to synthetic data: stipulations of its epistemic superiority, negotiations concerning most apt methodologies, and contestations regarding whether synthetic data are “fake.” I conclude by arguing that a sociology of expectations approach can productively question the hyperbolic promises attributed to synthetic data. Overall, this article contributes to germinal social studies of synthetic data by highlighting the constitutive role of expectations and boundary work in the fabrication of synthetic data promises.

    "title": "After visibility: Data as a factor of production in Douyin e-commerce",
    "abstract": " Since 2020, Douyin, an app known for its interactive entertainment and vibrant youth cultures, has risen to dominance in the retail sector. Douyin stands out by making paid traffic a significant revenue stream alongside commissions. This strategy, which restricts organic growth, compels sellers to make additional investments in traffic. Drawing from Douyin walkthroughs and the company's business development presentations, this article analyzes how audience attention and platform traffic are manufactured and integrated with retail in the context of China's recent national policy that positions data as a factor of production equal to labor, land, technology, and capital. In contrast to Instagram, traffic conversion into sales takes precedence over product visibility on Douyin. In this process, Douyin actively uses user data to manufacture high-traffic keywords with buying intent. This involves measurements employing surveillance technologies that span image and speech recognition, keywords, performance metrics, and pricing algorithms. The article argues that Douyin e-commerce cannot be fully explained by the current visibility research paradigm centered on metrics such as likes, shares, and comments, which are considered indications of interests and preferences. It is suggested that Douyin uses historical data to invoke momentary interests and produce desired user actions for conversion. Traffic investment alone cannot result in the conversion of momentary interests into sales; it needs to be combined with pricing that incorporates discounts, coupons, and reductions. The integration of traffic investment with pricing strategy has emerged as a dominant e-commerce practice that fosters retail growth. ",

    "abstract": "This article explores the construction of health data spaces through the lens of border work. It provides insights into the complex attachments and detachments that come to the fore when establishing centralized health data access bodies in the Nordic countries. By comparing Denmark, Norway, and Finland, the study unveils a variety of border work practices. These practices include the complex interplay between national infrastructures, local practices, and regulatory frameworks, the management of continuous attachments through additional loops, and negotiations over public-private borders. The study shows that, despite policy goals envisioning health data access bodies as seamless one-stop shops for ‘detached’ data, the data remains attached to places, institutions, people, and countries. Consequently, new data spaces tend to emerge and co-exist with existing ones. Our analysis of the Nordic experiences offers valuable lessons and critical insights for ongoing efforts to build a European Health Data Space. We further suggest that this stickiness of fragmentation might be a common feature of big data policy efforts.",

    "abstract": "\n            This paper sketches a prehistory of synthetic data in the development of simulation technologies. Synthetic data is connected to simulation by the technical problem of the reality gap: the gap between the synthetic data a model is trained on and the real-world data it is deployed on. The reality gap is presented as a novelty both generated and solved by synthetic data. We demonstrate that the reality gap has plagued simulation technologies since their inception in the mid-20th century. We contend that the reality gap is not something synthetic data can solve. To illustrate this, we examine three episodes in the prehistory of synthetic data. These episodes are representative of three distinct\n            regimes of simulation\n            : (a) the\n            statistical regime\n            , (b) the\n            discrete-event\n            regime, and (c) the\n            visual\n            -\n            interactive regime\n            . Each regime reveals a reality gap; from before the advent of digital computers to the present. Synthetic data, like simulations, require data about a given domain in order to model it. It requires the real-world data which it purports to dispense with. The reality gap is thus an epistemological issue as well as a technical one. We argue that it is also a political economic issue: it complicates existing means of producing data, adding new layers of mediation and labor. Synthetic data thus indicates the emergence of an alternative stack for the production of AI systems. This suggests that the political economy of AI must take account of the proliferation of new technical means for creating data.\n          ",

    "abstract": " In insurance, there is still a significant gap between the anticipated disruption, due to big data and machine learning algorithms, and the actual implementation of behaviour-based personalization, as described by Meyers (2018). Here, we identify eight key factors that serve as fundamental obstacles to the radical transformation of insurance guarantees, aiming to closely align them with the risk profile of each policyholder. These obstacles include the collective nature of insurance, the entrenched beliefs of some insurance companies, challenges related to data collection and use for personalized pricing, limited interest from insurers in adopting new models as well as policyholders’ reluctance towards embracing connected devices. Additionally, the hurdles of explainability, insurer inertia and ethical or societal considerations further complicate the path toward achieving highly individualized insurance pricing. ",

We devised a two-phase, two-stage experimental design with ChatGPT 3.5 (treatment group) and Google search engine (control group) by asking participants to find out how many LGBTQIA+ individuals served as elected representatives in India (first phase) and Ireland (second phase). The similar trajectories of legal reforms observed in these countries, and their small number of LGBTQIA+ elected representatives, allowed us to identify the fault lines in ChatGPT's creation of knowledge and information around LGBTQ issues. We followed the experimental study with semi-structured interviews to identify whether the chatbot reinforced previously held beliefs and whether users cross-checked the information provided by ChatGPT. Our results show that Large Language Models may provide incorrect but proattitudinal information that remains unchecked and unverified by the users, an effect we refer to as Chat-Chamber. We conclude with a discussion of our findings and recommendations for future research in the area.",

    "title": "Repair work, resistance and the invisible data labour of Lebanon's digital humanitarian infrastructures",
    "abstract": "This article draws upon a multi-sited ethnography of everyday labour in Lebanon's digital cash assistance for Syrian refugees. The datafication of humanitarian infrastructures generates technological breakdown, gaps in data and incredibly strict and cumbersome rules. In response to impediments related to biometric identification and automated poverty targeting, this article argues that humanitarian staff, refugee recipients and community members engage in ‘repair work’ – the subtle and quotidian labour that goes into addressing fragility and maintaining functionality. Inspired by feminist studies of labour, repair work is found to be invisible in being undervalued, unpaid and reproductive, which is reminiscent of labour that has historically fallen to disenfranchised people. Repair work also enables data workers to assert their autonomy and contest infrastructures that they framed as being unreasonable and unjust. In doing so, findings suggest that repair work is fundamental to the ability of data-driven aid programmes to cater to the needs of populations in crisis. This paper marks two contributions to understanding the promise and perils of ‘Technology for Good’: it introduces repair work as a novel conceptual framework to analyse labour involved in the datafication of aid, and it applies new empirical evidence to critical studies of data work.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, research has made rapid progress in the collection and analysis of digital trace data. However, when it comes to sharing data, researchers still face major barriers that often limit or prevent the reproducibility of research results and the reuse of data. Against this backdrop, we identify three broader categories of user challenges, namely researchers’ capacities &amp; incentives, legal &amp; ethical challenges, and technical hurdles. We describe in detail the problems researchers face in each category and why these often prevent researchers from sharing data, thus limiting both the reproducibility of research outputs and data reuse in other research projects. We conclude each category with specific needs of researchers for sharing digital trace data and making it reusable for others. These are intended to provide researchers as well as research institutes and repositories with approaches to improve the situation of data sharing.",

    "title": "Outsourcing accountability: Extractive data practice and inequities of power in humanitarian third-party monitoring",
    "abstract": "Since the early 2010s, humanitarian donors have increasingly contracted private firms to monitor and evaluate humanitarian activities, accompanied by a promise of improving accountability through their data and data analytics. This article contributes to scholarship on data practices in the humanitarian sector by interrogating the implications of this new set of actors on humanitarian accountability relations. Drawing on insights from 60 interviews with humanitarian donors, implementing agencies, third-party monitors and data enumerators in Somalia, this article interrogates data narratives and data practices around third-party monitoring. We find that, while humanitarian donors are highly aware of challenges to accountability within the sector, there is a less critical view of data challenges and limitations by these external firms. This fuels donor optimism about third-party monitoring data, while obscuring the ways that third-party monitoring data practices are complicating accountability relations in practice. Resultant data practices, which are aimed at separating data from the people involved, reproduce power asymmetries around the well-being and expertise of the Global North versus Global South. This challenges accountability to donors and to crisis-affected communities, by providing a partial view of reality that is, at the same time, assumed to be reflective of crisis-affected communities’ experiences. This article contributes to critical data studies by showing how monitoring data practices intended to improve accountability relations are imbued with, and reproduce, power asymmetries that silence local actors.",

    "title": "Researching data discomfort: The case of Statistics Norway’s quest for billing data",
    "abstract": "National statistics offices are increasingly exploring the possibilities of utilizing new data sources to position themselves in emerging data markets. In 2022, Statistics Norway announced that the national agency will require the biggest grocers in Norway to hand over all collected billing data to produce consumer behavior statistics which had previously been produced by other sampling methods. An online article discussing this proposal sparked a surprisingly (at least to Statistics Norway) high level of interest among readers, many of whom expressed concerns about this intended change in data practice. This paper focuses on the multifaceted online discussions of the proposal, as these enable us to study citizens’ reactions and feelings towards increased data collection and emerging public-private data flows in a Nordic context. Through an explorative empirical analysis of comment sections, this paper investigates what is discussed by commenters and reflects upon why this case sparked so much interest among citizens in the first place. It therefore contributes to the growing literature of citizens’ voices in data-driven administration and to a wider discussion on how to research public feeling towards datafication. I argue that this presents an interesting case of discomfort voiced by citizens, which demonstrates the contested nature of data practices among citizens–and their ability to regard data as deeply intertwined with power and politics. This case also reminds researchers to pay attention to seemingly benign and small changes in administration beyond artificial intelligence.",

    "title": "Understanding game data work",
    "abstract": " The game industry's content production, maintenance of live games, and processes of acquiring production funding increasingly rely on various kinds of data and its rigorous analysis. These new needs and functions have generated emerging forms of work, such as those of the data analyst, data engineer, and data scientist. Through in-depth interviews with 20 Finnish game industry professionals and an analysis of game industry job advertisements, this paper examines the work and identity of game industry data workers. Drawing from scholarship focused on game production, game work, and data labour, this article argues that organisational practices surrounding data professionals reveal the centrality of high-level data work in game studios focused on live service games and that data work is now performed not just by data analysts, but by the entire staff and management. As a precursor to the wider creative industries, we argue that creative work and data work in game companies are gradually converging, due to the datafied work environment facilitating datafied game work and the work of data professionals increasingly intertwining with creative tasks. Complicating the previous game studio hierarchy is the data analyst's dual role as both a subservient support function and a central broker of data. Adding nuance to this, the article argues that an important aspect of the work of bespoke data professionals in game companies is communication, in contrast to the high-level quantitative tasks often associated with analysis.

    "abstract": " The European biobanking infrastructure BBMRI-ERIC was established in the context of European Union science policy to facilitate collaboration between European repositories of biological samples and associated data, or so-called biobanks. To allow the exchange of research materials, the infrastructure has created several platforms for quality management and making materials visible and accessible. In this article, I develop the metaphor of mapping to explore the workings of these platforms. I consider maps as devices for giving directions, as representations of science, and as (symbolic) outlines of the territory of Europe to explore how BBMRI-ERIC's activities in quality management and IT-platforms for making materials visible and accessible (aim to) facilitate circulation. Across the different platforms, efforts to harmonize and integrate European biobanking activities confront both scientific and European tendencies toward fragmentation. The map of a European biobanking community drawn by BBMRI-ERIC consequently both makes and unmakes Europe sketching a Europe of both harmonization and fragmentation. In laying bare these paradoxical effects of the construction of a European biobanking infrastructure, using mapping as a lens shows how, rather than realizing its much-cited role as a “facilitator” for research, BBMRI-ERIC embodies key tensions at the center of efforts to advance “data-based” (big) science.

    "title": "Surveillance experiences of extinction rebellion activists and police: Unpacking the technologization of Dutch protest policing",
    "abstract": " Recent years have witnessed an intensifying debate on the deployment of emerging surveillance technologies in protests. Often discussed in terms of “chilling effects”—where activists self-censor due to fear of surveillance repercussions—there's limited research on its effects on both activists and law enforcement. This study explores the technologization of protest policing, moving beyond the oversimplified cat-and-mouse game analogy, to examine its effects on surveillance experiences in more nuanced ways. By analyzing observations and interview data from 2023 road blockades by Extinction Rebellion in The Hague, Netherlands, this paper highlights the intricate consequences of surveillance technologies for both sides. Moving beyond the narrow legal interpretation of “chilling effects,” it uncovers two further socio-psychological sub-manifestations, showing how both groups adapt through hyper-transparency (extreme openness) and hyper-alertness (extreme caution). The study demonstrates how these experiences can be self-reinforcing, where reciprocal suspicion might contribute to a cycle of mutual distrust beyond protest contexts, but also introduces new forms of resilience. This cycle, despite lacking clear causality, bears important implications for society at large. Pervasive suspicion erodes institutional trust among activists and threatens the traditionally communicative and de-escalation-focused approach of Dutch law enforcement. Overall, this extended impact indicates that the technologization of protest policing has resulted in a hybridization of screens and streets, causing its human impacts to stretch beyond the specific times and places of demonstrations. Protest policing now encompasses a multifaceted spectrum of surveillance experiences, affecting a plethora of public values, beyond the right to protest alone. ",

    "title": "The benefits of being between (many) fields: Mapping the high-dimensional space of AI research",
    "abstract": " This article considers how the emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) research field is constructed, primarily in university settings. AI research is a site of significant national funding, industry investment, and media interest. As such, for researchers working across the resource-constrained science system, their relationship to the field is significant; legitimisation as an AI researcher can bring material and symbolic rewards. Through interviews (n = 90) with academics affiliated with AI-branded research organisations in the US, UK, and Australia, the article develops an empirical account of the construction of AI research as a high-dimensional field – a field that moves between multiple disciplinary and sectoral boundaries across national and international hierarchies. The article draws on the sociology of expertise and studies of research infrastructures to develop the conceptual frame of dimensionality to explain the vertical and horizontal dynamics informing the AI field's development. The article's contributions are its description of the emerging AI field, which complements critical studies of how the figure of AI is mobilised in other settings, and its extension of field theory to fluid spaces that leverage the boundary zone between several overlapping field arrangements.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) ethics is undergoing a practical shift towards putting principles into design practices in developing responsible AI. While this practical turn is essential, this paper highlights its potential risk of overly focusing on addressing issues at the level of individual artifacts, which can neglect more profound structural challenges and the need for significant systemic change. Such oversight makes AI ethics lose its strength in addressing some hidden, long-term harms within broader contexts. In this paper, we propose that the reflection on structural issues should be an integral part of AI ethics. To achieve this, we develop a multi-level framework to analyze socio-ethical issues of AI at both the artifact and broader structural levels. This framework can serve as a potentially transformative approach to uncover some unspoken assumptions in current AI ethics discourses and expose some blind spots in AI guidelines, policies, and regulations. Our paper paves the way to develop a practical approach that can effectively integrate this multi-level framework into real-world AI design and policymaking, ultimately bringing about transformative change.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problems of data colonialism from a standpoint that not only challenges the legitimacy of colonial economics but also the epistemological legitimacy of data as a raw material from which knowledge and knowledge systems might be generated. Our reflexive investigation centres on knowledge systems of Aotearoa-New Zealand and the wider Moana Oceania through embodied traditions of wānanga and talanoa. As we explain, these offer a critical alternative to Western scholarly practices and allow us to attend to unremarked principles that underlie the sociotechnical knowledge infrastructure of a hegemonic global academy. Meeting Māori and Pasifika scholars, elders and master craftspeople within their own discourse traditions allows us to reopen categories of investigation beyond the already problematic consequences that can so clearly be seen in continued colonial capitalism and the neo-colonial data economy.",

    "title": "Artificial intelligence for development (AI4D): A contested notion",
    "abstract": "Recently, the notion of artificial intelligence for development (AI4D) has been mobilized by various actors in the global South and North. We identify five analytical categories to help us understand the different and often contested perspectives on AI4D. They are (a) a developmentalist framework that emphasizes discourses around modernity and progress through a technoliberal lens of ‘catching up’; (b) an economic development framework taken up by African states, private sector and civil society, highlighting a positive and more future-looking outlook on AI's potential for development; (c) an international policy framework tied to globally agreed on policies such as the Sustainable Development Goals; (d) a colonial and extractivist framework that articulates how AI4D reinforces old processes of oppression in new ways; and (e) decolonial AI discourses grounded in Latin American, African and Indigenous approaches. Our critical review of literature on AI4D and related expressions shows that while the notion applies broadly to the global South, the majority of publications use the term in reference to AI development on the African continent. This commentary enriches our understanding of the plurality of meanings, where they come from, what they do, and what they leave unaddressed.",

    "title": "Collectivism and individualism political bias in large language models: A two-step approach",
    "abstract": "\n            In this paper, we investigate the political biases of large language models concerning collectivism and individualism through a combined analysis of their value judgments and factual assessments. We propose a two-step approach to evaluate the patterns of bias in the outputs of large language models as well as a specific set of questions to examine large language model outputs’ political bias on collectivism and individualism. Our methodology involves two main phases. (a) Value assessment: we initiate the first phase by prompting large language models with questions from our set to identify patterns of political bias in their generated content. (b) Factual assessment: we refine the questions in our set and conduct a second round of prompting to verify the accuracy of the models’ responses regarding “\n            collectivism\n            ” and “\n            individualism\n            .” This step aims to assess whether the models can accurately discern these concepts in a factual context. Our experiments reveal varying degrees of political bias in the outputs of different large language models. While some models demonstrate proficiency in distinguishing between collectivism and individualism, they display outputs that are not neutral on political matters. Conversely, other models face challenges in accurately differentiating between these concepts and generating unbiased content. The latter indicates that many large language models not only fail to accurately distinguish between collectivism and individualism but also exhibit significant political biases in their outputs. We argue that a reliable large language model should achieve accuracy in factual assessments while generating unbiased content in value judgments, thus avoiding guiding users’ opinions.\n          ",

    "abstract": "Questions of data privacy in Africa are imbued with complexity. We examine a slice of this complexity by putting the concept of contextual integrity into dialogue with Africa's plural-legal contexts to explore data privacy within Africa's emerging digital landscape. The conceptual insights are empirically illustrated based on a case study in Ghana, involving content analysis of policy documents and interviews with a sample of residents, cultural leaders (among the Akan ethnic group), subject matter experts, and digital entrepreneurs (e.g. fintech firms). Our findings illuminate a nuanced and contextually rooted understanding of privacy, focusing on the complementarities and tensions around data anonymization for privacy; the multiplicity of information spheres that result in a complicated terrain of privacy breaches; and the individuality, mutuality, and collectivity of privacy harms and remedies thereof. Our findings challenge prevailing discourses in the literature that either suggests (a) misalignments between locally-rooted privacy norms and European-imported statutory regulations on privacy in African countries or (b) privacy myopia among Africans—underestimating their personal information and the need to protect such information. We suggest shifting away from such privacy discourses from above (meta-narratives, generalizations, and inherent assumptions on African states and societies) to conversations from below. That is, refocusing on the particularities of place, culture, and norms that complicate meta-narratives on privacy. This requires centering the everyday privacy norms that result from co-existing, and sometimes oppositional, customary-informed and state-stipulated information norms within Africa's emerging digital landscapes.",

    "abstract": "Data interoperability poses unique ethical challenges across a range of academic, industrial, and governmental implementations of data systems. Central to data interoperability is the design of systems and protocols for exchanging or integrating data from different initial source domains. Data interoperability is often regarded as necessary for carrying out tasks between different organizations and suborganizations as well as for ensuring secondary use of data for research purposes. However, interoperability poses a number of ethical problems whose contours can prove especially challenging in comparison to how ethical harms take hold at other moments of the data life cycle (such as algorithmic processing or results dissemination). Taking biomedical data interoperability as a focal domain, this article provides an overview of data interoperability, maps the central ethical harms that may challenge interoperability projects, and proposes a response to these problems through an approach rooted in philosophical pragmatism. Pragmatist responses to both individual and structural harms of interoperability are presented through three companion strategies: shared standards, manual data curation, and meticulous data documentation.",

    "title": "Indigenous peoples and artificial intelligence: A systematic review and future directions",
    "abstract": "This systematic literature review addresses the intersection of two rapidly evolving areas of knowledge and practice: Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS) and artificial intelligence (AI). There is growing scholarly recognition of the rich and diverse nature of IKS, which are unique intergenerational understandings of worldly relations from an Indigenous standpoint. There is now a vast literature on the promise and pitfalls of AI. However, there is a lack of systematic reviews showing how these two dynamic literatures are intersecting, and what the major themes are. AI has the potential to assist the promotion of IKS; however, there are also potential risks arising from AI for Indigenous peoples, such as the erosion of cultural knowledge, and data-grabbing that fails to respect the principles of Indigenous Data Sovereignty. These risks can exacerbate existing knowledge hierarchies and socio-economic inequalities. In this paper, we conducted a systematic review of articles published between 2012 and 2023 (January) on Indigenous peoples and AI. We shed light upon four unique overlapping categories into which existing literature can be classified and comprehensively discuss literature under each category. The first two categories discuss AI’s role in assisting the promotion of IKS and the third focuses on the pitfalls of using AI for Indigenous peoples. The final category discusses how IKS itself can enrich the development of AI. We further identify several gaps in the literature and highlight avenues requiring attention on AI’s role with Indigenous peoples and their knowledge systems.",

    "title": "Global data empires: Analysing artificial intelligence data annotation in China and the USA",
    "abstract": "As the two leading countries in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, China and the United States largely rely on separate AI infrastructure and data annotation ecosystems. Studies have focussed almost exclusively on data annotation associated with American and European companies, limiting our understanding of how this contrasts with the Chinese development of AI. This article provides a comparative analysis of the political economy of the Chinese and American/European AI data annotation ecosystems, focusing on the role of the state and the practice of outsourcing to data annotation institutions. It finds that while the US state plays a protectionist role concerning AI infrastructure such as semiconductors and data centres, it adopts a laissez-faire approach to data annotation. The Chinese state, however, understands it has a comparative advantage in data and invests heavily in its own data ecosystem while maintaining stringent regulations for Chinese tech companies. Secondly, many US companies outsource data annotation work to business process outsourcing centres and digital platforms, whereas Chinese companies maintain these activities in-house or, through a process of ‘inland-sourcing’, send this work to ‘third-tier’ cities in Chinese provinces to data labelling bases, often jointly managed by local government and private companies.",

    "title": "The appification of borders: Data, migration and digitalization",
    "abstract": "The intersection of migration, borders, and technology has been extensively studied in critical security studies, science and technology studies, law, and beyond. This article argues for closer attention to smartphone and other apps in the growing focus on the datafication and digitalization of borders. In recent years, states have increasingly made use of apps for customs declarations, visa and residence permit applications, and even claims for asylum. Such technologies are at the core of a tension between facilitation and fast mobility on one side, and the intensive need for data and prediction on the other. We contribute to the literature on datafication of borders and describe the ongoing ‘appification’ of the border in relation to three key logics. The first is the interoperation of the technical and bureaucratic infrastructures of the border and of consumer technology, in which apps are software products dependent on consumer hardware and platforms, as well as technologies of sovereign power. The second is a logic of efficiency, through which apps allow the state to more efficiently target and profile travellers as well as make time and cost savings for a range of stakeholders such as airports and airlines. The third is individualization, with apps benefiting from the wide use of personal devices and enabling more fine-grained control over mobility. To illustrate these trends, the paper draws on the cases of ArriveCAN (Canada), Customs and Border Protection One (USA), and the International Air Transport Association OneID initiative.",

    "abstract": "This article examines emerging “smart” pain technologies in the United States. New wearable and implantable devices aim to partly remove human decision-making from pain management, delegating it to more or less closed feedback loops that capture signals directly from the body, process them algorithmically, and administer electrical stimulation to modulate nerve response. This endeavor to create increasingly “closed loop” pain treatment reflects both the cybernetic dream of building self-regulating machines and biomedicine's discontent with the subjectivity of pain. The article conceptualizes and empirically explores the building and maintaining of loops in pain management, examining this sociotechnical process and the many elements it implicates, both within and beyond pain management. We focus on two specific devices: one implantable and the other wearable. The analysis shows how physicians and company officials imagine—and actively seek to realize—changes in the role of patients, the nature of medical expertise, the understanding of chronic pain, and the business models of companies. We argue that such activities are a type of technoscientific activity that portends potentially new forms of healthcare and social life. Finally, we propose that an analysis of “looping techniques” can contribute to recently advanced theories of a recursive society by demonstrating how building and maintaining loops shift different actors in and out, interface them at different scales, and establish new regimes of control.",

In this article, I explore, from a critical realist perspective, how users reflect on and decide what to listen to in various contexts. First, the article develops a framework for understanding reflexive decision-making in the context of music streaming. Then, based on interviews with Spotify users and an analysis of their donated streaming histories, three listening modes are identified based on what motivates music choices and how the users interact with the platform's content. Findings suggest that in addition to the platform's recommendations, users reflexively choose music to fit their contexts, emotions and goals based on their previous experiences, striking a balance between conscious and habitual music listening.",

Combining machine automation with human expertise and reflexivity, the proposed methodological framework bridges the gap between computer vision and social research. Our custom approach combines inductive, deductive, and abductive logics of scientific inquiry and consists of three complementary steps: (a) Pattern exploration—employing unsupervised learning to explore visual patterns within image datasets; (b) Theory-driven image classification—utilizing supervised learning with convolutional neural networks to systematically label visual content; and (c) Context-sensitive interpretation—to provide critical and creative engagement with the patterns identified in the previous steps. We illustrate these three steps, and their various combinations, through empirical examples from a study of visuality in digital diplomacy, and critically discuss the epistemological implications of using machine learning as a method in visual social research.",

    "title": "Street-level bureaucracy meets Big Data: The moral economy of taxation in China in the digital age",
    "abstract": "This article investigates the impact of digital technology and big data analytics on street-level bureaucracy. Building onto literature that highlights the residual autonomy and resistance of practitioners against big data governance, this article advances a more nuanced thesis, arguing that bureaucrats’ discretion and moral judgments are reconstituted rather than simply retained or eliminated by digital governance. Using the metamorphosis of street-level taxation in China as a strategic case study, the article documents a paradigmatic shift in tax administration—from the collection of individualized knowledge about enterprises through intimate and often conflictual interactions between tax administrators and taxpayers, to the acquisition of global knowledge on industries through big data and arm's length management. Contrary to conventional concerns that big data and digital technologies diminish the discretion of street-level bureaucrats, this research reveals that technology unloads the burden of attaining legibility for tax collectors, while providing new space for exercising moral judgment and informal practice vis-à-vis local society. Drawing on extensive fieldwork in a county-level tax bureau in China, I demonstrate that the primary mechanism for exercising moral agency lies in negotiations between tax officers and enterprises in interpreting data results and addressing data discrepancies. Consequently, I posit that discretion persists in the era of big data, which enables the application of “good enough” moral-economic principles in tax collection, informed by bureaucrats’ social and institutional positions. Overall, this paper reflects on the unintended consequences introduced by big data in reshaping human agency and moral disposition.",

    "abstract": "\n            The emergence of the modern state was closely intertwined with the advent of statistics and demographic data. Today, we are witnessing the ascent of artificial intelligence as a new technology of governance. This article seeks to lay the groundwork for a research agenda at the intersection of the state and artificial intelligence, unpacking the notion of “AI” and examining the consequences of the state transitioning from statistics to artificial intelligence as the means of “seeing” its subjects. The first part of the article argues that artificial intelligence represents a fundamental epistemic shift: from\n            variables to patterns\n            , from\n            rules to associations\n            , from\n            surveys to sensors\n            . This transition may transform governance and biopolitics, and with them, the very meanings of concepts such as citizenship, democracy, and population. In the second part of the article, the article draws on the literature on socio-technical transitions to conceptualize the integration of artificial intelligence into state practices, offering a framework to guide empirical research on how artificial intelligence is transforming governance.\n          ",

    "abstract": "The availability of big data has significantly influenced the possibilities and methodological choices for conducting large-scale behavioural and social science research. In the context of qualitative data analysis, a major challenge is that conventional methods require intensive manual labour and are often impractical to apply to large datasets. One effective way to address this issue is by integrating emerging computational methods to overcome scalability limitations. However, a critical concern for researchers is the trustworthiness of results when machine learning and natural language processing tools are used to analyse such data. We argue that confidence in the credibility and robustness of results depends on adopting a ’human-in-the-loop’ methodology that is able to provide researchers with control over the analytical process, while retaining the benefits of using machine learning and natural language processing. With this in mind, we propose a novel methodological framework for computational grounded theory that supports the analysis of large qualitative datasets, while maintaining the rigour of established grounded theory methodologies. To illustrate the framework’s value, we present the results of testing it on a dataset collected from Reddit in a study aimed at understanding tutors’ experiences in the gig economy.",

    "abstract": "This article reconstructs the sociotechnical imaginaries of “Big Data” in Germany, South Africa, and the United States over 10 years. Our inquiry into the meaning-making undertaken on expansive datafication processes began from the observation that since its inception circa 2010, the buzz phrase “Big Data” has not only denoted a technology but has also gestured toward a vast array of ambitions and concerns that are reflective of values, economic perspectives, and cultural preoccupations. We use a frame analysis to investigate the unfolding journalistic discourse and discuss the sociotechnical imaginaries of Big Data in cross-national comparison. We found three dominant views that centered chiefly on rebuilding a datafied society, reviving datafied business, and retooling datafied surveillance. Despite substantial data scandals and whistleblower revelations, affirmative views prevailed. The trope of reviving datafied business was most often evoked from 2011 to 2013, but rebuilding a datafied society became the central perspective from 2014 onward. This order of prominence existed in the United States and Germany, whereas a business-oriented view predominated in South African media. Some publications in all three countries ran counter to the general trend but only exerted limited influence on the overall picture.",

    "abstract": "This article results from a cross-disciplinary study which unfolds the neocolonial nature of the application of AI technologies for climate action by examining the actors’ network and discourses around this global practice. The study demonstrates that tech businesses from the Global North are currently leading the AI for Climate Action project, with certain non-profits and civil society organisations helping these actors to advance their core profit-driven ambitions. They facilitate discourses, such as ‘leveraging AI’, ‘AI innovation’, and ‘responsible AI’ to build techno-solutionist narratives and concurrently legitimise their networked relationships and actions. Drawing from our exploratory findings, we bring the question of geopolitical power imbalance into the forefront of this AI for Climate Action discussion. We highlight the deeply problematic realities around this practice that includes the minimal participation of the Global South actors in accessing the critical digital infrastructures to build AI technologies and their lack of control over the strategic decisions around the applications of such technologies in their own climate contexts. We contend that AI for Climate Action, due to the Global North-centric corporate interests, further exacerbates climate injustice by marginalising the populations who are already disproportionately impacted by climate change.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the lexical tactics of algorithmic resistance employed by Arab users to deceive Facebook content moderation algorithms in the case of censoring pro-Palestinian voices on Facebook, a phenomenon particularly conspicuous during the Palestine–Israel incidents of evicting East Jerusalem's Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood in May 2021. It has since escalated, becoming increasingly pronounced with the ongoing war that commenced on 7 October 2023, known as the ‘Operation Al-Aqsa Flood’ and continues to unfold to the present day. To achieve this aim, Facebook data scraping was used to extract comprehensive insights on the most frequent lexical resistance techniques, the most used resistance keywords, the geographical mapping of users and the related socio-political context. This study draws upon critical perspectives from data colonialism, resistance studies, critical platform studies and digital humanities to propose the concept of lexical algorithmic resistance as a conceptual framework for understanding the dynamics of language-based algorithmic resistance. By elucidating how language becomes a site of resistance, this study contributes to perspectives that deepen our understanding of power dynamics and resistance tactics in the face of data colonialism and highlights the dual nature of digital tools, which can be wielded both as instruments of oppression and tools of resistance. The study revealed the diversity of lexical algorithmic resistance techniques employed, the keywords of resistance utilised in the Arabic sphere and the variations thereof at spatial and regional levels.",

US respondents were most likely to believe in e-eavesdropping. A higher frequency of conversation-related advertising and shorter time perception were associated with e-eavesdropping beliefs. Moreover, in all three countries, we found a positive relation between conspiracy mentality and e-eavesdropping belief. The findings indicate the importance of contextual and individual factors and could help further understand privacy boundaries and enhance the ethical responsibility of Big Data collection strategies.\n          ",

    "abstract": "Recommender systems are dynamic systems used across digital platforms that personalize curation based on the individuals’ history of interactions. News recommender systems (NRSs) can enhance personal relevance and loyalty while reducing the power laws of curation. However, NRSs also denote a displacement of editorial agency and control due to technical complexity and limited transparency in personalized exposure. This study aims to bridge the gap between algorithmic curation and editorial control through a conceptual exploration of dashboards as a dynamic evaluation approach allowing translation between the personalized exposure and the situated realities of editors. We demonstrate the possibilities and limitations of dashboards by configuring three theoretically driven views on news recommendations based on a dataset containing personalized recommendations presented to audiences of a Scandinavian tabloid news site. The theories used are agenda-setting, uses and gratifications, and news repertoires. The construction of dashboards informs a discussion about how theoretical ideas about news use are informing for how evaluation approaches are pre- and configured, but also their potentials of refiguring the editorial control in algorithmic curation.",

    "abstract": "\n            Hopes and fears about algorithmic predictions are often rooted in the assumption that they represent a particularly\n            actionable\n            form of knowledge. Algorithmic predictions, the story goes, turn historical data into anticipatory actions instantly and on a large scale. Recent empirical evidence, however, casts doubt on whether algorithmic predictions are best understood as being inherently actionable. In this study, we draw on adjacent debates about actionable knowledge and reconceptualize the actionability of predictions as an active and deliberate construction accomplished by the designers of algorithmic systems. We demonstrate the value of this new perspective using material from an ethnographic research project on predictive policing in Germany. Over a 12-month period, we followed the work of designers in a police research unit responsible for developing an algorithmic system that generates crime predictions. We found that an important part of the designers’ work is calibrating the predictions. When engaging in calibration work, the designers adjust the form of the statistically calculated predictions—their volume, time, and space—to reflect their assumptions of what is most actionable knowledge for frontline police officers. Our study highlights a type of work on algorithmic systems that has received little attention, but which can have a significant impact on how the intended effects of algorithmic predictions are translated into their users’ actions.\n          ",

    "abstract": "\n            Interoperability has become a prominent topic in contemporary discourses around digital infrastructures in fields as diverse as security, finance, health, and communication. Common to these discourses are two views: first, that interoperability encompasses desiloization, i.e. the breaking down of barriers between disjoint data silos, and second, that interoperability is\n            de facto\n            good for users of digital platforms. This commentary challenges the techno-optimistic narratives often underlying this imaginary of interoperability, instead providing a perspective of the political economy of interoperability. First, it traces the historical emergence of the conceptual coupling between interoperability and data silos in which the latter presents an impediment to the realization of the former. Second, it situates imaginaries of interoperability in the paradigm of platform capitalism, highlighting that already dominant platform companies are prominent proponents of interoperability discourses, expanding what we here refer to as\n            interoperability capitalism\n            . Last, it shows that such platform companies, by advocating for interoperability via desiloization, often produce “platformed silos” that enable them to further entrench their power. We conclude by arguing that questions of political economy ought to remain front and center in studies of the techno-political imaginaries and infrastructures of interoperability.\n          ",

    "abstract": "\n            This study examines the collective actions of Chinese netizens in contesting algorithm visibility through popularity-boosting comments. Employing a netnographic approach within the theoretical frameworks of algorithm resistance and folk theories, the research analyzes popularity-boosting comments (\n            N\n             = 900) and discussions regarding these practices (\n            N\n             = 492) on Douyin, Xiaohongshu, and Weibo. The findings reveal that algorithmic resistance effectively sustains the lifecycle of posts and extends their dissemination. Netizens primarily engage in this resistance along two pathways: Within and beyond the algorithmic framework. Within the framework, conflicting folk theories trigger netizens’ internal power struggles, undermining the consistency and continuity of collective algorithmic resistance. Beyond the algorithmic framework, strategies such as creating viral memes and manually commenting on popular posts about trending events introduce innovative forms of algorithmic resistance. However, overall, regardless of whether within or beyond the algorithmic framework, netizens’ algorithmic resistance behavior is characterized by internal conflicts and relatively loose collective action. This study offers new insights into expanding the concept of algorithmic resistance, enriching the collective algorithmic resistance behaviors of netizens, and the negotiation of conflicting folk theories within those groups. It provides important implications for future research on the complex power struggles between algorithms and netizens.\n          ",

    "title": "Latin American critical data studies",
    "abstract": "In recent years, critical data studies from the Global South have gained traction, generating debates on power, knowledge production, and the politics of data. While these discussions challenge universalist frameworks, they also risk essentializing the ‘Global South’, requiring a more nuanced approach. This special issue centres Latin America as a site of theoretical, methodological, and empirical inquiry, highlighting its potential to generate new insights into datafication, power, and artificial intelligence. Rather than treating Latin America as a passive recipient of Global North theories, this issue foregrounds its epistemological and methodological contributions to global debates. Engaging with frameworks such as capitalism, coloniality, and dependency theory, the articles explore the region's heterogeneity and intellectual traditions in social sciences, humanities, and science and technology studies. This introduction proposes a research agenda for Latin American critical data studies – one that reflects historical legacies while envisioning possible data futures through interdisciplinary and critical engagement. It interrogates the politics of knowledge production, emphasizing the need for non-extractive, dialogical approaches to studying data in, from, and with Latin America. By centering Latin American scholarship and experiences, this special issue challenges dominant narratives in critical data studies and offers alternative theoretical perspectives that are globally informed yet locally grounded.",

    "abstract": "The perceived importance and difficulty of accounting for algorithms in health systems continues to inform scholarship and practice across diverse fields. While accountability is often framed as a normative good, less clear is exactly what kind of normative work accountability is expected to do, and how it is expected to do it. Drawing on contributions from science and technology studies, and especially sociomaterial perspectives on governance, in this article I review how algorithmic accountability has been conceptualized in the academic and grey literature. I introduce five normative logics characterizing discussions of algorithmic accountability: (1) accountability as verification, (2) accountability as participation, (3) accountability as social licence, (4) accountability as fiduciary duty, and (5) accountability as compliance. I critically engage with the styles of valuation these are predicated upon, including how each configures the algorithm as an object of reference, and discuss the implications of this approach for understanding how health-related worlds are created and sustained, and how they might be otherwise.",

    "title": "Inclusive yet marginalising: Symbolic empowerment through open big data in citizen science for transport planning",
    "abstract": "The open big data paradigm has reshaped citizen engagement, promoting digital participation in scientific and policy processes. Transport planning – a field dominated by technical expertise – reveals the specialised dispositions and skills needed to navigate the politics of open big data. Using a Bourdieusian lens and a case study in Hong Kong, this paper explores citizen empowerment within the open big data landscape, focusing on the symbolic aspects of data use. As citizens gain data access, they increasingly adopt professional practices valued in transport planning, aligning with the field's evidence-based standards. Despite expanded citizen participation, findings indicate that much of this engagement remains symbolic. Industry insiders, acting as cultural intermediaries and ‘historic firsts’, symbolically empower citizens by representing them, challenging stereotypes that portray citizens as uninformed. This representation shapes a collective identity, framing citizens as legitimate political agents. Access to authorised open big data sources as symbolic capital, with field-specific linguistic practices, further enhances these intermediaries’ legitimacy. Conceptualising data competencies as part of habitus – internalised schemas of behaviour – reveals that competencies extend beyond analytic skills to include navigating, interpreting and presenting data within accepted field norms, often unconsciously. Exposure to confidential information and data, though not directly usable, becomes a crucial factor in shaping habitus, enabling intermediaries to interpret open data in ways that resonate with authorities. Ultimately, while activists seek to secure their positions in transport planning, they risk reinforcing existing power structures, limiting broader citizen inclusion. This study underscores the need to address these dynamics to foster an inclusive approach to citizen participation in data-centric fields.",

    "abstract": "Farmers and agri-food movements are responding to rapidly changing trends related to digitalization and datafication in agriculture. However, there is a lack of consensus on the potential of common ‘best practices’ to resolve agricultural data governance challenges and achieve data justice. To explore these complex dynamics, we present analysis from 40 workshops, conferences, and community dialogue events related to digital agricultural technologies and data governance between 2020 and 2023, involving the participation of farmers, farming organizations, government policy and programs staff, civil society, and academic researchers. We use a data justice lens to reorient the treatment of data governance challenges and approaches. We apply multiple dimensions of justice to examine the power relations and capabilities of diverse agri-food system actors to navigate the changing landscape of agricultural datafication. We find that many common practices in agricultural data governance have fundamental limitations to achieving data justice. Overcoming these limitations will require structural change, including new laws and regulatory frameworks, novel governance structures, capacity building, and solidarity across movements.",

    "abstract": "Few studies characterize the diffusion of racist content on fringe social media platforms. We demonstrate how racism spread on Parler, a far right, un(der)-moderated social media platform, and that a single comment to a racist post increases the likelihood a person will generate and propagate new racist content. We found that racism on Parler was a social “contagion.” Using 50,375 posts from 2018 to 2021 that contained racist remarks, we quantified the spread of racism from the posts-to-comments (micro) and user-to-user (macro) levels. Comments on racist posts were 21 times more likely to be racist than comments on non-racist posts. On an average, Parler users posted 166% more racist content after an engagement with a racist post. At the posts-to-comments level, the spread of racist sentiment is alarming within ethnic subgroups (e.g. anti-Jewish-specific comments were 191 times more likely to appear on “anti-Jewish” posts; anti-Black-specific comments were 227 times more likely to appear on “anti-Black” posts). The spread of racist rhetoric between subgroups is also significant, albeit lower than within subgroups, suggesting a spillover effect. Aggregate user posting patterns also suggest that the spread of racist rhetoric between subgroups is lower, but significant. Our findings therefore suggest interventions should target users actively engaging with racist content. Furthermore, our study provides evidence that Parler served as a gateway platform that radicalized users toward racist content production, underscoring the urgency of intervention. Given the drawbacks of traditional moderation strategies, we propose additional interventions, policies, and structural changes for social media platforms to mitigate racism online.",

    "abstract": "This article analyzes how universalist paradigms for platform urbanism are being adapted, modulated, and subverted through an evolving platform ecosystem that is specific to the city of Surabaya, Indonesia's second largest city. We examine how processes of urban planning and city management are platformized, how specific groups of professionals and residents act as intermediaries between infrastructure and users and thereby facilitate the platformization process, and how these local iterations of platforms are informed by place-specific colonial and national history. By describing and tracing the genealogy of Surabaya's platform ecosystem, we demonstrate the specific ways in which it rationalizes city governance, shapes discourses on participatory citizenship and spatial planning, and redefine what counts as city infrastructure, innovation, and urban life in general. We argue that the modulation, adaptation, and resistance to platformization can only be understood by paying attention to the singularity of the milieu and tracing how visions of modernity and its sociotechnical assemblages are composed anew every time platform frameworks, tech tools, and discourses hit the ground.",

    "abstract": "Data infrastructures are becoming increasingly central in “evidence-based” and “data-driven” policymaking at the international level, but the production and use of data in governance varies between different institutions and settings. This article examines closely the relations between data production and use over time in two international organizations and their efforts to deal with emissions to air—the International Maritime Organization and the World Health Organization. The article contributes to work in STS on infrastructures by proposing new lenses through which to analyze data infrastructures in international organizations over time. We first conceptualize data infrastructures in international organizations as political formations which are institutionally negotiated and contested, and that both carry and enact relations. We then develop amendment as a praxiographic lens through which to study such data formations, based on what we call data praxiography. We analyze the politics of amendment, capturing how these data formations are continuously worked on in response to changing scientific and political interests, and how data practices are intimately linked with institutional practices and politics. The article contributes to the growing literature on data governance and digital statecraft by showing the importance of studying the continuity of data work in international organizations and the layering of data formations through amendments for understanding new data-informed modes of governance.",

    "abstract": "The establishment of norms among states is a common way of governing international actions. This article analyses the potential of norm-building for governing data and artificial intelligence technologies' collective effects. Rather than focusing on state actors's ability to establish and enforce norms, however, we identify a contrasting process taking place among civil society organisations in response to the international neoliberal consensus on the commodification of data. The norm we identify – ‘nothing about us without us’ – asserts civil society's agency, and specifically the right of those represented in datasets to give or refuse permission through structures of democratic representation. We argue that this represents a form of norm-building that should be taken as seriously as that of states, and analyse how it is constructing the political power, relations, and resources to engage in governing technology at scale. We first outline how this counter-norming is anchored in data's connections to bodies, land, community, and labour. We explore the history of formal international norm-making and the current norm-making work being done by civil society organisations internationally, and argue that these, although very different in their configurations and strategies, are comparable in scale and scope. Based on this, we make two assertions: first, that a norm-making lens is a useful way for both civil society and research to frame challenges to the primacy of market logics in law and governance, and second, that the conceptual exclusion of civil society actors as norm-makers is an obstacle to the recognition of counter-power in those spheres.",

    "abstract": "\n            Digital technologies and databases have repeatedly been associated with grand infrastructural promises in the European Union (EU)'s so-called management of borders and migration. Interoperability, i.e., the capacity to process traveler data across multiple databases, has been widely promoted as the latest and most transformative infrastructural innovation in this context. Yet, the contentious claims, voices of dissent, and opposing views regarding the remaking of this border infrastructure have often been neglected by scholarship on digital borders and interoperability. This article explores how the interoperable data infrastructure of borders has emerged as a point of contestation. It introduces the concept of\n            terrains of technopolitical contestation\n            to examine how multiple claims about interoperability have been articulated and contained. Drawing on interviews and the analysis of online and offline documents, the article identifies three key terrains that have shaped the nature and scope of contentious claims: the parliamentary, consultative, and civil society terrains. The article argues that each of these terrains characterizes the boundaries between the political and technological dimensions of interoperability, producing distinct forms of contestation. This boundary-making process is crucial not only for shaping how claims and issues can be framed but also for limiting the space of critique and critical interventions in the current technopolitics of the EU border regime.\n          ",

    "abstract": "Big data-based governance requires both compatible modes of computing data and interoperable databases. While interoperability is often portrayed as a logical imperative, we understand it as socially co-produced within a political choice for algorithmic governance. We use the case of the European Union's border management regime to show how its reconfiguration towards increasing reliance on data governance carries political and societal consequences, specifically the side-lining of civil society. In concrete, we focus on EU-funded Research and Development (R&amp;D) for security, which has seen an increase in projects addressing the realization of interoperability. Based on an original dataset of Civil Society Organization's (CSO) participation in EU security research and a mixed-methods approach combining digital methods, ethnographic methods, and semi-structured interviews, we find that civil society has largely remained side-lined in making interoperability – not as mere unintended consequence, but by design. Additionally, and in line with our socio-technical approach to the topic, our findings show how interoperability is a polysemic concept that different actors understand in very different ways, opening up for negotiation and political contestation. Although CSOs at times participate in interoperability R&amp;D projects, the political objectives of R&amp;D in terms of achieving interoperability are defined in other spatial and temporal settings outside of the ‘laboratory’ of the project. At a more general level, our findings contribute to uncover the modes in which the public relates with big data governance in the field of security.",

    "abstract": "The production of artificial intelligence (AI) requires human labour, with tasks ranging from well-paid engineering work to often-outsourced data work. This commentary explores the economic and policy implications of improving working conditions for AI data workers, specifically focusing on the impact of clearer task instructions and increased pay for data annotators. It contrasts rule-based and standard-based approaches to task instructions, revealing evidence-based practices for increasing accuracy in annotation and lowering task difficulty for annotators. AI developers have an economic incentive to invest in these areas as better annotation can lead to higher quality AI systems. The findings have broader implications for AI policy beyond the fairness of labour standards in the AI economy. Testing the design of annotation instructions is crucial for the development of annotation standards as a prerequisite for scientific review and effective human oversight of AI systems in protection of ethical values and fundamental rights.",

    "title": "Ground-truth is law: The invisible conceptual work behind AI",
    "abstract": "This article challenges the idea that the turn from rule-based algorithm to machine learning systems leads to a decline in formal conceptualization. Through ethnographic research at two artificial intelligence (AI) production sites within the French justice system, the study shows that conceptual labor remains at the heart of machine learning, shifting from algorithm coding to the curation of training data. Revisiting Lawrence Lessig's claim “code is law,” the article argues that in AI, the influence of formal code has waned, but a new form of structured conceptual framing has emerged in the form of ground-truth datasets—where “ground-truth is law.” These datasets, shaped by a range of actors across the AI production chain, subtly guide algorithmic operations under the guise of neutrality. This study applies Anselm Strauss’ “arc of work” framework to identify five critical stages in AI production: goal setting, databasing, taxonomy construction, labeling, and monitoring—and demonstrates how conceptual understandings of the world are embedded within algorithmic systems in each phase of the process. The article then examines two key mechanisms that obscure this work: first, the fragmentation and distribution of AI tasks across a broad range of actors; and second, the shift of conceptual labor away from coding toward data preparation and algorithmic monitoring. This article lays the foundation for an investigative method aimed at tracking ethnographically the entire algorithmic production chain and the diverse actors involved, in order to better document how conceptual labor is integrated into machine learning systems.",

    "abstract": "\n            Researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with an interest in the ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) need more integrative approaches for studying and intervening in AI systems across many contexts and scales of activity. This paper presents\n            AI value chains\n            as an integrative concept that satisfies that need. To more clearly theorize AI value chains and conceptually distinguish them from supply chains, we review theories of value chains and AI value chains from strategic management, service science, economic geography, industry, government, and applied research literature. We then conduct an integrative review of a sample of 67 sources that cover the ethical concerns implicated in AI value chains. Building upon the findings of our integrative review, we recommend three future directions that researchers, practitioners, and policymakers can take to advance more ethical practices across AI value chains. We urge AI ethics researchers and practitioners to move toward value chain perspectives that situate actors in context, account for the many types of resources involved in cocreating AI systems, and integrate a wider range of ethical concerns across contexts and scales.\n          ",

This article contributes to critical studies of (big) data in humanitarianism by introducing insights from the humanitarian literature on distance and proximity. It highlights three ways in which the mobilization of big data to convey “local” perceptions of needs—what we call\n            datafied localization\n            —can perpetuate epistemic injustices and paternalistic logics in humanitarian practice. First, we argue that big data represents a recontextualization rather than a decontextualization of reality, underscoring that data only becomes knowledge through contextualized interpretation. Second, we propose that the question of defining the local becomes even more pertinent in a datafied version of reality as representation takes place at a distance. Third, we argue that the introduction of big data into localization efforts risks reducing local communities to mere data suppliers, thereby reproducing the power imbalances that localization was meant to counter.\n          ",

    "abstract": "Synthetic data is increasingly used as a substitute for real data due to ethical, legal, and logistical reasons. However, the rise of synthetic data also raises critical questions about its entanglement with the politics of classification and the reproduction of social norms and categories. This paper aims to problematize the use of synthetic data by examining how its production is intertwined with the maintenance of certain worldviews and classifications. We argue that synthetic data, like real data, is embedded with societal biases and power structures, leading to the reproduction of existing social inequalities. Through empirical examples, we demonstrate how synthetic data tends to highlight majority elements as the “normal” and minimize minority elements, and that the slight changes to the data structures that create synthetic data will also inevitably result in what we term “intersectional hallucinations.” These hallucinations are inherent to synthetic data and cannot be entirely eliminated without compromising the purpose of creating synthetic datasets. We contend that decisions about synthetic data involve determining which intersections are essential and which can be disregarded, a practice which will imbue these decisions with norms and values. Our study underscores the need for critical engagement with the mathematical and statistical choices in synthetic data production and advocates for careful consideration of the ontological and political implications of these choices during curatorial style production of synthetic structured data.",

    "abstract": "\n            Due to the potential scope and impact of artificial intelligence’s (AI's) adoption in medicine, a comprehensive assessment of the potential ethical considerations arising during clinical integration is needed. Existing ethical frameworks and principles have aided in the identification of ethical considerations that may arise during the clinical integration of AI, however, our understanding of these considerations remains preliminary to the extent that it is not yet robustly informed by empirical research on key stakeholders’ experiences and perspectives. Utilizing a qualitative descriptive approach, we completed in-depth semi-structured interviews with physicians (\n            n\n             = 11) and AI researchers (\n            n\n             = 10) who had experience developing or using clinical AI regarding ethical considerations that they have perceived in relation to their work. An analysis of the interviews identified considerations related to information sharing and understanding, the risks and systemic impacts of clinical AI, and opportunities for safeguards. Physicians and AI researchers expressed questions relating to how much information and understanding is needed by both physicians and patients in order for AI to be ethically used in clinical practice, agreed that unintended impacts associated with clinical AI could pose threats to patient autonomy, and advocated for more diligent and thoughtful regulation of clinical AI innovation.\n          ",

    "abstract": "Research data management has become an inevitable part of research, and both funding agencies and publishers nowadays require open and reusable data. This article focuses on one of the most prominent initiatives promoting reusability of research data – the FAIR guiding principles – nowadays widely accepted as the new standard for research data management. Through semi-structured interviews, we investigated researchers’ experiences of practicing FAIR research data management within the context of a multi-stakeholder project within the field of health research funded by the European Commission. Our analysis showed that the informants’ experiences of practicing FAIR research data management differed largely depending on which scientific tradition they belonged to; something that previous studies have attributed to shortcomings in the current infrastructure, lack of resources and persistent cultures around data sharing in the wider scientific community. Drawing on previous work presented within the field of Critical Data Studies (CDS), we argue that our findings point to a more fundamental problem; namely the failure to recognize that the FAIR framework is built on a positivist conceptualization of data. We argue that if FAIR is to have any chance of succeeding in its ambitions to be as inclusive and all-encompassing as it wants to be, these insights need to be taken more into account and provide some potential pathways.",

    "title": "Big data visuality and interstitial spaces of autonomy: Drones and blockchains in and around Myanmar's civil war",
    "abstract": "Emergent technologies – from blockchains to drones – have sparked debate over their benefit to marginalized populations. When used in humanitarian contexts, proponents laud their ability to facilitate service delivery while critics hold that these technologies enact new regimes of control. Yet, both advocates and adversaries alike presume that the form of big data visuality generated by these technologies operates to intensify and perfect knowledge over these populations. We dispute this assertion, observing instead that this gaze both obscures even as it enhances, leaving gaps in putative control regimes. In this article, we consider instead how various projects have been improvised around humanitarian crises in Myanmar – blockchain for stateless Rohingya in Malaysia and drones for Burmese revolutionaries fighting against the country's military regime – appropriating some of these same technologies for their own purposes. These technologies interact with and draw upon broader milieus – areas not worth controlling, people not worth regulating – to enable projects that attempt to generate interstitial spaces of autonomy. Such spaces are defined not as circumscribed zones – plotted two-dimensionally on a map and (relatively) fixed temporally across time – but as mutating, rhizomatically interlinked spheres of connections. The creation of these interstitial spaces is hardly a good in itself, but can be interpreted as an indictment of the failures of the humanitarian regime. Indeed, these projects are not simple repudiations of humanitarian care and the ‘international community’ that deploys it; rather, they are reactions to the material neglect that manifests in the regime of biopolitical control deployed by states and their multilateral institutions.",

    "abstract": "Tech workers often experience ethical tensions arising from the misalignment of their values and the prevailing unethical or ethically ambiguous practices concerning data and algorithms in the workplace. Despite this, there is an insufficient understanding of how tech professionals address ethical tensions. Based on interviews with 98 tech workers in China and the United States, this study explores ethical tensions, the workers’ responses, and potential cross-national variations. It identifies three prevalent strategies by which tech workers navigate conflicts between their ethical principles and their companies’ practices: complying with market fundamentalism, compromising personal ethics, and upholding and critiquing ethical guidelines. Cross-national differences in strategy implementation highlight nuanced approaches by tech workers in diverse economic, political, and ethical contexts. The study positions these responses within a theoretical framework of ethical agency, revealing tech workers’ subtle ethical agency and the factors that constrain their decision-making processes. It also contributes data-driven insights to promote ethical practices in the global tech industry.",

However, common approaches to responsible governance of AI are often predicated upon notions of predictable pipelines and static outputs which are assumed to be easily describable and cleanly structured. Drawing upon empirical findings which challenge these notions, and conceptual tools from Simone de Beauvoir's\n            Ethics of Ambiguity\n            , I illustrate how AI [ethics] can be better understood as grounded in ambiguity and propose reframing ambiguity from a failure or risk to a core facet of the study and governance of AI. I report on interviews with 23 AI practitioners, combined with observations from an ethnography of an AI practitioner based in an industry AI lab, examining their motivations, aims and actions in developing and implementing AI models. Practitioners described the impact of local, epistemic and systemic constraints, employing heuristics, intuition and creative problem-solving to navigate embedded, inherent ambiguity and uncertainty across material and practice. Building on these analyses, I propose that engaging with ambiguity in the study and ethics of AI can provide productive sites for ethical reflection and governance.\n          ",

    "title": "Encroaching Borders and Defencelessness of Migrants at Checkpoints in Southern Mexico",
    "abstract": "After an intimidating experience I had during a checkpoint on the southern border of Mexico in 2023, I began to investigate the prevalence and impacts of immigration checkpoints. Despite having been declared unconstitutional by the Mexican Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación (Supreme Court of Justice) in 2022, checkpoints are still one of the most common and least regulated practices to detain people on the move, especially in the context of anti-drug operations. In this paper, I show how checkpoints have become a violent infrastructure dispersed across the Mexican territory. The flexibility and mobility of checkpoints and the actors administering them—governmental actors, extra-legal groups, and criminal networks—expose migrants to racialized and gendered forms of extreme violence and human rights violations. I present the findings of research conducted in 2022 and 2023 in the city of Tapachula, Chiapas, and its surroundings, consisting of participant observation and interviews with migrants who interacted with the Guardia Nacional (National Guard) during waiting, transit, or detention. I also interviewed ten civil society organizations that provide psycho-legal assistance to migrant people detained at checkpoints throughout the country. I analyze how, in hazardous conditions, being stopped in a checkpoint while traveling in Mexican highways can generate intimidation and defenselessness against all kinds of human rights violations.\nResumen\nTras haber vivido una experiencia intimidante durante un control fronterizo en el sur de México en 2023, comencé a investigar la prevalencia y los impactos de los retenes en carreteras para las personas migrantes. A pesar de que en 2022 la Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación declaró la inconstitucionalidad de las revisiones migratorias al interior del país, los retenes siguen siendo una de las prácticas más comunes y menos reguladas para detener a las personas en movilidad, especialmente en el contexto de los operativos antidrogas. En este artículo analizo los retenes en carreteras que funcionan como infraestructuras violentas dispersas por todo el territorio mexicano. Tanto su flexibilidad y movilidad, como los actores que los operan—actores gubernamentales, grupos extralegales y redes criminales—exponen a las personas migrantes a formas de violencia racializadas y de género y a serias violaciones de los derechos humanos. Presento los resultados de una investigación realizada en 2022 y 2023 en la ciudad de Tapachula, Chiapas, y sus alrededores, que consistió observación participante y entrevistas con personas migrantes que interactuaron con la Guardia Nacional durante los procesos de espera, tránsito o detención. Incluyo las entrevistas realizadas a diez organizaciones de la sociedad civil que brindan acompañamiento psico-jurídico a personas migrantes detenidas en retenes a lo largo de todo el país. Analizo cómo, en condiciones de riesgo, la detención en un retén por las carreteras mexicanas puede generar intimidación e indefensión ante todo tipo de violaciones de derechos humanos.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we enrich feminist theorizing on care by tracing more-than-human relationalities that are grounded in place but also stretch across México, the United States, and Canada. In three brief vignettes, we outline how geopolitical conditions of im/mobility intersect with specific material, semiotic, and affective relations of care involving Sonoran Desert soils, berries, toxins, and human bodies. In line with Indigenous theorizing on the myriad ways borders have colonized our political imaginaries, we suggest that more-than-human care is relational, not territorial—not contained by borders.\nResumen\nEn este artículo, enriquecemos la teoría feminista sobre el cuidado al rastrear relaciones más-que-humanas que están arraigadas al lugar pero que también se extienden a lo largo de México, los Estados Unidos de América y Canadá. En tres breves viñetas, describimos cómo las condiciones geopolíticas de in/movilidad se entrelazan con diferentes aspectos del cuidado, desde sus relaciones materiales, semióticas y afectivas hasta las más específicas que involucran los suelos del desierto de sonora, frutos rojos, toxinas y humanos en movimiento. En línea con la teoría indígena sobre las formas en que las fronteras han colonizado nuestros imaginarios políticos, sugerimos que el cuidado más-que-humano es relacional, no territorial.

    "title": "Queering Ecology",
    "abstract": "Homes are intimate spaces where many bodies come together in space and time to deeply learn and understand the processes that have created one another. Ecology, the study of the relationship between organisms and their environment, is based on the study of a home. Yet ecologists are trained in patriarchal, heteronormative, and otherwise Western articulations and understandings of nature that prevent access to this ecological home. In this article, I argue that through (re)constructing ecology as a home, ecologists can better understand the social and ecological processes that shape an organism. To (re)construct ecology as a home, I first dissect conflict with wildlife as a concept that reinforces taxonomical hierarchies and prevents humans from making a home with wildlife. I then leverage Queer theory to flatten taxonomical hierarchies and create a landscape that invites the (re)construction of ecology as a homemaking discipline. Lastly, I sit within the ecological home to examine urban wildlife and the environmental pressures they are subjected to—using the urban coyote as an example. This work leverages Queerness to collapse taxonomical hierarchies and push traditional ecology towards a boundless relationality with wildlife to more holistically understand the various social and ecological pressures that ultimately create their phenotype.",

    "title": "Sociotechnical Infrastructures and Textures of Care",
    "abstract": "This article explores the possibilities and limitations of care within sociotechnical infrastructures, including semi-automated, bureaucratic, and machine learning systems. Emerging from an ongoing research project that started during the global pandemic and grounded in ethics of care approaches, our project critically interrogates how such infrastructures not only create conditions for care but also reconfigure care itself to align with their underlying ideologies and discourses. Drawing on theories of care, particularly María Puig de la Bellacasa’s (2017) conceptualization of work-affect-politics, the article examines the politics and practices of care shaped by grant management infrastructures that underpin academic work. These infrastructures are framed as contexts where social actors and technological artifacts interweave into unified systems, and in the context of this article refer to the lived experiences of conducting research. Ultimately, the article argues that sociotechnical infrastructures function as “conditions of possibility” for care, and as indicative of the now-endemic ways that work-affect-politics is enmeshed in sociotechnical infrastructures.",

    "abstract": "In this article, I argue for an antinormative bioethics based in disability experiences drawn from memoirists’ accounts of idiosyncratic needs and desires that are obscured by normative impulses in mainstream bioethics. Bioethics has long been shaped by a commitment to the normal, which often casts disabled people and the category of disability as anterior to bioethical concerns about individual rights, protections, and property. Focusing on disability experiences and the category of disability—as developed by disability studies scholars and supported by materialist feminist science and technology studies—provides a grounding for an inclusive bioethics that creates livable lives through careful and creative alliance building in and beyond the contexts in which bioethics has traditionally operated. I focus herein on the non-unitary experience of autism and the facilitation of people who identify as autistic to develop this inclusive and responsive bioethical praxis.",

    "title": "“I Graft a New Tribalism”",
    "abstract": "In this essay, I engage the makings and evolution of queer Chicana theorist and feminist philosopher of science Gloria E. Anzaldúa’s generative engagements with Indigenous onto-epistemologies and syncretized spiritualities, as well as her (re)visionary disidentifications with the biosciences for matters of speculative visioning and social justice. Stitching together the rich insights of the fields of Chicanx/Latinx studies and queer feminist science and technology studies, I survey how Anzaldúa treads the boundaries between the humanities and biosciences as a means of complicating and rewriting new narratives of identity and belonging. Borrowing from the lexicon of the animal, plant, and other life sciences, Anzaldúa risks repurposing vexed evolutionary metaphors—namely, for the purposes of this essay, the “tree of life” image—to instantiate one part of what I call her “affiliative biofuturities.” Thinking from and through a border/nepantla space, Anzaldúa sifts through and remixes humanistic, scientific, esoteric, and spiritualized modes of inquiry to fashion alternative ways of knowing, seeing, and being in the world. Ultimately, I suggest that Anzaldúa’s Chicanafuturist œuvre radically reconceptualizes and expands our understanding of identity and our relationality to other beings/species while taking seriously the liberatory potentialities of “unruly” knowledge-making practices in times of socioecological crises.",

    "abstract": "Resumen\nActualmente, la observación y registro de las aves realizado por personas en todo el mundo suele asociarse con prácticas de ciencia ciudadana promovidas por distintas instancias que persiguen diferentes propósitos, casi siempre alineados con la identificación taxonómica y la producción de bases de datos mundiales sobre biodiversidad. Algunas de estas prácticas han sido cuestionadas por omitir las condiciones de vulnerabilidad ambiental y los vínculos entre humanos y más que humanos que dan lugar a estas observaciones, descontextualizando la información producida. En este trabajo propongo que las aves y las personas se constituyen en coagentes para la construcción de la frontera a través de un análisis de las prácticas de observación y documentación de aves realizadas por personas que viven en Ciudad Juárez, una metrópoli ubicada en la frontera norte de México, vulnerada por la contaminación industrial y el desecamiento del Río Bravo. Desde una perspectiva más que humana y en diálogo con estudios feministas de la ciencia, se muestra cómo las observaciones que realizan estas personas responden a intereses diversos, desde los científicos hasta aquellos relacionados con el reclamo ciudadano de contar con más espacios públicos, las prácticas artísticas y de denuncia por un entorno lastimado y vulnerado en ambos lados de la frontera. Se trata de prácticas que buscan poner atención en las distintas formas de vida que participan en la construcción de las ciudades y las fronteras e involucrarse con su cuidado.\nAbstract\nThe observation and recording of birds by people around the world are often linked to citizen science initiatives aimed at various goals, primarily focused on taxonomic identification and the creation of global biodiversity databases. However, some of these practices have faced criticism for ignoring the conditions of environmental vulnerability and the connections between humans and more-than-humans, which can lead to a decontextualization of the information produced. In this paper, I suggest that birds and people can be seen as co-agents in constructing the border, particularly through an analysis of bird observation and documentation practices by residents of Ciudad Juarez, a northern Mexican metropolis affected by industrial pollution and the depletion of the Rio Bravo. Adopting a more-than-human perspective and engaging with feminist science studies, I illustrate how these observations reflect various interests, ranging from scientific inquiry to community demands for more public spaces, artistic expressions, and advocacy for a healthier environment on both sides of the border. These practices emphasize the importance of acknowledging the diverse forms of life that contribute to the shaping of cities and borders, and they advocate for greater involvement in their care and protection.",

Drawing on my own experience living with type 1 diabetes, I reflect on what it means to depend upon a synthetic, politicized, exogenous hormone—insulin—from the very pharmaceutical and medical industries responsible for widescale, non-consensual exposures to endocrine disruptors (like the estrogen-mimickers in consumer plastics), while simultaneously barring trans, non-binary, and chronically ill people from accessing necessary and/ or desired hormones (like insulin, estrogen, testosterone). What determines whose body—human or nonhuman—is disruptive? Musing on my life as a full-time pancreas whose existence is made possible by laboratory-made insulin and wearable pumps and glucose monitors, I argue that to access humanity is more than being unadulterated, and aspiring towards a non-toxic or pure future is both impossible given the legacy of forever chemicals and missing the point, which is that humanity is more than the hormones that do or do not innately constitute us.",

    "abstract": "Declaración del artista: A diferencia de la concepción más tradicional de la fotografía como práctica de extrañamiento y construcción de otros fotográficos, mi interés como artista visual está marcada por procesos de empatía y reconocimiento. Esto supone asumirme como parte de lo que mira y es mirado, en una suerte de efecto espejo que trasciende la mera curiosidad antropológica para abrazar, en cambio, el acto gozoso de participación colectiva y la mirada voyeur. Pero esta mirada no es una mirada universalista o atemporal, sino la mirada de una artista mujer en una de las ciudades más grandes del mundo, la Ciudad de México. Habitar el lugar del voyeur en espacios donde la mirada hegemónica es masculina supone cambiar de posición para ser, por un lado, la artista que mira desde el anonimato, y por el otro, la que experimenta con la imagen fija y la imagen en movimiento, en un impulso constante por registrar los vestigios de la urbe. Es así que concibo mi mirada detenida a través del lente de una cámara como un acto semejante al de mirarse en un espejo. Me miro, reconozco y diferencio en otros y otras. Para luego poder mostrar la imposibilidad de todos esos intentos, con elementos fundamentales como el tiempo, ya sea en video, instalaciones fotogénicas o la poesía.\nEste tipo de mirada es una intervención radical en un país como México donde las relaciones sociales se encuentran sujetas y determinadas por roles de género y de clase; donde la invisibilización de los individuos es un elemento de control. Me interesa incidir en las artes visuales de las Américas desde planteamientos fotográficos en clave expandida, nuevos formatos, soportes y soluciones expositivas, pero desde un situacionismo social, epistémico y creativo. A lo largo de 10 series y dos libros, he construido a la Ciudad de México como escenario de la mirada y al mismo tiempo, como un personaje más que determina el transitar de sus habitantes.\nPara más información sobre la obra de Nirvana Paz, visite: www.nirvanapaz.com\nArtist statement: Unlike the more traditional conception of photography as a practice of estrangement and the construction of photographic others, my interest as a visual artist is marked by processes of empathy and recognition. This involves acknowledging myself as part of what sees and is seen, in a sort of mirror effect that transcends mere anthropological curiosity to embrace, instead, the joyful act of collective participation and voyeuristic observation. However, this gaze is neither universalist nor timeless; it is the gaze of a woman artist in one of the largest cities in the world, Mexico City. To inhabit the voyeur’s perspective in spaces where the hegemonic gaze is masculine implies shifting positions—to be, on one hand, the artist who observes from anonymity, and on the other, the one who experiments with still and moving images, driven by a constant impulse to document the vestiges of the urban landscape. Thus, I conceive of my gaze through the camera lens as an act akin to looking into a mirror. I see myself, recognize, and differentiate myself in others. Then, I aim to reveal the impossibility of all those attempts, using fundamental elements such as time, whether through video, photogenic installations, or poetry.\nThis kind of gaze represents a radical intervention in a country like Mexico, where social relationships are subject to and shaped by gender and class roles, where the invisibilization of individuals serves as a form of control. I am interested in influencing the visual arts of the Americas through expanded photographic approaches, new formats, media, and exhibition solutions, but always from a social, epistemic, and creative situational perspective. Across 10 series and two books, I have constructed Mexico City as both the stage for the gaze and a character itself, shaping the journey of its inhabitants.\nFor more about Nirvana Paz's work, please visit: www.nirvanapaz.com\n ",

    "abstract": "This article interrogates the role of misoprostol, an abortifacient pharmaceutical, in recent Argentine abortion activism through the lens of biopolitics. For more than three decades, misoprostol has enabled activists to accompany and facilitate self-managed abortions safely in settings where access is restricted. In Argentina, where abortion was legalized in 2021, misoprostol has been harnessed by feminist activists not only as a pharmaceutical technology, but also, as I argue here, a biopolitical one fostering a distinctly feminist “biopolitics from below” (Biehl 2016). Building on an analysis of informative and narrative materials publicized by activist groups, I trace the affective mechanisms by which feminist activists contest hegemonic subjectivities. I focus on feminist knowledge productions about misoprostol and the affective paradigms made possible through them to suggest that its pharmaceutical properties have enabled activist practices that link the commanding of scientific knowledge to the production of political knowledges. Through these practices, feminist activists have turned misoprostol into a technology for shaping counter-hegemonic subjectivities as embodied, affective, and relational.",

    "abstract": "Recently proposed alterations to the United States Patent Act would unsettle the US Supreme Court’s 2013 invalidation of isolated gene patents. Simultaneously, biotechnological advances have led to the increasing availability of pre-implantation genetic testing (PGT), which enables the (de-)selection of embryos following in vitro fertilization and prior to implantation. This paper uses the patent debates as an opening through which to examine the nexus of patent law, technoscientific capitalism, and reproductive genetic technologies—specifically, a form of pre-implantation genetic testing (PGT-M) that identifies specific genetic sequences that contribute to disease. Using feminist science studies and reproductive justice frameworks, I argue that the gendered imaginary of “high-risk” investment and health risk management, coupled with the privatization of biomaterial disproportionately produced by women, may exacerbate racial and economic inequities in access to reproductive healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Borders are complex configurations intertwined with political regimes, ecosystems, flows of bodies, objects, technologies, and affects. Feminist STS, with its attention to infrastructure and its intimacies, more-than-human relationalities, and investigative aesthetics, is ripe for a re-engagement with contemporary securitized borders and their lifeworlds. Using a mix of Spanish and English, we perform and theorize the importance of pocho linguistic third spaces for feminist community and offer practical tools for reading beyond English to frame the Spanish-language contributions in this Special Section. We ask how we can “know borders” otherwise and offer three emergent paths of reflexive engagement: Materialidades: Intimate Infrastructures, Ecologías: More-than-Human Migrations and Ecologies of Care, and Estéticas: The Research-Creation Nexus. After a curated review of the literature on borders and migration in the United States and Mexico, we suggest the analytic power of these lenses to nurture feminist attention to both the vibrancy and violences of contemporary borders and foster a grounded and generative politics of care and solidarity.\nResumen\nLas fronteras son configuraciones complejas entrelazadas con regímenes políticos, ecosistemas y flujos de cuerpos, tecnologías y afectos. Los estudios feministas de la ciencia, con su atención puesta en la infraestructura y sus intimidades, las relaciones más-que-humanas y las estéticas investigativas, están maduros para un nuevo compromiso con las fronteras contemporáneas securitizadas y sus mundos de vida y muerte. Transitando entre el español y el inglés, y habitando lo que llamamos aquí un espacio de práctica pocho, exploramos y teorizamos sobre las posibilidades de los terceros espacios lingüísticos para la comunidad feminista y ofrecemos herramientas prácticas para leer más allá de los marcos interpretativos anglosajones hegemónicos. En esta sección especial abordamos la cuestión de cómo “conocer las fronteras” de otro modo, y ofrecemos tres vías emergentes de compromiso reflexivo: Materialidades: Infraestructuras íntimas, ecologías: Migraciones más que humanas y ecologías del cuidado, y estéticas: El nexo entre investigación y creación. Tras llevar a cabo una revisión cuidadosa de las literaturas sobre fronteras y migración en los Estados Unidos y México, sugerimos el poder analítico de estos lentes para nutrir la atención feminista tanto a las violencias como a la vitalidad y las potencias que se despliegan en las fronteras contemporáneas, abogando por una política situada de la solidaridad y el cuidado. ",

No nos enfocaremos en hacer aportaciones conceptuales para el campo académico, pero sí trataremos de presentar a este archivo vivo como una forma y tecnología autogestiva mediante la cual hemos comenzado a producir conocimiento situado en bucles de praxis, aprendiendo de las relaciones geológicas y más que humanas en las que existimos. Narraremos algunos de los programas públicos que hemos organizado y presentaremos una lectura del espacio geográfico que habitamos, haciendo énfasis en cómo entendemos que la asimetría de la frontera geopolítica México-Estados Unidos se incorpora en nuestra experiencia y memoria del espacio, el río y el agua. También iremos planteando una serie de preguntas que nos puedan ayudar a orientar la producción del Archivo Familiar del Río Colorado, ubicando cuáles son los límites y los potenciales de este archivo como forma, tanto para resistir a las pérdidas ecosistémicas que sufrimos en esta parte de la cuenca como para imaginar su futuro.\nAbstract\nThis text and series of images will describe the Colorado River Family Archive, an artistic research and collective curatorial project that seeks to make sense of the relationships we have with water in the Colorado River Delta region.

We will narrate some of the public programs we have organized and present a reading of the geographic space we inhabit, emphasizing how we understand that the characteristic asymmetry of the Mexico-United States geopolitical border is incorporated into our experience and memory of space, the river, and water. We will also raise a series of questions that can help us guide the production of the Colorado River Family Archive, identifying the limits and potential of this archive as a form, both to resist the ecosystem losses we suffer in this part of the basin and to imagine its future.",

    "title": "Ethnicity Statistics as Tricky Tools in “Post-Racial” Britain",
    "abstract": "The inclusion of a “mixed and multiple ethnic” category in the UK census since 2001 has mobilized a post-racial discourse that sensationalizes Britain’s growing mixed-race population as representing Britain’s post-raciality. Two decades later, the 2011 census was linked up with National Health Service records to provide death statistics disaggregated by ethnicity. This article explores the consequences of these statistics for Britain’s claims of post-raciality, given that the Office for National Statistics reported the “mixed and multiple ethnic” category as dying at amongst the highest rates of suicide in the UK between 2012 and 2019. In this article, I use feminist data science methods to research the UK’s ethnicity statistics and surrounding discourses in order to analyze the co-existence of celebratory narratives of mixedness and high rates of suicide. Drawing on Rajani Bhatia’s articulation of the male/female sex ratio as a “tricky tool” for feminist struggle, I consider the UK’s ethnicity statistics as a tricky tool for research on mixedness at the intersections of the overrepresentation of mixed lives and the underrepresentation of mixed deaths in “post-racial” Britain.",

    "abstract": "In the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juárez, numerous animal protection organizations seek to rescue street dogs that have been abandoned or abused. Many of these organizations seek to place previously abused dogs in “forever homes” in the United States. To accomplish this, the dogs often go through a transformation that transforms them into objects of care, making them adoptable. In this article, I analyze how narratives and photos used in social media enable this transformation by creating individual animal biographies. These animal biographies are not innocent stories; rather, they show how care is constructed in specific contexts. The construction of these biographies is presented as a non-political attempt to make the lives of abandoned dogs better; these biographies are, in fact, filled with political implications of what the Mexico-US border is like. Thus, I argue that animal biographies have a significant social role, particularly through social media, and have to be understood as political devices that can create, challenge, or strengthen ideas about life, care, and ethics.\nResumen\nEn la ciudad fronteriza de Ciudad Juárez, México, las organizaciones protectoras de animales buscan rescatar perros abandonados, víctimas de abuso, o en situación de calle. Muchas de estas organizaciones intentan que los perros rescatados sean adoptados de manera permanente en los Estados Unidos. Con esta finalidad, los perros generalmente son transformados en “objetos de cuidado”, haciéndolos adoptables. En este artículo analizo cómo las narrativas y las fotos que se usan en las redes sociales permiten llevar a cabo esta transformación al crear biografías animales individuales. Estas biografías animales no son historias inocentes, más bien demuestran cómo el cuidado se construye en contextos específicos. La construcción de dichas biografías que intenta transformar, para bien, las vidas de los perros, aparenta ser un acto apolítico. Sin embargo, estas biografías están repletas de implicaciones políticas sobre la vida fronteriza entre México y los EEUU. Por lo tanto argumento que las biografías animales tienen un significado social, particularmente en las redes sociales, y que tienen que ser entendidas como artífices políticos que pueden crear, desafiar y fortalecer concepciones sobre la vida, el cuidado, y la ética. ",

This interview addresses this question and attempts to outline some possible strategies, based on the experience of a Mexican journalist. Marcela Turati’s 2023 book San Fernando: Última parada allows us to talk about the ways in which borders constitute complex nodes of human, economic, political, and criminal flows, where diverse ecologies, landscapes, territories, and social practices intersect. The violence recounted in her book shows how these nodes are also devices for selecting vulnerable or disposable people, who can be killed or disappeared without the state pursuing those responsible or seeking justice, what Turati calls “an authorized crime.”\nResumen\n¿Cómo pensar e investigar las relaciones entre los territorios y la producción de conocimiento situado en el campo de la violencia?

La violencia que se relata en el libro muestra cómo esos nodos son también dispositivos de selección de personas vulnerables o desechables, que pueden ser asesinadas o desaparecidas sin que el Estado persiga a los responsables ni haga justicia.

    "abstract": "In this research I interrogate how metrics of food insecurity rely on indexes of deprivation, of which Indigeneity is deemed an indicator of social deprivation. I engage the fields of critical Indigenous studies, critical whiteness studies, and Indigenous science, technology, and society. I argue that social deprivation indexes produce and surveil “deprived” geographic food zones according to metrics of whiteness. I make three central arguments through the empirical context of food insecurity interventions for Indigenous people in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. First, accounting for food insecurity through social deprivation indexes produces food insecurity because it does not accurately depict sources of food outside of what has been deemed appropriate (see: “healthy”) through logics of whiteness. Second, solely imagining food insecurity through logics of social deprivation results in interventions of whiteness, which overdetermines how inner-city urban space is designed, surveilled, and made carceral. Third, if food studies does not interrogate and make serious efforts to undo its own whiteness, it will continue to be deficient in its renderings and understanding of food geographies beyond whiteness.",

    "title": "Healing Cartographies",
    "abstract": "This paper examines the transformative memory of two GuateMaya feminist groups across settler-colonial borders. The paper explores the multidimensional ways the groups create a countercultural memory, opposing Guatemala’s state of what can be remembered and what cannot. 8 Tijax is a grassroots group formed during the wake of March 8, 2017, a day that fifty-six girls were victims of a fire at a state-operated shelter, Hogar Seguro Virgen de la Asuncion. Through accompaniment and spreading awareness about the case, the group has linked with other feminist groups across borders. One group is GuateMaya Mujeres Resistiendo-Los Angeles (GMR-LA), a multigenerational group in the diaspora that continues to amplify the cultural memory of the disappeared. Both groups are committed to what I call healing cartographies, weaving memory, movement, and embodied testimonios across imaginary lines. The groups honor their loved ones’ memories by installing public altars, photos, art, and poetry as counter memories. This paper explores the concept of healing cartographies and the ethnographic work I employed in Guatemala and Los Angeles from 2019 to 2023 as part of my dissertation. By producing a countercultural memory, the groups challenge state-imposed boundaries of what should be remembered, challenging border-thinking and working towards a hemispheric memory of expansiveness, fluidity, and transformation.\nResumen\nEste artículo examina la memoria transformadora de dos grupos feministas guatemayas a través de las fronteras coloniales. El artículo explora las formas multidimensionales en que los grupos crean una memoria contracultural, oponiéndose al estado de Guatemala de lo que se puede recordar y lo que no. 8 Tijax es un grupo de base formado durante la estela del 8 de marzo de 2017, un día en que cincuenta y seis niñas fueron víctimas de un incendio en un refugio estatal, el Hogar Seguro Virgen de la Asunción. A través del acompañamiento y la difusión del caso, el grupo se ha vinculado con otros grupos feministas más allá de las fronteras. Un grupo es GuateMaya Mujeres Resistiendo-Los Ángeles (GMR-LA), un grupo multigeneracional en la diáspora que continúa amplificando la memoria cultural de los desaparecidos. Ambos grupos están comprometidos con lo que yo llamo cartografías sanadoras, tejiendo la memoria, el movimiento y los testimonios  encarnados a través de líneas imaginarias. Los grupos honran la memoria de sus seres queridos instalando altares públicos, fotos, arte y poesía como contramemorias. Este artículo explora el concepto de cartografías sanadoras y el trabajo etnográfico que empleé en Guatemala y Los Ángeles de 2019 a 2023 como parte de mi tesis. Al producir una memoria contracultural, los grupos desafían los límites impuestos por el Estado de lo que debe recordarse, desafiando el pensamiento fronterizo y trabajando hacia una memoria hemisférica de expansión, fluidez y transformación. ",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the emergence of Quebrar, a community-led drug recovery program, as a dynamic and evolving alternative infrastructure within New Mexico’s complex historical, political, and social contexts. Established in 1968 by a coalition of activists, drug users, and individuals in recovery, Quebrar aimed to address the pervasive lack of support for drug addiction in a region marked by racial violence, land dispossession, and the criminalization of drug use. Through ethnographic research and archival sources, this paper explores the processes and strategies through which Quebrar transformed a decommissioned site into a drug recovery program. Quebrar’s infrastructure serves as a “thing-in-motion” by resisting and reimagining colonial and carceral systems tied to addiction treatment. This exploration raises questions about how alternative infrastructures can evolve in response to histories of colonialism and what they offer for future reimaginings of care and justice. Finally, it considers how these themes intersect with the practice of research itself, asking how embodied knowledge can be incorporated into the research process.\nResumen\nEste artículo explora el surgimiento de Quebrar, un programa de rehabilitación de drogas dirigido por la comunidad, como una infraestructura alternativa dinámica y en evolución dentro de los complejos contextos históricos, políticos y sociales de Nuevo México. Creado en 1968 por una coalición de activistas, consumidores de drogas y personas en proceso de recuperación, Quebrar pretendía hacer frente a la omnipresente falta de apoyo a la drogadicción en una región marcada por la violencia racial, el despojo de tierras y la criminalización del consumo de drogas. A través de la investigación etnográfica y fuentes de archivo, este artículo examina cómo Quebrar transformó un lugar abandonado en un programa de rehabilitación de drogas y cómo su infraestructura resiste y reimagina los sistemas coloniales y carcelarios vinculados al tratamiento de la adicción. De este modo, la infraestructura de Quebrar se convierte en un «objeto en movimiento» que evoluciona en respuesta a las condiciones históricas y materiales. Este artículo también plantea cuestiones sobre cómo pueden evolucionar las infraestructuras alternativas en respuesta a las historias de colonialismo y qué ofrecen para futuras reimaginaciones del cuidado y la justicia. Por último, se reflexiona cómo estos temas se entrecruzan con la práctica de la investigación.",

    "abstract": " This study proposes the concept of platformed creativity to examine how new technologies have engaged in the social dynamics of creative practices. In recent years, a few Korean female digital creators have become visible by producing and sharing gender-bound football media content on YouTube. Based on a critical discourse analysis involving the channels of four female Korean chuktubers, I found that this user-generated media platform offers these female digital creators the opportunity to capitalize on their unpopular and unconventional characteristics and narratives, allowing them to transform their creative practices into collective resistance against gender norms and hierarchies in the football media industry. However, YouTube also limits these chuktubers’ creative possibilities to the extent that it does not fundamentally intervene in the existing gender architecture within society. This study concludes that user-generated media platforms invigorate the social dynamics of creative practices while simultaneously controlling the social potential of creative imagination. ",

    "title": "Making immersive storytelling accessible: Interactive low-tech implementation in elementary school civic learning",
    "abstract": "Immersive storytelling (IST) is usually conceptualized within the framework of technologically immersive tools such as virtual, augmented, and mixed reality. While these tools offer some unique features (such as visual fidelity, interactivity, and embodied, first-person perspective), their level of technological immersion (based on the system’s objective qualities) might not directly translate to the psychological immersion experienced by the user. Such tools also tend to require access to digital or financial resources unavailable to many schools. We propose a low-tech alternative approach leveraging storytelling’s power for learning through affordable, accessible, and familiar classroom technology – Google Slides. We used the Participatory Learning framework to generate curricular design principles that aim to create a sense of psychological immersion through active participation in technology-mediated storytelling. In this design case study paper, we describe the design of a 10-day unit on Native American history implemented across nine teachers’ elementary school classrooms in the US. We examine the interplay between pedagogical and technological constraints in the design process, the role of the theoretical framework in the design, and conclude by detailing future directions for research on low-tech immersive storytelling environments.",

    "abstract": "The penetration of social media platforms in the cultural production and consumption circuits of sport mega-events means that organisations like the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) are afforded new and alternative channels to engage with their audiences. TikTok, one of the largest platforms, is characterised by a higher degree of playfulness and humorous content and has been used to mobilise audiences for prosocial political aims. Using TikTok’s Research API access, this article relies on automatically collected metadata from all IPC posts between May 2023 and May 2024. After consolidating and manipulating the data through Python, statistical analyses were performed on SPSS to understand how certain content becomes more visible on the platform. In a second stage, videos with most virality underwent visual discourse analysis. We hold that the IPC, to challenge invisibilities, arguably one of the biggest obstacles for disability sport, engages in the circulation of humorous content with the aim of promoting inclusion and social change for persons with disabilities. While TikTok and the circulation of humorous content afford the IPC wider visibility to new audiences, it might provoke unintended consequences through further stigmatisation of disability sport as non-serious activity.",

    "title": "Narrative virtual reality as a memory machine",
    "abstract": "Since 2014, a new narrative medium has been emerging that is delivered through virtual reality headsets. This paper theorizes narrative virtual reality as a new filmic medium with new and unique affordances that facilitate narrating and sharing memories. In contradistinction to the much-discussed concept of VR as an ‘empathy machine’, we propose to think of VR as a memory machine. This capability of VR is reflected in the proliferation of memory-related content in narrative VR and its early adoption in public history. Narrating and sharing individual and collective traumatic memories have featured prominently in narrative VR. Three unique properties enable a recipient of narrative VR, the immersant, to experience someone else’s memories: embodiment, immersion, and interactivity. First, embodiment allows the immersant to assume the role of the person who remembers or a person that is being remembered. Second, immersion enables the virtual transportation to a past setting that is remembered. Third, since VR always offers at least some form of interactivity, narrative VR permits the immersant to have agency within the remembered narrative. These three aspects combine to provide a qualitatively richer experience of memories in VR than was possible in conventional narrative media. We show how creators have leveraged these specific affordances of VR in support of narrating memories by analyzing two case-studies. First, we look at an example of traumatic collective memory in The Book of Distance (2020), which narrates a family history of forced removal and internment of Japanese immigrants in Canada during World War II from the perspective of the victim’s grandson. Second, we discuss Is Anna Ok? (2018), which lets the immersant experience two sisters' memories of traumatic brain injury, once from the perspective of the injured victim and once from the sister who witnessed the accident.",

After a brief conceptual introduction and a legal and policy review, an explanation of the analytical framework used follows, together with a structured analysis of stakeholders’ views regarding the content, implementation and impact of EU regulation and policy for prominence and discoverability of EU works and of services of general interest. Conclusions revolve around the existence, or not, of advocacy coalitions, emerging key policy issues, and challenges to be met.",

    "abstract": "Evidence suggests that the rate of reporting abuse, harassment and problematic content to platforms is substantially low. This article assesses the extent to which platform interfaces may contribute to discouraging the use of reporting as a remedy to online harms. Using a walkthrough method, we analyse reporting interfaces for the extent to which they may contribute to a lack of trust in reporting. The study found that reporting interfaces (1) did not provide appropriate access to platform policy or guidelines, (2) failed to provide options for dialogue, testimonials or mechanisms to report in formats supporting user wellbeing needs, (3) were consistently framed as individualising and transactional rather than brokering care or peer support, and (4) added to the opacity of platform intervention and decision-making processes. We argue the available interfaces do not do enough to protect users from digital harms.",

    "title": "Visibility of K-pop in the U.S.: Global rankings, ‘audience mis-aggregation’, and mainstream attention to niche genre",
    "abstract": " K-pop, a niche genre appealing to certain audience segments in the global market, has now attracted mainstream attention of music industries and general audiences within and beyond Asia. Previous studies often attribute niche genres’ visibility in a cultural market to audience segmentation and the prominence of niche tastes; however, K-pop’s mainstream visibility in its transnational spread complicates this argument. Integrating the sociology of quantification to studies on audience metrics and social quantification, this paper takes BTS as a case and examines how they gained mainstream visibility in the U.S. as the consequences of institutional audiences construction by Billboard’s global rankings – Social 50 and Top Social Artist Award. We argue that although Billboard’s charts and awards are not designed to favor exotic music, their institutional construction of global audiences is inherently a quantification process, the nature of which inadvertently eliminates regional differences in available audience sizes and consumption cultures when aggregating artists’ worldwide social engagements into ordinal numbers. Consequently, Billboard-constructed global audiences are mis-aggregated, over-representing certain regional tastes. Billboard initially interpreted mis-aggregated audiences as BTS’s global social popularity, increasing this then niche group’s mainstream visibility in the U.S. market. Focusing on measurement regimes, such as Billboard, this paper suggests an alternative mechanism for niche genres’ visibility in a culture market – audience mis-aggregation. When measurement regimes use metrics to synthesize diverse audience segments to represent the whole market, tremendous information is eliminated through this quantification process, resulting in over-representation of certain segments’ tastes and increasing mainstream visibility of niche genres.

    "abstract": "This article investigates the power of audio as a storytelling medium and its capacity to provide immersive narrative-based experiences. In particular, it examines the potential of immersive or spatial audio to engage young people with the complex and pressing issue of racism by focusing on the artwork [re]locate: a multi-channel sound installation revisiting the racially motivated murder of Stephen Lawrence in 1993. [re]locate metaphorically places the audience at the bus stop where Stephen Lawrence was attacked, and allows them to experience an audio-only reconstruction of events associated with his murder and its aftermath. Based on a reflexive thematic analysis of the qualitative feedback elicited after encounters with the artwork, the article seeks to understand young people’s perspectives on events, their sense of engagement with the story and the aesthetic and technical features of the installation that create a sense of immersion, and induce presence. It argues that the perceived potency of the artwork and its ability to engage young people with the issue not only resides in the inherent qualities of sound, but also in the capacity of the spatial audio design of the installation to heighten the sense of immersion, induce presence and enhance cognitive and emotional perspective taking.",

    "title": "Onboarding and offboarding in virtual reality: A user-centred framework for audience experience across genres and spaces",
    "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) technology is an emerging medium of experience in many different public-facing entertainment and cultural contexts, such as immersive theatre, live performance, VR film festivals, gaming arcades, escape rooms, and museum exhibitions. The processes of ushering audience members or users into the virtual experience and out again, to which I refer here as ‘onboarding’ and ‘offboarding’, have been considered within some specific contexts, or on a case-by-case basis, but to date no systematised consideration of VR onboarding and offboarding has been produced. One reason for this is that ambiguities in disciplinary and practical definitions of immersion have obscured the relationship between VR technology and users. Clarification of this relationship results in clear evidence of a need for attention to onboarding and offboarding processes in public-facing contexts. In this paper, I define onboarding and offboarding, and present a framework for considering the onboarding and offboarding experiences of virtual reality audiences that helps stakeholders identify both their responsibilities to audiences and the best way to facilitate the immersive experience. This framework is based upon identifying experience goals, centred on the affordances of virtual reality and principles of immersion and presence, and utilises the Immersive Audience Framework developed by StoryFutures in its interdisciplinary research with immersive audiences since 2019.",

Using a methodological framework that integrates multimodal discourse analysis with a study of ideology, semiotics, and intertextuality, we study ‘weaponized’ Internet memes that were generated during three Diba Expeditions in 2016, 2018 and 2019. We identify three major social-culturally embedded visual semiotic themes: the Jiong playful style, nostalgia, and the strategic use of colour. These themes reflect the negotiation between populist dynamics, emerging online in China to express dissatisfaction with elites and nationalist appeals which emerge to push back against external ‘threats’. This study enhances our understanding of populist visual mobilization and visual protest by examining the Diaosi self-image constructed by the people in online and bottom-up populism in China. Traditionally, populist discourse has depicted ‘the people’ as pure, hardworking, and morally upright, mediated through the rhetoric of populist leaders and parties in top-down approaches. However, our research reveals a more complex and self-reflective portrayal, where the Diaosi subculture presents ‘the people’ as vulnerable, marginalized, and socio-economically disadvantaged. This self-construction challenges conventional populist narratives and highlights the dynamic and context-specific nature of populist identities.",

    "abstract": "\n            The metaverse is considered by some to be the next big thing in the global economy. Despite technological progress and high expectations, scholars agree that a broader metaverse platform does not yet exist. Instead, it has been suggested that the metaverse exists mainly as an imaginary or a\n            representation\n            in various discursive contexts. However, studies that examine such representations are few, and the present study aims to – through the lens of social representation theory – critically explore how VR technology and the metaverse are discursively represented in Swedish news media. The analysis identifies three underlying themata: (a) The inevitability of technology, (b) The commodification of experience, and (c) The world of male pioneers. It is concluded that the news media’s representation of VR and the metaverse contributes greatly to maintaining the structural status quo. For traditional journalism to fulfill its democratic mission, a pervasive update of media logic is needed.\n          ",

    "title": "Expanding the magic circle: Immersive storytelling that trains environmental perception",
    "abstract": "Scholarship on immersion in simulated environments often emphasizes cognitive immersion, or the suspension of disbelief that takes place in an illusionistic space that simulates reality, making the fact of mediation disappear in the experience. Marie-Laure Ryan writes that: “immersivity can be understood in two ways: in a properly VR sense, as the technology-induced experience of being surrounded by data, and in a narrative sense... as being imaginatively captivated by a storyworld” (230). Both of these definitions rest on the notion of cognitive immersion. Grounded in the field of post-dramatic multimedia performance, this paper will focus instead on immersive storytelling that activates the senses in a phenomenological experience. Rather than transporting the spectator into a fictional imaginary space, post-dramatic multimedia performance aims to make participants aware of their presence in the here and now (Klich and Scheer, 128). This paper will describe an immersive storytelling project that integrates virtual reality (VR) into live participatory performance events that take place outdoors. The paper is co-authored by an artist-researcher and two students who are working as research assistants on this project. We recount our creative research process in developing a pervasive game, which Montola defines as a “game that has one or more salient features that expand the contractual magic circle of play socially, spatially or temporally” (2005, 3). This game is played in a park and at key moments, inside VR environments that simulate that same park. The purpose of the game is to attune participants to the species in that particular environment.",

    "abstract": "In 2022–2023, the gaming house LL35, live-streamed on Twitch.tv, was the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation’s (NRK) content strategy to reach one of the most elusive audiences: male gamers between 18–29. This article discusses the case of LL35 in the light of Norwegian media policy, with particular focus on the Norwegian public service mandate. Through an analysis of how the content and scheduling of the live Twitch broadcasts developed over the span of its first year of existence, informed by interviews with the production crew behind LL35, we discuss whether LL35 was able to live up to the public service mandate and how LL35 can be part of preparing NRK for the competition in a world of (inter)networked broadcasting. The article centers on two research questions: How did the content and scheduling of LL35 develop over time, and to what degree could this development enable NRK to fulfill its commitment to offer public service content to its target group? The research shows that despite the will for innovation in NRK, combining the social media logic of Twitch and the media logic of NRK was a challenge. It also underlined the mutual dependency of legacy television and streaming, and how their roles shift. The theoretical foundation for the study is a combination of perspectives from media policy studies with insights from research on esports, game streaming and Twitch, and studies of public service youth content.",

    "abstract": "Affordances and aesthetics of digital media platforms have given politicians new ways to connect with potential voters and actively manage their own self-image. Digital political communication is also often influenced by current trends in PR or commercial marketing; for example, the tools and tactics of social media influencers. Based on qualitative case studies of YouTube channels belonging to two Swedish party leaders, this article examines the adaptation of influencer practices in the politicians’ online presence, and what impact it has on the presentation of themselves and their politics. It analyses how different genres of beauty and lifestyle influencers are embraced and adapted to a political context, as well as the ways in which specific audio-visual elements are used to construct the mediated performance of political authenticity, giving viewers ‘behind-the-scenes’ access to the politicians’ personal as well as professional life. The analysis shows how the adaption of videos in confessional genres such as story time, Q&amp;A, and vlog, which feature personal expressions of emotions and experiences, is illustrative of an increased personalisation of political communication, where the dimension if intimacy is emphasised.",

    "abstract": "\n            The concern about misinformation in the public space has become more worrisome during the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. In this context, we investigate what make people correctly recognize accurate information and detect misinformation about the war at the beginning of the conflict in Romania, a bordering country. By means of a national survey (\n            N\n            = 1006) conducted in April-May 2022, we looked for predictors of people’s capacity of navigating the information environment about the conflict. Data was gathered via an online panel conducted by Kantar as part of a cross-country project implemented in 19 countries. Findings show that people are relatively good at discerning between correct and misleading statements about the war. Prior negative attitudes about the Ukraine invasion, the level of concern about the war, not having a conspiracy mindset, self-perceived media literacy, and the extent to which people believe fact-checks to be effective in fighting misinformation are all predictors of the accuracy of misinformation detection of the respondents. These results offer insights into how ideologically based/motivated misinformation could be countered in a war crisis context, in a country bordering the conflict.\n          ",

    "title": "Mechanical meaning: The relationship between game mechanics and story in ergodic theatre",
    "abstract": "Theatre is increasingly exploring the potential of interactivity, especially as the growing experience economy reveals that people actively seek activities that offer new ways to engage with stories. The inclusion of interactive elements akin to game mechanics, which I call ergodic mechanics, shifts these performances into an intermedial sphere between digital games and conventional theatre. I use the term ergodic theatre to classify this specific subgenre of immersive theatre where the traveller works to form their path through the storyworld. Ergodic mechanics are the systems through which the traveller works or interacts. But what impact does the inclusion of ergodic mechanics have on storytelling? This question is critical to producing meaningful ergodic theatre performances and preventing interactive elements from becoming gimmicks, as some theatre reviewers have labelled them (Gardner, 2014). I interrogate the relationship between and impact of ergodic mechanics on the creation of story and meaning by examining narrative moments from The Under Presents, a VR ergodic theatre experience, and What Remains of Edith Finch and Dream, both digital ergodic theatre experiences. Analysing these case studies helps demonstrate the value of weaving ergodic mechanics with the story. When there is harmony between the interactive and story elements, the included ergodic mechanics heighten the traveller’s narrative engagement and emotional connection to the play’s characters or themes. I argue that ludonarrative harmony loops are a powerful tool that can enrich the traveller’s theatrical experience. I present an interdisciplinary approach by applying digital game theory parsed through dramaturgy to address the nuances of telling meaningful and engaging stories in ergodic theatre. Analysing the incorporation and dramaturgical function of interactivity highlights the potential of ergodic mechanics in intermedial ergodic performances. Furthermore, creating ludonarrative harmony is central to ergodic theatre’s continued success and growth as a storytelling medium.",

    "title": "Stop calling the Web the Internet: CERN’s tactics to fight ‘brand confusion’ in the mid-1990s",
    "abstract": "The terms ‘Internet’ and ‘Web’ are often mistakenly used interchangeably in everyday discourse. This article investigates the communication strategies employed by CERN, the birthplace of the Web, and by Robert Cailliau, one of its “inventors”, to differentiate between the Web and the Internet during the early 1990s. Using the marketing concept of brand confusion, which occurs when consumers confuse one brand with another that is apparently similar, we analyze CERN’s approach to fight this misunderstanding. Using previously unpublished historical sources housed in the WWW collection at CERN and an interview with Robert Cailliau, the paper identifies three marketing strategies employed to mitigate the confusion: direct marketing, content marketing, and event marketing/public relations. These efforts began in the mid-1990s in response to widespread public confusion exacerbated by inaccurate media portrayals of the Web. CERN’s goal was to educate its employees, early users, and the general public on the nature of the Web by leveraging analogies with familiar concepts, making the technology more understandable. In addition, CERN sought to establish the Web’s distinct identity by emphasizing its European origins and its development inside CERN. This was reinforced through consistent branding elements, including logos, colors, and experiential marketing at public events. Despite these strategic efforts, the persistent conflation of ‘Web’ and ‘Internet’ underscores the inherent challenges in effectively communicating complex technological concepts to the public, suggesting that even well-aligned marketing strategies may be constrained by external factors and contextual influences.",

    "abstract": "While the widespread visibility on digital platforms and intensifying promotional cultures online have questioned ‘underground status’ in music and performance scenes, scene participants continue to construct underground identities online to increase their subcultural capital and manoeuvre politico-economic environments. In Shanghai, venues and event organisations negotiate their underground status through the dissemination of digital flyers on WeChat, targeting niche taste communities and navigating surveillance and censorship mechanisms of the digital platform and local authorities. Taking visibility as a lens to analyse underground status, this paper argues that multiple small but closely related music and performance scenes in Shanghai (including clubbing, drag, and BDSM) construct underground identities by negotiating their social, commercial, and political ethos within WeChat’s regime of visibility. Emphasising the interconnected nature of virtual and physical visibilities, it develops an understanding of ‘hybrid visibilities’ that consist of representational, coded, fractured, and offline visibilities. This paper contributes to debates in popular music studies by arguing that the notion of ‘underground’ still holds relevance within scenes through the negotiation of hybrid visibilities. It also engages with platform studies by suggesting a more nuanced conception of online visibility that includes (sub)cultural and social capital besides economic forms of capital.",

    "title": "Memetic memory as vital conduits of troublemakers in digital culture",
    "abstract": "Recent fears of data capitalism and colonialism often argue using implicit assumptions about cybernetic technology’s ability to automate data about culture. As such, the level of data granularity made possible by cybernetic engineering can be used to dominate society and culture. Here we unpack these implicit assumptions about the datafication of culture through memes, which both act as cultural data and cultural memory. Using Alexander Galloway’s critical method of protocological analysis and descriptions of media tactics, we respond to fears of cybernetic domination. Protocols – the source by which cybernetic technologies enable automated datafication – enables us to respond to fears with optimism, and it further enables a more extensive development of how memetic memory functions. Our development shows that memetic memory often emerges before cybernetic datafication, offering moments of resistance from cybernetic domination. Further, this development enables a vitalist development of memetic memory, borrowing from Bergsonian theory and related contemporary media theories. Such a work contributes by providing cybernetic context in which culture, characterized through memes, resists cybernetic domination. In the process of this contribution, it also contributes a novel theory of memetic memory. Inspired by recent posthuman new media theory, we provide a novel reading of Richard Dawkins’ genetically inspired meme as well as Limor Shifman’s notion of memetic ‘stance’. Taken together, we contribute the beginnings of a memetic theory of vitalism which speaks more readily with critical cybernetic discourse.",

    "title": "The New Media Art world in Turkey: Boundary-work in action",
    "abstract": "In an age marked by the Post-media condition, the term ‘New Media Art’ remains in use in reference to a professional territory not autonomous, but also different from the territory of Contemporary Art, and its members use various rhetorical tactics to maintain and expand their professional authority. This study aims at analyzing the professional ideology of the New Media Art territory in Turkey using Thomas F. Gieryn’s concept of the ‘boundary-work’. The data obtained via semi-structured in-depth interviews conducted with a purposively sampled population of artists, curators and producers are used to assess whether a common cultural repertoire exists in this territory and whether it conforms to or contradicts its global counterpart. The study finds that since the mid-1990s, the professional ideology of the New Media Art territory in Turkey has developed in parallel with the world, but not monolithically. The curators/producers’ ideology is defined by potential for democratization, intersections of art, science and technology, interaction/interactivity and interdisciplinary collaboration. However, they exhibit two repertoire variants positively correlated with the subjects’ career orientations. The artists’ common ideology is similar to the curators’/producers’, but their cultural repertoires are more flexible thanks to the variety of their individual practices. The study concludes that this duality emerges due to the limited funding sources in Turkey.",

    "abstract": " By reconstructing a basic temperature sensor and its chains of translation, the text presents a new approach to experimental media archeology, critical making and speculative design. Based on this experiment, the text proposes to investigate how sensoric mediation transforms data into operational signals, challenging the myth of ‘raw data’ as unfiltered representations of the environment and the clear distinction between analog and digital. In a micro-analysis, the text reconstructs the translations between the analog and the digital as processes of virtualization, through which what is processed by the computer shares an efficiency with what it refers to, without being of its nature or substance. In order to better understand how autonomous machines adapt to their environment by means of such translation chains, without assuming an isomorphic representation of the world or direct access to the environment, the text follows the first steps of such chains of translation in detail. Experiments with a simple temperature sensor and an Arduino microcontroller show how often unreflected and black-boxed pre-decisions flow into the necessary sensory mediations. This in turn sheds light on new forms of co-existence between humans and autonomous, sensor-based machines such as autonomous vehicles or robots. ",

Using affordance theory, we analyze a university classroom, a collaborative virtual environment, situated in virtual reality (VR). Our longitudinal study spans 10 weeks and follows 15 participants who spent over 25 hours together in meta-space classroom habitats. To capture a wide range of conditions around VR affordances (avatars, embodiment, immersion/presence), we turn to spotlines, a method that combines various medialities, to compare and describe the temporal rhythms of VR habituation. Through sustained engagement in VR, this study reveals how meta-spaces function as habitats that foster avatar sociality, metalearning, and embodied moments of friction. ",

Whilst existing understandings tend to focus on the assumedly predatory monetisation techniques that players are subjected to by game developers, I instead argue that a logic of gambling is integral to the f2p experience economy of Asian players. Drawing on an analysis of in-depth interviews with Singapore-based game players/developers, I show how the virtual items and worlds that players engage with through f2p gamespaces are imbued with experiential value, whilst developers leverage the volumes of data generated by players to maximise this value in ways that might eventually lead to their monetisation. Embracing these complementary facets of f2p gamespaces can help expand normative understandings of gambling in/and gaming. ",

This paper explores the design of such a tailored methodology for investigating the value-driven development of online public service media platforms in Germany. While qualitative methodologies are time- and resource-consuming and digital methods leave out less context to the field, this mixed methodology emphasizes the context and invests in collecting thick data. It encompasses multiple stages of recording and mapping that employ qualitative and quantitative approaches to bring together various vignettes, unveiling complementary context and contradictory accounts with the help of visualization. In each mapping and visualization stage, the paper investigates actors and relationships heuristically and emphasizes the work-in-progress nature of mapping regarding platforms. ",

    "abstract": " This article examines the social technology company Meta’s public communication on problematic content, via their official ‘Meta Newsroom’, within the context of growing regulatory scrutiny. For nearly a decade, the Meta Newsroom has been a major outlet for Meta company announcements, and since 2016, the Newsroom has increasingly become a key source for company responses to concerns regarding mis/disinformation and other kinds of problematic content on Meta’s platforms. Using a mixed-methods approach informed by discourse analysis, this article critically examines Newsrooms posts from 2016 to early 2021. It asks: how is Meta framing ‘problems’ on its platforms? How is Meta identifying ‘solutions’ to those problems? And is Meta ‘nudging’ policymakers in specific conceptual directions? Overall, we find that Meta is framing content moderation issues through four key frames – ‘authenticity’, ‘political advertising’, ‘technological solutions’, and ‘enforcement’ – that benefit Meta, as they shift responsibility while also demonstrating that Meta is an active and capable problem-solver.

    "abstract": "This article represents our editorial contribution to the exploration of immersive storytelling, broadly conceived in this Special Issue as a set of creative and design practices, audience experiences, a field of study and a toolkit of rapidly developing digital technologies. Herein we set out our motivation for collaborating as an interdisciplinary team seeking to interrogate and expand on celebratory industry-led discourses that (over-)emphasise the transformative potential of digital innovations for immersive storytelling without properly situating these as part of longer trajectories of creative and audience practice. We provide an account of this background context that purposefully shifts the focus from technologies of the moment – Virtual Reality, the Metaverse, Artificial Intelligence – to the underpinning storytelling that can give rise to, as well as make use of, these technologies to facilitate immersion. Having introduced the various perspectives on immersive storytelling presented in the articles collected in this Special Issue, we go on to draw out key themes, topics and approaches from the body of work as a whole. Our analysis encompasses definitional questions, interdisciplinary perspectives and the sharing of expertise. It highlights the role of users as the nexus of technology and narrative, including emotional and sensory interactions, which contribute to their agency within immersive experiences. The discussion of immersive storytelling moves beyond a focus on VR to consider the wider context, including the overlap between real-world locations and narrative content of experiences, and the importance of setting audience expectations. Because, taken together, the articles include multiple projects and case studies involving designing and making immersive experiences, it is apparent that this is an expanded, rather than normalised, design space in which inclusion and exclusion are important considerations. From these findings we put forward a future agenda for the field of immersive storytelling, which revolves around issues of accessibility, ethics and audience research.",

    "abstract": "Theories of deception in digital media often rest on the assumption that deception occurs when something in the process of communication does not work as it should – due to an intention to lie, or to faults and mistakes in the communication process. Such perspectives, however, do not fully account for the more subtle practices by which deception becomes normalized in the very functioning of digital media. This article advances the concept of ‘banal deception’ to describe deceptive mechanisms and practices that are incorporated in the functioning of media technologies, to the point that they appear indistinguishable from the media themselves – in other words, to the point of becoming ‘banal’. Through a range of examples encompassing digital and non-digital media, the article illuminates nuanced mechanisms of deception that are often not understood as such but are integral to people’s experiences with media. Banal deception mechanisms applied to media even before digitalization processes, but they are becoming increasingly relevant and ubiquitous due to the automation of communication processes sparked by platform algorithms and AI.",

    "abstract": "\n            During the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns (2020-2021), almost all facets of life were rendered digital – health, work, schooling, and logistics. In this phenomenon, not only did digital access become synonymous with social inclusion but inequalities were also amplified – particularly in the case of older adults (65 years and over). Contemporary older adults represent one of the most diverse spectrums of digital media users – spanning from technologically savvy to non-users. As the first generation of older adults to age\n            in\n            and\n            through\n            data in a data-saturated world, their understandings and experiences can teach us much about the possibilities and limitations of new media. Understanding these practices through cultural probes – like drawing, photos and writing prompts – can enable playful behaviours that not only elicit new thoughts and actions but also allow insight into some of the tacit lived experience that can support opportunities for technological use. In this paper, we ask:\n            How can we playfully co-design through personas to enhance understandings of older adults’ lived experience of digital media?\n            In this paper, we focus on the six co-design workshops in which we deployed personas as representations of digital experience to challenge, explore, provoke and help build nuanced tools for implementation. Through personas, speculative fiction and lived experience collide, offering some fascinating ways to rethink the digital-social dimension for older adults now and into the future.\n          ",

The study sample included four independent bloggers and six bloggers working for organizations that serve visually impaired people in the US. The study was set to investigate the usage of blogging sites, examine methods of presenting visual media, and identify serious difficulties imposed on visually impaired bloggers. Usage of hyperlinks, interactions between bloggers and readers, and accessibility of blogging sites are probed. Significant findings of the study show that bloggers have generally received positive feedback from blog readers. Study participants were satisfied with the accessibility level of blogging sites, as some viable textual alternatives to visual media elements are provided.

    "abstract": "Public engagement, digital or in-person, is mostly adult-centric and ableist, often universalising the experience of participation of a narrow demographic (white, older and middle class). In Mindset Revolution we combined arts-based and creative methods with civic tech to co-design participatory spaces with a diverse group of young people, where to discuss and influence mental health policy and practice. The paper examines the digital element of the project, where young people, supported by a team of academics and digital designers, used the Decidim civic tech platform to engage with their peers and policymakers. This co-design work helped inform changes to the platform towards more accessible and margin-responsive participation that can better support active engagement of traditionally excluded groups. The young people evaluated their own participation and social impact, challenging assumptions about youth participation. The flexibility afforded by the digital platform was crucial to sustain engagement. However, although often branded as digital natives, the young people we worked with perceived digital participation as an enabler but not a central element of their work on social change. Follow-up work on the platform is shaping it as a space for collective oversight, with opportunities for open-ended dialogue between young people, the community and policymakers to identify and navigate barriers to implementation of young people’s proposals.",

    "title": "Audio for extended realities: A case study informed exposition",
    "abstract": "An area of immersive storytelling in rapid evolution is that of extended reality. This emergent mode of experience employs spatial mapping, and both plane and object detection to superimpose computer-generated images in the volumetric context of a physical space via a head-mounted display. This in turn produces a unique set of challenges and opportunities for associated audio implementation and aesthetics. Creative development of this audio is often a function of evolving toolsets, and the associated workflow is far from standardized. This paper forms a context for such audio workflow, one that draws from precursor technologies such as audio for games and virtual reality and develops this into an outline taxonomy that is both representative of the state of the art, and forward facing towards evolution of the technology stack. The context is framed through a series of case studies. Between 2019 and 2021, BBC and Oculus TV commissioned Alchemy Immersive and Atlantic Productions to produce virtual reality and mixed reality experiences of several classic documentary series by Sir David Attenborough: Museum Alive, Micro Monsters, First Life VR, Museum Alive AR and Kingdom of Plants. This portfolio received numerous award nominations and prizes, including from the Raindance Festival and a double Emmy. The sound design, audio postproduction and spatial audio for these experiences were implemented by the company 1.618 Digital, and drawing from first-hand-creator involvement, the workflows are deconstructed and explored with reference to tools, technologies, techniques and perception. Such an exposition forms the basis for an analysis of both this and broader creative practice in the field of audio for extended reality, and this is subsequently used to present a speculative vision of audio in the future of immersive storytelling.",

    "title": "Invisible, aesthetic, and enrolled listeners across storytelling modalities: Immersive preference as situated player type",
    "abstract": "Immersive storytelling includes narrative experiences that take place in the public spaces of theaters, theme parks, museums, and historical reenactment sites; on tabletops, where role-playing games are collaboratively played; in fictional spaces superimposed on the real world during a live-action role-playing (larping) event; and in hybrid, asynchronous, and transmediated spaces that blend the digital, the virtual, and the real. Understood as a kind of boundary object, a player typology can incorporate multiple perspectives and heterogeneous sources of information, producing ‘ideal types’, which provide a framework for observation and discussion across immersive modalities. This paper offers a typology of situated immersive preference, in which narrative immersion and embodied immersion are understood to vary independently of one another. Along the vertical axis listener-players of immersive storytelling experiences are classified as narratively attached, narratively detached, or narratively opposed. Across the horizontal axis of embodied engagement, listener-players are classified as invisible, aesthetic, or enrolled. Nine ideal types emerge at the intersection of these narrative and embodied preferences. Why someone might fit into one category rather than another reflects comfort rather than personality. Situated immersive types are understood to be fluid and temporary configurations. The degree to which players are willing to engage and are comfortable with what they are being asked to do may differ dramatically from experience to experience and from day to day, and even during a single session, reflecting how they feel at a given moment, which is affected by who they are with and how they are perceived and treated by others. This framework for understanding immersive preferences calls for the design of more widely inclusive story worlds.",

    "title": "Meta-music and the sonic storytelling of\n            <i>Baldur’s Gate</i>\n            3",
    "abstract": "\n            The video game\n            Baldur’s Gate\n            3 adapts the fictional setting and rule systems of the classic tabletop roleplaying game\n            Dungeons &amp; Dragons\n            . For most of its branching three-act story, the music of\n            Baldur’s Gate\n            3 serves the conventional nondiegetic purpose of supporting narrative immersion and communicating key gameplay information to players. However,\n            Baldur’s Gate\n            3 also employs a range of metareferential musical devices which foreground the artificiality of the medium with varying impacts on the player experience. This article explores how the use of ‘meta-music’ in\n            Baldur’s Gate\n            3 contributes to its digital representation of the tabletop roleplaying experience while also navigating the anti-illusionistic risks that this entails for immersive storytelling. I begin by reviewing the established relationship between music and immersive storytelling across video games and tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs) alike. I next consider the metacommunicative nature of TTRPGs and how this aligns with the unique potentials of metareferential music within interactive contexts. The article then proceeds with a detailed accounting of the diverse meta-musical techniques encountered in\n            Baldur’s Gate\n            3, from musical easter eggs and transdiegetic leitmotifs to villains who perform their own nondiegetic theme music. I argue that these strategies evoke the aesthetic experience of playing\n            Dungeons &amp; Dragons\n            by eliciting states of heightened meta-awareness and open creative experimentation that characterise TTRPGs. In doing so, the ‘meta-music’ of\n            Baldur’s Gate\n            3 bridges the extra- and intratextual worlds to support a specific interactional immersion that succeeds, in most cases, to deepen the storytelling experience. I conclude by arguing for further research into player perceptions of metareferential music and considering what the case study of\n            Baldur’s Gate\n            3 reveals about the study of video game music at large.\n          ",

    "title": "Sound design in VR filmmaking: Opportunities and challenges in a new medium",
    "abstract": "Cinematic sound design workflows are well-established and refined over many years of practice and scholarly review, and the creative and technical approaches resulting from this are widely adopted and used. Until recently, these approaches were partially dictated by the conventions and limitations of the underlying visual medium: the cinematic screen. Nevertheless, the ongoing technological revolution brings radical changes in the way we approach and consume creative media content and the accompanying soundtracks. Long-established cinematic sound design conventions are challenged and transformed, as emerging cinematic sound systems allow for greater creative freedom and more precise sound spatialisation. At the same time, advanced virtual reality (VR) systems provide an opportunity to break the boundaries of the screen and allow filmmakers to explore new ways of creative expression. With this comes an increased demand for specialised audio content that utilises the unique technological and creative characteristics of the VR medium. Through discussions and commentary based on secondary research and a series of interviews with sound design and filmmaking practitioners, this study aims at identifying some of the creative and practical opportunities and challenges sound designers may encounter when working in VR projects with a cinematic narrative structure and orientation. Ultimately, the study seeks to assist sound designers, VR filmmakers, and immersive media practitioners in better contextualising and defining the potential roles of the soundtrack in VR filmmaking and the associated workflows, contributing to the ongoing dialogue as the language of the new medium is being developed.",

    "abstract": "\n            The Web opens possibilities for democratic engagement in collecting. Previously closed groups available only to aficionados/cognoscenti are now open to wider networks of collector. This paper argues that a typology of Web collecting is possible to chart. Although not disconnected to offline modes of collecting, or collecting practices that occurred pre-Web, it remains that certain ways of collecting are mediated by Web 2.0 technologies. We see that the Web enables a broader network of collectors to readily access the requisite knowledge surrounding artefacts, provenance and collectability, whilst also provisioning connections with distributed communities of collectors, sellers and brokers in a manner never before available. We suggest that Web 2.0 applications enable capacity for undertaking\n            reconnaissance\n            , the\n            gaining of knowledge\n            , and\n            facilitation of exchange\n            for collectables , as well as furnishing the curation and\n            \n            display of subsequent ownership . These platforms enable the mediated demonstration of one’s identity as a ‘collector’ and point to hallmark features of ‘connected collecting’. Taking these elements of collecting practice as foundational to the connected collector’s persona, we condense a tripartite conceptualisation that includes\n            acquisition\n            -\n            maintenance\n            -\n            curation\n            as an organising typology for considering Web 2.0 facilitation of collecting practice.\n          ",

    "abstract": "Feminine males in China have been criticized and stigmatized by both the state and society, and scholarship on live-streaming platforms has overlooked marginalized Chinese males expressing femininity. This paper examines the male presentation of femininity on Platform Bilibili, where cosplay is prevalent as part of its ACG (Animation, Comics, and Games) culture, through a 20-month observation and interviews. Focusing on two Chinese male streamers who wear women’s clothing, this research analysis demonstrates how two male individuals—a transgender streamer who identifies as a woman and a gender-queer streamer who avoids gender designation—utilize femininity through distinct approaches: (1) The transgender streamer employs the performance of femininity as both entertainment and as a means of personal gender identity construction while forming collective identity among male-to-female crossdressers and trans women. (2) The gender-queer streamer actively employs sexualized feminine presentation as a means of making a living. Through this analysis, this paper argues that specific live-streaming platforms with cultures accepting male presentations of femininity can provide stigma-free streaming spaces for marginalized Chinese feminine males, enhancing their visibility.",

This article examines the dystopian narratives that emerged after ChatGPT’s release date. Through a critical analysis of media responses, we uncover how dystopian imaginaries discussing ChatGPT become rhetorically constructed in popular, journalistic discourse. The article locates prevalent anxieties surrounding ChatGPT’s unprecedented text-generation capabilities, and identifies recurrent fears regarding academic integrity, the proliferation of misinformation, ethical dilemmas in human-AI interaction, and the perpetuation of social biases. Moreover, the article introduces the concept of ‘fear cycles’ – recurring patterns of dystopian projections in response to emerging technologies. By documenting and dissecting these fear cycles, we offer insights into the underlying rhetorical features that drive societal reactions to technological advancements. The research ultimately contributes to a nuanced understanding of how ChatGPT dystopian imaginaries develop particular futures, while grounding the present in predictable anxieties related to technological innovation.",

    "abstract": "Intermingling new and old media, this article introduces the concept of phonographic theatricality to explore the performativity of human-machine vocality. It jointly discusses the theatricality of historical and new sound media: media principles that characterized the phonograph in its emergence are still evident in the speech of contemporary AI-voice agents. Phonographic theatricality is a cross-media concept describing the conditions, playfulness, contingencies, and implications of the actualization of pre-recorded voices. It covers a broad range of cases in which a machine injects a human sounding voice into a situation, usually acousmatic in its detachment from a human body, yet performing as a theatrical agent. The analysis demonstrates how sound media theatricalize truthfulness, fidelity, illusion, and trickery as part of their mediation of voices, and how humans and machines mingle in producing phonographic theatricality. Three historical dramas, as well as contemporaneous newspaper articles, caricatures and ads, unveil the rise of phonographic theatricality as a media principle, inviting and affording a discussion on the performativity of AI voices. When machines speak and laugh in human voices, they become actors, vocally reshaping the space in which they operate, charging it with theatricality.",

    "title": "The photographic palimpsest: Layering and alteration in digital photography",
    "abstract": "This article offers a new framework for conceptualizing the digital photograph as a palimpsest – a multilayered signifying object representing various types and acts of alterations performed at different moments of an image’s formation. It offers an analysis of how the concept of layering is manifested within processes of alteration, and elaborates types of image alteration and their potential accumulation in a single image file. Examining the digital photograph as a palimpsest opens up the possibility of referring to a photograph as stratigraphic sequence by accounting for and emphasizing a timeline of changes within arrays and digital platforms while referring to the interaction between humans and technology. This new conceptualization points to the potential for enduring change in the digital image and to the hypothetical possibility of tracing the narrative of its visual formation.",

Players created personal playlists to use during play, vocalised self-reflections in some tasks, and shared these artefacts on the communal Discord server. Findings show that players reported music significantly enhanced their play experience, fostering community, supporting emotional regulation, and deepening their sense of engagement with the game. The personal playlists and communal interaction pivotally provided comfort to players while completing the game’s often emotional tasks. However, individual music preferences impacted the resonance of players’ experiences, with some participants finding the repetition of music-based tasks less engaging. Based on these findings, recommendations for developers include using audio interludes for reflection, music playlists as narrative tools, and integrating personal and communal music design to facilitate emergent narratives in games.\n          ",

    "abstract": "Game live streaming has become a major component of global game culture. Through interview data with Japanese game live streamers, this paper offers a first consideration of Japanese-language game streaming and its associated cultural norms, expectations, and streamer perspectives. We firstly show that Japanese game streamers mostly stream anonymously, and interrogate this preference and situate it within wider contexts of Japanese internet culture, gaming culture, and societal stigmas. Secondly we show Japanese game streamers do not only appeal to native Japanese speakers, but draw in viewers from both English-language and Chinese-language backgrounds. We examine this in the context of the widespread cultural perception outside Japan of Japanese ‘otherness’, demonstrating instead that Japanese game streamers are well integrated with global flows of game streaming. We therefore present a picture of a linguistic-cultural game streaming context that is in many ways familiar, yet also highly distinctive.",

    "abstract": "\n            Late modern society has been conceptualized as a\n            spectacle\n            , a metaphor that brings to light not only its commodification but also the benumbing impact of mass media on the audience’s political agency. This study turns attention to the spectacle in the age of social media. Building on a growing body of research on the spectacle of suffering, we compare reactions to the 2022 Itaewon Halloween stampede, which claimed more than 150 lives, across Korean-language and English-language posts on the social networking platform, X (previously Twitter). Our research draws on two computational techniques, topic modeling and network analysis, to examine the emotive and evaluative character of the discourse as well as its structural features. The analysis reveals significant differences between the two corpora. While the English-language network, in which corporate media accounts are most prominent, dehumanizes the victims and parrots the official version of events, the Korean-language network, driven by ordinary users, evinces empathy and draws attention to administrative failures – serving as a prelude to large-scale protests across South Korea that forced the government to concede its responsibility for the tragedy. We argue that even though the spectacle remains relevant as a concept to understand mediatized public life today, it is not quite as monolithic as it was originally conceptualized. Instead, the logics of social networking have rendered a\n            fractured spectacle\n            , with different networked publics producing different representations of and reactions to public events in the digital attention economy – leading to different political consequences.\n          ",

Yet, access to that community is constantly under threat due to content or account removal, known as de-platforming. Through interviews with content creators who had experienced de-platforming, this paper explores their ‘corpo-civic’ relationship with Instagram and TikTok, hybrid locations caught between a work and social space mirroring these platforms’ hybrid nature, between corporate ownership and public use. In doing so, we reflect on the challenges of aspirational creator work and its related difficulty in building, managing and engaging communities in precarious spaces, especially when threatened with de-platforming and relying on a hybrid friend/customer relationship.",

Through a case study of a Danish consultancy working at the intersection of data analytics and film production, we explore how audience insights are mobilized in creative processes. We propose the term\n            recalcitrant audiencing\n            to describe a mode of audience analytics that challenges filmmakers’ assumptions rather than offering definitive representations of the audience. Our findings show that such practices create a narrative space for renegotiation and disruption, highlighting the nuanced role of algorithms as tools that can elicit rather than dictate creative processes. Rethinking audiencing in this way demonstrates how AI can be integrated with qualitative methods to co-imagine multiple potential audiences for a cultural product still in the making.\n          ",

This study uses the Technology Acceptance Model to suggest ‘perceived ease of use’ is both a factor in acceptance and panic around emerging technologies. We provide a qualitative analysis of statements, guides, and policies about AI and ChatGPT from 148 U.S. universities to argue that there is not so much a panic happening in higher education as there is a concerted effort to negotiate and integrate artificial intelligence into classroom, research, and daily operations. Across four different categories of statements – university policies, teaching and learning resources, library guides, and professor statements – we find recurring values emphasizing usefulness as well as navigating ethical concerns. ChatGPT’s perceived ease of use has led higher education faculty and staff to avoid panic discourses and focus on problem-solving discourses as they negotiate its institutionalization.",

    "title": "Band of blood brothers: Exploring visibility management and networking among Twitter users identifying as Filipino men living with HIV",
    "abstract": "\n            The Philippines continues to grapple with a rising number of HIV cases, particularly among Filipino men who have sex with men. Notably, Filipino men living with HIV (FMLWH) are visible on Twitter (now X), despite Facebook’s dominance in the Philippines. The Twitterverse of FMLWH may be imagined as networked publics, with these users negotiating visibility management in the face of HIV-related stigmas and navigating context collapse in a high-visibility space. In this study, we explore the visibility management practices of Twitter users identifying as FMLWH and subsequently map their network structure. Our mixed-methods approach combined analysis of online trace data from 1447 public Twitter accounts with in-depth interviews conducted with 24 Twitter users. Findings revealed that FMLWH employed a range of visibility management practices on Twitter, including the use of succinct identifiers to disclose HIV status, the maintenance of pseudonymous identities, and a strategic shift from partial to greater visibility when engaging with other FMLWH in private communication spaces. Participants expressed a strong inclination to connect with fellow ‘blood brothers’ and were frequently directed to these users through algorithmic recommendations rather than word-of-mouth. An expansive network comprising 302,934 ‘follow’ ties connected all but two of the 1447 users. Network analysis also showed high reciprocity and short distances between actors. Despite these metrics, a relatively low degree of interconnectedness was found, suggesting that users formed their own smaller pockets of conversation. Overall, FMLWH exhibited a deliberate effort to manage their visibility on Twitter and demonstrated a level of connectivity and engagement that might not naturally occur in real-world settings. Furthermore, the affordances of Twitter facilitated the open disclosure of HIV status, traditionally considered a private and sensitive matter. These findings warrant further investigation into the formation of networked HIV social identities and the emergence of pseudonymous networked\n            counter\n            publics among FMLWH.\n          ",

Emerging scholarship on this topic reveals how users strategically negotiate their visibility online. However, we still need to broaden the scope of our knowledge, especially outside Western contexts, in order to advance our theoretical understanding of such negotiations. Asian societies and communities, with their distinctive platform political economies and socio-cultural landscapes, offer rich yet underexplored contexts for advancing visibility theories beyond Western-centric frameworks. Responding to Brighenti’s call to treat visibility as an interdisciplinary social scientific category, this special issue presents 19 articles organized into four thematic clusters that analyze visibility practices across Asian communities and diasporic spaces. By centering Asian case studies and perspectives, we illustrate how visibility negotiations in Asian contexts can inform broader theoretical understandings of digital visibility negotiation practices and the power dynamics that shape them.",

    "abstract": "Despite the growing significance of the Chinese digital diaspora, large-scale empirical research on its communication patterns on digital platforms remains scarce. This study presents the first large-scale empirical analysis of Jianzhong Quan (简中圈), a key Chinese digital diasporic community on X (formerly Twitter). By examining its temporal and thematic patterns as well as group composition, this research provides valuable insights into how diasporic communities engage in political discussions while navigating contrasting media systems and technopolitical landscapes. Given that X has been officially blocked in Mainland China since 2009, this platform offers a unique space for diaspora members to negotiate visibility, identity, and influence. Analyzing over 2.2 million tweets from January 2014 to December 2023, this study employs a mixed-methods approach, integrating qualitative analysis and network analysis techniques. The findings illuminate the composition of diaspora subgroups, their primary concerns, and the dynamics of intergroup connections and fragmentations. Beyond offering empirical evidence on diasporic discourse, this study also makes a theoretical contribution by proposing the concept of the Chinese digital diaspora.",

We then lay out the analytical framework of SIPCs that enables the rigorous reconstruction and comparison of sociotechnical imaginaries in public and mediated communication. Finally, we illustrate the framework with examples from public communication about artificial intelligence, an emerging key technology in contemporary societies.\n          ",

    "abstract": "\n            While bullying on social media among the youth remains a public health problem, there is little that we know about ways of dealing with bullying by disconnection. In this article, we build upon the concepts of disconnective practice (Light, 2014) and visibility (Brighenti, 2007) to explain the ways into which the youth deal with bullying on social media. We draw evidence from in-depth interviews with 152 youth across the Philippines. First, we find that disconnective practice is a continuum of acts that involves disconnecting from people and messages and is anchored on temporality. Second, we find that visibility is both a condition for and a process of disconnective practice. Grounded in the youth’s experiences with bullying on social media, we suggest the concept of\n            ambivalent visibilities\n            to characterize the youth’s efforts to manage their well-being amid the volatile landscape of social media interactions. We conclude this article by discussing the implications of\n            ambivalent visibilities\n            for Filipino youth, their support networks, and technology designers and platform owners.\n          ",

    "abstract": "In 2017, Brazil launched the Geostationary Defense and Strategic Communications Satellite (SGDC-1), fulfilling the state’s long-held ambition to manufacture and operate a national communication satellite. This article investigates the main frictions surrounding the establishment, articulation, and representation of this large-scale infrastructural system, particularly regarding the federal government’s alleged commitment to deploying it to deliver broadband to public rural schools. Through open-source investigation and satellite footprint analysis, the study explores the political economy and governance dilemmas surrounding the SGDC-1 as a state-led project, revealing how its operations are framed and mediated through underserved publics and bolstered by televisual tactics under a populist logic. A critical analysis of disclosed documents, news stories, footprint maps, congressional hearings, and visual media uncovers the satellite’s dual complexity: it serves both as a flagship of publicly funded connectivity and as a discursive artifact that shapes public perceptions of inclusion through paternalistic space-telecom narratives. Considering the challenges related to public-private partnerships, militarization, and potential outages, the article calls for increased civic scrutiny and suggests the need for new policy strategies to ensure the project’s viability and long-term success.",

    "title": "A Chinese queer subtitling community’s digital visibility management: An alternative approach",
    "abstract": "This paper concerns Chinese queer subtitling communities’ digital visibility management. Queer subtitling communities are communities that focus on collectively and voluntarily subtitling queer audiovisual content including TV series and films that depict LGBTQ+ identities. Such communities have been actively facilitating Chinese people’s access to queer content and queer community building. Being both queer and online subtitlers in a heteronormative society and a restricted mediascape, such communities must have been managing their visibility across multiple levels, about which, however, little is known. This paper aims to address this gap in knowledge by exploring one Chinese queer subtitling community’s digital visibility management. It draws on data collected through a 12-month netnographic fieldwork including a survey and interviews in the community. It has been found that the community managed their digital visibility through three processes: creating, adjusting, and sustaining visibility. The paper argues that the community’s digital visibility management was centred on serving their activism to facilitate Chinese people’s access to diverse queer lives and that their nonconfrontational negotiation among various transnational and local, collective and individual factors offered a lived example of an alternative approach to queer activism in MC and potentially other similar contexts.",

    "abstract": "This article explores dynamics of knowledge formation and preservation through social media uses in an emergent East Asian context of musical production. Taking the case of the Hong Kong independent music scene and drawing on Bernard Stiegler’s typology of knowledge, this article analyses how culturally specific logics of knowledge production are used to remedy infrastructural scarcity and limited media and institutional support. Through the analyses of four independent music actors’s social media uses, this essay proposes that three overlapping logics – industrial, subcultural, and archival – with roots in the history and practices of the HK music landscape are at play in supporting attempts at fostering knowledge in and about the HK independent music scene. In turn, this article argues that paying attention to the industrial, cultural and stylistic specificity of platform-based logics of knowledge production by users is useful not only to better understand the role of social media platforms in cultural production ecosystems outside of the American and Anglo-European social media contexts, but also to conceptualize social media potentially as complex – at times negentropic - knowledge spaces.",

Finally, this paper will provide an overview on how science-fiction games represent and establish experiences and reflections of the progressing augmentation of bodies and their environment.\n          ",

    "abstract": "This article presents a minor history of the beneficial community-created bots that once flourished on Twitter, showcasing their important but overlooked role in enhancing platform cultures, accessibility, and user experience. We present a typology of Twitter’s community-created bots, positioning them as marginal but active characters, tracing how and why they were crafted and co-evolved with, and in connection to, platform changes. The article offers a counter-narrative to the dominant discourse and association of bots with nefarious actors, showcasing the value of bot-making practices as forms of community-led innovation that have enriched social spaces through automation. In the context of current trends towards platform enclosure, the article argues for the continued importance of user innovation cultures in an AI-infused and potentially decentralised internet, proposing that we should not forget, overlook, or undermine the potential of creative, purposeful and community-initiated automation in fostering accessible, sociable, and joyful communication environments.",

    "abstract": "This paper identifies the visibility practices of Japanese Twitter users supporting Ukraine during Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion. Studies of digital visibility often suggest that moral goals and ideals are not attainable in such practices, as they clash with conditions of visibility configured by social media. This has led scholars to suggest that moral paradoxes, or the need to reconcile conflicting considerations, are the main characteristic of visibility on social media platforms. In this study, through an innovative mixed-methods approach for analysing visibility practices, I also outline several moral paradoxes underlying practices through which Japanese Twitter users enhance or decrease the visibility of actors associated with Russia’s war on Ukraine. However, by adopting the conceptual approach of ‘ethics as practice’ which emphasises the moral considerations of practitioners when faced with a moral conundrum, I argue that users driven by the moral call to support Ukraine recognise the limitations of Twitter’s regime of visibility. Their grappling with the identified paradoxes as they engage in visibility practices is what gives moral value to these practices.",

    "abstract": "\n            Big Tech hearings are high-stakes events that draw in various audiences, and have the potential to reveal and influence the ongoing process of power (re)distribution between various actors, including governments and major tech corporations. In this process, public uptake matters. To gain more insight into the uptake of the political discourses that collide during Big Tech hearings, this article analyzes live chats that were produced in association with 35 YouTube live streams of the 2020 Big Tech antitrust hearing. Using a critical approach towards discourse analysis, this article establishes that the different audiences that watched the hearing on YouTube understood the hearing and its discourse in strikingly different ways. As such, this article finds that different YouTube audiences constitute different ‘micro-populations’ (\n            Maly and Varis, 2016\n            ) that adhere to different micro-hegemonic beliefs, which draw on different historical events. To elaborate on this finding, this article introduces the concept of ‘micro-hegemonic path dependence’. This concept draws attention to the notion that different niched ideological groups can develop their ‘paths’ divergingly, causing them to arrive at the same event from different contexts, that lead them to understand the same event in unparalleled ways. Though the audiences’ focus on different historic events might appear to negatively affect the potential uptake of Big Tech discourse, their ideological fragmentation in fact allows for the continued self-reinforcement of Big Tech power.\n          ",

Despite apparently disparate rhetoric in the memes, they had shared users and topics of discussion, leading us to investigate how ideas and people circulate across both ideological and social media networks. In this article, we analyze the network structure of who tweeted these memes and whether they were widespread or concentrated, conduct a content analysis of their shared topics, and use discourse analysis to unpack the ideologies they represent. We argue that these tweets that package conservative ideology into memes using progressive terminology provide a window into how users and ideas travel across right-wing networks, gaining traction and visibility by reusing and remixing these phrases.",

    "abstract": "Remote-control technologies have expanded into homes, potentially transforming domestic dynamics by altering how pets are monitored, interacted with, and cared for within domestic environments. This study delves into the user experiences and societal implications of Enabot, a mobile surveillance robot designed for pets in China. We employ telepresence to gauge operators’ perception of being present in a mediated and physical environment, focusing on human-animal interactions and relationships. Drawing from semi-structured interviews with 22 Chinese users, this research puts forth a typology of ‘embodied projection’ to articulate rich telepresence encounters. Moreover, we establish connections between various forms of telepresence and mediated interactions within the triadic relationship of operator-pets-others (e.g., families, friends, colleagues), surpassing the design intent for operator-pet interactions. Notably, this study finds that when operators regard Enabot as an extension of themselves, they actively seek attention from their pets, which might signal a shift of power in the human-pet dynamic and a novel relationship. Ultimately, we conclude that the utilization of this robot fundamentally serves as an act of self-care for operators.",

The highly regulated yet economically vulnerable media landscape in Singapore makes for a particularly interesting case study. Most of the data collection is from a local Multi-Channel Networks (MCN) that gathers aspiring creators in one of the country’s first-of-its-kind, industry-led training programmes, complemented by data from other local commercial MCNs and creators. The study makes use of qualitative interviews with creators and MCNs to gather empirical evidences on creators’ visibility imaginary as visible to ‘friends’ and visibility as metric numbers, in contrast to MCNs’ visibility understanding as visible to ‘fans’ and visibility as currency. Our study provides insights on the local contestations of the globally controlled visibility, proposing that visibility is ‘intermediated’ by not only platforms but also the state, MCNs, and creators in order to achieve ‘two-way visibility’. Our paper suggests small media markets that are dominated by global platforms to reconsider the platformization procedure.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an examination of the online backlash against Lisa, a member of the K-pop girl group Blackpink, triggered by her decision to perform in a burlesque club. It explores how feminist counterpublics operate within Asian fan communities in discussions concerning the visibility of female celebrities. Employing critical discourse analysis (CDA) in our study, we examined gender, power, and ideology in feminist discourse surrounding Lisa’s action, paying close attention to how feminism is negotiated within counterpublics of online communities. Analysis of 22 Facebook posts and accompanying comments from Vietnamese K-pop fan groups and pages revealed how feminist discourse in Vietnamese online fan communities is deeply intertwined with cultural preservation, social responsibility, and class considerations. Reflecting broader societal tensions between individualism and collectivism, as well as between Western and Asian values through varied interpretation of feminism within a discursive framework, this contextualization builds on existing scholarship of how feminist discourse is shaped and contested in non-Western settings.",

    "abstract": "This article examines how Deleuzean philosophy can inform the design and analysis of Virtual Reality (VR) narratives, focusing on the concepts of becoming, assemblage, and immanence. The research addresses the question: How can VR narratives foster ethical reflection and participant engagement, particularly on issues of social justice and representation? Through a post-qualitative methodology and narrative analysis of four VR films – ‘Notes on Blindness’, ‘Clouds Over Sidra’, ‘The Key’, and ‘Giant’ – the study demonstrates how VR enables participants to engage in processes of becoming-other, provoking sensory and emotional transformations. These films illustrate how VR narratives allow for co-creation, ethical reflection, and empathy by immersing participants in complex ethical dilemmas related to disability, trauma, and displacement. Based on these findings, the article proposes an ethical framework for VR narrative design, emphasizing participant agency, immanent ethics, and the integration of social justice themes.",

    "title": "Subjectivity, culture and the datafication of music",
    "abstract": "The main objective of this article is to critique the notions of subjectivity, identity and selfhood underlying key approaches to the datafication of music, and some key normative positions associated with those approaches. I begin by showing how some of the most sophisticated and influential approaches to datafication of music (by Eric Drott and Robert Prey) draw on theorisation of the harms associated with datafication that depend upon the idea of ‘subjectification’. I then question this conception of subjectivity, tracing its origins in earlier modes of social theory. I argue that the emphasis on subjectification has resulted in approaches to digital identities, in studies of datafication in general as well as in culture and music, that focus on how technologies imply, construct or ‘demand’ certain ‘subject positions’ on the part of users. This approach, I claim, fails sufficiently to engage with the actual practices and lived experiences of users or audiences, and frames them in a way that downplays, neglects and even evacuates agency and autonomy as elements of subjectivity, identity and selfhood. I then argue that the normative basis of such subjectification critiques as applied to music is limited because those critiques depend on the limited conceptions of subjectivity, identity and selfhood characteristic of subjectification approaches in general. I also show that Drott and Prey’s accounts fall back on different groundings for critique than the subject formation theorising they purport to offer. These groundings are provided by two rather different theoretical concerns: political-economic critique regarding capitalist power and critiques of surveillance and privacy. I close by offering suggestions for better models of selfhood, identity and subjectivity that might inform a more integrated account of political-economic, socio-cultural and psychic domains. I also comment on the kinds of methodologies that might be entailed by adopting such models.",

    "abstract": "This essay uses the theory of privacy as contextual integrity together with critical research on the role of media in democracies to critique platform surveillance and a related process that I call direct marketization. It focuses on the case of advertising attribution, a paradigm of audience and marketing measurement that attempts to determine advertising effectiveness by observing people as both media audiences and marketplace consumers. Advertising platforms have recently promised to implement ‘privacy-preserving’ methods of attribution measurement. The paper argues that these efforts to legitimize attribution make implicit claims about the values and purposes of media systems. It then introduces the concept of direct marketization to explain how these claims relate to shifts in the social and institutional norms of ad-supported media. The analysis exposes direct marketization and advertising attribution, which both fuel and depend on platform surveillance, as contradictory to the contextual integrity of democratic media.",

    "abstract": "The term ‘Mutai Danshen’ (母胎单身), referring to individuals who have never been in a romantic relationship, has recently gained significant cultural prominence in China. This study explores how media convergence enhances the digital visibility of ‘Mutai Danshen’ within Chinese audiovisual media. Using a case study approach combined with netnography, it is argued that media convergence facilitates both the memeification and stigmatization of ‘Mutai Danshen’ by enabling interactions across diverse media formats, thereby amplifying its online visibility. As the term interacts across different media, it evolves from a niche internet buzzword into a widely recognized social phenomenon. This process reshapes public perceptions of singlehood and marital norms, creating a dynamic environment where ‘Mutai Danshen’ becomes both a humorous meme and a contested social label. This study showcases media convergence’s role in the process of gaining visibility in audiovisual media, which furtherly offers a mechanism for the dissemination and negotiation of cultural identities, underscoring the transformative potential of integrated media landscapes in shaping contemporary social narratives.",

    "abstract": "This article discusses the domestication of remote-controlled sex toys within the online multiplayer sex game 3DXChat (SexGame Devil 2012) after their partnership with Lovense (Hytto) in May 2021. Under the title ‘Virtual pleasure made real’, both companies re-branded longstanding promises for the ‘future of sex’ for their consumers by converging different kinds of technologies and influencing sex-playing practices. In order to understand players’ perspectives, I primarily analyzed publications posted on 3DXChat official forum related to the partnership, which were complemented by other materials and participant observations of a two-year-long online ethnography within the sex game. The findings suggest that players were surprised and sceptical about the success of domestication. There was limited data supporting a modification of sex-playing practices, though they speculated who would benefit the most. In sum, it seems that the consumption and domestication of sexual objects in a technological setting were not as impactful as was expected, particularly in a sociocultural context of a global pandemic, which encouraged the interrelation of play and sex.",

    "abstract": "\n            This study examines the struggling lived experiences of women workers in the Chinese audio drama industry, through a mixed-methods approach involving online and on-site observations, as well as multi-round interviews with voice actors, and technical and administrative professionals from seven distinct Chinese audio drama crews. I reveal a pronounced process –\n            the feminization of labor\n            – within this burgeoning creative sector. The feminization of labor, understood here as\n            a constant process of invisibility and vulnerability\n            . Within the Chinese audio drama industry, female workers are stuck in invisibility, frequently find themselves relegated to backstage roles, and subject to an inflexible flexibility whereby work is discursively overloaded and becomes inextricably linked with life, while their male colleagues occupy more prominent and supervisory positions. Despite contributing creatively, women’s efforts often go unnoticed and are rendered invisible. Then by spotlighting the challenges faced by female voice actresses and audio drama professionals, I explicate the systemic gender biases, which result in women receiving limited opportunities, lower incomes, and reduced visibility compared to their male counterparts. I argue that the current state of gender inequality is a consequence of deeply ingrained binary gender beliefs that shape the choices of voice actors in audio dramas, along with uneven progress across various genres, including\n            danmei\n            , heterosexual romances, and female-female romances, stemming from the entrenched Chinese hetero-patriarchal socio-familial system and the party-state’s heteronormative censorship practices.\n          ",

    "abstract": "\n            This article presents the development, and exploration of a prototype for VR-dissemination of cultural heritage with the use of radio archive sound.\n            Pastfinder 2.0\n            is designed to examine how historic audio, and emerging technologies can be combined to create immersive experiences and contribute to a deeper understanding of how the past has shaped the present-day landscape in an unpredictable future where cultural heritage sites might become harder to interpret and visit than they are today. The concept includes a 3D-model of a protected landscape and audio from the archive of the Norwegian Public Broadcasting Corporation, NRK. Each sound clip conveys narratives directly linked with locations at the mountain plateau of Dovrefjell. The study’s key innovation is the re-use of a public broadcasting archive for location-based virtual dissemination of cultural heritage, with the VR showing the landscape of today whilst the audio interprets its past. For the development and evaluation of the concept we have used the method of media design and strived to practice a bottom-up approach by including an extended peer community in the process. To get input for further iterations, the prototype has been explored by students specializing in Media and Interaction Design. The article describes the design-process, present results from the user-study and discuss these in view of the project’s intended purpose. Our findings show that most students felt that they were physically at the location and that this usage of a radio archive can make it more relevant in our day and age. They also indicate that VR-experiences can be overwhelming and stand in the way of the audio content and reveal a potential for enhancing the knowledge output of the concept and its level of interactivity.\n          ",

The study utilizes qualitative textual analysis of Twitter/X conversations to analyze how moviegoers’ attitudes toward streaming blockbuster movies changed across various phases of the pandemic. Operating within the framework of media substitution theory, the research highlights how brand equity and social word-of-mouth (sWOM) influence consumer attitudes towards streaming services as a potential substitution for the traditional moviegoing experience.

    "abstract": "Chronic conditions are often described as long-term bodily disorders that lead to functional limitations and the need for ongoing medical and social care. This steers some people with such disorders towards supportive interactions with peers on social media. Through a theoretical framework focused on different types of ‘publics’, the article investigates the communication of illness and patienthood in two selected social media publics, by asking: How is chronic illness and the role of the ‘peer-patient’ constructed in these different media publics? The analysis is based on empirical material dealing with two different and large Danish publics for people with chronic conditions, one on Instagram and one on Facebook, consisting of a manual coding of ‘posts’ in the two publics and interviews with 21 members/followers. The article argues that the two social media publics enable very different ways of making sense of illness, integrating illness into daily and public life, and creating bonds between peers. The article thus identifies two types of chronic publics and ‘peer-patienthood’ – the ‘activist peer-patient’ and the ‘supportive peer-patient’. Through this analysis, the article contributes to existing research by focussing on the nuances of how experiences of chronic illness can be communicated through and shaped by social media publics in fundamentally different ways.",

    "abstract": "\nDo both authoritarian and liberal-democratic regimes rely on similar forms of police governmentality and state terror to sustain public order and security? Are police forces inherently authoritarian institutions that cannot be reformed? Our aim is to explore these questions by analysing the case of Spain, a constitutional democracy considered free by liberal standards, yet where, in the short period between 2011 and 2024, the two main policing bodies in Spain—the National Police and the Guardia Civil—were involved in the legal and illegal surveillance and espionage of almost one-hundred parliamentarians from left-wing, Basque, and Catalan organisations, the questionable infiltration of “radical” and “anti-fascist” social movements, and operations to cover up widespread royal, political, and corporate corruption.\n",

    "title": "Dataveillance, Design, and the Demise of Interpretive Flexibility",
    "abstract": "Over the past decade, new technologies have been increasingly deployed in a manner that allows designers to remotely collect usage data, facilitating the development and rollout of updates and adjustments after their release. By retaining control over product stabilization, designers can discourage technologies from being used in manners other than that which they prescribe, thereby reducing interpretive flexibility. As a result, end users are increasingly shepherded towards use-patterns that reflect the interests of designers. This paper explores this agential shift using three case studies. The first considers the evolution of a video game series, exploring how expanding data-collection practices in subsequent releases changed design processes and user experiences. The second case examines the evolution of social media design and the rise of algorithmic nudging. The third case broadly analyzes humanitarian design, demonstrating how dataveillance has expanded beyond consumer electronics. By maintaining control over use-patterns, designers can reduce uncertainty and increase profitability. However, these subtle power shifts also have consequences for user agency and interpretive flexibility, reanimating debates about technological determinism.",

    "title": "Communications Under Siege: Colonial Legacy and Authoritarian Surveillance in India",
    "abstract": "Under the guise of decolonizing and modernizing laws, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance government has sought amendments in laws governing every aspect of digital communication in India, such as cellular mobile, instant messaging, news, and entertainment. The government has dramatically expanded its power to control and regulate different forms of digital communications, exerting significant influence over what people watch, read, hear, and think. This extensive authority enables the government to monitor, surveil, censor, and shape public mood and opinion, thus placing communications under siege. In today’s world, communication technologies are deeply embedded in our daily lives as we transmit, share, and broadcast information. In India, the enduring legacy of colonial surveillance powers continues to shape and influence the surveillance over digital communications. This Dialogue paper argues that authoritarian surveillance in India is not merely a direct manifestation of the colonial legacy of British rule, but rather a fusion of enduring authoritarian features rooted in the colonial past, and the prevailing authoritarian intentions and practices of the post-colonial present.",

    "abstract": "In Tunisia, the 2016 national strategy against terrorism introduced the concept of preventive measures, which legitimized tighter state control over religious discourses and practices. To bring a local perspective to the study of international preventative measures, I build upon the concept of “vernacular security” to examine how Tunisian imams involved in preventing violent extremism (PVE) programs understand security, violent extremism, radicalization, and their role as non-traditional security actors. To achieve this, I observe how imams describe their own experiences of security, in their own words and through their own understandings. Through ethnographic interviews conducted with local imams between 2019 and 2020, this research focuses on the way in which they perceive, re-enact, and influence security practices, with a particular focus on the relationship between religion and security, a central subject in post-revolutionary Tunisia. In so doing, this paper argues that local imams involved in PVE programs reproduce local and global security discourses, while at the same challenging their role in community policing.",

    "abstract": "The burgeoning market for wearable technologies with surveillance capabilities is reorienting our relationship with our bodies, privacy, and digital data. This expanding sector has prompted an exploration into how the surveillance of the individual body has been normalized more broadly in the fashion sphere through its visual communications practice. To this end, a multimodal critical discourse analysis following an adapted framework examined a series of photographic editorials and identified two overarching trends that characterize the representation of surveillance in female-focused fashion consumption contexts. Firstly, by adopting a visual style that uses analog aesthetics and obsolescent technology, contemporary surveillance’s obtrusive and expansive reality is obscured and replaced with hauntological nostalgia. Secondly, by framing the act of self-surveillance via screen technologies as erotically charged and potentially empowering, the body’s surveillance is celebrated rather than scrutinized. With close reference to two specific case studies, I demonstrate how these visual treatments can be interpreted as downplaying concerns about privacy and assisting in accelerating the collapse between public and private spheres. I argue that the fashion media’s aesthetic softening of surveillance has culturally foreshadowed an expansion of surveillance capitalism manifesting in the current interest in, and demand for, fashionable wearables.",

    "title": "Authoritarian Surveillance: An Introduction",
    "abstract": "Authoritarian surveillance is no longer an exceptional or rare practice. In many parts of the world, we are witnessing an increase of pervasive government monitoring, of curtailing privacy protections, of stringent control of information flows, and of intimidation towards self-censorship. These hallmarks of authoritarian surveillance are not confined to authoritarian or undemocratic regimes. In a political landscape that favours strongarm authoritarian leaders, the boundaries between authoritarian and democratic regimes, the liberal and the illiberal ones, are blurrier than ever. The increasing availability of advanced technologies for analyzing (big) data, particularly when integrated with artificial intelligence (AI), has heightened the temptation for governments to adopt authoritarian surveillance tools and practices—and has amplified the potential dangers involved.\nThis Dialogue section introduces the multiple dimensions of contemporary authoritarian surveillance, going beyond a dichotomy between “democratic” and “authoritarian” regimes to identify and map authoritarian surveillance in diverse geographical and political contexts. We focus on surveillance beyond the exceptional and beyond the rule of law to examine an increasingly mundane but dangerous practice undermining the limited democratic spaces that remain in our world. The seven articles in this special Dialogue section explore different angles of authoritarian surveillance— the technologies that facilitate it, the laws that govern it, and the legacies that precede it or linger thereafter—and the social and political consequences that emerge as a result. Together, this collection revisits existing literature on authoritarian surveillance, calls for a renewed scholarly focus on its consequences, and proposes new directions for future research.",

Here, we shift the focus away from only either state and/or the individual and the conventional entities in between, to consider the new platform actors driving authoritarianism and digital surveillance in the twenty-first century.",

    "abstract": "This article addresses the puzzle of scatological humour among privacy advocates. Drawing on ethnographic work in Britain in 2014 and in Germany between 2019–2023, it advances a consideration of the phenomenon as a form of “boundary play” (Nippert-Eng 2005). Deploying the transgressive exposure of behaviours of a human body, as expressive of transgressions across a social body, scatological references use satire to make statements around contemporary digital surveillance. Splicing this to a noteworthy absence of anthropological scholarship on the concept of privacy, the article positions privacy as an extrinsic concept, alive at the boundary, that struggles to travel across cultural contexts. While continuing to support the local extrinsic work that privacy performs, it suggests the need to construct stronger architectures of value around other phenomena synonymous with not being readable.",

    "title": "In the Heart of Liberal Democracy: Whitewashing Authoritarian Surveillance a Decade After the Snowden Revelations",
    "abstract": "Practices of authoritarian surveillance are not limited to so-called authoritarian states. Authoritarian surveillance has been increasingly witnessed in countries that uphold liberal democratic principles and institutions in the twenty-first century, along with accelerated automation of mass surveillance. This article situates authoritarian surveillance as a problem in the heart of democracy and capitalism in its materiality and imperial expansion and discusses how mass surveillance has redrawn boundaries of democratic principles. What Edward Snowden has revealed since 2013 is a good reminder of the materiality of the global surveillance networks built under the “War on Terror” that we still live in. They are embedded within digital communication infrastructures by the security agencies in the United States, the self-defined champion of liberal democracy. Nonetheless, a decade after the Snowden revelations, the authoritarian surveillance within democracy has been whitewashed in technological competitions with the Global South, such as China and India, and in tech-savvy culture in the Global North. What is the driving force of this oblivion? In a contrast with the COVID-19 pandemic surveillance, I highlight the exceptional position given to the security intelligence and policing agencies within liberal democratic institutions to generate authoritarian surveillance continuously from the imperial to postcolonial times. It is critically important to deconstruct the binary discourse of democratic states versus authoritarian states because this view tends to only problematize surveillance activities by countries located outside the “West” and sees authoritarian surveillance practiced by self-defined democratic states as harmless or even necessary to counter perceived authoritarian states. It further fuels global dissemination of surveillance technologies, just like the nuclear arms races, and produces more victims of authoritarian surveillance on earth, without borders.",

    "title": "Recursive Surveillance and the Persistence of Authoritarian Surveillance in Brazil",
    "abstract": "To comprehend contemporary surveillance in Brazil, especially under Bolsonaro’s administration (2019–2022), it is crucial to revisit the country’s most authoritarian period, the military dictatorship (1964–1985). During this period, the National Information Service (SNI) was established as a state intelligence agency and played a pivotal role in monitoring and suppressing dissent, setting the stage for future surveillance practices in Brazil. The military dictatorship ended in 1985, with the SNI being dissolved in 1990. In 1999, the remnants of SNI were restructured into the Brazilian Intelligence Agency (ABIN), which remains operational today. Under Bolsonaro’s government, ABIN employed advanced surveillance technologies to monitor opponents of the far-right president. Some of these surveillance practices have been deemed abusive and are currently under investigation by the Federal Police during Lula’s administration (2023–2026). This contribution introduces the concept of recursive surveillance, suggesting that state surveillance mechanisms not only reinvent themselves but also do so in ways that create the framework for their examination and eventual exposure. Surveillance structures, particularly those created in authoritarian regimes, leave traces that may reveal the practices and ideologies of the watchers, allowing for their eventual scrutiny.",

    "abstract": "Kidnapping as a crime of (im)mobility can be understood as a social act of mutuality and reciprocity, where the interaction between kidnappers and kidnappees shapes a broader system of connected activities of surveillance, intimacy, control, and consent. This article argues that during situations of long-term kidnapping, novel forms of social interaction emerge as a result of mutual surveillance practices between surveillance agents (kidnappers) and surveillance objects (kidnappees). It focuses on analysing how members of The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) (the kidnappers) and Colombian politicians, police, and army personnel (the kidnappees) conducted mutual practices and activities of surveillance during their lengthy cohabitation inside jungle kidnapping camps. It presents the results of thirty-three semi-structured interviews with victims of long-term kidnapping in Colombia and eleven structured interviews with FARC ex-combatants who were involved in kidnapping operations. The article demonstrates that the senses of mutuality, reciprocity, and intimacy were crucial to creating an unconventional surveillance regime inside jungle kidnapping camps in Colombia.",

    "title": "Authoritarian Surveillance Trends: Structural Racism and Transnationalism",
    "abstract": "This paper extends the “authoritarian surveillance as a practice” (Topak, Mekouar, and Cavatorta 2022) perspective by focusing on the major trends that shape authoritarian surveillance in three different contexts. It draws on authoritarian surveillance practices implemented by Turkey, Israel (in Palestine), and the European Union (EU) (at Africa-Europe borderzones) and observes that, despite different contexts and regime types, authoritarian surveillance is driven by structural racism and transnational associations. In Turkey, racialized Kurdish populations and pro-Kurdish dissident groups have been the major recipients of authoritarian surveillance practices, even though mass authoritarian surveillance has impacted large segments of the society. The Gülen community, which is a Turkey-origin transnational movement, played a major role in the intensification of authoritarian surveillance, while the EU provided indirect support because of its reliance on Turkey for stopping migrants trying to reach Europe. The EU implements authoritarian surveillance not only through responsibilizing external actors (such as in Turkey and Libya) for border policing but also through the deployment of its own border surveillance technologies. The EU drones, provided by Israeli companies, surveil and facilitate the return of black African migrants to Libya where they are subjected to crimes against humanity. The long history of European colonialism in Africa shapes the current racist use of EU drones as an authoritarian surveillance practice, which is implemented through the EU’s transnational associations involving Libyan militia groups and Israeli drone companies. In Palestine, the legacies of Israel’s settler-colonial racism against Palestinians have culminated in the current genocidal surveillance by Israel. Israel has been committing genocide within a network of transnational associations and is also one of the major exporters of authoritarian surveillance technology, ranging from spyware to drones. Through examination of these contexts, the paper argues that authoritarian surveillance is practiced by both liberal and authoritarian regimes, is driven by structural racism and is implemented through the involvement of various transnational actors.

    "abstract": "Online audiences have become increasingly visible to each other. Recent work in Surveillance &amp; Society has suggested that visible viewership in gaming constitutes “visibility labour” (Abidin 2016). Yet, little work has sketched the relationship between visible consumption, visibility labours, and social media’s surveillance economy. This article fills that gap by offering a preliminary structural outline of how visible consumers play a role in digital surveillance economies. I ask: What role does visible consumption play in digital surveillance economies on Instagram Live? What kinds of visibility labour are demanded of visible consumers, and with what effects? First, top-down surveillance of user interactions turns involuntarily visible consumers into social producers through metrified viewership and personal profiles. Second, lateral surveillance, such as moderator features and reporting tools, also turns voluntarily visible consumers into social producers by reproducing Instagram’s brand and deflecting from government oversight. In the context of Instagram Live, making users’ consumption habits socially public extends surveillance culture and neoliberal trends on social media, whereby market forces are extended into further reaches of social life.",

    "abstract": "The twentieth century has been termed the Century of Women, an era marked by significant social and political changes that began around 1900. Although by no means universal and occurring in differing sequences and at different speeds throughout the twentieth century, there were noteworthy improvements in the position of women in society encompassing extensions of suffrage, greater educational opportunities, removal of many restrictions on employment, access to healthcare including contraception and abortion, and legislation against forms of sexual discrimination. These developments were neither straightforward nor universal, and in recent times there have been many examples of these advances being curtailed and even put into reverse with the position of women and young girls deteriorating significantly.",

    "abstract": "Sociotechnical research increasingly includes the social sub-networks that emerge from large-scale sociotechnical infrastructure, including the infrastructure for building open source software. This paper addresses these numerous sub-networks as advantageous for researchers. It provides a methodological synthesis focusing on how researchers can best span adjacent social sub-networks during engaged field research. Specifically, we describe practices and artifacts that aid movement from one social subsystem within a more extensive technical infrastructure to another. To surface the importance of spanning sub-networks, we incorporate a discussion of social capital and the role of technical infrastructure in its development for sociotechnical researchers. We then characterize a five-step process for spanning social sub-networks during engaged field research: commitment, context mapping, jargon competence, returning value, and bridging. We then present our experience studying corporate open source software projects and the role of that experience in accelerating our work in open source scientific software research as described through the lens of bridging social capital. Based on our analysis, we offer recommendations for engaging in fieldwork in adjacent social sub-networks that share a technical context and discussion of how the relationship between social and technically acquired social capital is a missing but critical methodological dimension for research on large-scale sociotechnical research.",

    "abstract": "This is a manifesto to reject calls to “online privacy.” Privacy is an inherently exclusionary liberal entitlement inextricably linked to property, racial oppression, sexual control and class segregation. However online privacy is uncritically promoted by academics, activists and media discourse as a civil right and even a form of social justice. We build on the arguments of feminist, queer, Black Radical traditions and GDPR legal scholars to make three arguments to the contrary. First, privacy is not social justice, but reproduces the ideologies of colonial rankings, policing and norms (racial, sexual, able-bodied and more). Second, online privacy is inextricable from private property as the exclusive legal protection of home-owners from state oversight; a liberal privilege that is easily appropriated into corporate affordances. Third, online privacy is a myth: the Internet works because its infrastructures share knowledge inferred from data, in other words there is no actual possibility of privacy, nor any real corporate incentive to privacy, except as an optic tactic to avoid accountability. Grounded in anti-capitalist social justice, our argument exceeds current liberal civil definitions of safety, such as the Human Rights based approach to Smart Cities inspired by the United Nations, the GDPR, municipal policies and environmental law. Instead we call for public, collectivized data and the complete rejection of liberal property entitlement, gatekeeping and policing known as “privacy.”",

    "abstract": "Though there is robust literature on the history of the advice genre, Reddit is an unrecognized but significant medium for the genre. This lack of attention, in part, stems from the lack of a coherent timeline and framework for understanding the emergence of dozens of advice-related subreddits. Noting the challenges of Reddit historiography, I trace the development of the advice genre on the platform, using the metaphors of evolutionary and family trees. I make use of data dumps of early Reddit submissions and interviews with subreddit founders and moderators to plot the development of advice subreddits through the periods of subreddit explosion (2009–2010), the emergence of judgment subreddits (2011–2013; 2019–2021), and the rise of meta subreddits (2020–2023). Additionally, I specify a lexicon for understanding the relationships between subreddits using the metaphor of tree branches. For example, new subreddits might spawn, fork, or split relative to existing subreddits, and their content is cultivated by meta subreddits by way of filtration, compilation, and syndication.",

    "title": "Girltelligence: A safe and supportive social community app for teen girls and young women",
    "abstract": "Young people’s mental health has deteriorated over the last decade, especially among females. Rates of depression, anxiety, and self-harm have soared while well-being has declined. This mental health crisis has coincided with increased use of smartphones and social media, the extended isolation and suffering caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and attacks on reproductive rights. These recent stressors have compounded the historic challenges women and girls have always faced while growing up, at school, in society, and in the workplace.\r\nIn this paper, we examine the mental health effects of social media on young people, focusing on females. In an effort to address the current crisis, we designed a mobile app, Girltelligence, that provides a safe online space for girls and young women to advise and support one another on any topics without judgment and without the negative mental health impacts associated with mainstream social media. Girltelligence achieves this by offering a safe environment monitored by both AI and human moderators and tailored by age.",

    "abstract": "his study investigates changes in online gaming behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, applying video game uses and gratifications theory to analyze young adults’ gaming motivations. We explore the popularity of specific gratifications amid the crisis and propose a novel gratification, commitment, that may affect gaming choices. Results showcase a possible link between some players who self-report tenuous or low emotional and mental well-being and certain video game gratifications, like competition and diversion. Our findings suggest commitment may influence some players’ willingness to pursue social and competitive gratifications, especially if they are more willing to identify as a gamer.",

    "abstract": "The hijab controversy, a hot topic in India since January 2022, emerged from a clash between students and college authorities in Karnataka, a state in India. The dispute made its way to Karnataka’s High Court, which, on 15 March 2022, ruled that the hijab was not mandatory for religious practices. This decision stirred widespread debates, especially on social media platforms like Facebook. This study is focused on user reactions in The Times of India Daily’s official Facebook page, employing sentiment analysis to decipher public emotions, attitudes, and opinions. Nearly 200 comments posted on the verdict day were analyzed, utilizing the routine activity theory (RAT), spiral of silence theory, and online disinhibition effect. The research introduced a unique model, RAT+A, to enhance analysis. As a significant platform for public discourse, Facebook played a crucial role in capturing diverse societal sentiments and reactions regarding this social issue.",

    "abstract": "Empirical evidence has suggested a positive correlation between authentic self-presentation on social media and improved mental health and well-being. False self-presentation, conversely, may bring about negative outcomes to subjective and psychological well-being. Our study examines the different selves that users present, as well as factors influencing self-presentation, on social media platforms. Results from 392 survey responses suggest that, first, users present themselves differently on Facebook, LinkedIn, and TikTok; generally, they tend to present their real and ideal selves more than the false selves. Second, users seek significantly different uses and gratifications from different social media platforms (e.g., maintaining existing relationships on Facebook, meeting new people and socializing on LinkedIn, or entertainment purposes on TikTok); nevertheless, education and information is a common motivation for social media use. Third, social media uses and gratifications, social media usage, and self-esteem are influential factors of users’ self-presentation on social media. The dynamics of these influential factors, however, differ across platforms. Theoretical implications, as well as empirical suggestions to enhance the quality of social media interactions, are further discussed.",

In 2021, Meta Platforms pledged billions to make the metaverse a reality. They founded the Metaverse Standards Forum in 2022, together with Microsoft, NVIDIA, and others. The same year, the French President, Emmanuel Macron, reacted to the dominance of American tech giants. He vowed to support an “European metaverse”. The European Commission later identified the metaverse as a key initiative. The Commissioner Thierry Breton presented Europe’s “threefold” categorisation of the metaverse: “people, technologies, and infrastructure”. By extension, this paper presents a review of academic literature and elaborates three commonly prioritsed concepts that are relevant to Breton’s categories. The metaverse’s common concepts are: avatars (people), XR (technlogies), and digital markets (infrastructure). Their discussion highlights potential suggestions for future research.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the Sigma Male Community has become a global online counterculture that spreads ideas about masculinity, rejection of contemporary Western values, and the restoration of traditionalism. Led by the question of how this discourse became a global counterculture, this study examines participants' use of Twitter (now known as X) and their construction of a shared identity through a reflexive thematic analysis of seven public accounts. By using a platform that does not have strict policies regarding provocative speech, its members have been found to create alternative truths that serve as a form of escapism for men who are dissatisfied with the current reality. Moreover, findings suggest that the community became a global counterculture as it represents a contemporary trend of personal development that is tailored towards men and that attracts them with the complete acceptance and understanding of male-only struggles.",

Bisexuality is becoming increasingly common; younger adults are very much more likely to identify as bisexual. There does not appear to be any research that investigated differences between lesbian/gay and bisexual adults on relationship search and online dating. Results show that 1) bisexual adults are significantly less likely than lesbian/gay adults to adopt online dating and 2) bisexual adults are significantly more likely than straight adults to use online dating. Online dating offers the promise of helping bisexual adults make better matches. Future research should investigate additional differences between bisexual, lesbian/gay, and straight adults on the use of technology for relationship search, formation, and establishment.",

    "abstract": "The percentage of female computer science majors is lower today at U.S. schools than in the 1980s, despite decades of effort by concerned computer scientists and the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF). Researchers have addressed a variety of possible reasons, ranging from the lack of female role models, to sexism on campus and in the workplace, to conflicts between work and motherhood. More recently, efforts to attract women have focused on the content of computer science as a factor deterring women. In particular, recent studies have proposed that the subject will be more appealing to underrepresented groups — especially girls — if teachers emphasize “computational thinking.” The idea that computer science has its own special way of thinking, which can both appeal to women and be transferred to non-computing fields, has been a subject of enthusiasm but also debate among computer education experts. This paper explores the implications of the claim that teaching computational thinking can help undo the gender imbalance in computing, and what this says about computer science itself.",

    "abstract": "Gender issues persist in the computing industry, with women representing only just over 20 percent of the workforce, despite numerous initiatives to encourage their wider participation. This paper explores gender inequalities within the computing industry by adapting the sociological lens of Pierre Bourdieu’s concepts of capital, habitus and field to understand why inequalities arise and persist in the computing industry. Using interviews with both men and women in the computing industry, the research explores the gender perceptions and systemic experiences from both perspectives. The findings indicate that while inequalities persist, women can and do demonstrate agency in creating their own social support networks to assist in negotiating the male dominated workplace. Promisingly, there is also an increasing awareness among men in the industry regarding the importance of inclusivity, coupled with the positive impact of such developments for them personally.",

It is important to highlight these women in the historical narrative, starting with discussions of recent and contemporary history, so that there is a “first draft” of the history that ensures they are not ignored in subsequent retellings of this period of computing’s history.",

    "abstract": "The contemporary scholarly communication environment is characterized by the growth in mandates and infrastructure for open access publication and open approaches to the research lifecycle, with a consequent explosion in the number of online platforms seeking to provide infrastructure for open scholarship. These include corporate academic social networks and scholar-governed infrastructure created as a reaction against those networks, as well as the recent major transformation of the social media landscape in the wake of changes at Twitter (now X), previously a major outlet for scholarly engagement with the public. Analysts of this environment have pointed out that most platform initiatives focus on narrow use cases rather than building up solutions through a holistic understanding of scholar workflows. This exploratory study uses focus group interviews to draw out responses to one academically governed platform, the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) Commons, in the context of humanities scholars’ existing work. It explores humanities scholars’ needs and behaviors related to sharing scholarly information with each other and broader audiences, particularly on the Internet. Feedback from participants sheds light on opportunities and challenges for academy-governed infrastructure for “open social scholarship.” Themes identified include technical fatigue and burnout in the current multi-platform environment, sustainability, and desires to reach and engage the right academic and non-academic audiences when appropriate.",

    "abstract": "F International was a pioneering company set up by Dame Stephanie “Steve” Shirley in the 1960s specifically to provide flexible, free-lance opportunities for highly skilled women who needed to juggle childcare and other domestic or caring responsibilities with a desire to continue using and developing their programming and other computer-related skills and expertise. From the 1980s onwards it was lauded by many, with coverage in the media and in top management journals. Yet by the early years of this century, it had all but disappeared, having lost its distinctive features along the way. Was this an unavoidable outcome of its growth and strategy of mergers and acquisitions? Were opportunities lost or did key decisions unwittingly lead to this result? Or was there an inevitability to such a project?",

    "abstract": "Research on the link between social media and well-being has lead to ambiguous findings — some research has found a positive, negative, and mixed relationship between the two. We employ the case of China, in which social media is controlled in important ways, as a useful alternative case to gain leverage on these ambiguities. Using data from a nationwide survey of Chinese citizens (n=2,292), we principally find that individual, heterogeneous effects are an important driver of the relationship between levels of social media use and reported well-being. Additionally, our results lend support to a FOMO (fear of missing out) mechanism as an important driver of the relationship while not finding support for the mechanism of exposure to negative content on social media as a predictor of well-being. Finally, our findings suggest that institutional context may not play an important role in the social media — social isolation relationship.",

    "abstract": "\nIn the rapidly changing landscape of online social interactions, the presence of automated accounts, or bots, has always posed a significant challenge to maintaining platforms where the information posted is authentic and reliable. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) may exacerbate this problem, as researchers have recently found families of automated accounts that use generative artificial intelligence to produce their posts. This paper focuses on this new type of bot, particularly on detecting them. Using a new detection technique that relies on image classification to distinguish between human and automated accounts, we demonstrate remarkable efficiency in identifying bots whose posts are generated by large language models. Our research improves the results of previous work on the detection of bot accounts powered by generative artificial intelligence.\n \n\n\n\n \n \n",

    "abstract": "This paper re-imagines the governance of artificial intelligence (AI) through a transfeminist lens, focusing on challenges of power, participation, and injustice, and on opportunities for advancing equity, community-based resistance, and transformative change. AI governance is a field of research and practice seeking to maximize benefits and minimize harms caused by AI systems. Unfortunately, AI governance practices are frequently ineffective at preventing AI systems from harming people and the environment, with historically marginalized groups such as trans people being particularly vulnerable to harm. Building upon trans and feminist theories of ethics, I introduce an approach to transfeminist AI governance. Applying a transfeminist lens in combination with a critical self-reflexivity methodology, I retroactively reinterpret findings from three empirical studies of AI governance practices in Canada and globally. In three reflections on my findings, I show that large-scale AI governance systems structurally prioritize the needs of industry over marginalized communities. As a result, AI governance is limited by power imbalances and exclusionary norms. My reflections reveal that re-grounding AI governance in transfeminist ethical principles can support AI governance researchers, practitioners, and organizers in addressing those limitations.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of preschool apps marketed as educational has created a challenging landscape in which their actual educational value is difficult to assess, a phenomenon some authors have described as a “digital Wild West.” While education apps have received continuous scholarly attention, the specific conditions governing their distribution remain understudied. From a software and platform studies perspective and drawing on digital methods, this paper investigates how app stores mediate access to educational apps for young children. We examine the “ranking cultures” on Apple’s App Store through the empirical study of search results of early literacy apps. We present our findings, paying attention to both the strategies employed by app stores and the tactics used by app developers to adapt to algorithmic governance. This lens prompts a discussion on the ranking dynamics that influence app makers’ tactics and how these negotiations shape the current offer for preschool education.",

Based on 16 in-depth interviews, it identifies five key social media affordances: anonymity, audience curation, content curation, visibility, and connectivity. Despite government oppression, participants find some societal acceptance through positive online experiences. Social media enables identity exploration, connection, and solidarity in an unsupportive political environment. However, challenges like online harassment and conflicting discourses persist. This research highlights the crucial role of digital spaces in identity development and community building. It underscores how social media simultaneously empowers and challenges identity work, highlighting its evolving role in shaping the lives of LGBTQ+ individuals grappling with discrimination and seeking understanding.",

By designing for learning, deliberation, inclusivity, respect, and listening, communication designers might help avoid the use of harassment and suppression techniques in online social interfaces which affect women and marginalized users in particular. My motivation is to give designers tools to create designs that align with specific democratic values that I consider important. Through shaping, analyzing, and juxtaposing two of my own designs with a traditional commenting forum, I categorize five components: Conversational content, conversational architecture, input options, incentives and rewards, and user visibility. By using autoethnography, this study documents how personal motivations, norms, and gendered experiences can influence designs and meaning-making choices.",

The findings offer new and exciting insight into modern viewing habits as they tend to defy the conventional wisdom of the literature regarding audiences gravitating toward content that affirms and reinforces existing beliefs, attitudes, values, and cognition. The implication is that hate-watching as a phenomenon may fuel societal polarization.",

    "abstract": "Surveillance capitalism (SC) — as intended by Shoshana Zuboff — is a fairly recent concept, but it has already attracted the attention of many scholars from various fields within social sciences. Despite this interest, a comprehensive review of the available literature on this concept is lacking. To address this gap, we systematically mapped the contributions on SC. Working on a database of 486 papers downloaded from Scopus and Web of Science, we conducted descriptive statistics to analyze the distribution of contributions over the years, the most cited works, the predominant approaches (i.e., theoretical, empirical, methodological, etc.), and the co-occurrence of keywords. Additionally, we performed a close reading of a purposive sample of 50 articles. Our analysis revealed that empirical works remain limited compared to theoretical contributions. Furthermore, both theoretical and empirical papers often lacked a specific focus on the value(s) of data, with many scholars concentrating on surveillance, privacy, and big data. Building on these findings, we propose “future research directions” to guide and inspire empirical research on SC and to better address matters of value. Specifically, we identified four main directions: “privacy and beyond”, “big data and their relation to digital platforms”, “surveillance and the culture of surveillance”, and “platformization of consumer culture”. For each “direction”, we discuss ad hoc methodological implications and strategies.",

This study investigates the perceptions of digital artists in the entertainment industry towards AI-generated art. Through 22 in-depth interviews, we find that artists considered AI art unethical. In addition, artists questioned the agency and the lack of human expression behind AI art. Furthermore, the creative process is a point of contention. Unlike traditional art forms, AI art offered them little control or room for experimentation. Artists could not iterate or make incremental changes. Regarding the final AI art output, although the digital artists were impressed with its aesthetics, they found AI art soulless. The study has important implications for emerging research on AI art.",

    "title": "Making sense of generative AI for creating art: An exploratory study",
    "abstract": "\r\nThis paper explores how people make sense of generative AI for creating art, and how various meanings that people associate with generative AI for creating art relate to their trust toward generative AI for creating art, general orientation toward technologies, and the level of creativity. Taking a perspective of communication and media studies, the present research reports the findings of an exploratory survey (n = 112) conducted in April 2024. The results suggest that positive orientation toward technologies appears to be most relevant for positive meanings and higher trust toward generative AI in the context of creating art, and more frequent use of AI for creating art was also related to higher level of trust. Proficiency was the factor found to be related to creativity, but positive meanings and trust were not. The present study, although exploratory, shows the relevance of these factors, along with a communication and media perspective, to researching computational creativity, as technology continues to be appropriated into our everyday life.\r\n",

    "title": "Albert Rivera's Adoquín. The political consequences of a meme going viral",
    "abstract": "Understanding Twitter as a political space, we observe how, in response to the actions of the elites, a society that had previously remained distant and in a process of radicalization comes together under the protection of hashtags and trending topics to engage in public debate. One of its tools of protest is memes, which are used as argumentative reinforcement or as an attack. Their repetitive use facilitates their viralization, expanding their criticism and thereby increasing their social impact.\nIn this study, we will analyse a case in which memes played a significant role in the digital debate: The “Debate a cinco” or 4N Debate, broadcast on 4 November 2019, in which Albert Rivera — leader of the Ciudadanos party — presented before the cameras a visibly fragmented paving stone (panot) of considerable size. This action triggered an avalanche of comments and interactions on Twitter, which continued until the election day on 10 November. The public’s criticism and laughter generated a second media wave, in which digital news outlets, in their coverage of the event, compiled a collection of memes created at Rivera’s expense. This fuelled a social trend of irony and mockery directed at Rivera’s public persona, contributing to a drop from 57 to 10 parliamentary seats, the party’s relegation to fifth place and his subsequent resignation from the presidency of Ciudadanos and an end to his political career.",

    "title": "Modes of toxic behavior and game design considerations in online multiplayer games",
    "abstract": "Online multiplayer games like League of Legends, Counter Strike, and Roblox create experiences through community interactions between players. These games provide players with the ability to interact with each other through multiple modes of communication: text, image, audio, and behavioral signals. However, the presence of such features also opens a Pandora’s box to toxic behavior, such as hate speech, racism, and gaming-specific behaviors like intentional feeding. This paper reflects on toxic behavior from the perspective of the game industry. We first present definitions of toxic behavior through referencing definitions by several large game studios. We thus define toxic behavior as: actions disapproved by game designers and/or gaming communities that might affect gameplay. Then, we elaborate on the effects of toxic behavior — ruined game play experience, reduced player base, harmed success of the game and game studio. Through online case reports, we identify four modes of toxic behavior in online multiplayer games — text, image, audio, and behavioral — then move into a treatment of current practices for mitigating toxic content in terms of detection and game design, before concluding with open research directions.",

    "abstract": "Computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) has a longstanding tradition of facilitating collaboration among individuals, including in music creation. However, most studies in music creation focus primarily on music generation and individual interaction with supportive software for music writing. Despite the potential usefulness of current technology, it is not clear how technology can effectively support bands in collaboratively creating music, leaving ample room to explore how musicians actually work in their daily workplace. Through a design ethnographic perspective, this paper unveils the work practices of a band, providing detailed descriptions of the music creation process. This paper contributes to our understanding of music creation from several dimensions, including creative collaboration, communication, repository building, and privacy protection. In conclusion, we offer reflections on implementation to inform future designs that may better support musicians with suitable technological solutions. This highlights the importance of the CSCW perspective in bridging the gap between academia and industry, emphasizing the need for collaborative efforts to advance technology for music creation.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines how self-ascribed identity in Twitter biographies relates to news-sharing behavior on the platform. Drawing on a dataset of Dutch Twitter users who shared links to news articles in 2021, this study applies contextual topic modeling and clustering techniques to analyze identity patterns at scale. While prior research on online identity has often relied on manual annotation or focused on elite actors, this work leverages computational methods to systematically identify thematic identity groupings and their relation to news dissemination. The findings reveal that political identity — particularly among right-leaning users — is often foregrounded in biographies, frequently articulated through oppositional or “anti”-statements. However, news sharing across identity groups remains largely centered on mainstream Dutch news outlets, indicating that ideological critique does not necessarily translate into alternative media consumption. This research also highlights the complexity of online identity construction, as users commonly blend social and professional affiliations in self-presentation. These results underscore the importance of identity cues in understanding how news circulates on social media and suggest that self-presentation plays a critical role in shaping users’ perceived credibility and influence. By offering a scalable approach to studying identity in relation to news sharing, this research contributes to broader debates on digital journalism, political communication, and platform-based public discourse.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the business landscape in countless ways. This research examines the role of AI-generated images in business applications, an area that has received less attention relative to other business-related AI technologies. The results of three experimental studies indicate that people can tell the difference between real and AI-generated images and that the former leads to increased levels of trust. Our findings further show that in charitable settings, real (versus AI-generated) images increase donation intentions and amount through the mediating influence of trust. This empirical and conceptual evidence offers valuable insights to businesses that are considering incorporating AI-generated images.",

    "abstract": "Responding to this journal's inaugural editorial statement, this forum piece reflects on the ongoing usefulness of the concept of the digital itself. The digital as a term could be regarded to encapsulate too much of social life to be effective as an analytical point of reference. Beginning with the unstated evocations of the term, the article turns back to earlier work on digital sociology in an attempt to put this concept into context and to think about its value. It argues for embracing the digital's retro properties by reflecting on how it might be used to understand the relations between past, present and future. The article concludes by thinking about how potential issues with the term digital can be turned to the advantage of the researcher and also how a renewed agenda for research on digital society might yet be devised, especially in the pages of this new journal.",

    "abstract": "The West is suffering from ‘pessimism paralysis’ – a despair towards the digital. This stands against the contagion of hope towards new technologies among young people, most of whom live in the Global South and have fast come online due to increasingly cheap mobile phones and data plans. The digital, despite the risks of surveillance and control, offers these young people with the possibility of a little more freedom to find pleasure, leisure, and spaces for self-actualization. While fears and concerns around new technology are legitimate, they become critically meaningful when they fairly account for the full spectrum of human sentiment driven by diverse lived experiences. Pessimism is a privilege for those who can afford to live with despair. It is our moral imperative to hope as this collective belief can be harnessed to align the digital with global social flourishing.",

In light of threats to civic agency and democracy in datafied societies, this shouldentail the systematic involvement of citizens and affected communities in debates and decisions over the governance of AI to make sure those who are affected by datafication have a voice in steering its future. From community action and social movement mobilisations to deliberative and participatory models such as citizen juries, civic initiatives have played an important role in influencing the norms, principles and policies of AI and data use. AI governance thus points us to the need for democratising governance itself and exploring a democratic perspective for life in the age of AI.",

    "abstract": "This commentary responds to Taylor et al.'s proposal for global data and artificial intelligence (AI) justice principles. While the proposed data governance framework is timely and important, I offer two provocations to invite critical reflection on the limits of the data-centric approaches to governing AI and digital societies more broadly. Drawing on the findings from the ERC INFO-LEG project, first, I argue that framing digital problems primarily in terms of data risks oversimplification of such problems, which are often complex socio-technical and political affairs. Second, I caution that data governance and the ensuing uncertainties of the boundaries of included data and groups can distract from the essence of the problems at hand, facilitating evasion strategies for powerful actors, for example, by navigating technical and legal complexity to their advantage. I advocate for more context-specific approaches to governing digital societies, where data governance may be part of the solution but not the starting point.",

    "abstract": "\n            A growing body of research has examined the relationship between social media algorithms and public opinion-related issues in digital environments, focusing on specific phenomena such as disinformation, fake news, and ‘filter bubbles’. However, a comprehensive theoretical framework that captures the complex interplay of factors through which social media algorithms shape, facilitate, or obstruct public opinion formation in Western digital societies is still lacking. To address this gap, this article introduces the concept of ‘algorithmic public opinion’ to capture the role of social media algorithms in shaping public opinion both as a\n            process\n            and as a\n            product\n            . While inherently open-ended, we argue that this framework offers scholars a valuable tool for understanding the centrality of automated decision-making processes in the circulation of informational content, and its interaction with diverse actors who play a decisive role in determining which issues of public interest gain salience and which news sources and interpretations are selected and amplified.\n          ",

    "abstract": "Through their focus on counter-practices, Borbach and Kanderske offer valuable methodological inspirations for research on sensor media. Above and beyond a praxeology of subversive action, their suggestions carry a number of additional media-ecological implications that revolve around the incommensurability of sensory affordances in-between human and technological actors in sensor-saturated environments. Who's to say which perceptual topologies are navigated by the numerous semi-autonomous technological actors and sensing devices sharing the same physical space with humans? And, more politically relevant, which ways of perceiving might humans already be exposed to without their awareness? A situated account of counter-practices could thus usefully be extended toward a form of interface critique that can help to surface asymmetries of perception in co-habited media ecologies and support to exploit them toward political-activist aims.",

Datta and Hoefsloot propose the concept of the state as auteur to underscore the significance of time and the imperative of timing as a performative, strategic, anticipatory, and symbolic practice of the state to project, direct, execute, accelerate, and synchronise circulating technological ideals. In this commentary, I introduce three attributes – time essence, time thicket, and time passage – to further emphasise the centrality of time and timing for the auteurist state in the digital age. Finally, I interrogate what the state as auteur framework might overlook, particularly given that Southern digital futures emerge through multiple open-ended and incomplete essences, thickets, and passages of time.",

    "title": "The work that digital standardization does (or not): Exploring tensions between urban land practices and statecraft",
    "abstract": "Digitization of land records in Kenya represents a particular moment in smart city strategies to enable rationalization and standardization. In many ways, it represents a linear, technology-driven approach, very much informed by the tenets of modernization theory. The embedded assumption here, that socio-cultural practices and emotional ties around land can be eclipsed by the intended certainty and linear rationality represented by digitation, is misguided. The paper explores two dimensions of these tensions. One, literature on land in Kenya, foregrounds the role of the state as power broker in land exchanges, often to the detriment of the urban poor. Thus, the role of the state is never politically neutral. Two, land is infused with divergent interest groups and actors, that range from customary authorities, informal occupational structures, to private development speculators. The paper concludes on why it is important to explore the tensions that emerge when considering statecraft in multiple regimes.",

    "abstract": "The race by governments and industry to exploit the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) raises concerns over prioritizing economic gains over community-based rights. This heightens the urgency of efforts to develop a justice-based framework for AI governance. Despite the European Union's AI Act, international AI governance remains fragmented, particularly as the U.S. pivots toward an innovation-first approach. Principles of data justice and data governance offer a solid foundation on which to build a framework for equitable AI governance, particularly as broader human rights principles become more fragmented and contested.",

    "abstract": "If we are to understand our contemporary sensor media ecology, it is worthwhile to move beyond “theorizing media as practice” (Couldry). In contrast to mere usage practices, counter-practices productively exploit the flaws of sensing infrastructures. Counter-practices are minor and momentary, yet epistemically significant, as they render visible the logics of machinic perception. This author response argues that research on counter-practices is able to operate on various scales and that counter-practices are intrinsically political actions which allow the queering of the binary logics and normative “data-worldings” of today’s technologies. Conceptualizing bodies not as data sources but as agents capable of defending themselves against nonconsensual sensing, our approach shifts the analytical focus from supposedly disembodied computation to an integrated view of digital sensing as an embodied process. Altogether, studying counter-practices enables politically engaged media research that is attentive to how resistance and critique are enacted through the body in environments of pervasive datafication.",

    "abstract": "In translating data governance for the AI era, Taylor et al. have put forward a set of ambitious and considered benchmarks that can serve as an important vision for data justice. However, in doing so, we are also confronted with the challenges of the current ‘AI moment’. The open consolidation of powerful interests seeking to advance AI's unfettered development has also marginalised governance agendas, especially those seeking to assert publicness and avenues for resistance and refusal. In this sense, asserting benchmarks for just data governance can only garner real meaning if such benchmarks can account for the broader politics of the current AI moment and connect to the political mobilisation around data justice that might now be possible.",

    "abstract": " The field of data justice has been evolving to take into account the role of data in powering the field of artificial intelligence (AI). In this paper we review the main conceptual bases for governing data and AI: the market-based approach, the personal–non-personal data distinction and strategic sovereignty. We then analyse how these are being operationalised into practical models for governance, including public data trusts, data cooperatives, personal data sovereignty, data collaboratives, data commons approaches and indigenous data sovereignty. We interrogate these models' potential for just governance based on four benchmarks which we propose as a reformulation of the Data Justice governance agenda identified by Taylor in her 2017 framework. Re-situating data justice at the intersection of data and AI, these benchmarks focus on preserving and strengthening public infrastructures and public goods; inclusiveness; contestability and accountability; and global responsibility. We demonstrate how they can be used to test whether a governance approach will succeed in redistributing power, engaging with public concerns and creating a plural politics of AI. ",

    "title": "Rehabilitating planetary breathing in times of algorithmic extraction: Notes from the text by Minna Ruckenstein",
    "abstract": "This article discusses Minna Ruckenstein's notion of breathing spaces as a critical perspective for rethinking digital futures beyond techno-solutionism. In a context where algorithmic architectures and data extraction increasingly shape behaviours, decisions, and imaginaries, Ruckenstein invites the social sciences and humanities to proactively engage in the design and governance of digital technologies. I analyse three key ideas from her work: breathing, critical making, and the re-humanisation of technologies, while also proposing the need to expand these concepts toward a planetary perspective. I argue that breathing is not merely an aesthetic metaphor, but can become a practice of resistance that connects the digital with the planetary. This implies recognising the material entanglement of the digital with specific territories and its deep interdependence with the living beings that shape our environments.",

    "abstract": "The relentless push for universal digitization driven by market forces mirrors historical patterns of spiritual and linguistic colonization. It is imperative to safeguard the right to exist beyond the dictates of top-down digitization efforts. Embracing diverse approaches to digitization, shaped by communities rather than imposed by nation-states or corporations, is essential for addressing the planetary crisis. This commentary argues that communities in the majority world should have the autonomy to determine their political, economic, technological, and cultural pathways, ensuring their right to self-determination. The argument is structured by first reflecting on the widespread processes of universal digitization and their historical context. It then addresses the imperative of community-led digitization, exploring various technological alternatives that are more inclusive and representative of local needs and values. Finally, it discusses the potential negative implications of not adopting these alternative technological models, including the perpetuation of inequalities, loss of cultural identity, and further environmental degradation. By advocating for a decentralized and community-focused approach to digitization, this commentary highlights the importance of preserving diversity and promoting sustainable development in the digital age.",

    "abstract": "In the face of rapid technological development, this text asks whether we can take a moment to pause and reflect on where we are heading. Inspired by Minna Ruckenstein's original article, two initiatives are explored: a global petition to stop the development of advanced AI and a national campaign to restrict smartphone use in schools. While the first had little impact, the second gained a lot of public attention as it brought together scientists, experts, educators, families, schools, etc. The article argues that social scientists should go beyond criticism and help find better solutions by bringing together different initiatives. It calls for a more thoughtful use of technology, where people are not just users, but active participants in shaping a more balanced and people-centered future.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the limitations of sensor datafication by examining the distinction between “thick” and “thin” description. While sensors excel at capturing “thin” data - characterized in traditional ethnography as raw, observable behaviors akin to what a camera records - they struggle with “thick” description, the interpretation of intentions, meanings, and cultural context. Responding to Borbach and Kanderske's work on surveillance counter-practices, the paper questions the extent to which sensors can discern between accidental glitches and deliberate subversion. The paper concludes by considering the implications of emphasizing intentionality in resistance, suggesting that while such practices are crucial, they may ultimately contribute to the refinement of sensor accuracy and power and limit how surveillance scholars conceptualize surveillance subterfuge.",

As a cinematic auteur, they argue, the state times and sequences the asynchronous moments of its action. Building on this insight, the following commentary adds a vectoral dimension to the relationship between time and statecraft: acceleration, or, as physicists would define it, a directional rate of change in speed. Yet acceleration is more than an analytical metaphor: as we argue, it has been a collective grammar through which the Kenyan state itself has been given effect and sense through hastened infrastructural projects in the transition from autocracy and immobility to democracy and (digital) development.\n          ",

Society and social structures are being reconfigured through algorithmic techniques, resulting in losses and gains that might be difficult to predict.

This brief forum article explores how research and teaching in many regions are being ‘platformised’ by a combination of academic publishers, the edtech industry, and Big Tech firms. Together, these processes of platformising research and teaching are integrating universities into complex digital infrastructures for many of their central operations. Universities are being re-infrastructured. They are also being ‘assetised’ as control of platforms and infrastructures allows their proprietors to extract value from the HE sector. These developments call for concerted dialogue on the conditions and prospects of academic labour in the digital university, and close attention to how emerging technological devices and systems are integrated into, challenged or transformed by scientific and pedagogic practice.",

This commentary emphasises the necessity for alignment between researchers’ interests and collaborators’ goals, as well as the importance of strategic timing in collaborative projects. By addressing these challenges, the commentary builds on Ruckenstein's framework, offering practical considerations in choosing collaborative projects which enable meaningful interventions. ",

    "abstract": "In this commentary, I argue that while the digitalizing state mobilizes the anticipatory imaginary of network time, its own temporal ontology remains anchored in the modern construction of “homogeneous and empty time.” Acknowledging the generative insights Datta and Hoefsloot's analysis of temporal statecraft offers, I consider how their analytic use of timing might inform a wider reading of the spatial history of the digitalizing state but raise questions about the limits of framing the state as an auteur.",

    "abstract": "Kenya is in the midst of an information revolution and has recently unveiled a set of digitisation initiatives to become the Silicon Savannah of East Africa. While the African state is often examined through the notion of absence or failure, we argue that we need to pay more attention to timing as a mode of statecraft in a digital era. Drawing upon a Deleuzian conceptualisation of ‘time-images', we argue that the Kenyan state operates as an ‘auteur’ to give meaning and significance to a seemingly asynchronous set of disconnected digitisation initiatives across spaces, scales and institutions. Timing as a form of state power determines which initiatives are prioritised, what gets executed, in what sequence and at what pace. As an auteur, the state presents a linear narrative from the past to the future, but in the end, as with all auteurs, the state's identity and authority are defined in part through the actions of its actors and the experience of citizens.",

    "abstract": "TikTok's short video culture confirms the idea of algorithmic cosmopolitanism (Elkins, 2019). It involves the algorithmic promotion of local identities and place-making practices as a symbolic representation of multi-culturalism, which nonetheless is also constrained by its “flattened, one-dimensional, and consumerist approach” (Elkins, 2019: 385). At the same time, the impending TikTok ban in the US seems to suggest the rise of platform nationalism as an emerging approach to platform governance (Craig et al., 2021). This paradox between algorithmic cosmopolitanism and platform nationalism demonstrates the political nature of today's digitalization and its promised transformation of society. It raises a renewed question about how technological practices and imaginations are prone to state and economic power. In the complex entanglement between the technical and the political, we must first of all be wary of any simplistic discourses of politicization and governance.",

Using examples ranging from the exhibition of John Clark's Latin Verse Machine in 1845 through generative poetry in the early 1950s to today's generative AI, the authors argue that aesthetic innovation precedes and is necessary to technological advances.",

They invoke new questions around the power of the state in directing action towards acceleration, performance, untimeliness, time essences, thickets and passages, and creativity. In this response piece, we develop our contention that the state in a digital era needs to be reconceptualised through timing as a form of statecraft. We will suggest first that while the state is not a coherent entity, it is in its temporality across spaces, scales, and actors that we begin to see its performative nature as auteur. Second, we address the question of untimeliness in our paper as an inherent aspect of temporal power itself. Finally, we address the provocation to expand our work on the creative uses of temporality from the margins.",

Based on in-depth interviews with immigration alarmists, this article discusses how the participants’ anti-immigration position is sanctioned in their everyday social networks and how they find alternative networks online for information, community, and support. This online community takes the form of an emerging counterpublic, characterized by active curation and different levels of participation aimed at optimizing the trade-offs between gaining visibility (moderation and mobilization) and creating an alternative moral community (a “safe space” for peers). Combining notions of interpretative communities of resistance with the theory of counterpublics, the study provides insight into the internal life and values of emerging anti-immigration online communities.

Against the backdrop of social changes influencing family roles, a new father–child relationship characterised by presence and active involvement in a child’s life has recently transpired. As the fathers’ role in minority language transmission has not been given much prominence in research, this article offers novel insights into how Polish fathers endeavour to maintain Polish through digitally mediated communication. Research on digital practices in the context of code-switching (CS) has been scant, despite the fact that everyday reality of transnational multilingual families has been permeated by technology. With this article, I aim to touch upon the themes situated at the intersection of transnationalism, family multilingualism, language transmission, as well as new media and their role in contemporary communication practices. Six excerpts containing examples of CS practices among three different families, where instant messaging via Messenger has been adopted to maintain Polish will be scrutinised. ",

    "title": "Imagining permanence on the web: Tracing the meanings of long-term preservation among the subjects of web archives",
    "abstract": " This article explores how web archiving impacts the online communication practices of individuals whose personal websites have been archived by major public libraries. Drawing on interviews with website creators and analysis of their written reflections on the archiving process, it demonstrates how web archiving alters the meanings people attach to their online activity. In most cases, the preservation of their website in a national web archive sees individuals perceive their communication practices as having wider cultural and historical significance. These meanings are shaped by the distinctive interaction between archiving and archived actors and propelled by imaginaries surrounding the culture and history of the collecting institution. Based on these findings, this article argues that web archiving can be productively understood as an intervention in the dynamics of online sociality and calls for reflexive archival and research practices that attend to the short- and long-term impacts of altering the visibility of online material.

    "title": "(Re)animating the ancestors: Digital personality emulations, ancestor veneration and ethics",
    "abstract": " Veneration of paternal ancestors plays an important role in Chinese tradition. In this article, we offer some speculations about how a new ‘thanatechnology’ – digital personality emulation – may impact on ancestor worship. We explore the ethical issues raised by the use of personality emulations for this purpose, drawing on Confucian, Daoist and contemporary Anglo-American perspectives. For Confucians, the key questions concern the extent to which this technology automates the task of remembering and whether it is corrosive of filial piety. Daoists might be critical of personality emulations owing to a larger disagreement with Confucians about the role of ritual in a good human life. Finally, recent discussions in the Anglo-American literature suggest that the use of this technology would raise questions about the consent of the deceased to emulation, the privacy of users, the danger that users will be manipulated by the designers and/or manufacturers of emulations, and the impact of emulations on the grieving process.

    "abstract": " Rankings are a well-established genre for evaluating diverse phenomena, yet culturally resonant critiques of them are relatively rare. This paper examines how student vloggers on YouTube challenge and reinterpret university rankings through ‘tier list’ and ‘reaction’ videos, thereby shifting genre expectations. Through a move analysis of 30 such videos, we identify 3 rhetorical actions – making sense of ranking, audience interpellation and subverting the ranking genre – and discuss how the ranking’s remediation simultaneously rejects and reinforces hierarchy as the social form underlying it. This results in often humorous critiques where vloggers challenge ‘objective’ cardinal assumptions and posit rank as collaboratively constructed. Remediation in social media has the potential to not only make visible genre work performed by the genre’s discursive community, but in doing so also reconfigures the rhetorical premises that characterise the ranking genre in the first place.

    "abstract": " There are about 13 million visually disabled people in China, among which more than 8 million are blind. As an information-vulnerable group, they have unequal access to digital media. In this context, this study, by applying domestication theory, analyzes the use of digital media by the visually impaired in China based on 40 deep interviews and finds out that digital media, as a necessary opportunity, can indeed create more possibilities for increasing the social participation and improving the daily life of the visually impaired. But due to systematic and personal factors, this opportunity cannot be enjoyed by all visually impaired people. Visually impaired people have a strong subjective initiative, which can weaken the impact of digital exclusion on themselves to a certain extent. But social inclusion still determines the effect of digital inclusion, which needs to be taken seriously. ",

    "abstract": " This article examines how social media creators in the United Kingdom navigate regional labor dynamics in small urban cities and towns and their perceptions of potential resistance strategies. Grounded in a creator workers’ inquiry and thematic analysis of in-depth interviews with creators ( N  = 53), it expands the notion of peripheral creator labor. It reveals how digital factors and historically entrenched regional disparities exacerbate the global platform precarity experienced by different types of peripheral creators and the relative privilege of peripheral English-language Western-based creators. The study introduces the concepts of regional monetization precarity and localized production space and networking precarity to capture the unique challenges creators face in small urban cities and their shared strategic resistance strategies to effect change, combining professional support and unionization. This study contributes to theoretical understandings of creator labor by challenging a binary notion of “center-periphery” relations and a homogeneous Western user experience in creator economies. ",

    "abstract": " The public sphere has become increasingly digitalized and transformed by the intermeshing of social media platforms and mobile devices cultivating reimagined selves. The negative impact of living in a deeply mediatized world has fostered a phenomenon both in the public mind and academic discourse known as “fear of missing out” or by its acronym FoMO. Historically, and consistent with the “media effects” tradition, hundreds of studies have highlighted the psychological and behavioral dimensions of this construct, noting its negative effects. In opposition to the “effects” paradigmatic studies, we utilize social constructionist mediatization theory and Q methodology as frameworks for audience research that foreground subjectivity and understandings concerning the mediations of FoMO as a sociocultural construct. A total of 37 millennials and post-millennials Q sorted 55 statements resulting in three selfhood factors. Both dominant and counter “hegemonic” accounts were uncovered in the factors, respectively, identified as envy/exclusion, grounded vigilance, and managed vulnerability. ",

    "abstract": " This article investigates – based on semi-structured interviews and conversations on cryptoart forums – how digital artists experience the blockchain-enabled assetization of their work through non-fungible tokens, including the transformation of digital artworks (which previously had negligible if any economic value) into assets capable of increasing in price value over time and generating future income from resale provisions. We show how this assetization of digital artworks has kindled artists’ financialized imagination and incentivized them to perform speculative labour – that is, to speculate on the potential capture of future financial proceeds from present-day underpaid or uncompensated activities, while mobilizing fictional expectations of imagined rentiership futures. We suggest that the commodification thesis, which has traditionally explained the future orientation of creative work as tied to commodity exchange, may be insufficient to account for artists’ speculative, asset-based imaginations of the future under financialized capitalism. Therefore, it may be beneficial to complement it with an assetization lens. ",

This research explores these questions via a 3 (modality: contemporary internet meme vs text-only vs text-with-explanation) × 2 (identity-congruence: congruent vs incongruent) between-subject online experiment, using two contexts of investigation (crime and taxes). Findings indicate that identity-congruent posts (vs incongruent), regardless of modality, were perceived as more credible. These effects occurred due to the invocation of the self-identity heuristic (if content is similar to my identity, then it is automatically credible) and the other-identity heuristic (if content is similar to the identity of others in my network, then it is automatically credible). However, the effects of identity-congruent posts were diminished when the content was presented as a contemporary Internet meme (vs text). This occurred because identity-congruent posts in meme modality evoke anger. ",

Using data from the 2020 German Ageing Survey short survey ( N = 2243), we examined the links between self-rated health (SRH, independent variable) and four Internet use purposes (dependent variables) that might have been particularly relevant for older adults with health limitations during the pandemic: online information search, maintaining social contacts, religious purposes, and consultations with doctors or therapists. Multivariate regression analyses revealed that older adults with poor SRH were more likely than those with good SRH to use the Internet for online consultations with doctors or therapists, whereas they were less likely to use the Internet to search for information and to maintain social contacts at least once per week. This hints to health-related inequalities in Internet use which merit further investigation. ",

    "abstract": " As artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled social robots continue to enter our lifeworlds, we will need to grapple with challenges to assumptions about our relationship to and even with these technological objects. This essay works at the intersection of social robotics, legal studies, and human–machine communication to explore the concept of ownership in human–machine relations. In particular, we draw on more-than-human approaches to ask: To what extent should (need) we retire the concept of ownership in the context of AI-enabled social robots? With a particular emphasis on companion robots, we explore alternatives to the ownership modality by investigating concepts such as personhood, a degrees-of-relationship perspective, and a situational approach to understanding human–robot relationships. The goal is to re-imagine human–robot relationships beyond legal confinements by engaging a pragmatic perspective that supplements existing philosophical approaches. We conclude the paper by discussing practical implications of our proposed perspective. ",

    "abstract": " Domestic workers have long been marginalized, even as they are made hypervisible to their employers. This is a process increasingly augmented by digital technologies. These technologies include care platforms, which have increasingly mediated the process of finding employment. This article reports on interviews with in-home childcare workers or “nannies” who shared experiences of scrutiny and surveillance across the labor process, both on and off the platform. This includes background checks, in-person monitoring, hidden cameras, and more. Although these practices might be legitimized as an extension of parental care or benign monitoring, workers’ negative afffects—fear, worry, anger—disrupt this normalization. Their stories make visible harm and hidden burdens from this hybridization of care and control. Through their accounts, a surveillant assemblage comes into view that intensifies uneven visibility regimes and reinstates the racialized and gendered power dynamics that have long defined domestic labor.

    "abstract": " Social media has become instrumental for older adults in maintaining social connections, which are an integral component of older adults’ well-being. However, little is known about how daily positive/negative social media emotional experiences are associated with older adults’ subjective views of aging. The current study examined daily emotional experiences related to WhatsApp groups and their association with subjective age (feeling younger/older than one’s chronological age). Data were collected from 42 Israeli older adults who confirmed daily WhatsApp usage ( Mage = 74.30, SD = 8.39). Participants reported their daily WhatsApp emotional experiences in family/other groups and daily subjective age over 14 consecutive days, resulting in 557 completed reports. Results demonstrated that on days older adults reported negative WhatsApp group emotional experiences they felt older. Positive emotional experiences were associated with feeling younger solely when these experiences were reported in relation to family WhatsApp groups. Time-lagged models further indicated that only negative (but not positive) WhatsApp emotional experiences on a given day predicted an older subjective age the following day. The results underscore the significance of daily social media emotional experiences in shaping older adults’ daily subjective age. They also indicate the presence of a negativity bias effect in social media interactions among older adults. ",

    "abstract": "This study examines how journalists are grappling with platform migration following Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitterin October 2022. Using a mixed-method approach that combines computational analysis of the activities of 861 journalists on Twitter and Mastodon with qualitative interviews of 11 active journalists, this study aims to (1) examine the extent to which journalists have exhibited different forms of Twitter disengagement post-acquisition; (2) identify the motivating and discouraging factors influencing their move, guided by the push-pull-mooring model; and (3) explore how journalists managed their online presence across platforms. The results indicated minimal Twitter non-use following Musk’s takeover, and full migration was not observed within a 6-month post-acquisition period. Factors such as the flood of fake news and the loss of the blue-tick verification served as push factors, while the appeal of Mastodon’s enhanced user control and stronger community values acted as pull factors. However, the practical reliance on Twitter’s functionalities, audience base, and professional obligations made total abandonment challenging.",

    "abstract": " This article examines the experience of microworkers living in the United Kingdom. Based on a survey of 1189 microworkers and 17 in-depth interviews, the article explores the experiences of UK-based microworkers on three digital platforms: Prolific, Clickworker and Amazon Mechanical Turk. The article draws on the theoretical framework of self-determination theory to analyse workers’ motivations for performing microwork. It reveals that workers’ relatively high satisfaction with otherwise low-paying and low-status work was possible because workers conceptualised their activity as occupying an ambiguous space and time in their lives, blurring traditional distinctions between work and leisure. These findings contribute to our understanding of how microworkers experience their relationship to work in the United Kingdom. ",

    "abstract": " This article delves into the process of technological adaptation to local environments by presenting the case of food delivery platforms in Mexico City. Primarily, it focuses on the tension between design and local economic practices. Given the primacy of cash as an object of economic exchange, platforms facilitate cash payments. Platforms then delegate the task of cash administration to couriers. Labor control around this task is then institutionalized in the form of platform features. Furthermore, platform dependency to cover basic necessities shapes divergent experiences of the delegated task of cash administration. Conceptually, this article employs the Latourian concept of delegation to explore the human and nonhuman enrollments mobilized to adapt digital technologies to local environments. ",

    "abstract": " The Indian state has invested simultaneously in connectivity by pursuing universal Internet access and in disconnectivity by leading the world in state-ordered Internet shutdowns. How can we make sense of these contradictory approaches to technology policy? This article argues that this paradox illustrates a bifurcated experience of digital citizenship moderated infrastructurally through differential access to mobile connectivity. While previous research has largely interpreted Internet shutdowns as curtailments of freedom of expression, this article evaluates the implications for citizenship itself by bringing together scholarship on digital governance, science and technology studies (STS) approaches to Internet governance, and postcolonial and decolonial theory. More broadly, this article raises the stakes for critical analysis of how authoritarian states approach Internet policy to bridge digital divides—and for evaluating quality and contingency of connectivity experienced by marginalized and peripheral communities.

Based on the research, we develop a new understanding of ‘social digital dilemmas’, situating our analysis within the rapidly changing social media environment that uses algorithmic technologies and recommendation systems to automatically feed and personalise content to users. These social digital dilemmas are negotiated within relational social networks taking into account digital skills and literacies, household rules and realms of responsibility for children’s online safety that cut across differences in gender, family structure, cultural background and children’s disability status. Based on our findings, we make conclusions about the regulatory context for children’s online safety and suggest how to develop more effective online safety policies and approaches. ",

Game spaces offer a site of trans and non-binary embodiment that can be decoupled from the physical world, yet these spaces remain embedded in structures of cisnormative hegemony. In this exploratory study, I interviewed 10 players whose gender identities do not conform to the static male-female binary that is encoded, both literally and ideologically, in games. This work centers the experiences of non-cisgender people with particular attention to the differences in how virtual environments are approached by those who wish to present within binary gender/sex categories and those who do not. I consider both the features and the constraints of the digital game environment, and their implications for non-cisgender players’ processes of gender expression and identification. ",

This article applies critical disability studies and theory of accumulation by dispossession to analyze the dynamics within China’s data labeling industry. We examine the interplay among capital, central and local governments, Disabled People’s Organizations (DPOs), and workers with disabilities in the AI data labeling value chain. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of DPOs in reallocating surplus labor and capital across spatial and temporal dimensions. By supplementing functions traditionally associated with government entities, these organizations significantly influence the industry’s landscape. Furthermore, we reveal how DPOs foster labor agency, creating spaces for work dignity among workers with disabilities. Through their efforts to navigate and mitigate algorithmic control, DPOs contribute to a more inclusive labor environment, challenging societal norms. ",

    "abstract": " Although China’s social credit system (SCS) is widely portrayed by Western media as repressive surveillance, recent studies show that it receives high levels of support among Chinese citizens. Previous research suggests that people support the SCS because they lack knowledge about the system. This study further examines the roles of media framing (Western vs Chinese framing) and monitored behaviors (financial vs social behaviors). The results from a survey experiment conducted in China ( N = 1600) demonstrate that when exposed to Western framing, public support for the SCS is lower, but only when participants are informed that the SCS monitors social behavior. By contrast, when people are told that the SCS focuses on financial behavior, Western framing exposure is not associated with low levels of public support. The findings suggest that an expansion to social domains and exposure to Western media framing will likely result in decreased support for the system. ",

    "abstract": " This study examines so-called “ironic memes,” a seemingly inscrutable genre of memetic Internet content, as meaningful digital multimodal text. Considering Internet memes’ semiotic construction patterns and their social functions, this study connects these two concerns, asking: How is the provocatively “nonsensical” design of ironic memes organized and connected to the construction of (group) identities online? Adopting a digital ethnographic approach, we employ a combination of multimodal discursive methods in order to jointly analyze semiotic design patterns and the social actions underlying them. The analysis suggests that, despite their nonsensical appearance, ironic memes rely on distinct design strategies that contribute to the construction of (group) identities rooted in digital literacies. Specifically, ironic memes constitute generic hybrids where semiotic practices are associated with personas that are “less literate” in Internet memeing. Our findings indicate that digital literacies can feature as central in the construction of superdiverse identities through digital text-making and text-sharing. ",

    "abstract": " Despite much attention for group polarization in online environments, little is known about how group membership affects online behavior. We designed an online platform where ethnic minority and majority users in the Netherlands participated in discussions about controversial topics (homosexuality and abortion). Participants were randomly assigned to either progressive, conservative, or mixed discussions on these topics, which were ostensibly held among ethnic minority or majority users. We find that when ethnic minority users are exposed to discussions among the ethnic majority (i.e., outgroup) with which they disagree, they are less likely to express their opinions and more likely to deviate from their personal opinions. Among ethnic majority users, we find the opposite: when confronted with a discussion among the ethnic minority with which they disagree, they are more likely to voice their opinion and less likely to deviate from their personal opinions. This shows that group membership can affect online polarization. ",

    "abstract": " Opponents of COVID-19 measures invoke science in curious ways: they collect data, cite scientific studies, and even conduct their own research projects. Previous research has explained these scientific appropriations as the product of motivated reasoning, the result of widespread disinformation, or a populist strategy. This study provides a further explanation by focusing on these scientific projects. Drawing from repeated interviews with a select group of 36 anti-lockdown protesters in Germany, I find that my interviewees draw on scientific repertoires in order to overcome information insecurities triggered by their discovery of online countermedia. Although the results of their scientific efforts often remain inconclusive, through the process of doing research, protesters achieve a reorientation in the information environment and begin to rely on countermedia as a source of information and political opinion. Based on these findings, I argue that protesters refer to the sciences as a conversion technique. ",

    "title": "Hate prompts participation: Examining the dynamic relationship between affective polarization and political participation",
    "abstract": " Political participation has long been considered a cornerstone of democracy. While most studies on political participation have been grounded on a normative approach, which assumes that political participation is driven by positive civic actions, recent studies suggest that political participation is also driven by negative forces such as overconfidence in knowledge and partisan communication flows. This article builds on the latter line of research by exploring the role of affective polarization on political participation. While this line of research is not new, it suffers from a lack of clear causal order. This study relies on three-wave panel data collected during the 2022 Korean presidential election. To ensure methodological rigor, we utilized both cross-lagged and fixed-effects panel analyses. Our findings show that affective polarization stimulates political participation rather than the reverse path. In addition, we did not observe a reciprocal relationship. Implications for democracy are discussed. ",

    "abstract": " Digital communication venues are essential infrastructures for anti-democratic actors to spread harmful content such as conspiracy theories. Capitalizing on platform affordances, they leverage conspiracy theories to mainstream their political views in broader public discourse. We compared the word choice, language style, and communicative function of conspiracy-related content to understand its platform-dependent differences and convergence. Our cases are the conspiracy theories of the New World Order and Great Replacement, which we analyzed on 4chan/pol/, Twitter, and seven alternative US news media longitudinally from 2011 to 2021. The conspiracy-related texts were comparatively analyzed using a multi-method approach of computational and quantitative text analyses. Our results show that conspiracy narrations are increasingly present in all venues. While language differs vastly between platforms, we observed a style convergence between Twitter and 4chan. The results show how more coded language veils the spread of racist and antisemitic content beyond the so-called dark platforms. ",

However, this condition is undermined by a contemporary landscape of online political discourse rife with incivility. Given the seemingly dismal state of American politics, a remedy to this problem is needed. We test the effects of a self-regulation intervention, mental contrasting with implementation intentions (MCII), on the expression of political incivility in a social media discussion setting. Data from two online experiments show that participants in the MCII condition expressed more civility and selected civil responses in response to uncivil communication cues.

    "abstract": " Political microtargeting practices aim at exposing social media users to political content that aligns with their preferences and interests. Hence, such exposure becomes a personal experience, dependent on individual perceptions. So far, research has rarely investigated young social media users’ personal experiences with targeted political advertising (TPA). In the present study, five qualitative focus group interviews with 20 young social media users ( Mage = 19.30, SD = 1.59) were conducted to descriptively explore young social media users’ experiences with TPA. The insights indicated little intuitive reflection about TPA and targeting disclosures on social media. Participants often based their knowledge on algorithms for commercial advertising. This awareness did not seem to translate to TPA automatically. Once aware of TPA, however, they intuitively understood its potential threats. Our insights highlight the importance of educational programs to increase adolescents’ and young adults’ TPA-related awareness. ",

    "abstract": " This article analyzes the generational politics of smartphones in the Malaysian state of Sarawak in the context of Bornean history and contemporary Sarawakian political economy. We respond to a global north bias in the standing literature on smartphone media and suggest approaches to improve representation of global south perspectives. Concretely, we propose three programmatic maxims as a methodological guide to incorporate perspectives and concerns from the global south more fully. Drawing on long-term ethnographic research in Sarawak, we demonstrate the value of these suggestions by framing smartphones in the perspective of Bornean history as tools for maintaining instrumental social networks more than exchanging information across spatial disjunction. These tools are used differently by young urbanites and older rural populations. This leads us to show how Pokémon Go refracts generational conflicts by becoming the cultural touchstone of the changing political economic conditions of Malaysian urbanization. ",

A three-wave longitudinal survey of 555 US adults was conducted in March and May 2022. The results of a cross-lagged panel model showed that interactive mediated contact predicted greater empathy and perceived threat. Subsequently, these two factors predicted positive and negative attitudes toward Ukrainian refugees, respectively. Empathy and perceived threat mediated the effect of interactive mediated contact on intergroup attitudes over time. Furthermore, intergroup attitudes predicted increased empathy and decreased perceived threat subsequently, but did not predict further interactive mediated contact on social media. This study contributes to our understanding of mediated contact in social media environment. ",

This study explores how young, highly qualified Spanish migrants in Iceland adopt social media to become embedded in Iceland and to maintain relationships in Spain, and how it affects their sense of belonging. For this aim, semi-structured interviews were held in 2017–2018 with 29 Spaniards residing in Iceland, and their personal networks were analyzed. We found that migrants who felt they belonged to both Spain and Iceland had more social relationships in Iceland and used more social media platforms to sustain their local and transnational networks compared with migrants who felt they belonged nowhere or only in Spain. Not only did they extend their repertoires with new social media, they also adapted how they used platforms to the media environment in Iceland. In this way, social media facilitated a sense of local and transnational belonging. ",

Findings from a US national survey ( N = 1003) suggest that NFM perception is positively associated with belief in COVID-19 misinformation and mediates the positive relationship between social media use and false beliefs when NFM is measured as a single-dimensional construct. However, the sub-dimensions of NFM have distinct implications: The reliance on peers and not seeking but feeling informed dimensions work in the same manner as when NFM is treated as a single-dimensional construct, whereas reliance on algorithmic news negatively predicts belief in misinformation and negatively mediates the aforementioned relationship. We also found the mediating role of exposure to misinformation in the relationship between social media use and false beliefs. Implications from these findings are discussed. ",

    "abstract": " Scholarship in the sociology of medicine has tended to characterize diagnosis as disruptive to one’s self-concept. This categorization, though, requires reconsideration in light of public conversations about mental health and community building around neurocognitive conditions, particularly among youth online. Drawing upon Tan’s notion of “biographical illumination” (BI), which describes how medical frameworks can enrich personal biographies, we explored the shifting nature of BI through the case of TikTok. Combining quantitative and qualitative methods, we argue that TikTok serves as a space to discuss diagnosis and refine one’s sense of self as a result of diagnosis. However, such personal transformation is inseparable from the app’s affordances, or what we term “algorithmically mediated biographical illumination.” BI shapes TikTok as a platform, and TikTok informs BI as a psychosocial process, leading to what we call “platformed diagnosis.” These findings have broader critical applications for the study of algorithms, disability, and digital platforms.

Our research uncovered four key themes to this spiritualized conceptualization of algorithmically controlled visibility: (1) Algorithm as directed by the hand of God, (2) Context collapse as an evangelism opportunity, (3) Boosting visibility as a spiritual obligation, and (4) Invisibility as persecution. Following our analysis, we develop an understanding of the “spiritual algorithmic imaginary,” building on Bucher’s concept of the “algorithmic imaginary.” Functioning as both a networked performance and an affective framework, the concept of the spiritual algorithmic imaginary theorizes how certain spiritual users sacralize their participation in and understanding of digital platforms.

    "title": "Algorithm dependency in platformized news use",
    "abstract": " Previous research has highlighted the ambiguous experience of algorithmic news curation whereby people are simultaneously comfortable with algorithms, but also concerned about the underlying data collection practices. The present article builds on media dependency theory and news-finds-me (NFM) perceptions to explore this tension. Empirically, we analyze original survey data from six European countries (Germany, Sweden, France, Greece, Poland, and Italy, n = 2,899) to investigate how young Europeans’ privacy concerns and attitudes toward algorithms affect NFM. We find that a more positive attitude toward algorithms and more privacy concerns are related to stronger NFM. The study highlights power asymmetries in platformized news use and suggests that the ambivalent experiences might be a result of algorithm dependency, whereby individuals rely on algorithms in platformized news use to meet their information needs, despite accompanying risks and concerns.

    "abstract": " Contributing to the study of curated news flows, we investigated how conflicting participants in an issue public fed mainstream news into their Twitter networks. In a quasi-experimental field study in the context of the 2018 European Court of Justice’s ruling on genome editing, we combined standardized manual content analyses of a universe of legacy media news items ( N = 165), users’ tweets (“feeds”) linking these news items ( N = 2014), and users’ profiles ( N = 1070). Confirming existing knowledge, opponents and proponents of genetically modified organisms largely fed news items confirming their issue attitudes. Extending existing knowledge, we show that counter-attitudinal news feeding became more likely when users had a political disadvantage rather than a political advantage in the controversy. However, this was only true for the more active but not for the more inactive news feeders. ",

Using qualitative mixed methods, including interviews with 38 Blackfeet community members, the study provides a brief overview of the Siyeh Corporation’s Internet services in Blackfeet territory and presents a thematic analysis of interview data focused on three issues: the Internet as a daily lifeline; peoples’ ideals and standards of sovereignty; and tensions around network sovereignty. The article explores how Blackfeet community members assess their tribe’s moves to assert network sovereignty, presenting a range of opinions regarding tribally owned and operated Internet services. Building from interview data, the article suggests that practices and perceptions of local tribal governance are vital to mounting and sustaining meaningful network sovereignty initiatives. ",

    "abstract": " The gig economy has been explored recently in the media through videos, films, and series. Similarly, different video games have shown the ideology, values, and mechanisms that govern the gig economy. This article applies six mechanisms of algorithmic control at work to achieve a dual objective: to analyze how platform workers experience algorithmic control and to examine the extent to which video games, as a medium for raising critical awareness, reflect these workers’ experiences. We analyzed interviews with 42 platform workers in different sectors and six video games that address this topic. Our findings reveal that these games consistently mirror the dynamics and experiences arising from platform control. Furthermore, through specific elements of their meaningfulness (such as narrative, rules systems, and mechanics, among others), video games simulate situations and processes, sometimes opaque to workers, portraying the reality of the gig economy more explicitly and transparently.

    "abstract": " Fostering skepticism has been seen as key to addressing misinformation on social media. This article reveals that not all skepticism is “healthy” skepticism by theorizing, measuring, and testing the effects of two types of skepticism toward social media misinformation: accuracy- and identity-motivated skepticism. A two-wave panel survey experiment shows that when people’s skepticism toward social media misinformation is driven by accuracy motivations, they are less likely to believe in congruent misinformation later encountered. They also consume more mainstream media, which in turn reinforces accuracy-motivated skepticism. In contrast, when skepticism toward social media misinformation is driven by identity motivations, people not only fall for congruent misinformation later encountered, but also disregard platform interventions that flag a post as false. Moreover, they are more likely to see social media misinformation as favoring opponents and intentionally avoid news on social media, both of which form a vicious cycle of fueling more identity-motivated skepticism.

    "abstract": " Paralympic athletes are increasingly using social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok to self-represent and engage audiences in disability counter narratives that resist dominant disability stereotypes. This is particularly the case at the intersection of gender and sexuality where social media is being harnessed to visibly reclaim gendered and sexualised disabled identities in new and diverse ways. In this article, we advance scholarship on female Paralympic athletes’ self-representational practices through an intersectional visual media analysis of the most popular female British Paralympic athlete Instagram pages. We capture a particular trend in Paralympic athletes’ self-representational practices, termed cripvertising, that intersects with gendered heteronormative scripts centred on neoliberal ableism, kinship normativity and consumption (‘branding’) capabilities. We discuss the contradictions and complexities of Paralympians self-representations and their role in relation to the subversive, pedagogical and emancipatory potential for shaping new disability media narratives, disabled (online) normativity and representational politics.

Drawing on an analysis of the qualities of children’s free play across time and cultures, a nationally representative survey of UK 6- to 17-year olds compared their experiences of play across digital and non-digital contexts to identify design features that enhance or undermine children’s digital play and propose evidence-based recommendations for digital products and services likely to be used by children. Children viewed digital play more critically than non-digital play although both were judged poorly on key qualities of ‘intrinsically motivated’, ‘voluntary’, ‘risk-taking’ and ‘safety’. Logistical regression analysis shows that rights-respecting design features contribute to children’s enjoyment of digital play more than premium or freemium designs do, thus supporting Playful by Design recommendations that can benefit children.

    "abstract": " In the past 10 years, live-streaming services have gained huge popularity. Streamers usually play video games and complement their performance with commentary. We examine the role of this streamer commentary on state aggression in Czech adolescents who were randomly assigned into one of the three experimental groups (i.e. aggressive commentary, non-aggressive commentary, no commentary). The findings suggest that a short-term streamer’s commentary has no effect on affective and cognitive state aggression. In addition, the experimental conditions did not moderate any effects of personal traits (i.e. aggression, empathy) and long-term environmental factors (i.e. exposure to violence, watching violent streams, playing violent video games) on state aggression. We found that trait aggression, trait affective empathy and long-term exposure to violence were positively associated with state aggression, whereas trait sympathy was negatively associated with state aggression. The findings enrich the research with evidence for the lack of influence of streamer commentary on viewer aggression. ",

    "abstract": " Although the Reddit-led short squeeze of GameStop shares in 2021 drew comparisons with Occupy Wall Street, this article focuses on one key area of difference: where Occupy exemplified the theoretical model of connective action through its discursive and technological openness, mobilisation around the short squeeze followed a different pattern characterised by discursive and technological disconnections, which we argue partly reflects the intervening decade of platformisation. Our case shows how platforms can establish boundaries as well as brokerage points in contentious politics, with particular regard to repertoires of action, collective identities and discourses. We show how in our case, these boundaries impeded discursive and technological connections, instead organising users into relatively disconnected zones and ultimately reducing their power and impact over broader discursive systems. Our argument is explored using three data sets from Reddit, Twitter and legacy news media outlets, using a combination of non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) topic modelling and manual content analysis.

The study shows increasing instances of hate speech occurring online, primarily against Muslims, with topic modeling uncovering 32 topics for Muslims and 41 for the LGBTQ+ community, featuring themes of violence, cultural conflict, and challenges to traditional values. The LGBTQ+ community is depicted as undermining traditional norms, whereas Muslims are presented with hostility. The research underscores the necessity for digital platforms to employ nuanced strategies to counter hate speech, advocating for policies that tackle hate speech while also addressing the underlying factors and enhancing understanding of the social and cultural contexts of the targeted groups to refine detection accuracy.

Discussed are the harms that these researchers face in the course of their work, including trolling, doxing, and mental and emotional trauma arising from exposure to terrorist content, which highlight the need for an emphasis on researcher welfare. We find that researcher welfare is a neglected aspect of ethics review processes however, with most interviewees not required to gain ethics approval for their research resulting in very little attention to researcher welfare issues. Interviewees were frustrated with ethics processes, indicating that committees oftentimes lacked the requisite knowledge to make informed ethical decisions. Highlighted by interviewees too was a concern that greater emphasis on researcher welfare could result in blockages to their ‘risky’ research, creating a ‘Catch 22’: interviewees would like more emphasis on their (and colleagues’) welfare and provision of concomitant supports, but feel that increased oversight would make gaining ethics approval for their research more difficult, or even impossible. We offer suggestions for breaking the impasse, including more interactions between ethics committees and researchers; development of tailored guidelines; and more case studies reflecting on ethics processes.

    "abstract": " Our article delves into the emergence of ‘kidfluencers’ within the content creator economy, highlighting how children’s participation intertwines their identities with monetisation strategies on platforms. Focusing on TikTok, we blend ethnographic and legal analysis of 215 videos from 23 kidfluencers in Israel, New Zealand and the Unites States, illuminating the complexities of monetising childhood across cultures. We highlight four monetisation and visibility practices in which children are exposed, mobilised and commodified in their parents’ content: (1) kids as props; brands as playmates, (2) transactional childhood, (3) aspirational child-ification and (4) regulative parenthood. Our analysis shows how children become concealed commodities, with varying degrees of (in)visibility in monetisation practices, from playful participation in branded content to embodying idealised notions of childhood for brand visibility. We situate our analysis within regulatory frameworks, revealing how TikTok’s policies conceal children’s role in monetised content, and reflect on platform liability under the European Union’s Digital Services Act.

    "abstract": " Research on user experiences with datafication, the transformation of social life into data, identifies “digital resignation” and “privacy cynicism” as rational responses to feeling overwhelmed and disempowered. But how, exactly, do shared feelings and emotions mediate relationships between datafication and disengaged responses – both individually and institutionally? We develop a relational analysis of datafication, deploying an infrastructural perspective and drawing on affect theory to develop the concept of data disaffection, which we define as the structural cultivation of accepting data accumulation as inevitable. Data disaffection is a structure of feeling that conditions processes across scales of analysis: it manifests in resignation and cynicism on an individual level while simultaneously structuring commercial practices. We illustrate how data disaffection highlights alternative sites and methods for understanding datafication, and we conclude by discussing the implications for understanding datafication as a cultural dynamic as well as a corporate practice.

    "abstract": " This article adopts a feminist relational orientation to investigate the care practices that women develop when producing and engaging with body-focussed content online. We propose and argue for an embodied ethics of social media use to understand women’s enactments and exchanges as they relate to shared corporeal concerns. Drawing on qualitative interview data, and using Judith Butler’s understanding of corporeal vulnerability as the basis for mutual recognition, this article investigates social actors’ ethical orientations towards, and attempts at, improving the collective experiences of women in the context of Instagram use for physical activity. We identify several ways in which exercising women practice an embodied ethics of care on Instagram, including sharing unedited images of themselves, not judging others’ bodies, awareness-raising and supporting others. By conceptualising women’s everyday social media encounters as an embodied ethical practice, this study develops new theoretical insights to understand women’s sharing of body-focussed content online.

    "abstract": " The article provides an argument that the platform is the site of Burawoy’s workplace games. The game observed on the platform used a pattern quite similar to one diagnosed by Burawoy, successfully employing coercion and consent to control the workforce. Control on the platform has a general nature which combines technological, organisational and normative aspects. Work on the app is coordinated by adopting a co-optation strategy, reducing conflicts by enabling mobility, and remuneration from the platform is based on a piece-rate system. Yet, the modern game, labelled in the paper as Ride-Pass, is different from the one described by Burawoy. Due the game is taking place in the service sector, the article argues that it is structured around two mutually connected stakes: working time and self-recognition. The article contributes to the Labour Process Theory, supporting its conclusions with a long-lasting study among Polish platform workers (53 interviews with Uber’s drivers). ",

    "abstract": " As primary carers of children, mothers provide a central role in mediating and negotiating children’s digital media use in the home. In parental mediation research, this work is often reported with a gender-neutral tone, implying both parents play an equal role. This study challenges this bias by unmasking the mediation practices and experiences of mothers. Qualitative interviews revealed mediation is bound by maternal desires to protect, guide and educate children in their media use. The intensity of this care role, often conducted in parallel with other unpaid and paid work, also leads mothers to deploy self-satisfying strategies that facilitate repose. The study illustrates how the gendered role and experience of mothering influences the mediation strategies mothers’ use and argues for broader recognition of these nuanced practices in parental mediation research. It also discusses the implications and impact of parental mediation on the unpaid digital care work of mothers. ",

Despite research indicating the prevalence of humorous hate speech, how audiences perceive and process the combination of humor (e.g. irony as a humor cue) and hate speech (e.g. dehumanization as a hate cue) remains unclear. Using a sequential mixed-methods approach combining a qualitative think-aloud study (Study 1, N = 41) with an experiment involving implicit measurements of response times (Study 2, N = 65), it was examined how individuals perceive memes that contain both humor and hate cues. While think-aloud interviews indicated that processing humorous hate speech may require multiple steps, the relative time spent by participants in Study 2 to rate humorous and non-humorous hate speech as being hostile or not did not entirely support that conclusion. However, findings imply that hostile views may become more commonplace when hate speech is masked by humor. ",

    "abstract": " Personal messaging platforms are hugely popular and often implicated in the spread of misinformation. We explore an unexamined practice on them: when users create “group rules” to prevent misinformation entering everyday interactions. Our data are a subset of in-depth interviews with 33 participants in a larger program of longitudinal qualitative fieldwork ( N = 102) we conducted over 16 months. Participants could also donate examples of misinformation via our customized smartphone application. We find that some participants created group rules to mitigate what they saw as messaging’s harmful affordances. In the context of personalized trust relationships, these affordances were perceived as making it likely that misinformation would harm social ties. Rules reduce the vulnerability and can stimulate metacommunication that, over time, fosters norms of collective reflection and epistemic vigilance, although the impact differs subtly according to group size and membership. Subject to further exploration, group rulemaking could reduce the spread of online misinformation. ",

    "abstract": " We investigate in this article how repository platforms change the sharing and preservation of digital objects in academic libraries. We use evidence drawn from semi-structured interviews with 31 data repository managers working at 21 universities using the product Figshare for institutions. We first show that repository managers use this platform to bring together actors, technologies, and processes usually scattered across the library to assign to them the tasks that they value less—such as data preparation or IT maintenance—and spend more time engaging in activities they appreciate—such as raising awareness of data sharing. While this platformization of data management improves their job satisfaction, we reveal how it simultaneously accentuates the outsourcing of libraries’ core mission to private actors. We eventually discuss how this platformization can deskill librarians and perpetuate precarity politics in university libraries. ",

    "abstract": " In this article, we explore the experiences of commercial content creators who have their content (videos, photos, and images) misused. This article reports from a mixed-methods study consisting of 16 interviews with content creators; nine interviews with practitioners who support sex workers and interviews with seven adult service website (ASW) operators. These qualitative data are supported by 221 responses to a survey from the content creators’ community. We describe how content creators experience blackmail, threats of exposure and recording without knowledge, stalking, harassment, doxing, ‘deepfakes’ and impersonation. We conclude that the online sex work environment may not be as safe as previous research has demonstrated, and that commercial content creators are often ignored by governance and platforms following sex workers’ complaints regarding their content being misused. We reflect on the forthcoming UK Online Safety Bill as compared to the US Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act/Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (SESTA/FOSTA) law which have seen implications across the globe for digital sex workers. We offer solutions for ASWs to act more responsibly. ",

    "abstract": " With 600 million daily users in 2020, Douyin faced monetization challenges after increased advertising led to a decline in user engagement. The app pivoted successfully to “shoppable videos” and livestream shopping by operating as a retail infrastructure. This article analyzes this transformation, arguing that Douyin strategically limits data availability, creating an artificial scarcity for capturing advertising and infrastructural rents. This approach is sustained by Douyin’s carefully crafted vision for career and business success derived from data’s speculative value. The app established reciprocal relationships with music creators and later video creators and sellers through reward programs, contractual deals, and online workshops. However, success often remains unattainable due to the uneven growth between continuous influx of creators/sellers and stalled user growth. This disparity allows Douyin to incorporate paid traffic into its business model, perpetuating data’s manufactured scarcity and obscuring exploitative practices by making paid traffic an essential component for success.

    "abstract": " Comment sections below news posts on social media pages of news outlets provide spaces for user engagement and public discussions. However, from the normative perspective of deliberative discussions, user comments often lack quality. We analyze how deliberative characteristics of Facebook user comments, namely, reciprocity, respect, rationality, and constructiveness, can influence the number and deliberative quality of the reply comments they receive. The manual content analysis shows that rationality in top comments increases the number of replies; additionally, respect, rationality, and constructiveness in top comments increase the occurrence of these characteristics in replies. The findings support assumptions about the involvement mechanisms in commenting behavior and the applicability of social norm theory in online discussions. They contribute to understanding spirals of deliberation as well as those of incivility. ",

    "abstract": " Social media is a central arena for the articulation of values, shaping what people around the world deem important and desirable. However, traditional value typologies struggle to capture the dynamic nature of value expression in digital spheres and overlook new communication-related values prevalent in these environments. Addressing these gaps, we developed an analytical framework for investigating value expression on social media, comprising three general value orientations ( Do well, Do good, and Feel good) and four communicative value orientations ( Inform, Influence, Bond, and Express). We drew on extensive cross-national research to construct the framework and examined its utility through a study of TikTok videos related to the FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Our analysis shows how value orientations enable the identification of patterns that underpin complex discourses. Ultimately, our framework offers a pathway to understand what people present as valuable on social media, as well as the broader value ecosystem platforms cultivate. ",

Utilizing a survey of 2004 English parents aged 20–55 years, the study explores how various factors – including household living conditions, parents’ sociodemographic status and sociotechnical variables such as children’s usage frequency and intensity, expenditure on technology and parents’ digital skills – affected different dimensions of children’s digital experiences during the lockdown. These dimensions include academic performance, connectivity issues, social interaction, feelings of isolation, problematic use and social support. The findings reveal distinct age-related trends, with older children more frequently engaging in online socialization. In addition, the study highlights a correlation between more favourable household socioeconomic conditions and improved digital experiences for children.",

    "abstract": "\n            This study examines how digital nationalism distorts the articulation of feminism on China’s popular video-sharing platform, BiliBili. Through a discourse analysis of the 100 most-viewed user-generated videos tagged with “feminism” (\n            nüquan\n            ), we find that BiliBili’s unique sociotechnical context, functioning both as a cultural platform and as a conduit for state propaganda, creates a space where various forms of nationalism—including anti-consumerism, anti-Western liberalism, and Sinocentric nationalism/chauvinism toward East Asian neighbors—intersect with discussions of feminism. Consequently, feminism on BiliBili gains virality only insofar as it does not appear “contradictory” to state-sponsored ideological slogans, norms, and notions of national identity. This article demonstrates how a seemingly participatory and free discursive space for user-generated content can, in fact, constrain women’s agency in negotiating the very concept of feminism, limiting their ability to articulate struggles and diversify narratives.\n          ",

We address this question by examining inequalities related to online job search skills and the outcomes of the online search process. Results from a representative survey of 1103 Spanish jobseekers show that online job search skills positively affect the chances of getting an interview through employment platforms but that they are unevenly distributed. Online job search skills are more important than other digital resources, including basic digital skills, in determining positive outcomes of online job searches though there are still inequalities in getting an interview independent of either. This calls for considering domain-specific digital skills both in research and in practice alongside tackling traditional inequalities.",

    "abstract": " The increasing role of algorithms shaping our use of communication technology—particularly on social media—comes with a growth of empirical research attempting to assess how literate users are regarding these algorithms. This rapidly emerging field is marked by great diversity in terms of how it theorizes and measures our understanding of algorithms, due, in part, to the opaque “black box” nature of the algorithms themselves. In this review article, we summarize the state of knowledge on algorithmic literacy, including its definitions, development, measurement, and current theorizing on human–algorithm interaction. Drawing on this existing work, we propose an agenda including four different directions that future research could focus on: (1) balancing users’ expectations of algorithmic literacy with developers’ responsibility for algorithmic transparency, (2) methods for engaging users in increasing their literacy, (3) further developing the affective and behavioral facets of literacy, and (4) addressing the new algorithmic divide.

Drawing from reflexive thematic analysis of interviews ( n = 15), I demonstrate that four reasons explain why the Twittersphere has become the central platform for activism in Nigeria. These include the use of Twitter for activism, justice, and dragging; the functional uses made possible by Twitter’s architecture; twitter as a platform for young elite influence; and the perception of Twitter as a leveller. I expand on what these themes mean for Twitter activism and social media regulation, further arguing that research into digital activism and communities should start to recognise Twitter’s centrality as a tool of choice in the formation, coordination, and amplification of activist voices.

This article analyzes how companies that produce machine vision technology articulate what it means for machines to “see.” Through a thematic analysis of more than 200 corporately produced documents, we examine the companies’ product offerings and identify three discursive techniques that entwine basic explanations of emerging technology with the ideologies of AI producers: dismantling sight into technical action, expanding the parameters of sight, and seeing through data. These recurring corporate narratives organize perceptions of automation, educating outsiders how to value computational outcomes and support them through rearranging the real-world conditions of labor. We argue that the social power of machine vision is not only in how it detects objects, but also in how it arbitrates what work is visible in visions of the industry’s future. ",

Artworks that are introduced to be generated by AI (rather than a human artist) are, however, often evaluated negatively. Integrating extant research, we suggest that AI is ascribed less mind (i.e. agency and experience) which is responsible for this effect. In two experiments ( N = 176 and N = 381) we observed negative indirect effects of artist information (AI vs human artist) on the appreciation of visual artworks. The AI is consistently ascribed less agency and less experience than a human artist. Higher levels of experience and agency ascribed to an artist are, in turn, associated with higher appreciation of a piece of art. In both experiments the total effect of artist information on appreciation was not significant. Artist information did not predict whether the artwork deviated positively from viewers’ expectations developed before the actual artwork was encountered. ",

This study uses a quasi-experimental two-wave design to examine the relationship between BeReal use duration and well-being indicators. Results suggest that long-term BeReal use is linked to higher friendship satisfaction, positively influencing life satisfaction. In addition, long-term use is associated with reduced fear of missing out and connection overload compared to short-term use, suggesting BeReal may enhance well-being possibly by facilitating daily interactions with close ties, limiting usage time, and providing a more authentic representation of everyday life compared to other social media platforms.

Drawing on 12 case studies with participants performing digital tasks, we use Ingold’s four phases of skill (getting ready, setting out, carrying on, and finishing off) to research and represent the rhythm of digital skill. By using medialities of inscription, scripting, and annotation, we demonstrate how researchers can use mediality to perceive rhythms of digital skill without being physically co-located in the performance. As different medialities enable and constrain the perception and descriptions of digital skill, we develop spotlines as a method that combines different medialities particularly well suited for describing and comparing the temporal order of phases for performing digital skill by rendering each performer’s pace and intensity.

    "abstract": " This two-study package examines sense of common humanity—a subcomponent of the psychological construct of self-compassion—in relation to political divisiveness. Study 1 ( n = 1010) employs a survey with a probability sample representative of the US population to show that sense of common humanity—recognizing that feeling bad about oneself is a common human experience—is associated with feeling competent to form relationships with those one disagrees with politically. This finding paved the way for Study 2, an experiment ( n = 955) that showed sense of common humanity can be primed using meme-like posts on Facebook, and, as a result, lead people to have more positive attitudes toward their political outgroup. From a theoretical perspective, this study demonstrates the relevance of using self-compassion as a framework for addressing political divisiveness, and that a sense of common humanity can be primed in the computer-mediated space of Facebook.

    "abstract": " eHEALS is one of the most prevalent scales used to measure eHealth literacy. However, significant criticism toward its conceptualization had raised. This study tests the effects of eHEALS alongside constructs from the elaboration likelihood model and information seeking processes, within a multidimensional model to predict medical decision-making quality. We test this model using a sample of 56 participants who completed a 45-minute online simulation task, requiring them to offer recommendation for a hypothetical medical scenario. Findings revealed that neither eHealth literacy nor elaboration likelihood independently predicted decision quality. However, eHEALS was positively associated with higher decision quality, but only among participants who had greater motivation and ability to process health information, and who used more complex information seeking strategies. Findings suggest that the eHEALS measure can be examined using a multidimensional theoretical approach to illustrate the ways in which patients obtain and utilize health information to make informed decisions.

We performed manual coding of images ( N = 9648), and a series of supervised machine learning methods to classify three waves of comments ( N = 22,676) published in 2020 on Instagram. Welch’s F tests were used to compare misinformation, emotions, toxicity, and identity attack across three time periods. The results showed that hashtag moderation had an intended effect in reducing misinformation, and an unintended effect in reducing anger, fear, toxicity, and identity attack. Images with people of East Asian descent were associated with more anger, fear, toxicity, and identity attack than images with people of other races. Prior to content moderation, misinformation was associated with identity attack. Stigmatization on social media, and content moderation of misinformation and hate speech are discussed. ",

    "abstract": " How news media, such as newspapers and magazines, is consumed has dramatically changed due to technological developments, such as mobile and high-speed Internet technology. As a result, there has been a dramatic shift in consumer consumption of news from desktop and television to mobile platforms such as smartphones and tablets. Due to the shift of news consumption from desktop and television platforms to mobile, journalists have had to consider how news headlines and alerts must be tailored to match the distinctive characteristics of mobile platforms and consumers’ engagement patterns on such devices. Drawing on construal theory (CLT), this study will examine how mobile alerts should be framed to optimize engagement. Overall, it finds a combination of abstract construal through combination of a gain and other frames results in heightened levels of curiosity in readers leading to further engagement with news products.

    "abstract": " Game design’s influence on how gaming is practiced is a debated topic within video game research. Overlapping with this debate are questions of how game design and social practice each contribute to experiences of problematic gaming. In this study, we drew on focus groups and individual interviews with a total of 107 adolescents. We deployed practice theory to demonstrate how game design is an integrated part of the material configurations of everyday gaming practices. Furthermore, we will provide empirical examples of how interplays between game design and social practices can shape experiences of problematic gaming. In the analysis, we will demonstrate how adverse consequences of gaming can emerge in the clash between game design and everyday life obligations. Additionally, we will show how strategically designed monetary mechanics and patterns can be intensified or stifled by players’ socializing practices. Finally, we will address the interplay between gendered practices and game designs. ",

    "abstract": " When do users share fact-checks on social media? We describe a survey experiment conducted during the 2019 election in Argentina measuring the propensity of voters to share corrections to political misinformation that randomly confirm or challenge their initial beliefs. We find evidence of selective sharing—the notion that individuals prefer to share pro-attitudinal rather than counter-attitudinal fact-checks. This effect, however, is conditioned by the type of adjudication made by fact-checkers. More specifically, in line with motivated reasoning processes, respondents report a higher intent to share confirmations (i.e. messages fact-checked with a “true” rating) compared with refutations (i.e. messages fact-checked with a “false” rating). Experimental results are partially confirmed with a regression discontinuity analysis of observational data of Twitter and replicated with additional experiments. Our findings suggest that fact-checkers could increase exposure to their verifications on social media by framing their corrections as confirmations of factually correct information. ",

We apply affective disposition theory’s moral judgment predictions regarding message and audience factors and Schadenfreude theorizing to explain reactions to similar SM posts. In an experiment with a large census-matched sample, participants viewed a series of SM posts similar to those on featured on reddit.com/r/hermancainaward . We manipulated two message factors: whether the poster was dogmatic or uncertain in their anti–COVID-19-vaccination stance and whether they expressed regret before they died. Dogmatic posting resulted in perceptions of the poster as more immoral and deserving of worse health outcomes, but regret mitigated these effects. Notably, political party and vaccination status, two audience factors, moderated these processes. Our findings demonstrate that SM posting is a morally relevant behavior and that narrative moral judgment theories seem capable of explaining reader’s responses. ",

    "abstract": " Platforms have disintermediated the markets for books, film, television, and music, but the online art market has reproduced offline structures, leaving intermediaries intact. This study explores the limits of platforms by describing why disintermediation failed in the art market. Along with museums and other intermediaries, the most important function of galleries is to co-create artistic value. They not only sell art but also form a central part of the status system of art. We examine #artistsupportpledge (ASP) on Instagram. ASP uncovered a market for art that had no place in the existing system. ASP facilitated direct sales to consumers while allowing artists to maintain links to galleries for reputation, career development, exhibitions, and sales of large, expensive work. The art market experienced unique partial disintermediation under narrow conditions with continued allegiance to existing intermediaries and status structures. We conclude by discussing four implications for the theory of platforms. ",

In the correlational Study 1, participants ( N = 291) were regular users of Instagram, and in the randomized controlled trial Study 2 ( N = 283), they were newcomers. We found that regular users are motivated to use Instagram to capture life’s positive moments, and their higher frequency of posting was associated with increased appreciation and, in turn, greater life satisfaction and happiness (Study 1). New users, regardless of whether they were instructed to post positive photos (experimental conditions) or not (control conditions), posted exactly this kind of content. The more positive the photos were, the higher participants’ appreciation, life satisfaction, and happiness (Study 2). Posting appreciative content on social media might have a beneficial impact on users’ well-being and become a foundation for future interventions. ",

Consistent with the central phenomenological tenet of locating the present as ontologically prior to any past origin, the idea is that in order to properly understand the texture of day-to-day digital navigation our focus should not be on discrete media texts or objects, but on the way they are experienced first and foremost as presents into which we find ourselves repeatedly thrown. The aim of this article is to establish an empirical framework for scrutinizing the ethical dimensions of digitally mediated temporal experience. The traces of this experience are not paths from a past or causal origin, but traces of mobility experienced as always-already presentness. ",

    "abstract": " Partisanship, polarization, and platforms are foundational to how people perceive contentious issues. Using a probability sample ( n  = 825), we examine these factors in tandem across four political claims concerning US presidential elections and the COVID-19 pandemic. We find Democrats and Republicans differ in their belief in true and false claims, with each party believing more in pro-attitudinal claims than in counter-attitudinal claims. These results are especially pronounced for affectively polarized partisans. We also find interactions between partisanship and platform use where Republicans who use Google or Twitter are more likely to believe in false claims about COVID-19 than Republicans who do not use these platforms. Our findings highlight that Americans’ beliefs in political claims are associated with their political identity through both partisanship and polarization, and the use of search and social platforms appears critical to these relationships. These findings have implications for understanding why realities are malleable to voter preferences in liberal democracies. ",

    "title": "Understanding the role of participatory-moral abilities, motivation, and behavior in European adolescents’ responses to online hate",
    "abstract": " Researchers have repeatedly discussed how to strengthen supportive and pro-social responses to online hate, such as reporting and commenting. Researchers and practitioners commonly call for the promotion of media literacy measures that are believed to be positively associated with countermeasures against online hate. In this study (conducted in 2021), we examined relationships between media literacy proficiencies of (1) moral-participatory motivation and abilities and, consequently, (2) the establishment of moral-participatory behaviors and the correspondence with prosocial responses to online hate. A sample of 1489 adolescents and young adults (16–22 years old) from eight European countries is examined. Results confirmed that higher participatory-moral motivation and behavior were significantly associated with stronger intentions to report online hate. Commenting on hateful online content, on the other hand, was significantly related to participatory-moral abilities and past experiences with online harassment. Implications for the role of social media literacy in the context of online hate are discussed. ",

    "abstract": " Watching other people share their lives in real time via streaming platforms, also known as In Real Life (IRL) streams, has gained popularity as a form of entertainment and a meaningful way for people to experience social presence and community with others. Our study focuses on IRL streams to investigate how the multiple dimensions of social presence (cognitive copresence, psychological involvement, and behavioral interdependence) with the streamers and other viewers are associated with community identification. Through an online survey of 423 IRL stream viewers, our study found that community identification is associated with different dimensions of social presence derived from the streamers and other viewers. Specifically, cognitive copresence was not sufficient to evoke a sense of community. Psychological involvement with the streamers and behavioral interdependence with other viewers were significantly associated with the participants’ community identification. The findings provide support for examining social presence as a multidimensional construct in studying online interactions on platform with asymmetrical affordances in which different groups of users have varying communication affordances.

    "abstract": " This article demonstrates how applying the concept of audiencing allows us to better understand how the presence of different audiences online mediates the affective labour practices of content creators. The article focuses on one distinctive example of online content creators: British travel bloggers. First, the article argues that audiencing provides an important lens to witness the diversity of affective labour practices being undertaken by travel bloggers, contributing to the wider literature around affective work. Second, the article also demonstrates how travel bloggers are an important focus of study, as they utilise visual and narrative experiences of place as the key foci through which they tailor their affective work to different relationships of audiencing. This finding contributes to the labour on audiencing, by demonstrating how creative labourers use a stimulus (such as discussions of place) as a mechanism through which to tailor their affective work.

    "abstract": " The literature on the relationship between social media and online political participation continues to expand. Yet, attention to the effect of cognitive dispositions central to user engagement on social media is rare. This study advances the current theoretical understanding of the effects of social media news use by focusing on online privacy concerns. Two studies in Singapore (Study 1 using cross-sectional survey data) and the United States (Study 2 using two-wave panel data) find that social media news use is positively associated with online political participation. Still, public concern regarding online privacy is negatively related to online political participation. Moreover, moderation analyses suggest that those with more significant privacy concerns are least likely to engage in online political participation, even at higher social media news use levels. We also identify that those with lower cognitive ability are more likely to curb online participation due to privacy concerns. ",

It considers NFT applications’ dual purposes as entertainment media and financial instruments and posits that the interests of capital inform users’ engagement. In an environment defined by distrust and uncertainty, predominantly Filipino digital laborers’ (“Scholars”) experiences and interactions with the game’s ownership class (“Managers”) reflect pre-existing patterns of exploitation made inexpensive by differences in currency valuations, accessible by access to digital devices, available by global financial uncertainty, possible by a lack of user protection and governance, and permissible by light government regulation. To navigate an interplay of designed systems and human behavior, users share gameplay and marketplace knowledge. The blurring of gaming, gambling, and finance discussed here risks fostering an increasingly gamified approach to work and finance and facilitates exploitation of global, stratified labor. ",

    "abstract": "Public communication change (PCC) is often studied in communication research with a somewhat narrow conceptual focus, for instance, either on the contingency or on the determination of communication development. I argue that instead of considering the various extant theoretical approaches as competing and irreconcilable, the field should strive for a holistic understanding that helps integrate them. I consider PCC as a process that unfolds over time in complex multilevel dynamics between macro-level structural transformations and the decisions and resulting behaviors of individual and collective actors. I propose a structure–actor model of PCC that accounts for both, determined and contingent processes simultaneously. It is also able to explain the emergence of paradox phenomena and collective misjudgments despite better knowledge. I conclude by using examples from the context of the “filter bubble” phenomenon to illustrate the heuristic value of the developed model and sketch an empirical research agenda that follows from its arguments.",

    "abstract": "This article considers how children’s memeability is entangled with commercial sharenting narratives through two case studies of (mothers) influencers and their daughters in Brazil and Portugal. The Brazilian mother privileges cute aesthetics by enchantment in an inspirational sharenting and does not promote the child’s memeability. In contrast, the Portuguese influencer privileges cringe aesthetics, encouraging her daughter’s memeability by exploring the ambivalence of parenting with humor in a transgressive sharenting. The findings point to the unpredictability and uncontrollability of the memetic culture. In Brazil, the child’s image was appropriated for playful and parodic engagement, neglecting her privacy, reputation, and well-being despite her mother’s public complaint. This unauthorized memeability results from the girl’s celebrification after her display in viral content and advertising campaigns. In contrast, the encouraged memeability of the Portuguese influencer does not exceed her community of followers since her daughter’s recognition seems limited to an extension of the mother’s self.",

    "abstract": " In studies of misinformation, the distinction between high- and low-credibility publishers is fundamental. However, there is much that we do not know about the relationship between the subject matter and timing of content produced by the two types of publishers. By analyzing the content of several million unique articles published over 28 months, we show that high- and low-credibility publishers operate in distinct news ecosystems. Bursts of news coverage generated by the two types of publishers tend to cover different subject matter at different times, even though fluctuations in their overall news production tend to be highly correlated. Regardless of the mechanism, temporally convergent coverage among low-credibility publishers has troubling implications for American news consumers. ",

    "abstract": " The diffusion of algorithms, robots, and artificial intelligence has sparked public debates regarding opportunities, risks, and responsibility for addressing problems and developing solutions. Since media cover and shape sociotechnical imaginaries, this study investigates the Austrian media discourses on responsibility in two domains of automation: social media algorithms and social companions. Using a machine learning approach, relevant articles were identified, followed by a manual comparative content analysis. The findings indicate that media coverage of social media algorithms tends to be more critical compared to social companions. In the debate about social media algorithms, journalists emerge as the most common speakers raising responsibility issues and primarily attributing them to Internet platform providers. Conversely, responsibility for social robotics is predominantly articulated by experts, considering it as a responsibility shared by society, economy, and research. Furthermore, the media present different perspectives on the agency and responsibility of social media algorithms and social robots themselves. ",

Our data included 4699 participants from a nation-wide panel study, the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study from 2019 to 2022. The findings demonstrated that 322 of 1884 (17.1%) nonusers initiated Internet use in 2019, while 418 of 2815 (14.8%) users discontinued Internet use in 2019. Older age, low education, and low population density predicted less initiation, greater discontinuation, less increase, and more decrease in Internet use. Participation in social activities predicted more initiation, lower discontinuation, and decrease in Internet use. Social support was associated with initiation, discontinuation, and increase in Internet use; the associations varied by the source of support. Digital divide among older adults was exacerbated by socioeconomic disparities. Engagement in social activities and targeted social support may help bridge this divide. ",

    "abstract": " With more than 50% of the world’s population living in urban areas, the smart city concept has been introduced as a solution to urbanization problems, with a focus on technological and social innovation. However, critics argue that the concept is more about marketing than actual benefits for citizens. Given the limitations of conventional and formalized e-participation and smart city procedures, we highlight the value of shared citizen knowledge and the potential of e-interaction in this context by analyzing city-related informal social media communication, following recent calls to embrace citizens’ opinions in the smart city framework. This work focuses on major German cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants. The authors identify nine categories of interest in citizens’ discussions. Unlike official channels, citizens tend to focus on social and societal issues. The results of this study can complement existing tools by including citizens’ perspectives in smart city decision-making processes. ",

    "title": "Satellite surveillance and the orbital unconscious",
    "abstract": " Satellite data are frequently attached to discourses of infallibility, objectivity and omnipresence. Yet the value of satellite data in everyday society largely depends on the strength of our interpretations, interpretations which are easily misled. Satellite images can be fabricated, misread and restricted, yet companies like Google encourage users to see themselves as active agents in a collaborative process of accumulating data, obscuring users’ true relations with satellite technology and giving them a false sense of power and anonymity. In this sense, satellites constitute a new unconscious terrain of perception. For Geert Lovink, we have reached an age where we can ‘read satellites as metaphors, as a new type of technological mirror’ and as ‘an unconscious apparatus’. This article argues that our lack of conscious awareness around the presence, nature and infrastructure of satellites allows them to thrive under the radar as a new species of unconscious surveillance technology.

    "abstract": " Social media abound with successful portrayals in nearly every life domain (e.g. appearance, social life). Many researchers have expressed concerns about such portrayals, claiming that they might be detrimental to adolescents’ self-development. More specifically, continuous exposure to successful portrayals on social media may encourage adolescents to perceive these portrayals as standards to meet, which might evoke feelings of discrepancy (i.e. the feeling of falling short of important standards). The results of a three-wave longitudinal study ( N = 1032, Mage = 14.55, SD = 1.65) revealed that exposure to different types of successful portrayals on social media (i.e. attractive appearance and a perfect life) does not relate to feelings of discrepancy over time, and vice versa at a within-person level. Yet, between-person associations were present for both types of successful portrayals with feelings of discrepancy. Hence, our findings stress the importance of taking into account both between- and within-person relations when examining social media effects. ",

We argue that users creatively build these ‘glocal’ cultures on affordances but also globally disseminated cultural toolkits of, in this case, imageboards. We present such an empirical analysis of Ylilauta, a Finnish-language imageboard with important similarities but also differences to previously studied English-language imageboards such as 4chan. Users of Ylilauta construct strong social boundaries, bonds and speech norms, unofficial rules of conduct and belonging in the anonymous online culture. They resist commercialization of their culture and try to preserve its perceived originality. ",

Heeding to this call, this study examined how the general public perceives and reacts to Chat GPT and the implications of these perceptions, drawing on the third-person and first-person effect. A national survey in the United States ( N = 1004) revealed that individuals tend to believe they would personally benefit from the positive influence of Chat GPT, while others will benefit relatively less. Also, results showed that people believe that self is more capable of using Chat GPT critically, ethically, and efficiently than others. Interestingly, the self-other gap in perceived efficacy was influenced by subjective knowledge but not by objective knowledge about Chat GPT. The self-other gap in perceived efficacy negatively predicted support for government regulation of Chat GPT, while the self-other gap in both perceived influence and efficacy positively predicted support for literacy interventions.

    "abstract": " Professional content moderators are responsible for limiting the negative effects of online discussions on news platforms and social media. However, little is known about how they adjust to platform and company moderation strategies while viewing and dealing with uncivil comments. Using qualitative interviews ( N = 18), this study examines which types of comments professional moderators classify as actionable, which (automated) strategies they use to moderate them, and how these perceptions and strategies differ between organizations, platforms, and individuals. Our results show that moderators divide content requiring intervention into clearly problematic and “gray area” comments. They (automatically) delete clear cases but use interactive or motivational moderation techniques for “gray areas.” While moderators crave more advanced technologies, they deem them incapable of addressing context-heavy comments. These findings highlight the need for nuanced regulations, emphasize the crucial role of moderators in shaping public discourse, and offer practical implications for (semi-)automated content moderation strategies.

    "abstract": " Healthy news consumption requires limited exposure to unreliable content and ideological diversity in the sources consumed. There are two challenges to this normative expectation: the prevalence of unreliable content online; and the prominence of misinformation within individual news diets. Here, we assess these challenges using an observational panel tracking the browsing behavior of N ≈ 140,000 individuals in the United States for 12 months (January–December 2018). Our results show that panelists who are exposed to misinformation consume more reliable news and from a more ideologically diverse range of sources. In other words, exposure to unreliable content is higher among the better informed. This association persists after we control for partisan leaning and consider inter- and intra-person variation. These findings highlight the tension between the positive and negative consequences of increased exposure to news content online. ",

    "abstract": " Drawing on two competing hypotheses from the prevention and partisan gap frameworks, this study tests how news literacy, partisanship, and exposure to partisan YouTube channels interact to influence misinformation acceptance. Partisan YouTube channels in this study refer to a type of soft journalistic content with a partisan perspective. Panel survey data ( N = 808) collected during the 2020 South Korean General Election campaign were analyzed. Supporting the partisan gap hypothesis, the results show that when exposed to partisan YouTube channels, those with higher news literacy were more likely to process misinformation in a biased manner, such that party-congenial misinformation is more likely to be accepted, while party-uncongenial misinformation is more likely to be rejected with an increase in news literacy level. This indicates that the effects of news literacy on misinformation acceptance vary depending on political factors. Furthermore, in the context of politically biased media, the partisan gap widens among those with greater news literacy. ",

This article conducted two randomized controlled 2 × 2 × 2 experiments ( N = 518) to explore the influence of heuristic cues (including the number of followers, popularity, and description as variables) generated by the system and video characteristics (including definition, duration, and editing as variables). The results suggest that the number of the source’s followers and the video’s popularity are positively associated with perceived credibility. Moreover, high-definition deepfakes are more efficient at deceiving viewers. Interestingly, an interaction effect indicates that it is not easy for users to detect editing traces in relatively long videos (greater than 30 s). Our study is an initial step to better understand how individuals assess video credibility and lay the grounds for approaches to combat the negative effects of deepfakes. ",

Using the 2024 Taiwan presidential election as a case study and prompting as a method, the study audits responses from Microsoft Copilot in five languages. The findings reveal significant discrepancies in information readiness, content accuracy, norm adherence, source usage, and attribution behavior across languages. These results underscore the contextual awareness when applying accountability assessment that looks beyond transparency in AI-mediated communication, especially during politically sensitive events.

    "abstract": " Physical items are often taken for granted in mediated communication between grandparents (GP) and young grandchildren (GC). This article puts “constitutive nonhumans” at the center of inquiry to understand the potential of physical items and communication technologies to communicate over distance. The notion of phaticity operationalizes the role of constitutive nonhumans to establish and maintain contact over distance, which might have pleasurable or unpleasurable outcomes. A relational view on agency supports the entanglement of humans and nonhumans when they cooperate to communicate over distance. The article reports on a two-phase qualitative study that was conducted in two European countries with 10 GP (aged 60–75 years) and 10 GC (aged 6–11 years). The results identify how the entanglement between constitutive nonhumans conflates emotional connection and contact. Furthermore, the results suggest that the condition of familiarity can direct contact to pleasant or unpleasant outcomes that might differ across mediated and co-located communication. ",

    "abstract": " Moving beyond the publicness-oriented perspective in Internet censorship studies, this article directs attention to censorship’s consequences for users’ personal lives. We examine “account bombing” in China, a phenomenon where social media platforms suspend user accounts permanently, and we focus on the loss of the “victims.” Notably, people commonly use social media accounts as personal archives that store their digital traces, from which they obtain a sense of self, and perceive the accounts as their private property. We use the dignity takings theory to illustrate the dual harm the victims suffer in account bombing: Censorship deprives them of both their social media accounts and dignity. We propose the concept of “dual dehumanization” to explain the dignity violation in account bombing, as this arbitrary conduct not only occurs in a dehumanizing manner, but also destroys users’ identity work and community ties.

    "abstract": " Disconnective action, this article argues, is an important supplement to the logic of connective action, which enables social movements to organize informally online. Through the (threat of) disconnection, members may (re)assert their agency in relation to social movement organizations. In conducting a case study of LGBTI+ community members’ protests of a corporate sponsorship of WorldPride 2021, we establish disconnective action as a particular form of within-movement activism that relies both on social media affordances and the conditions of possibility of hybrid media ecologies. Thus, we explore how individual members of the LGBTI+ community were able to influence the formal organization of WorldPride 2021, as the threat of community members’ disconnection from the event led the organizers to terminate a corporate sponsorship. On this basis, we conceptualize disconnective action as a central means for individual activists to shape the movements of which they are part. ",

    "abstract": " Social media can establish governance frameworks for their users through public-facing documents and policies. Such governance frameworks are value-laden and embody platform values. As a newly dominant platform in the United States, TikTok serves as an exemplary medium to study the evolution of platform values. Based on the iterations of TikTok’s Community Guidelines from 2018 to 2022 ( N = 25,641), we conducted longitudinal lexical analyses to determine changes in their structure and value salience. Then, through network analysis, we demonstrated how values co-exist by constructing co-occurrence networks. Our results reveal that the lexical complexity and value interconnection of these policies have increased over time. Certain values are more central in the networks than others (e.g. privacy, safety, and fairness), which may be attributed to a public outcry for change. The evolution of TikTok’s governance frameworks follows three mechanisms (mediation, reversion, and founding paths) in shaping the core-periphery structures of platform values. ",

The results showed that by the second week since the inception of the war, the children and adolescents already had created new practices of smartphone use, suitable for war. They extensively used their smartphones offline and online for three overarching purposes: in order to emotionally regulate themselves; make significant contacts with other people; and maintain identity. The current study shows the important role of avoidant and collective coping strategies in the lives of children and adolescents in war and contributes to a deeper and pragmatic understanding of their digital coping in war.

    "abstract": " This study proposes a framework for examining hashtagged content on social media, which captures how specific issue frames (i.e. hashtags) contribute to navigable structures. We introduce ‘interwoven multimodal discourse’ as a pluralist alternative to the widely applied unitary approach in which trending hashtags serve as primary sites of analysis. The study argues that ‘interweaving’ of social media discourse takes place through practices such as hashtag colocation, which result in ambient and navigable structures. Analysis of hashtag colocation networks can serve as an approach for mapping ambient affiliations accessible through such structures. We analyse a hashtag colocation network constructed using a sample of 1100 Instagram posts related to climate change uploaded during the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2021 (COP26) held in Glasgow to demonstrate two structural properties of interwoven discourse on Instagram: (1) hashtags contribute to multiple thematic clusters and (2) micro-level hashtags representing secondary topics are nested within larger thematic clusters.

    "abstract": " On social media, politicians present themselves on public issues to achieve re-election. Protest provides one opportunity for politicians to do so. In this study, we ask: How do politicians respond to protest on social media? And, which factors determine how politicians react? Building upon classic typologies of politicians’ rhetorical strategies, we study Twitter and Facebook posts ( N = 8211) of Belgian politicians ( N = 225) who respond to protest ( N = 124) staged in Brussels (Belgium). Results show that politicians predominantly engage in position taking when responding to protest and rarely engage in advertising, blame attribution, or credit claiming, although latter reactions are more prevalent on Facebook than Twitter. A pattern of how politician features impact rhetorical responsiveness stands out. Executives are more likely to claim credit, opposition politicians are more likely to blame politics, right-wing politicians are more likely to blame demonstrators. Findings lay bare politicians’ online protest communication strategy and speak to party–protest interactions. ",

    "abstract": " Although memes are considered disruptive to elite control over political discourse, their viability for contestation in authoritarian settings remains uncertain. The present study addresses this question by analyzing Russian memes created to ridicule the Kremlin’s propaganda, which accuses the United States of undermining Russia domestically and internationally. These memes depict US presidents engaging in trivial acts of sabotage, from damaging worn-out roads to urinating in dilapidated buildings, thereby exposing the absurdity of Russia’s claims to superpower status. Importantly, the memes go beyond ridiculing the regime to vilify “ordinary Russians” as unsophisticated subscribers to the government’s narrative. The study shows that by focusing on the tug-of-war between the authorities and the protesting “vocal minority,” communication scholars may overlook a sizable “silent majority” that enables authoritarian consolidation. I argue that such outgroup memetic articulations, despite their limitations in mobilizing broader publics, offer valuable insights into authoritarian populism that surpass this empirically flawed binary logic.

    "abstract": " This study utilizes social media data and deep-learning-based text classification methods to investigate cross-cutting interactions on social media. Our findings reveal that people are more likely to use offensive speech in response to content published by opposing partisans. Furthermore, we demonstrate how inter-party hostility is associated with the partisan identity of both the message sender and the target in the interaction. On one hand, the findings indicate that strong partisans and people who publicly assert their partisan identities tend to attack opposing partisans, suggesting a relationship between the salience of partisan identity and value defense mechanisms. On the other hand, strong partisans, especially politicians, are more likely to be the target of offensive speech from opposing partisans. The disparity in the extent of received offensive speech is argued to result from individuals’ tendency to maintain their partisan identification by expressing hostility toward representative individuals of opposing partisans.

This study explores the growing ties between public institutions and data-driven firms by focusing on the case of the Tel Aviv Municipality and a (data-driven) startup accelerator it established in the city. Based on semi-structured interviews with the Municipality staff and with representatives of the data-driven firms in the accelerator, I present a grounded framework that outlines the characteristics of the resulting collaboration and describes the mechanisms that facilitate and contain the dynamic thereof. The framework contributes to existing research on tech companies’ involvement in public organizations by suggesting two analytical dimensions, which I term orientation and action. On both, I note various tensions, which are bound to be endemic to collaborations between a public institution and a data firm, and which account for two main motivations behind the Municipality’s actions vis-a-vis its partner data-driven firms, driven by both market imperatives and its overarching aim to benefit the public.

    "abstract": " Nonhuman life is increasingly analyzed and acted upon through big data and AI tools. Birds in particular are among the most datafied wild beings. However, avian—like human—data sets present challenges of bias, misclassification, and harmful collection methods. For example, avian data includes bias along lines of sex and sexuality, female, queer, and intersex birds are significantly understudied. These missing birds not only represent consequences for biodiversity loss but also “naturalize” assumptions about sex and sexuality for all species, including humans. In this article, we interrogate avian datafication practices and introduce Salvaging Birds, a multimodal project proposing “queer data surrogacy” as a method for generating “queer ecological data,” that is data resisting normative environmental frameworks. Here queer data surrogates were produced by creatively subverting AI toward generating speculative missing birds. Bridging critical data and archival studies with queer ecology, we argue that data logics demand examination at nonhuman sites and scales. ",

    "abstract": " This article analyses the ‘free speech’ online forum Flashback, which adheres to a strict non-interference policy when it comes to user-generated content, but beyond this also forbids users from deleting their own content or accounts. Through a qualitative content analysis, this article sought to understand the relationship between the platform and its users with respect to this unconventional approach to moderation and content removal. This article discusses both the position(s) taken by Flashback as it pertains to its policy of minimal moderation, and the expectations as expressed by users navigating Flashbacks rules and their practical implementations. The article shows a discrepancy between how Flashback (incoherently) justifies minimal moderation and how users had imagined the platform operating. The article also discusses how Flashback maintains these policies through its community’s active encouragement via supportive posting and silencing of non-conformers, and the consequences that Flashback’s inaction has in terms of residual hate.

    "abstract": " Given the number of identified risks associated with influencer sharenting, momfluencers are increasingly adopting a more mindful approach to sharing information about their children online. Prior qualitative research suggests that followers respond positively towards these mindful sharenting practices, especially when motives are communicated. However, there is a lack of experimental exploration into this finding and its potential explanations. Therefore, drawing upon theoretical insights regarding self-disclosure and self-determination theory, this experimental study with 176 mothers seeks to investigate the impact of momfluencers providing an explanation regarding mindful sharenting practices, proposing the need for relatedness and empathy as mediators. The findings reveal that when momfluencers disclose their motives, this significantly enhances follower engagement, admiration, and evaluation of the momfluencer. This effect is fully explained by empathy, and partly by the need for relatedness. This study emphasizes the importance of transparency and provides momfluencers strategies to balance privacy protection and the benefits of influencer sharenting. ",

    "abstract": " Following the January 6 insurrection on the US Capitol, we sought to explore how two social media platforms were being used concurrently to disseminate far-right memes and discourse. Our study employs a mixed-methods approach to collect a large data set of images from 4chan/pol/ and using the “#stopthesteal” hashtag on Twitter between 1 January 2021 and 13 January 2021. Our findings reveal how each platform influenced the usage of memes toward identity building and far-right activism in the days leading up to and immediately after the insurrection. Our findings reveal that Twitter was used to mobilize users leading up to January 6 but led to in-fighting among the pro-Trump crowd in the days after. Meanwhile 4chan/pol users took advantage of the Overton window of the Insurrection to disseminate far-right ideology and attempt to recruit and radicalize disgruntled Trump supporters after the insurrection was deemed a failure.

    "abstract": " Covid-19 deepened the need for digital-based support for people experiencing mental ill-health. Discussion platforms have long filled gaps in health service provision and access, offering peer-based support usually maintained by a mix of professional and volunteer peer moderators. Even on dedicated support platforms, however, mental health content poses difficulties for human and machine moderation. While automated systems are considered essential for maintaining safety, research is lagging in understanding how human and machine moderation interacts when addressing mental health content. Working with three digital mental health services, we examine the interaction between human and automated moderation of discussion platforms, contrasting ‘reactive’ and ‘adaptive’ moderation practices. Presenting ways forward for improving digital mental health services, we argue that an integrated ‘adaptive logic of care’ can help manage the interaction between human and machine moderators as they address a tacit ‘risk matrix’ when dealing with sensitive mental health content.

    "abstract": " Despite newer media technologies alleviating barriers of entry for marginalized groups, media still fails to address White supremacy at large. The live-streaming service Twitch banned one of its top streamers Hasan Piker in December 2021 for using the word “cracker” during a stream. Despite the myriad of complaints from women, people of color, LGBT +, and people with physical disabilities about targeted harassment they received on the platform, Twitch has taken little to no action on to ban those attacks. Utilizing critical whiteness and white framing theory, this study reviewed the discourse of Twitch influencers, who created YouTube reaction videos about the ban. All three of the influencers used rhetoric that sustained White supremacy like downplaying the impact of systemic racism, victimizing White men, and calling for freedom of hate speech. The implications of this study outline how the policing of hate speech can facilitate White supremacy on platforms. ",

    "abstract": " This article examines emergent communities of platform-based delivery workers in Bangkok by applying Max Weber’s concept of Vergemeinschaftung or ‘doing community’. Using offline and online ethnographic methods, the authors demonstrate how delivery workers do community on the streets of Bangkok and leverage smartphones and social media to extend their communities to the online realm. These community practices are culturally constituted and share characteristics with pre-existing communities in the transportation sector in Thailand. However, while these older communities are under pressure from rationalisation, or in Weber’s terms, Vergesellschaftung, rider communities emerge from the rational conditions of delivery platforms. Through this analysis, the article demonstrates how Weber’s theory effectively captures the dialectical dynamics of doing community and rationalisation in digital economies, suggesting that scholarship on digital platforms and media could benefit from adopting a Weberian analysis of social change.

We analyzed every comment ( N = 3,686,110) produced over 42 months on a popular incel discussion board and found that nearly all active participants use misogynistic terms. Participants used misogynistic terms nearly one million times and at a rate 2.4 times greater than their use of neutral terms for women. The majority of participants’ use of misogynistic terms does not increase or decrease with post frequency, suggesting that members arrive (rather than become) misogynistic. We discuss these findings in relation to theories of intersectionality, masculinity, and sexism. We likewise discuss potential policies for mitigating incel misogyny and similar online discourse. ",

Drawing on the spatial-sociological approach of German sociologist HP Bahrdt, the discussion is guided by the thesis that the specific dynamics of privacy risk attributed to the digital revolution pre-date the digitized age, specifically in rural environments. The analogy between rurality and digitality is used to illustrate why the increasing blurring of public and private through transparency potentials—along with the accompanying convergence of social contacts (characteristic of both rural and digital space)—threatens not only individual privacy but also democratization by violating forms of individual freedom that are constitutive of a critical public realm. Therefore, this article serves as a call to understand digital privacy protection as one of the pressing challenges of our time. ",

Through in-depth, semi-structured interviews, narrative analysis and more than 2 years of virtual ethnography, I observed the family politics and power dynamics presented in the videos of Chinese cross-border wives. I found two types of family politics within the ‘power game’ of interculturally married families. Wives who have experienced significant domestic injustice tend to demonstrate and reaffirm their moral capital, whereas those who are content with their marriage lives tend to demonstrate to subscribers how they play the power game with wisdom. Nevertheless, by focusing on a marginalized group on YouTube, I illustrate the platform’s role in these Chinese cross-border wives’ family politics, the great effort they made to attain popularity, the invisibility they endured and their highly unpredictable platform practice.

This study examines Airbnb Online Experiences as a new media offering possibilities for people to be “in touch” with others around the world through short-lived interactive activities on Zoom. While new media technologies traditionally expand the potential for sustained connection and increasingly replicate elements of “in-person” communication, this emerging digital phenomenon, although enabling wider communicative reach and enhanced somatic experience, exists in fleeting, physically distanced connections. Through ethnography, the article examines how participants navigate circumstances of touch in online experiences, both by ways of communicative contact and physical proximity. The term being-in-touch is proposed, inspired by works on touch from relational ontological perspectives, to capture the multiple meanings and many ways of being in touch, exploring the relational nature and (im)possibilities of connection.

Using qualitative field and digital methods, computational methods, and economic modeling, it analyzes the scope, scale, and cost of commissioning social media influencers in the 2022 Philippine Elections across Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok. The researchers find that there is a high demand for influencers to campaign for candidates, characterized by premium and dynamic incentives under informal and obscure arrangements. We identified 1425 influencer accounts across the four social media platforms that engage in covert political campaigning and categorized them into seven types. The cost of these influencer-led campaigns is estimated to range from USD 27M following a pay-per-post compensation model, to USD 10.9M using a retainer model. This article serves as a model for both election research and election policy by providing a modular framework that addresses knowledge gaps in various country contexts. ",

    "title": "Behold the metaverse: Facebook’s Meta imaginary and the circulation of elite discourse",
    "abstract": " Despite pushback from regulatory and non-governmental entities, Meta’s control over the public narrative remains consistent. Using a method of corpus analysis, this study investigated the company’s sociotechnical imaginary as it circulates in media artifacts (428) responding to Zuckerberg’s 2021 Metaverse announcement. Analysis of how these artifacts respond to issues related to identity, security, and connectivity revealed that the majority amplify Meta’s corporate messaging, empowering its elite discourse and solidifying its socio-technological power. As it relates to user privacy, however, this study uncovered a limited number of artifacts in which journalists challenged rather than repeated Meta’s rhetoric. As an implication of this finding, future tech journalism should consider privacy as a starting point for critiques that also interrogate the underlying logic of surveillance capitalism and user exploitation. Ultimately, this article addresses the rhetorical functions deployed in the circulation of elite discourse while acknowledging the dynamism of sociotechnical imaginaries. ",

Consistent with prior, mostly US-focused research, we find that European tech-workers hold a liberal worldview, which values openness to change, individualism, and universalism and devalues conservatism. However, our findings challenge the notion of tech-workers as being a completely distinct or a homogeneous group in terms of their values. While developers appear to be substantively different from other occupations and non-developers working in tech, non-developers hold values similar to those of other occupational elites, such as professionals and managers. The study offers takeaways for research, policy, and education.",

    "abstract": "Content moderation plays a pivotal role in structuring online speech, but the human labour and the everyday decision-making process in content moderation remain underexamined. Informed by in-depth interviews with 16 content moderators in India, in this research, we analyse the decision-making process of commercial content moderators through the concept of sensemaking. We argue that moderation decisions are made in the context of the industry’s plural policies and efficiency requirements. An interplay of four cognitive processes of pattern identification, subjective perceptions, shared knowledge, and process optimization influences the final judgement. Once sense is enacted in the decision-making process, the sensibilities are retained by the adept moderator for future moderation decisions. Visibilizing the labour process behind commercial content moderation, we argue that everyday moderation decisions unfold in a socio-technical and economic assemblage wherein decisions are decontextualised and plausibility driven rather than consistency driven.",

While instant messaging (IM) groups are nowadays prominent spaces for daily communication, we have only little knowledge of how norms function within them. To address this gap, this study analyzes norm formation in WeChat neighborhood groups during the Covid-19 lockdown in Shanghai. We conceptualize these groups as\n            location-based meso-spaces\n            ; situated between the public and private realms, they underscore the importance of social norms in navigating social interactions. Building on 20 semi-structured interviews, combined with walk-through protocols, we identify what social norms emerge and how they are formed. We find that group norms develop through in-group interactions facilitated by the technological and social affordances of WeChat groups, and that they could derive from shared moral values and “group prototypes.” The results highlight that the lockdown and the Chinese socio-cultural and political environment play a significant role in shaping in-group norms.\n          ",

We conceptualize the ideology promoted by incels as misogynist extremism and explore the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown on the radicalization of this online community. Based on computational measures, we conducted a multi-perspective exploration, comparing the prevalence of and participation in threads dealing with extremism, ideology and mental health on the incels.is forum between pre-lockdown, lockdown and post-lockdown periods. We found evidence of long-term and temporary radicalization. Moreover, we found that, specifically, older forum members increasingly post in extremist-themed threads triggered by the lockdowns. Crucially, we show that activity on mental health–themed threads temporarily decreased during the lockdown. These findings indicate that real-world social isolation reduces mental health complaints among incels but, at the same time, exacerbates misogynist extremism among active community members.",

While we found a similar pattern for the associations of individual factors with engagement in the three sexting behaviors, we found no pattern for the associations across the outcomes (i.e. feeling happy and upset).

Drawing on gatekeeping theory and the concept of rationalisation, it describes and explains the use and effects of the technology in the news. Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in all parts of the gatekeeping process to drive efficiency gains, optimise processes and bring about greater effectiveness, with these effects being real but task-dependent and hard to quantify. Overall, AI reshapes and retools the production and distribution of news by providing publishers with new means in the service of achieving existing ends, rationalising the work of news organisations in the process, and pushing it more strongly towards logics of efficiency, predictability and calculability. I discuss these findings with respect to their impact on the public arena and the reconfiguration of power and control within the information ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "What drives a genuine sense of community in online spaces? This study examines the role of governance, autonomy, and control in fostering a sense of community online. Findings show that participatory governance and peer-enforced social norms are crucial for creating a strong sense of community, even after controlling for active, frequent community engagement. In contrast, merely enforcing rules through formal control mechanisms does not significantly enhance community strength. Inclusive governance also helps mitigate challenges posed by larger community sizes, supporting a strong sense of community at scale. However, the interaction between participatory governance and social control reveals a complex tension, where high member involvement may dilute the positive effects of peer-enforced norms. These insights underscore the necessity of a balanced, configurational governance approach, integrating both participatory processes and social control to bolster community cohesion. This study offers a more nuanced understanding of how online governance shapes community belonging and provides practical guidelines for designing more inclusive and cohesive digital spaces.",

This article explores how teens integrate conventional and social media entertainment into their media repertoires, and how they reflect on the interrelations of different media in the context of their daily lives. Using Q-methodology and qualitative interviews, three entertainment repertoires are identified: legacy-oriented, gaming-oriented, and social media entertainment-oriented. Findings reveal that while teens across these repertoires have similar experiences of conventional media entertainment and social media entertainment, they differ in how they portray the value of these. The analysis further demonstrates the complementary nature of various forms of media entertainment. The interweaving functions of entertainment media relate to how content flows between different forms of media, and to how different media are entangled into daily life.",

CLIP models are a recent artificial intelligence (AI) innovation which train on massive amounts of Internet data in order to align language and image, deploying this ‘grasp’ of cultural concepts to understand prompts, classify images and carry out tasks. To critically investigate this cultural codification, we explore MetaCLIP, a recent variation developed by Meta. We analyse the model’s metadata, a single file of 500,000 terms that aims to achieve a ‘balanced distribution’ or sufficiently broad understanding of concepts.

However, this is not always realised, particularly in the context of risky, sensitive and morally complex experiences. Failure to include children causes lacunae in our understanding of the factors that influence their lives and well-being. In this article, we propose to conceptualise approaches to including children in research along four dimensions: Exclusion; Exploitation; Extension; and Empowerment. Using research on children’s experiences with online sexual content as a case, we discuss ethical dilemmas related to including children in research. Finally, we present 10 recommendations for future research to respect children’ agency and empower them to participate in research in an ethically responsible manner.",

    "title": "Uses and effects of AR- and VR-based animal embodiment: A field study at a beach music festival",
    "abstract": "\n            Amid growing ecological threats to wildlife, organizations are increasingly exploring multimedia solutions to spur action. One such strategy involves enabling audiences to embody threatened wildlife (animal embodiment) via augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR). Despite AR/VR’s capacity to visualize threats onto one’s virtual body, little is understood about how these platforms differ in their uses and effects. Thus, A field study was conducted at a music festival where attendees (\n            N\n             = 99) evaluated custom-designed AR and VR games enabling animal embodiment. Results showed clear modality preferences for the AR game, though both AR and VR elicited high levels of connection, or body transfer (BT), with the animal body. BT also predicted pro-environmental behavior intentions, though this effect was strongest for direct (donations, volunteering) rather than indirect actions (social media advocacy). Results yield insight into the requirements for BT with animal bodies and establish support for animal embodiment as a viable environmental communications strategy.\n          ",

    "abstract": "Relational labour has become a critical concept for understanding the consequences of the ongoing relationship between creators and their audiences on social media. This article draws on this discussion to address Brazilian erotic content creators’ perceptions of the impact of relational labour on their sense of self and subjective identity. Combining the concept with the idea of recognition as conceived in the Psychodynamics of Work, the article explores the subjective investment and identity development involved in the continual creator–audience intersubjective relationships. Based on 31 in-depth interviews with Brazilian erotic creators, the article reveals a deep subjective investment in performing relational labour and its impact on creators’ self-esteem and self-relationship, with the potential to strengthen their subjective identity and social value. Nevertheless, the symbolic rewards of relational labour are an effort rather than a guarantee, especially in highly stigmatised work where the distribution of in intersubjective relationships is uneven.",

    "abstract": "Young people’s experiences with sexual content online are a regularly featured popular topic in news media, feeding heated ongoing policy and academic debates. Concerns and calls for further regulation and youth’s self-regulation are exacerbated when celebrities and popular public figures share statements and confessions about their own sexual lives at a young age. In this article, we study the discursive conditions of media coverage and the celebrity confessional as narratives of regulation and self-regulation. Using Billie Eilish’s statement about her self-perceived experience of harm from use of pornography during teenage life (13 December 2021), we study how global and national media outlets constructed Eilish’s confession in the light of broader concerns about children’s experiences with such online sexual content. This study enhances our understanding of how adolescents’ experiences of sexual content online is publicly shaped.",

    "abstract": "This article investigates the development and deployment process of QUIC, a new standard of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) that is fostering momentous architectural change in the ways in which communication and data packets transport happens on the Internet. We present QUIC’s standardization process as an analytical site to capture recent evolutions in the balance of power between the so-called “Big Tech” actors, other actors of the Internet industry, and states. The article focuses on three key socio-technical controversies that have shaped its standardization process, and, in particular, explores Google’s capabilities in re-shaping the technical architecture of the Internet. This research contributes to unveiling how control over Internet traffic is “infrastructured” by the QUIC process, highlighting the place of the private sector in standardization processes; the processes of consolidation and concentration of the Internet around dominant actors that are influenced by the making of standards; and the discussions and controversies regarding specific technical aspects of a standard that reconfigure broader balances of power and decision-making in Internet governance.",

    "abstract": "This article calls for systematic analysis of the accumulation and exercise of institutional platform power in the digital economy. We examine how the relatively open mobile advertising ecosystem is nevertheless dominated by a handful of platform conglomerates, most prominently Google, Facebook, and Apple. Although extant scholarship acknowledges the concentration of corporate power in digital advertising, as well as its cultural, societal, and environmental harms, a comprehensive approach to platform power is missing. Providing a framework to develop such insights, we analyze how shifts in the advertising ecosystem are driven by four interrelated institutional platform strategies: infrastructuralization, platformization, conglomeration, and financialization. The 2021 introduction and subsequent rollout of Apple’s App Tracking Transparency framework serves as an example to demonstrate that even though institutional relationships of dependence are constantly evolving, control over infrastructural nodes tends to entrench the already dominant position of leading platform conglomerates.",

There are more than 300 million views associated with the hashtags #sexualassaultawareness and #sexualassaultsurvivors on TikTok. Using quantitative content analysis, we analyzed 150 TikTok videos about “sexual assault” for trends in self-disclosures (RQ1), message framing (RQ2), types of sexual violence (RQ3), emotions (RQ4), creator characteristics (RQ5–7), and engagement (RQ8). We found that millions of people are seeing and engaging with this content. Coded videos were often (68%) framed from the perspective of educating or creating awareness. Video creators often engaged in displays of authenticity like showing their face on camera (84%). Coded videos often (60%) framed information in a way that “calls out” perpetrators or social norms surrounding sexual violence. This study sets the stage for future explorations of strategic communication on TikTok, including but not limited to projects related to sexual violence resistance and prevention.",

    "abstract": "Search engines are both frequently used and widely trusted sources of current political information. While research has examined the different stages of information seeking via search, the question of how political preferences and sociodemographic factors impact political online search has received less attention. In particular, the way in which attitudinal factors, such as sentiment toward a politician or interest in their personal life motivate information seeking have not been widely studied. We present findings from a panel study that combines browser tracking data with survey results for 1863 German participants. Our results suggest that both sympathy and antipathy toward a selection of popular politicians is predictive of searching for them. Queries also vary in their composition, with searches for female politicians highlighting their personal lives and physical attributes somewhat more often than for males. We conclude that the role of “soft” factors in motivating information seeking on political actors remains underexplored.",

It first outlines how socioeconomic factors promote blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. Against this background, and based on scholarship in cultural communication, anthropology, and critical platform studies, the article illustrates how sociocultural frames shape the interpretation and enactment of blockchain-based gameplay affordances. A Grounded Theory analysis of interviews and documents reveals that players identify persistent access and ownership as technical affordances, performing them through the cultural frame of cockfighting and its digital economy version, the side hustle. The study challenges universalist notions of Web3 adoption, highlighting how technical affordances both support and disrupt sociocultural and economic reproduction through narratives of family, competition, and inclusivity. The research calls for comparative studies on how platform corporations structure societies in emerging economies, how platforms exploit culture as use value, and how adopters strategically utilize Web3 technologies.",

    "abstract": "\n            While research has highlighted the ties between algorithms and culture, this article focuses on how cross-cultural encounters shape developers’ perceptions of their algorithmic work. I ask: How do cultural transitions and intercultural encounters influence people’s perceptions of their algorithms? How do key issues regarding algorithmic production get translated and reinterpreted? Based on 50 semi-structured interviews with Israelis who immigrated to Silicon Valley, I show that their interpretation of the cultural differences between Israeli and Silicon Valley cultures—and their culturally specific\n            logic of difference\n            —informs how they perceive the algorithms they develop and their ethical implications. I argue that these perceptions stem from deep-seated cultural tropes but are also potentially ameliorated by their encounter with Silicon Valley’s culture. Thus, this article calls for a more diverse view of Silicon Valley’s ideologies, showing that attention to cross-cultural encounters can both reveal and complicate the performative logics sustaining Silicon Valley’s liberal image.\n          ",

    "abstract": "Fake news represents a threat to our society since people can face unverified and sensational information. News media can play a crucial role in disclosing and correcting misinformation. This paper argues that higher media coverage can anticipate an increase in public attention to the issue of fake news. Such relationship can be moderated by the country’s economic conditions and by the type of media system. We provide an original dataset and perform regression models for panel data on 12 countries, spanning from January 2016 to December 2022. The results indicate that the public will pay higher attention to the issue of fake news when media coverage on these topics increases; during economic turmoil the positive association between media coverage and public attention is higher; furthermore, the role of media coverage is stronger in countries with public-backed media as state sponsorship of the media strengthens their agenda-setting power.",

Edtech provides a useful empirical object of study because of the increasing deployment of new digital technologies in educational organizations; our focus is on higher education institutions (i.e. universities) in the United Kingdom. The empirical analysis is split between a discussion of digital infrastructures and architectures of (data) assetization in higher education; the tensions arising between new digital infrastructures and legacy infrastructures in UK higher education institutions; and the implications of reconfiguring legacy infrastructures for UK universities. We pay particular attention to the creation of new techno-economic objects, especially the transformation of personal and user data into an asset, as datafication transforms higher education in unexpected and not necessarily beneficial ways.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the differential impacts of corrections, awareness prompts, and legal warnings on the endorsement of fact-checking information (through both “likes” and expressed support in associated comments) across three types of misinformation motivation (dread, wedge-driving, wish) on Weibo, a major Chinese social media platform. Through manual labeling and BERT (a pretrained large language model), we analyzed a cleaned dataset of 4,942 original fact-checking Weibo posts from 18 November 2010 to 31 May 2022, created or shared by Weibo Piyao. Results indicate that government posts or those with visual cues received fewer “likes” but garnered more supportive comments, while awareness prompts and legal warnings received more supportive comments across three misinformation types. This research provides valuable insights into the practice of fact-checking on social media, highlighting how different strategies may vary in their impact depending on the nature of the misinformation being addressed.",

    "abstract": "We gain exposure to news across a range of platforms and, within each platform, across a range of sources. How does a multi-platform media environment shape the news choices we make and the gaps that result from those choices? We address this question tracking news exposure across TV, the web, and YouTube for approximately 55,000 unique US panelists over a period of 39 months. We find important variations in the demographic profiles of those who choose to consume news within platforms and those who consume news across, casting light on the contingencies of news divides. We also show evidence of a systematic amplification effect: the slice of the population that chooses to consume news across platforms increases their overall levels of exposure, suggesting that a multi-platform media environment widens the gap between news consumers and those who decide to opt out.",

    "abstract": "Social media influencers (SMIs) are ordinary people who rise to fame via social media. These individuals have repeatedly been labeled as opinion leaders, but often without in-depth theoretical reflection. We fill this gap by introducing a novel typology that allows for greater scrutiny in the identification of different types of opinion leaders in the modern media environment. Using this typology, we adequately capture—for the first time—opinion leadership as practiced by actors like SMIs, describing them as Proximal Mass Opinion Leaders (short: ProMOLs). We highlight that—despite their reach—ProMOLs exert a seemingly interpersonal and horizontal influence by engaging in personalized communication with opinion followers in self-built networks. Furthermore, we theoretically model the various flows of communication between ProMOLs, their communities, and other actors in the public sphere, thereby illustrating the multiple layers of ProMOLs’ impact. Finally, we discuss the model’s implications and suggest directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "Protesters in recent years have been making a somewhat novel demand: they are asking journalists to blur their faces in news coverage of public demonstrations. This article investigates this demand to explore how new surveillance technologies and the political economy of media are complicating the ethics of visual journalism. Reviewing 26 articles from news outlets, trade publications, and blogs published between May 2020 and October 2024 that discussed protesters’ demand, the study considers three themes: visibility and surveillance in digital media; the ethical contradictions that visual journalists navigate while documenting dissent; and the relationships among journalists, movements, and political-economic power structures. The article contrasts Enlightenment ideals with an ethic of care to understand journalists’ views on transparency and truth, concluding that the uneven power dynamics among protesters, journalists and the state raise important questions about the documentation, preservation and circulation of dissent.",

The Software Development Kit (SDK) Data Audit is a mixed methodology that explores how personal data are accessed in apps using ChatGPT4o to account for how digital surveillance transpires via SDKs. Our research highlights that not all apps are equal amid ubiquitous datafication, with a disproportionate number of SDK services provided by Google, Meta, and Amazon. Our three key findings include: (1) an empirical approach for auditing SDKs; (2) a means to account for modular SDK infrastructure; and (3) the central role that App Events—micro-data points that map every action we make inside of apps—play in the data-for-service economy that SDKs enable. This work is intended to open up space for more critical research on the tracking infrastructures of datafication within our apps in any domain.",

With a focus on the English and Spanish-language Wikipedias and additional comparisons with the Arabic, Dutch, and French-language editions, our analysis presents a new perspective on Wikipedian self-governance. By paying attention to how Wikipedians designate the authority of rules through templates, we observed that an incredibly small number of editors use techniques to designate the sovereign authority of policies in ways that\n            determine\n            community consensus, rather than\n            reflect\n            it.

Building upon Guy Debord’s theory of the spectacle, I propose the concept of “platformed racial spectacle” to theorize such online phenomena: an aggregate of images voluntarily shared online, facilitated by the social media platform affordances and its sociality culture, fabricating the mythical connections between race, DNA, bodily traits, and geographies. Indicative of the racial structure and racial formations insidiously reified through such practices, the mobilization of racialization, semantics, and somatics can be found through the platformed racial spectacle and the collective practices of conjuring such a racial project. Contextualized in the subreddit r/23andme, I further explicate the emergence and existence of platformed racial spectacle, unfurl its texture and format, and expound its spectacular functionality of unification and alteration.",

    "abstract": "\n            Mobile dating apps (MDA) are popular for intimate encounters, but romantic rejection is common, and can drive surveillance using information from social media. Awareness cues convey digital information about others’ activities, but their link with rejection is underexplored. This study explores the uses of awareness cues in mobile dating applications (MDAs) in relation to rejection, social surveillance and post-digital safety. Using a 1-month diary study with eight participants of diverse gender and sexual identities, we identify a grammar of awareness cues that helps users interpret others’ intentions, manage relational uncertainty (e.g. ghosting) and navigate rejection. While awareness cues convey helpful information, they also expose users to social surveillance or even stalking. Since ‘incognito mode’ is a premium affordance on most MDAs, participants developed creative\n            invisibility strategies\n            to restrict access to social surveillance mechanisms.\n          ",

    "abstract": "Webcam sex platforms represent an important sector of the creator economy. Yet, there is a great scarcity of research on revenue flows and performer income. To address this, we collected and analyzed a dataset comprising 2 weeks of tips received by performers on Chaturbate, a prominent camming platform. Our findings reveal that income is highly unevenly distributed, with only a small group of mostly female performers collecting earnings resembling a living wage. Countering the commonly held notion that algorithmic front-page visibility is the main indicator of performer “success,” we demonstrate that “alternative visibility” modes are sustainable and performers find their niche audiences. However, they often precariously rely on a few generous tippers, that is, “whales.” We conclude that while various pathways to financial success exist, performers remain reliant on platform affordances and audiences they have little control over.",

    "abstract": "In 2010, the EU Kids Online project, and aligned AU Kids Online study, interviewed one parent and one child (9–16) from 25,542 families across 26 countries. Information gathered included parents’ awareness of their child’s experiences of sexual content online. This dataset has since been updated by recent ethnographic work in Australia and Ireland, capturing parents’ approaches to managing their children’s (11–17) digital engagement with sexual content. Parents identified risks and benefits in their children’s encounters with adult content online. This article concludes that parents do not judge the efficacy of their digital parenting around preventing their child from seeing restricted 18+ content or, indeed, knowing whether their child has encountered sexual content online. Instead, they adopt a nuanced approach that reflects knowledge of their child and the child’s relative maturity, with a view to supporting their child’s progressive development towards full digital and sexual citizenship.",

Employing a single case study methodology – namely, exploring exchanges made on r/StableDiffusion, a known subgroup on Reddit – it illustrates the conceptual parameters of the Undersphere, outlines the potential for creative harm within the GenAI space, and counters these elements against the AI regulatory frameworks found within the EU AI Act. It concludes that a risk management framework that provides a more fluid approach to addressing risks, such as those found in governance frameworks aimed at eradicating climate change, could be better positioned to address insecurities manifesting from the GenAI space.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the management of affective labor on E-Pal, a US-based gaming freelancer platform where gig workers provide companionship and intimacy to clients during gaming. Based on interviews with 27 workers, the research reveals that E-Pal prioritizes emotional connection over gaming skills. The platform uses authenticity expectations, performance evaluations, and gamification to regulate workers’ emotional interactions with customers. The findings also highlight how E-Pal’s algorithmic visibility disproportionately favors Asian and Latina female workers, reinforcing gender and racial stereotypes for economic gain. A tiered governance system rewards high-performing workers with greater agency and financial benefits, while lower-tier workers often experience precarity. This study also illustrates the toll of constant emotional availability, particularly for minority groups and non-US workers who face physical and mental health challenges without adequate institutional support.",

    "abstract": "The present study sampled online daters to (a) inductively explore their motives for meeting a potential partner for face-to-face (FtF)-like interaction (i.e. a modality switch [MS]); (b) examine modality-switching motives and pre-MS modality expansion in relation to MS channel choice (e.g. video chat or in person); and (c) investigate whether MS motives, degree of pre-MS modality expansion, and MS channel are associated with partners going on a second FtF-like date. Results revealed that online daters possessed both relational (i.e. romantic, sexual, and platonic companionship) and information-seeking (i.e. fact-checking and exploration) MS motives. Holding the MS in person was associated with romantic, sexual, and platonic companionship motives, whereas meeting through video chat was associated with fact-checking motives and the degree of pre-MS channel expansion. Romantic MS motives and having held the MS through video chat were both associated with online daters going on a second FtF-like date.",

    "abstract": "Porn studies have a long tradition of researching porn as a cultural artifact in relation to adult audiences. Recently, there has been increasing interest in young people’s uses and perceptions of porn since there is a general concern about its possible harms and dangers. This article aims to shed light on these issues through an ethnographic study carried out in Barcelona and its metropolitan area. Our main objective is to understand how teenagers and young people use, experience, and give meaning to the porn content they consume. We applied a bottom-up approach that brings the real and everyday experiences of young people to the discussion. The results focus on three areas: the spatial, temporal, and media context in which young people approach porn; their own interpretations of pornographic content, considering gender differences; and the double preventive and educational view young people extract from porn.",

    "abstract": "Drawing on Reinforcing Spirals Model theory and longitudinal network analysis methods, we analyse the co-evolution of climate change communication network and online expressive participation around climate policy issues on China’s top social media platform Weibo (2019–2021). We find a mutual influence between actors’ engagement in communication relationships and their participatory behaviours over time. However, this dynamic does not operate at the individual level. Active/popular actors in the communication network do not necessarily become more participatory later, nor does higher participation significantly lead to greater activity/popularity in the subsequent time point. Instead, this dynamic is characterized by concurrent homogeneity-based network selection and network influence processes. Model results show that actors with similar participation levels are more likely to form future communication ties and actors with existing communication ties are more likely to converge in participation levels over time. This indicates a homogeneity-based reciprocal influence between network connections and individual engagement. We also find that endogenous network structural factors play a significant role in shaping people’s engagement with climate change communication. These findings underscore the importance of the social relational dimension in the dynamic interplay between communication and online expressive participation, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of the Reinforcing Spirals Model theory.",

    "abstract": "\n            All mainstream social media platforms now use algorithms to display recommended content, and some (e.g. Instagram, LinkedIn) have started showing what we call\n            algorithmic transparency cues\n            about why certain posts are recommended. However, little is known about what cues users see on their own feeds and how they experience them. Thus, using an online survey (\n            N\n             = 515) of adult U.S. social media users, we gathered data about two research questions: (1) What types of algorithmic cues users find in their own feeds, and (2) their experiences with algorithms and their transparency. Content analysis of user-submitted screenshots and cue descriptions shows that most transparency cues refer to users’ behaviors, behaviors of others in their network, and sponsored posts. Furthermore, open-ended responses indicate that users have critical opinions about algorithms, calling for greater algorithmic transparency on social media, and offering suggestions for researchers and platform designers moving forward.\n          ",

This online experiment (\n            N\n             = 461) examines cognitive (perceived acceptability), affective (negative emotions), and behavioral (intervention intentions) responses to varyingly hostile comments (impolite vs uncivil vs intolerant) directed at a female science communicator with different ethnic (Black vs White) and LGBTQIA+ identity cues (heterosexual vs homosexual vs trans), thus shedding light on intersectional identities comprising social group affiliations with varying levels of marginalization. While intolerance triggered stronger emotional reactions than impoliteness and incivility (likely due to its discriminatory nature), participants were, somewhat paradoxically, more inclined to act (and advocated for more institutional action) against incivility. Furthermore, ethnic cues had a much stronger influence than LGBTQIA+ identity cues across response domains.\n          ",

    "abstract": "This article examines Spotify’s engagement with East-Central European (ECE) music markets, exploring how platformization intersects with peripherality. Using insights from the political economy of global media and platform studies, it situates Spotify within the asymmetrical geographies of platform capitalism, where peripheral regions are more consumption markets than cultural centers. While Spotify emphasizes egalitarian access through playlisting and algorithmic tools, the findings reveal persistent inequalities shaped by “spatial gatekeeping.” Focusing on how regional actors, mediating between artists and the platform, experience these inequalities, the article draws on interviews and “scavenging” ethnography to develop a typology of “platform intermediaries,” including regional playlist editors, digital distributors, major label representatives, and music creators. These intermediaries internalize spatial gatekeeping in their practices and platform imaginaries, which reflect perceived distance from geographic and algorithmic centers and aspirations to transcend peripherality. The article offers a nuanced account of platform geography’s asymmetries as experienced from the periphery.",

Our results indicate that most respondents conceptualize personalization as a functional process of social media platforms seeking to deliver relevant information, while a small but vocal number of users claim algorithms are designed not to personalize content but rather to enact an ideological agenda. Our findings, which include real-time user responses to algorithms, suggest that algorithms do not simply radicalize unsuspecting users but, rather, are negotiated to reveal a more complex digital landscape.\n          ",

Quantitative analyses showed different forms of online gambling, participation in gambling communities online, and instant loans associated with increased problem gambling. Qualitative analyses revealed that gamblers were drawn to gambling sites through an online ecosystem including complex social and monetary incentive structures and sought instant loans through dedicated websites to continue gambling. Together, the results show that gamblers’ problems have deepened and become more multifaceted due to online environments. The online realm enables gambling through ubiquitous opportunity, targeted marketing, social influence, and access to gambling credit, although it also offers information and peer support groups to help gamblers abstain.\n          ",

    "abstract": "Wayfair, an American furniture and home goods retailer, garnered sudden attention across social media in 2020, particularly Twitter and Reddit, due to a conspiracy theory linking the company to child trafficking. The short-lived, well-delineated nature of this theory, coupled with its simultaneous emergence across multiple platforms, makes it a distinct case for studying the dynamics of online conspiracy development and spread. Using intermedia agenda-setting theory and computational approaches, we analyzed 1.2 million posts to explore cross-platform interactions. We examined how platform affordances shaped discourse and enabled the conspiracy’s dissemination. Reddit’s anonymity and detailed discussions sustained narratives, while Twitter amplified emotional content and broadened the audience. Hourly time-series analysis reveals a bidirectional influence: Reddit set thematic agendas that Twitter amplified, while Twitter’s emotional content shaped Reddit’s discussions. These findings shed light on the digital development of child abuse conspiracy theories while advancing the understudied aspects of intermedia agenda-setting literature.",

    "abstract": "This article explores how the political–economic balancing of state interests and potential state intervention influences everyday perceptions of platform companies in China. We introduce the term “flexibility imaginary” to describe the adaptability and responsiveness exhibited by our research participants in Hangzhou amid changing conditions and unforeseen transitions. Focusing on the flexibility imaginary aids in unpacking the assumptions, values, and expectations embedded in how societies deal with uncertainty and transformation. By zooming in on the notion of replaceability as a key feature of the flexibility imaginary, we explain how platform companies have become integral yet are still seen as transient elements of daily life. We demonstrate that while the flexibility imaginary shapes local interpretations and political dynamics, it does not challenge the state–corporate digital paradigm that underpins everyday existence. Understanding these limits is crucial for exploring future developments.",

    "abstract": "This article introduces a special issue exploring emerging empirical approaches to studying infrastructures for datafication and their social, political, and economic implications. The merits of empirical research on infrastructures for datafication are drawn out across seven articles offering diverse methodological entry points to develop our understanding of how datafication processes operate across everyday life settings, sectors, and institutions. The contributions span multiple levels of infrastructural analysis, from tracking ecologies to digital platforms and chatbots. They also cover a range of core questions regarding the relationship and power dynamics between private and public institutions, and between big technology companies and everyday citizenhood. In illuminating how infrastructures for datafication operate, for whom and with what ends, the special issue extends a fruitful dialogue between infrastructure studies and people-centric approaches to datafication and opens avenues for infrastructure research across disciplines to create more coherent understandings of how specific technological operations shape social life.",

    "abstract": "\n            In 2024, Oxford University Press made ‘brain rot’ – a piece of teenage slang found primarily on the popular video sharing application TikTok – its\n            word of the year\n            . This announcement was received by a public discourse of media panic wherein ‘brain rot’ was understood primarily as a threat to young people’s mental and physical wellbeing. This article seeks to challenge this discourse, building on the participatory approach to children’s media scholarship to argue instead that ‘brain rot’ constitutes a complex, and historically situated,\n            genre of participation\n            . Drawing on empirical data from seven TikTok workshops with 16- and 17-year-olds in Oslo, ‘brain rot’ is conceptualised as a collection of related practices that (1) are childish or unserious, (2) provide no cognitive or developmental benefit, and (3) are deliberately non-productive. In this way, it can be understood as a\n            decompression-driven\n            genre of participation whereby young people actively resist the pressures of productivity and self-optimisation.\n          ",

The results showed that by utilizing the technological infrastructure provided by Weibo, FoN effectively brought the EPIL debate into the public sphere and media spotlight. The sensitive capture of changes in the policy environment enabled FoN to develop a flexible campaign repertoire that maintained the campaign’s continuity and visibility. The results also showed that Weibo blurred the boundaries between the private and public spheres. By merging personal reputation with the movement’s practices, FoN underscored the legitimacy and importance of the organization’s efforts. Moreover, the immediacy and anonymity offered by Weibo facilitate fluid transitions between protest spaces, effectively addressing asymmetrical visibility challenges.",

This essay situates the topic of this special issue—adolescents’ perceptions of harm from accessing online sexual content—within a broader context of the discourses and practices that inform research in this field. We show how discourses of harm and risk circulate around the figure of the innocent child in need of protection and argue for more nuanced understandings of and research about childhood that take into account the lived experiences and perspectives of young people themselves. The papers in this special issue cover a range of academic perspectives and reflect diverse epistemological, methodological, and academic cultures.

Based on in-depth interviews with 25 users, we identified four engagement statuses—High SoA Use, Low SoA Use, High SoA Nonuse, and Low SoA Nonuse—and two strategic transitions: Disengagement and Reengagement. These transitions illustrate users’ reflective processes regarding past behaviors and highlight deliberate efforts to regain control over platform use. Our findings reveal a complex interplay between user autonomy and algorithmic influence, highlighting the psychological mechanisms underpinning user-driven adaptations. By exploring users’ psychological coping strategies, this study positions user agency as central to fostering sustainable interactions with algorithmic platforms. By advancing our understanding of algorithmic engagement, this research emphasizes user autonomy and offers actionable insights into strategic adaptations, digital wellness, and algorithmic literacy, suggesting the value of mindful social media use.\n          ",

Building on the sensemaking theory, this study employs semi-structured interviews to explore how individuals make sense of astrology short videos on Douyin to navigate identity and intimacy. Findings illustrate how individuals interpret these videos to construct an “Imagined Self” that merges collective meanings with personal interpretations. Douyin acts as a “Holy Technology,” enabling algorithmic interactions that reinforce spiritual narratives. In addition, the regulated nature of astrology content on Douyin prompts users to demonstrate agency in creatively negotiating and adapting astrological meanings within China’s unique sociopolitical context.

These cultural ideals are particularly appealing in the context of growing digitally mediated interactions, as the symbolic and relational boundaries between these femininities are becoming more fluid. Drawing on 32 in-depth interviews with Romanian content creators on TikTok, I highlight the intersectional, symbolic, and discursive character through which different types of femininity define online success and popularity. Women who approximate the hegemonic locations of femininity were found to practice\n            privileged experiencing\n            of TikTok’s affordances. These users already endorse affluence, heteronormativity, and knowledge premiums, which gives them an advantage in becoming popular on TikTok. However, women in disadvantaged intersectional locations tend to practice a\n            resistant assimilation\n            of TikTok’s affordances, as they tend to borrow but also criticize certain strategies from privileged users.

This study aimed to explore how adolescents themselves understood harm and risk from pornography use. Thirteen male adolescents, 14 to 15 years old, were interviewed using in-depth interviews to understand their perspectives of risk and harm. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to identify three pertinent themes: pornography is risky and harmful, especially to naïve consumers; pornography is not harmful to me, because strategies of control can be used; and generational disparity, where differences between adult claims of harm and personal experiences were questioned. We propose adolescents’ concern for others’ wellbeing over their personal risks be considered as showing compassion. We conclude that adolescent perceptions of risk and harm are nuanced and insightful, and that adolescents can engage critically with pornography content to manage potential risks and harm.",

The network analysis reveals distinct clusters of politically homogeneous networks or “political echo chambers” where users were exposed to attitude-consistent political TikTok content. Furthermore, through digital trace data, we found that users with strong political views and positive social feedback are more likely to share their political opinions on the platform. This research emphasizes TikTok’s growing importance as a hub for political engagement, as well as its potential polarization effects.

    "abstract": "Research on knowledge collaboration in Wikipedia has predominately focused on metadata at the article level or editor-centric analyses, often overlooking the complexities of knowledge collaboration and its contextual dependencies. This study takes a novel, fine-grained approach to investigating revision mechanisms in Wikipedia’s knowledge collaboration. By considering modified sentences as carriers of collective knowledge and spaces in which epistemic power is negotiated, it reconstructs their revision sequences and examines how editorial, contextual, content, and temporal factors shape Wikipedia’s revision dynamics. A total of 140,593 revisions (by 48,643 editors) of 76,525 sentences in 537 Wikipedia articles related to climate change were analyzed using text mining, natural language processing, survival analysis, and meta-analysis. The findings expand our understanding of how epistemic power is negotiated through collective endeavors underlying bureaucratic rules and community moderation in Wikipedia.",

    "abstract": "Visual art is increasingly created by generative artificial intelligence (generative AI). This study, conducted online with 470 US participants, investigated whether exposure to art attributed to AI may influence aesthetic appreciation, perceptions of AI mind, and evaluations of AI (acceptance of AI as an artist, evaluation of AI as an identity and realistic threat) and of art careers. Exposure to art introduced as generated by AI (vs a human artist) reduced appreciation. No significant impact was observed on the other dependent variables. For ostensibly AI-generated art, higher appreciation was associated with more acceptance toward AI as an artist and lower levels of AI realistic threat. This suggests that mere exposure to art attributed to AI may not be sufficient to induce a change in perceptions of AI mind, evaluations of AI and of art careers, but these effects might occur if AI-attributed art is appreciated aesthetically.",

    "abstract": "The affordances of Internet distribution have substantially expanded the array of video that is part of the everyday video cultures of many across the globe. Scholarly frames now need to integrate “hosted video” – video distributed without licensing agreements on services such as YouTube and TikTok and through social media – into broader conceptualization of viewing cultures. Hosted video encompasses a broad and diverse range of content and represents a new “subfield” of video use best understood as a part of a broader field of use including legacy video sources (moviegoing and television). This article first explains hosted video as a subfield, then identifies distinct “encounters” enabled by the various features offered by social media and hosted video services. It then draws from focus groups and interview findings to highlight four common uses that indicate considerable consistency with other types of viewing that supports the holistic video field we advocate.",

    "abstract": "This article critically examines the social implications of data infrastructures designed to moderate contested content categories such as disinformation. It does so in the context of new online safety regulation (e.g. the EU Digital Services Act) that pushes digital platforms to improve how they tackle both illegal and ‘legal but harmful’ content. In particular, we investigate and conceptualise X’s Community Notes, a tool that uses ‘human-AI cooperation’ to add context to tweets, as a data infrastructure for ‘soft moderation’. We find that Community Notes is limited when dealing with under-acknowledged online harms, such as those derived from the intersection between disinformation and humour. While research points to the potential of content moderation solutions that combine automation with humans-in-the-loop, we show how this approach can fail when disinformation is poorly defined in policy and practice.",

    "abstract": "This article explores the notion of the child as found in the growing body of research on child influencer culture. While much of the existing literature adopts a reductionist and risk-focused perspective, this article explores the complexities and variations of the child figure in this field. Through an empirical case study of a successful Swedish child influencer, we highlight how multiple representations of ‘the child’ – as professional, creative, vulnerable, and marketing subject – can coexist within a single campaign. Theoretically, we draw on complexity theory, the concept of multiplicity and the feminist idea of ‘staying with the troubles’. We argue for a more nuanced approach to studying child influencers by embracing the uncertainties and challenges involved, and acknowledge that influencing is only one of many roles children occupy in their lives. This approach encourages thinking about children in dynamic, interconnected ways, recognising the fluidity of their roles across time, space and context.",

To date, little research has investigated the role of digital media in sharing ED experiences and promoting recovery for autistic individuals, despite high autism rates among those with EDs and the potential for social media (SM) to provide resources and support for adolescent girls and young women living with EDs. Given this gap, we undertook an exploratory study to assess content pertaining to autistic people’s difficulties with food and eating on the leading SM app TikTok. We identified four main themes: (a) EDs and autism; (b) cognitive, sensory, and behavioral dimensions of autistic eating and body issues; (c) social, cultural, and economic aspects of autistic people’s food challenges; and (d) self-reported role of TikTok in autistic individuals’ coping with food/eating difficulties. Our study contributes several novel findings to research on digital media, mental health, and marginalized populations.",

    "abstract": "This article asks how our capacities to conduct critical research on digital power are influenced by depending, empirically and methodologically, on powerful market actors controlling the underlying research infrastructure. Building on discussions at the intersection between digital methods, political economy and infrastructure studies, we zoom in on three cases of widely used commercial data tools and repositories for academic studies. Mapping out their methods and applications, we ask of each case: Who owns and offers it? What is (not) measured? And, how is it mobilized in existing research? We thereby explore how they each contribute to the construction of knowledge by setting the standards for measuring, monitoring and ultimately regulating digital power. We conclude that the constructions of digital research infrastructures should be placed at the centre of our investigations – as objects of analysis and as research findings in and by themselves.",

In this article, we consider two cases of public sector chatbots, one in Estonia and one in Sweden, seeking to challenge the seemingly coherent understanding of artificial intelligence (AI) in the public sector. The aim is to both question the “thingness” of AI and show AI chatbots can be very different things. The material in this article is based on in-depth interviews and observations at public sector institutions that have relatively recently implemented chatbots. We employ the notion of AI frictions as a sensitizing concept to engage with the material and the diverging character of the public sector chatbots in the two countries. In the analysis, we identify AI frictions related to expectations of AI, organizational logics, as well as values connected with the digitalization of the public sector.",

    "abstract": "Democracy festivals are events that aim to strengthen democracy by engaging citizens, politicians and organisations in dialogue and provide a more equal access to the agenda. In recent years, social media have become important arenas for agenda building, supposedly equalising the access to such processes. This article uncovers patterns of activity and visibility in agenda building through an actor-centric study of the official X/Twitter hashtag of a Swedish democracy festival. We analyse all tweets containing the hashtag #almedalen for four election years and find that levels of activity in the hashtag are connected to the visibility of elite actors. We see a cycle of development concerning visibility in the hashtag over time with early adopters dominating the beginning of the period, establishment actors in the middle and right-wing populist actors at the end. There is little evidence of the hashtag as an equalising factor in agenda building. We discuss these findings in relation to the position of X/Twitter as an arena for opinion formation.",

This study (\n            n\n             = 293) explores the association of OnlyFans usage—including viewing and interaction—with different types of satisfaction: sexual self-esteem, relational satisfaction with sexual partners, and sexual satisfaction. The study also examined the role of upward comparisons (e.g. comparing oneself to performers, comparing sexual partners to performers, and comparing one’s sex life to depicted performances) in these dynamics. Contrary to expectations based on previous pornography research, the data revealed a positive relationship between OnlyFans use and satisfaction through upward comparisons. The findings suggest that OnlyFans use was associated with upward comparisons with content creators, which in turn may relate to increased sexual knowledge, skill development, and inspiration.\n          ",

This study explores influencers’ social cause communication to understand message attributes, which may be catalysts in increasing public attention to the message and engagement in social causes. Data from Instagram were collected, and data mining with sentiment and semantic network analyses was conducted to discover the patterns of sentiments and themes used in influencers’ social cause communication. The results were then compared with the corporate social responsibility (CSR) communication framework proposed by a previous study. Influencers’ message contents comparable to effective CSR communication were found, as well as their distinct features (e.g. emotional expressions with sentimental words and product promotions). The study provides a foundational understanding of influencers’ communication practices, which may contribute to future research investigating the impacts of those message factors on public perceptions.",

    "title": "Young people and sexually explicit content online: Exploring Australian parents’ concerns",
    "abstract": "Ongoing discussion between parents and their children, including listening to young people, is essential to enable young people to safely navigate the online sexual ecosystem. Research suggests, however, that parents and their children conceptualise and discuss online risks in different ways. This article documents findings from interviews and focus groups with 40 Australian parents exploring their perspectives and concerns about online pornography, and provides insights into the extent to which the adults report listening to and engaging with young people. It reveals that while parents are concerned about online pornography, most do not know what their children are doing online and do not appear to be discussing the issue with their children in ways which explore their children’s experiences, perspectives and concerns. It concludes by suggesting that education about online pornography be extended to parents so that they are better able to support young people in navigating the online sexual ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "\n            In the so-called\n            post-truth\n            age and the rise of social media, news circulates widely and quickly, leading to information overload. In this context, individuals experiencing high issue involvement tend to engage more with information. Literature has recently focused on news literacy interventions to protect people from fake news. However, few have addressed these initiatives’ immediate and differential effects simultaneously on young adults’ vulnerability to deception. Through three experiments involving undergraduate university students in France, we demonstrate that intervention-based educational methods can mitigate the impact of issue involvement on belief in fake news. Yet, they do not enable individuals to protect themselves in the long run and may even prove counterproductive by triggering information overload. Our study contributes to the research investigating preventive practices to help users arm themselves against fake news in media communication, social media, and social marketing.\n          ",

    "abstract": "The evolving technological and social landscape offers adolescents new avenues for engaging with digital content, particularly in the realm of intimate activities. Public discourse often oversimplifies the intricate relationship between adolescents and online pornography. The prevailing narrative tends to portray pornography as detrimental to health and well-being, relying on a limited exposure and effects model that fails to grasp its nuanced significance in young lives. Online pornography, easily accessible to young individuals, is criticised for potentially replacing informative sex education with representations of violent and risky relationships. Employing media and cultural studies tools, this research positions porn consumption within the broader context of new mediated intimacies. The study aims to unravel how young Italians (15- to 18-year-olds) perceive and interpret harms in relation to online pornography. Findings reveal that despite a critical perspective, many participants maintain stereotypical views on gender and age dynamics, reflecting broader societal discourses about effects and addiction.",

    "abstract": "Self-media entrepreneurs from marginalised communities face unique challenges in the rapidly evolving global creative industries. This study examines the lived experiences of Deaf creators on Douyin, China’s leading short-video platform, highlighting how they navigate the socio-technical and economic pressures shaping their labour experiences. Drawing on the ethnographic approach, we uncover the tension between the platform’s promise of visibility and the reality of constrained creative autonomy. Deaf creators are frequently compelled to conform to hearing-centric and commercially driven norms, leading to the commodification of Deaf identity and the reinforcement of Deaf stereotypes. Such practices not only normalise societal insensitivity towards Deaf culture but also reduce sign language to superficial and dismissive representations. By applying Callon’s concept of socio-technical agencements, our study critically examines how platform architectures enable and constrain the creative agency of marginalised groups. Our findings reveal how platform labour perpetuates systemic inequalities for Deaf creators, reinforcing cultural subordination and economic dependence within a hearing-centric digital space.",

    "abstract": "While digital platforms foster a sense of community and identity, they also facilitate harmful exclusionary practices. In this context, toxic and hateful speech are key mechanisms not only for harming others but also marking processes of othering and belonging. In this article, we examine the role of hateful and toxic speech in structuring processes of in- and out-group formation and maintenance by focusing on a public Colombian Telegram group. More specifically, we examine how members use toxic speech to position themselves and others in relation to narratives emerging from the group by analyzing 3221 posts with high levels of toxicity. Our analysis yields insights into the complex and paradoxical uses of antisocial behavior on social media platforms. Overall, the findings of this study deepen our understanding of the social gratifications that underlie how hate and toxic speech are used to disenfranchise individuals.",

    "abstract": "Immersive multi-user virtual reality (VR) enables users to embody a first-person avatar and through them enact agency over their virtual self-representations and identities. Moreover, these visual representations can profoundly impact users’ thinking and behaviour. Despite this, there is a dearth of understanding of how opportunities to create an avatar versus using a preassigned one might affect users. One of the first pre-registered multi-user collaborative VR experiments, this mixed-method study investigates how customisation agency affects self-perceptions, and what role individual and avatar style differences play in this relationship. Results are limited but suggestive of VR avatars potentially serving as an empowerment tool through taking control over shaping one’s self-image, with interacting influences from self-discrepancy perceptions and avatar styles. Moreover, this article highly emphasises the complex relationships between intra- and interpersonal aspects of experiences. Implications are considered in terms of various contextual aspects and individual experiences and differences.",

    "abstract": "Sweden has increasingly come into international far right focus, and digital media sites in the United States have proven especially active in spreading mis- and disinformative narratives about the country. Using social network analysis and descriptive statistics, we trace 776 links over a 27 year-period to understand how U.S. far-right media sites construct the idea of Sweden as ‘the rape capital’ of the world. The article makes several contributions as it pertains both to the technological and ideological functions of citing for digital far-right media. We highlight the (lack of) timeliness of sourcing, the role of mainstream sources for repurposing and amplification, and practices of exaggeration and pseudo-legitimisation. Against the backdrop of our findings, we suggest the need for approaching digital far-right media information practices as more complex and subtle than they have previously been conceived, and highlight the necessity to problematise misinformation as a label for misrepresentation in digital far-right media.",

In addition, this study expands on the original by including a fifth question examining the intersection of representations within videogames. Using a sample of the top 100 best-selling boxed videogames of 2017 from four console platforms, this study compares its findings to the 2017 US Census demographic estimates as well as to findings of the original study. The results of the study are similar to those of the original, but the intersectional analysis shows an over-representation of white adult male characters, specifically, and an under-representation of Black female characters of any age group. This study discusses potential reasons for the slow progress made in videogame representations and the need for more intersectional analyses on videogames.",

Applying Beck’s concept of the “risk biography,” we explore the way these digital narratives recount encounters with pornography in a setting intended to reach other young people. The analysis combines computational text analysis with manual analyses to characterize how young people tell their own stories. Findings suggest that while content creators critically address sexual norms, they also reinforce the Internet’s potential for harm. Yet, the greatest risk identified is not pornography itself, but parents—namely, the threat of punishment, including physical punishment.",

    "abstract": "Journalists’ social media use is a recent example of long-standing gaps between journalistic discourse and journalistic practice. This manuscript applies the sociological concept of rationalization to explain the persistence of this gap, theorizing that the need for rational explanations of one’s work is so powerful for journalists that they offer one description publicly, or to their bosses, while practicing something different. We apply rationalization theory to reflect on journalism’s love affair with Twitter, now that many journalists and their organizations have deprioritized the platform. In interviews, journalists indeed could readily offer rational explanations for Twitter’s use and purpose in journalism, but further questions revealed that common practices didn’t serve the stated purposes; instead, journalists’ attachment to the platform was primarily relational. We argue humans’ inherent sociality, individuals’ response to a field in crisis, and journalism’s acute need for social validation may contribute to this disconnect.",

This article extends a theorization of “the virtual” developing from earlier approaches in feminist sociology and digital media studies, to consider the implications of selfie-editing capacities for how young people navigate selfhood in contemporary visual cultures. We draw on qualitative data, including in-depth semi-structured interviews and participatory selfie-editing group workshops which used an innovative “smartphone live capture” method, where participants screen recorded on their smartphones and narrated how they edit selfies in real time to understand how bodies materialize through the everyday technologies of visual culture. We theorize that editing apps facilitate a “virtual gaze” that can create new ways of sensing embodiment, producing both intensified self-scrutiny and a seemingly increasingly plastic virtual and physical body, available for remaking according to intensifying demands for visual perfection.",

    "abstract": " Public and vocal calls by Algerian feminist groups to revise restrictive laws about women during the 2019 Hirak (“protest” in Arabic) were met with physical and online violence from both pro-government and reformist groups. Theories considering the role of public spaces in advancing democratic efforts differ on strategy and method for inclusion of marginalized voices. Through structured open-ended questionnaires with Algerian feminist demonstrators, this study probes the perceived efficacy of various democratic-advancing tactics. Findings show a reticence on the part of Algerian feminists in cultivating open social media spaces or efforts to assimilate into a single public and echo previous findings of those advocating for a more disputed perspective on democracy.

    "title": "Affordances-in-Practice: How Social Norm Dynamics in Climate Change Publics Are Shaped on Instagram and Twitter",
    "abstract": " Social norms are flexible regulating forces of human behavior. They are shaped by humans, whose actions in turn are shaped by their environment, including the online social spaces they venture into. The objective of this research is to create an understanding of how the affordances of social media platforms shape social norm dynamics in online publics, particularly in climate change publics. For this purpose, we make a comparative analysis of the practices of users on Instagram and Twitter that engage with climate change content. We conducted 22 in-depth interviews with a purposively selected sample of worldwide Twitter and Instagram users. We investigated how each platform’s specific affordances shape the participants’ sense of community and how they participate in social norm enforcement and contestation, also called “callouts.” This “affordances-in-practice” perspective brings observations on the differences in how users can actualize the novel affordances of “interventionability” and “external visibility” on both platforms. This research provides a deeper insight into the socio-technical processes underlying the (self-)organization of social movements and provides a pathway to investigating discursive practices of online publics on other platforms. The study avoids debating which norms should prevail over others in the online climate discussion, but does reflect on the negative impact that certain outcomes of norm enforcement and contestation might have on democratic deliberation on climate change. The main findings are that actualizing these affordances on Twitter anno 2023 makes climate discourse sensitive to group-loyalties, whereas on Instagram it makes it dependent on norm leaders in the form of content creators.

It confirms a positive relationship between Facebook political information experiences and overconfidence in political understanding. However, contrary to expectations, there is a positive relationship between overconfidence and traditional media use. An exploratory post hoc analysis, viewed through the lens of truth vs. false-default orientations, suggests overconfident users might use traditional news outlets to confirm their sense of knowledge, thereby exhibiting a false-default orientation on social media political information.

    "abstract": " Drawing on figured worlds and geographies of selves frameworks, we use critical ethnographic methods to explore three Latina teenagers’ experiences and ideas about social media and identity that were expressed throughout a Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR) project. While their discussions show a clear awareness that these sites are often inaccurate and biased, teenagers still admit to comparing themselves with others online and feeling disconnected. By sharing stories about racial and linguistic discrimination in virtual spaces, participants highlight how many social inequities are being reproduced online. However, they also express optimism that social media has potential to offer new ways to connect with their communities and express multifaceted identities. Their experiences highlight a need for intentional opportunities in our schools and communities to critically reflect on ways that technology positions us and explore our power to redefine these roles.

I analyze these reveal videos, their comment threads, and the role of YouTube in hosting these videos, to capture the popular discourse around the relationship between DNA and racial identity. By employing critical technocultural discourse analysis (CTDA), I explore how Caribbean content creators discuss racial identity, and how online discourses negotiate, codify, or disrupt neoliberal notions of racial authenticity. I focus on videos made by creators who self-identify as being from the Caribbean or of the Caribbean diaspora. By bringing the Caribbean existentialist thought of Stuart Hall and Édouard Glissant into my analysis, I explore how Caribbean creators employ what C. Rhonda Cobham-Sander deems “the Creole imagination” to interrogate notions of racial authenticity while de-/re-constructing racial identity in digital spaces. ",

This special issue critically engages with existing discussions by adopting a broad political-economic perspective on the platform economy in China. Aiming to deconstruct and contextualize the dominant concepts of “platformization” and “infrastructuralization,” we focus on three central themes under the overarching framework of\n            Digital China\n            : “Platform cum Infrastructure along a Techno-developmental Path,” “Platform Governance,” and “Platform Spatiality and Geopolitics.” These themes collectively deepen our understanding of the temporal and spatial dynamics of platforms, as well as their conceptual significance as evolving processes and outcomes. More importantly, we highlight how the development of Chinese platforms reflects not only the contours of China’s contested integration into global capitalism but also the state’s shifting socio-economic priorities and its broader aspiration to establish a distinct “Chinese model of modernization.”\n          ",

    "title": "Mobilization and Latency Dynamics in the #StopLine3 Discourse",
    "abstract": "After the Canadian oil corporation Enbridge proposed replacing its Line 3 pipeline in 2014, activists began protesting against its environmental risks and violations of Indigenous rights, among other concerns. As the pipeline’s construction progressed and resistance intensified, a parallel discourse emerged online under the hashtag #StopLine3. This study explores the temporal evolution of that discourse and its alignment with on-the-ground developments. Specifically, we assess whether the discourse conforms to a phasic model of collective action inspired by Melucci, which contends that social movements oscillate between phases of visibility and latency. This oscillation is mediated by key mobilizing events, which drive activists to focus their energy toward fighting a target. Once a resolution is reached (positive or negative), the movement progresses into a latent phase, where participants regroup, reflect, and build unity. The ideas behind this model were developed before the digital turn. Given how social media complicates temporality, it remains unclear how well the model explains discursive resistance online. We use #StopLine3 as a case study to test the phasic model, examining all tweets with the hashtag posted between 2016 and 2023. We break up the data into temporal segments based on peaks and lulls in overall activity and explore how both tweet content and forms of engagement shift from segment to segment. In line with the model, we find that the shifts between segments are mediated by key events; however, we also find that the Twitter discourse consistently favors mobilization-oriented forms of engagement and content over latency. Our results suggest that Twitter primarily facilitates mobilization work, and call into question the importance of latency work, what it looks like, and where it takes place on platforms such as Twitter. We argue that Twitter may not be an effective venue for latency processes, or alternatively, may alter how those processes manifest. Overall, we trouble the application of the phasic model to #StopLine3 and other similar public-facing discourses.",

Adopting a multi-level approach, we put the spotlight on how states, platforms and laborers interact with each other when states and platforms impose their controls over overseas laborers. Drawing on 47 in-depth interviews, surveys and online data collected during 2018–2023 on ABCKID (pseudonym), a large China-based platform employing North American laborers, we unpack how state control directly affected the lives of laborers and indirectly impacted platform work through strengthening platform control over laborers. Our findings show that the state is not necessarily an ally with platform laborers but could be a major source of control over these laborers. We also document how the platform took advantage of laborers’ dependency on the platform and collaborated with them to get around state controls. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of disguised precarity and illustrate how laborers’ precarity became more disguised as double controls unfolded. We argue that double controls by platforms and the states can exacerbate platform laborers’ precarity even though their precarity may seem to be tolerable.",

    "abstract": "\n            Extant research on the gendered dynamics on digital labor platforms and care work is divided in terms of focus: (migrant) men involved in supposedly “masculine” work such as driving and delivery, and home-based repair work, and the feminized invisible work performed by women in home-based care-work such as domestic work and beauty work. While such scholarship has merit, it completely dismisses the particularities of the South Asian context where beauty work, considered to be ritually impure work, has historically been performed by men from the marginalized Nai caste. Foregrounding the views of men in beauty work, particularly Nai-barbers (on and off platform), our findings reveal that Nai-barbers find the relocation of work from\n            barbershop to customer’s home\n            by platforms particularly humiliating. The transition from being entrepreneurs, in charge of their barbershops, to mere workers supervised by both platforms and customers, evokes memories of the servitude their ancestors endured. The humiliation and degradation of work they experience are rooted in caste and colonial histories. Our findings underscore the need to go beyond the immediate temporal context to identify the conditions of work that workers find degrading, and situate the feminization of platform economy within the context of coloniality and casticization of power, thus bringing a necessary intersectionality that recognizes but goes beyond gender.\n          ",

    "abstract": "The ability of informal social media networks to facilitate civic participation is a major topic of political and scholarly debate. Some studies find that social media networks support little, low-cost, periodic, and demographically biased civic participation, while others find the opposite. We argue that many studies do not have an adequate point of comparison to determine the contribution of social media networks relative to other organizational forms, such as formal volunteering. Using an original population survey on volunteering during the COVID crisis, we compare social media networks to other types of organizations in terms of the relative volume of participation, the type of participation, the persistence of the volunteer, and volunteers’ socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. We do not find that social media networks contribution is comparatively trivial, low cost, and biased when compared to other organizational forms. Volunteers organized on social media are, however, less persistent when compared to volunteers in formal civil society organizations.",

Yet, while numerous studies have examined how people understand algorithmic power, there are insufficient numbers of studies about how people respond to and resist algorithmic curation in different sociocultural contexts. This article adopts a walk-through method and a diary-interview approach with 31 participants to investigate user resistance to algorithmic curation in different sociocultural circumstances. Drawing on the theoretical framework of folk theories and user resistance to algorithms, this study reveals a paradox in users’ algorithmic awareness and resistance behaviors: although respondents said they expressed annoyance with algorithmic simplification, commercial exploitation, and political agenda-setting, they often behaved in ways that contradict those claims with oscillated resistance to algorithmic curation. This study found that this paradox of resistance not only reflects users’ efforts to reconcile sociocultural needs with digital irritations caused by algorithmic mismatches but also arises from a sense of digital resignation in response to the platform’s strict regulations and censorship. Thus, this article argues that although people espouse folk theories as resources to resist algorithmic curation in different sociocultural contexts, most of their resistance behaviors remain constrained within the dominant use of technological affordances, which largely functions as a process of continuous negotiation rather than a subversive force capable of disrupting the ideological power relations embedded in algorithm-driven platforms.

    "abstract": " Digital media allow users the ability to engage in and be exposed to trolling. Although many people may enjoy the occasional opportunity to witness others being trolled, a relative minority directly troll others, those whom we can label overt trolls. Nevertheless, features afforded on social media and online communities (e.g., likes, upvotes) make it accessible for people to positively react to and support trolling, becoming supportive trolls, a potential steppingstone into overt trolling. In the theoretical contexts of social cognitive theory and the bystander effect, we advance a model in which enjoyment of observing trolling prompts supportive trolling, which could then lead to overt trolling. Analyses of data from an online survey conducted in the United States ( N = 604) show the positive link between enjoyment of observing trolling and supportive trolling is stronger among individuals with higher fear of punishment, while the subsequent link between supportive and overt trolling is stronger among those with higher online disinhibition. Our findings hold implications in understanding the effects of trolling on social media audiences and how trolling can be performed in nuanced ways. ",

    "title": "Performing Not-Not-Me in SoMe: A New Theatrical Typology of Self-Presentation Online",
    "abstract": " Erving Goffman’s dramaturgical model in The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life (1959) is frequently used to analyze online self-presentations in social media (SoMe) and other social network sites (SNS). The term “self-presentation” seems to be here to stay. We argue that Goffman’s dramaturgical model belongs to another era, and that online self-presentation needs new theoretical approaches and new content. Compared to its predominant usage in SoMe research, our approach involves a perspective shift from what do SoMe users present (e.g., social role, identity/identities, idealized self, authentic self, brand) to how they perform it, concerning the style of acting and dressing, the use of props, makeup, symbols and signs, emotions, and expressions. Since participation on SoMe platforms is largely about how SoMe users present themselves and how they want to be received, theatricality and performing arts theories can inform this how with a new and nuanced conceptual apparatus. Therefore, we create a theory-based typology on the concepts of theatricality, simple and complex acting, not-acting, not-not-me, imagined audience awareness, and absorption. We present six types of theatrical self-presentations and conditions, types suitable for analysis of SoMe performances. ",

    "title": "The Disaggregation of Platform Labor: Theorizing Skin Tone Work in the Black Influencer Beauty Economy",
    "abstract": " Research on the beauty influencer economy highlights the role that racism plays in platform labor, as race is a prominent determinant in the hierarchy of influencers. While the literature on beauty influencers reveals the multi-faceted labor necessary for success in the genre, less attention is given to the ways that skin tone discrimination—or colorism—defines one’s subject position as a beauty influencer. I argue that skin tone is an identity characteristic that ultimately multiplies the labor required of beauty influencers, particularly for Black women with darker complexions. The extra labor required of persons from a marginalized subject position within a marginalized population is called Racial Phenotype Labor (RPL). Due to racist beauty standards and historical disdain for African phenotypes, Black people—and Black women specifically—with phenotypic features perceived as undesirable enter the digital influencing economy at an additional disadvantage. Societal preference for lighter skin impels darker-skinned creators to complete additional physical, emotional, and mental work in the beauty influencing community. This research asserts that the first layer of RPL involves skin tone work, where beauty influencers must combat the negative preconceptions and discourses typically associated with dark skin. I also suggest that they must combat these biases while simultaneously presenting themselves as marketable to cosmetics companies, viewers, and platform algorithms. This research study uses methodological triangulation through critical technocultural discourse analysis, thematic analysis, and autoethnography to analyze the beauty content of two prominent Black influencers—both advocates against colorism. Ultimately, I conclude that colorism remains especially gendered and functions as an agent of racial capitalism within the digital influencing economy. ",

It calls for a close examination of how platform companies, as capitalist enterprises, organize themselves legally and spatially. The article first reviews how platforms have been studied in relation to space. I then use the case of the Sina model, also known as the Variable Interests Entities (VIE) model, to challenge the meaning of the “Chinese” prefix. This example illustrates that, Chinese or not, capitalist platform companies engineer a composite geography to guarantee maximum flexibility and mobility for the accumulation of private wealth and, in the process, generate great power differentials. In short, this commentary is a call to study digital platforms over the course of capitalism permutations as well as its interpolation and interdependence with existing systems of power. ",

It examines race-technology entanglements as they manifest during trans-platformization, highlighting the illusory progress in recognizing Black creators and the resistance against a predominantly White, techno-capitalist patriarchy. The tensions arising from these complexities intensify the demand for a more nuanced understanding of ignorance as the affordance of trans-platformization and the potential pivot point for speculative hope.

This ethnographic study found that women’s experience of privacy entails balancing between norms related to “hide” and “having nothing to hide.” Specifically, conflicting practices of avoiding online visibility while sharing passwords and accounts with family members exist to conform to their expected gender performance. The study highlights the dual nature of privacy practices that relate to the horizontal dimensions of privacy among the study participants. Limited digital literacy levels affect their perception of privacy, with vertical dimensions absent from the discussions. ",

    "abstract": " A growing body of research highlights digital platforms like TikTok’s pivotal role in shaping meaning for their users, particularly regarding gender perceptions. With TikTok increasingly serving as a search engine for teens, understanding how opinions are formed necessitates examining online content and interactions. Our article focuses on the construction of masculinity and gender dynamics with sigma videos on TikTok, emphasizing the digital practices that foster toxic communication. We define toxic communication as the deliberate framing and intensification of gender relations through the lens of male control and domination, alongside the denigration, devaluation, or defamation of feminine and non-binary identities associated with hegemonic masculinity. Adopting a socio-technical approach, we utilize a digital qualitative method of immersive observation to collect and analyze videos, posts, hashtags, and gender-related content. Our findings reveal that sigma toxic communication manifests in a spectrum ranging from subtle humor to explicit violence. This diversity of content functions as a “ready-to-think” framework, potentially appealing to a wide range of men across varying tastes, ages, and attitudes toward gender while perpetuating narratives that reflect and reinforce entrenched patterns of male dominance.

    "title": "“Cash Masters” Coming Out as “Straight”: Social Media and the Changing Dynamics of Gender and Sexuality",
    "abstract": " This article explores a novel concept called “straight cash master” emerging on social media platforms, especially X. The concept refers to relationships where self-identified straight men act as masters and primarily gay individuals take on the role of slaves. Several factors make this concept worthy of examination. First, these relationships are complex, involving dimensions of financial domination, sexuality, emotionality, and psychology. Second, while elements of sex work, fetishism, and BDSM (Bondage, Discipline, Sadism, and Masochism) culture are present, categorizing these masters solely as sex workers or performers and using a single theoretical framework for analysis may be inadequate. Third, the “straight” identity of these cash masters does not orient them toward the opposite sex but rather involves same-sex interactions. Thus, their “straightness” lacks the opposite sex and can only be articulated if relied on the same-sex slaves, thereby queering the notion of straightness. Finally, while social media perpetuates traditional norms of gender, sexuality, and masculinity, it also enables such relationships to emerge, having a queering effect. Despite its relevance, there is a noticeable gap in the literature addressing the interplay between social media and this concept. Drawing on unstructured, in-depth interview and qualitative content analysis methods, this article represents the first attempt, to the best of the author’s knowledge, to address this gap and offers a queer reading of it.

    "abstract": " Emotionality is a well-established strategy for boosting audience engagement on social media. While fact-checking is positioned to provide objective information, fact-checking posts on social media often involve heightened emotionality. How much emotionality is present and how emotionality influences audience engagement and public sentiment toward fact-checked targets remain largely understudied. Informed by social psychological frameworks explicating message-level factors influencing public engagement and sentiment, the present study examines emotionality in 49,270 fact-checking posts created by 10 United States fact-checking organizations on Facebook from 2017 to 2022. Results showed that emotionality in fact-checking posts significantly increased by 13.5% over the years. Editorial fact-checkers (e.g., Washington Post) used higher levels of emotionality than independent fact-checkers (e.g., snopes.com). Emotionality positively indicated public engagement as predicted. However, in both fact-checked true and false information, emotionality was negatively associated with the public’s sentiment toward fact-checked targets, suggesting a potential spillover effect on stories verified to be true. This study reveals that emotionality in fact-checking posts boosts social media engagement yet with the potential of compromising fact-checking effectiveness. ",

By analyzing nearly 1 million Tweets from journalists at major US news outlets, we tracked changes in emotion, tone, and sentiment before and after the introduction of ChatGPT in November 2022. Using various computational and natural language processing techniques to measure emotional shifts in response to ChatGPT’s release, we found an increase in positive emotion and a more favorable tone post-launch, suggesting initial optimism toward AI’s potential. This research underscores the pivotal role of journalists as interpreters of technological innovation and disruption, highlighting how their emotional reactions may shape public narratives around emerging technologies. The study contributes to understanding the intersection of journalism, emotion, and AI, offering insights into the broader societal impact of generative AI tools.",

    "title": "Social Data Migration Concept: Analyzing Transborder Data Flows in the Post-Industrial Economy",
    "abstract": " Transborder data flows offer opportunities, such as health data sharing, but they also bring risk. Research has explored the tensions between transnational and regional linkages, striving to understand when transborder flows of data bring benefits or drawbacks. By viewing global data flows as a social change process, this commentary strives to complement existing perspectives. It advocates embedding data studies within the framework of social transformation theory to transcend the distinction between theory and its empirical application across diverse social and cultural contexts. Inspired by Stephen Castles’ approach to human migration, it introduces the concept of “social data migration” as a dynamic social transformation. This approach enhances our understanding of the complex, interconnected, and context-dependent nature of transnational flows of data across platforms amid rapid global changes. ",

    "abstract": " There have been global regulatory debates and efforts aimed at holding digital platforms accountable for the public interest. Utilizing mixed methods of documentary research and expert interviews, this article examines how the Chinese digital giant Tencent leverages its adaptive capabilities for corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives in response to increasingly stringent regulation in China. Specifically, it explores Tencent’s organizational restructuring, including the establishment of the sustainable social value (SSV) division, as well as the accompanying corporate practices and discursive strategies aimed at enhancing its legitimacy. As an exemplar of the “institutional chameleon,” Tencent has deftly navigated regulatory waters through organizational metamorphosis. However, while Tencent’s enhanced CSR initiatives have certainly yielded some social benefits, the SSV initiatives are increasingly emerging as a new business frontier for the company, leveraging its vast infrastructural capacities to capitalize on the very social fabric it purports to support. This underscores the complexities and contradictions inherent in its CSR practices and the significance of the intrinsic logic of digital platforms as a modern business. ",

    "abstract": " This study examines the use of TikTok as a platform for youth activism in Southeast Asia, focusing on Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Through a mixed-methods approach that includes qualitative content analysis, semi-structured interviews, systematic fact-checking, and digital trace data, the research explores how activists leverage TikTok’s unique features to promote social justice and mobilize political participation amid democratic backslidings. The findings reveal that activists skillfully adapt to TikTok’s attention economy, using strategies like trend-jacking and meme creation to reach broad audiences. However, they also face significant challenges, including rampant harassment and the precarious nature of algorithmic visibility. The study highlights the complexities of digital activism, where the pursuit of virality can sometimes undermine the depth of political movements. While the research counters the prevalent narrative that digital activism is rife with misinformation, it underscores the importance of maintaining accuracy to protect credibility. The study concludes by calling for further research on integrating online activism with offline organizing and exploring how platform governance can be reformed to better support activists. The insights from this study contribute to a deeper understanding of TikTok’s role in contemporary social movements and the challenges faced by youth activists in the digital age. ",

    "abstract": " In the era of ubiquitous mobile internet, Chinese youth are engaging in dual pursuits of knowledge and employment through various social media platforms, showcasing unique social media practices. Via semi-structured interviews with 14 platform-swinging youth and NVivo12-assisted three-tier qualitative analysis, this study reveals the psychological mechanisms behind their “wandering” behavior. Spontaneous engagement, fulfillment of needs, resonance with peers, preservation of meaning, self-management, and intermittent swinging characterize youth’s complex wandering online activities. It further explores new dimensions of youths’ media practices, emphasizing subjective expression, identity reconstruction, boundary clarification, and visibility control. Moreover, wandering youth also encounter challenges like context collapse, losing their true selves, and self-pulling, which raises a critical question: Where will they wander? ",

    "abstract": " Tobacco content on Twitter (X) generally opposes regulation. Although a near real-time data source of the public’s response to prominent events heightens the allure of extrapolating public sentiment from Twitter content, tobacco policy sentiment on the platform may be more indicative of industry-affiliated top users. We examined 2 years of tobacco policy discussion on Twitter (X) at the user level ( N = 3,159,807 posts) from September 2019 to July 2021. We sampled the 100 most followed, amplified (retweets), influential (H index), and connected (betweenness centrality) users at three different time periods: pre-COVID (September 2019 to February 2020), COVID lockdown (March 2020 to March 2021), and post vaccine rollout (April to July 2021) to characterize top users. The Louvain method was used to partition users into communities based on retweet behavior. The 100 most amplified users received between 48% and 71% of all retweets across time periods, with e-cigarette advocates dominating the most amplified (64.7%), influential (38.4%) and connected users (42.1%). The vast majority of interaction took place in communities dominated by e-cigarette advocates, but only reaching 2.5% to 8.2% of users. We identified 58 tobacco policy top users who had 1,000 or more total retweets and were among the top 100 for any of our influence metrics at more than one time period. Among top users, 50 were e-cigarette advocates, and 24 had quantifiable ties to the tobacco industry. Practitioners and researchers should be wary of mischaracterizing industry public relations on social media as public sentiment. ",

    "title": "#StopAsianHate as Hashtag Activism: Provocateurs, Celebrities, and Fan Practices of Collective Action Against Racism",
    "abstract": " The #StopAsianHate hashtag movement emerged as a challenge to the rising tide of racism in the United States during the coronavirus pandemic and contributed to the legislation of the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act. Our research brings together concepts from social movement studies as well as network science and celebrity-fandom studies to examine a corpus of tweets about the movement. We employ a mixed-methods design combining structural topic modeling with digital discourse analysis. Even though the movement rose up against White Supremacist structural racism, we find that right-wing provocateurs with large followings often hijacked its hashtags to amplify sporadic Black-on-Asian violence. But the active participation of Asian celebrities such as BTS, with their own huge followings online, bolstered the movement. Their posts and statements about anti-Asian violence were heavily reposted and dominated the digital discourse. Crucially, we show how their fans helped boost the movement’s anti-racist agenda by repeatedly posting similar messages in concert, which we compare with the offline fan practice of “chanting” as a form of collective identity performance. While theories like the logic of connective action view digital activism as individualized and decentralized, our research elucidates its hierarchical structure and the oversized role of provocateurs and celebrities in raising the visibility of competing claims and agendas by re-contextualizing hashtags. At the same time, culture industries and practices can create bottom-up solidarities that can have a political impact by raising particular agendas in the digital attention economy. ",

    "abstract": "\n            Social media are becoming a growing presence in our cities, filtering our experience of urban place and enabling locations to “go viral.” This article examines the downstream consequences of this new reality, examining how the urban actors who shape the city consider social media in their work. Drawing on ethnographic research and interviews with elite investors in São Paulo’s gentrifying Centro neighborhood, this article finds that social media are ever-present force in the production of the city. The capacity of social media to shape imaginaries and steer flows of people—and therefore flows of capital—have emerged as a powerful economic logic, integral to the city’s economic machinery. In pursuit of online attention, investors are adapting the city to fit their understanding of what “works” on social media—changing not only superficial designs and aesthetics, but even in which buildings they invest. Restaurants and bars come to function as intermediaries for the exchange of\n            attention capital\n            : they purchase attention from influencers, in turn marketing it to their customers and exchanging accumulated digital clout for free beer and new kitchens from their suppliers. Attention is transforming the very built environment of the city, which in turn provides essential physical infrastructure for the attention economy. While social media platforms may be diverse in their biases and characteristics, this article argues that the imperative of data accumulation has produced an era in which everything—even our cities—is shaped by the pursuit of attention.\n          ",

    "abstract": "This article examines the construction of the ideal influencer across two sites of articulation within the influencer ecology: influencer coaches and platforms. It seeks to make visible the normative model that underpins and regulates influencer identities, practices and monetization, which is tied to the interests and values of different actors. Drawing on a sample of 70 TikTok videos and Instagram posts from influencer coaches, a dataset of 69 TikTok and Instagram policies, and a walkthrough of TikTok and Instagram creator accounts, I analyze what constitutes the ideal influencer through a critical feminist approach to influencer labor. In content shared by influencer coaches, the influencer is framed as a strategic actor who offers value to their community and embraces their identity as a professional entrepreneur. Through platform policies and interface design, the influencer is constructed as a skilful creator who engages their audiences in the “right” ways and assumes responsibility for complying with regulations. I argue that these constructions converge on the assertion that influencers should monetize for the “right” reasons. This steers influencers toward a worker subjectivity that is ideal for the platform, linking the construction of influencers as users—rather than workers who should be rewarded but not compensated for their labor—to the professionalization of the industry.",

    "abstract": "\n            In this article, we extend the concept of “postdigital intimacies” by developing its more-than-human and more-than-digital capacities. We argue that while we have witnessed a gradual flattening out of the digital and non-digital, our institutions, regulations, laws, ethics, and policies still make distinctions between digital experiences and “real life.” This demands a refinement of critical understandings of intimacy. We locate postdigital intimacies in accounts that situate\n            intimacy\n            as ambivalent, and draw on posthuman and new feminist materialism to argue for the interdependencies between human and non-human agencies, making intimacy something always more-than-human. In turn, we develop accounts of the\n            postdigital\n            that suggest a more-than-digital by highlighting experiences of an entangled digital and non-digital, and the practical implications of this for how we advocate approaching health, safety, well-being, and anti-harassment. We bring these two bodies of work together through two distinct examples: one of the intimate therapeutics of AI chatbots and the other in how young people navigate technology-facilitated sexual violence in schools. We argue that a theory of postdigital intimacies demonstrates the importance of thinking through the more-than-human and more-than-digital of intimacy in relation to regulation, policy, and research pertaining to harms, risk, and vulnerability.\n          ",

    "abstract": "This article theorizes the politics and poetics of data infrastructure through an examination of Guizhou-Cloud Big Data (GCBD), the state-owned enterprise that landed the deal with Apple to build its first data center in China. I deploy the concept of “post-socialist imaginaries” to analyze how Guizhou, an economically lagging province, has positioned itself as a strategic hub for big data and cloud computing. The “politics” refers to the development policies promoting digital innovation as an engine of growth, while the “poetics” involves the discursive framing of big data through fantasies and desires. The qualifier “post-socialist” highlights the coexistence of multiple temporalities beyond linear developmentalism. By probing this peculiar case, the article aims to generate insights into how data infrastructures are being institutionally reconfigured in China vis-a-vis its modernization trajectory and divergent conditions compared to Western contexts. It calls for alternative theoretical frameworks to unpack the materiality and spatiality of data at the current conjuncture.",

    "abstract": " Previous studies have discussed digital dating by the “love-is-fast” metaphor and the successful and failed stories on dating platforms to debate the ideal of modern intimacy; however, the conceptualization of rituals and mechanisms for constructing intimacy in a continuum of online and offline everyday life has been left unstudied. Drawing on Eva Illouz’s argument on a regime of performativity of emotions and ritual scholarship, this study investigates the staged (dys)functioning of platform-constructed acts. Based on 35 interviews and 14-month user-led cross-platform walkthroughs, this study examines how users deployed and interpreted the platformed monetized ritual in emotions to (de)code and (de)construct intimacy, and how users act on encountering the “unconcealed concealment” of mundane considerations, as well as the discontinuity of online/offline experiences of constructing intimacy. Reflecting on users’ choices and gender dynamics entangling the hybrid social orientations of materialism, individualism, and intervention of social institutions, this study underscores the fragile mechanism of digital dating and users’ trade-offs in the conundrum of heterosexual intimacy.

    "abstract": " With the abundance of social media content that promotes unrealistic beauty standards, there are growing concerns about the potential negative impact of social media use on body image satisfaction. While some studies highlight negative associations, others present null effects, pointing to methodological limitations like biased and unreliable self-reported screen time measures and a focus on singular platforms. Addressing these gaps, our study employed a daily diary method to objectively measure social media screen time across six major platforms ( Twitter, Reddit, TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook), alongside daily body image dissatisfaction among 252 young adults ( Mage = 21.67 years, 67.77% female) over 7 days. Through multilevel modeling, our analysis revealed no significant within- or between-person associations between social media screen time and body image dissatisfaction, a finding consistent across all platforms. In addition, the lack of association between social media screen time and body image dissatisfaction was consistent across several exploratory moderators such as sex, self-esteem, and perfectionistic self-presentation. The current study did not find strong evidence supporting the concerns surrounding the potential detrimental link between social media screen time and body image dissatisfaction. ",

    "abstract": " Internet memes have emerged as the de facto language of the internet, where standardized memetic templates and characters distill and communicate narratives in simple, shareable formats. While prior research has highlighted their broad appeal as they traverse diverse audiences, their cultural function within online communities has received less attention. To investigate this function, we draw on cognitive anthropological conceptualizations of culture and theorize internet memes as “cultural representations.” We analyze 544 memes shared across two interconnected conspiratorial subreddits about COVID-19 between 2020 and 2022, employing a combination of content and thematic analysis. In doing so, we demonstrate that community members selectively engage with standardized memetic elements that resonate with their “conspiracist worldview.” Specifically, elements conveying the enduring “cultural themes” of Deception, Delusion, and Superiority function as “cultural resources” that stabilize the community’s culture. As such, we make three contributions. First, by theorizing internet memes as cultural representations, we demonstrate their stabilizing cultural function. Second, by showing how internet memes are used in online conspiratorial communities, we highlight their role in maintaining group cohesion and alleviating contention. Finally, we advance a revised methodological approach for the study of memetic communication. ",

    "abstract": " Studies on digital advertising effects claim that the primary purposes of online ads are persuasive: They seek to change vote choice or voters’ attitudes toward candidates. But recent scholarship has noted that social media’s unique affordances encourage electoral campaigns to use them in specific ways, such as using Facebook’s ads for email list-building. We conceptualize such strategic campaign goals as instrumental purposes of advertisements. We develop novel measures to test these instrumental effects. In an online survey experiment using Facebook ads from the 2020 Biden and Trump campaigns, we test our theory with list-building, fundraising, and persuasion ads. In a factor analysis, we find that instrumental and persuasive effects are related, but distinct, aspects of candidate support. We also test the effects of these ads on persuasive and instrumental outcomes. Our control treatment was an ad for a can of Progresso soup. We found no main persuasive or instrumental effects of any advertisement type. These ads performed no better than soup. ",

    "abstract": " Common to scholarly analyses of the “digital revolution” is their inclination to deploy technology—the platforms, their affordances, the virtual spaces they create—as the main entry into evaluations of digital media’s impact on socio-cultural organization. While certainly useful in helping us understand the dynamics of digital practices and spaces, these narratives often fail to provide a fuller portrait of individuals’ broader relationship to the technological world shaped not (only) by their digital media use (or lack thereof) but also by their mere awareness of the existence of digital tools. Drawing from 14 months of ethnographic fieldwork in as small rural community in France, this project starts sketching such a portrait. Inspired by theories of mediation that encourage us to “rediscover” people as a methodological starting point by moving our focus from object (media) to process (mediation), it explores how residents experience, enjoy, resist, and negotiate the impact of digital and social media on the community’s culture, identity, and social organization.

    "title": "Tensions, Confrontations, and Consensus: WhatsApp Use in Kenyan Electoral Politics",
    "abstract": " Social media has enhanced culturally grounded debates and ethnicity-based exclusionism during Kenya’s WhatsApp group deliberations. These practices are often more pronounced during elections when WhatsApp becomes a social media platform of choice for various groups. Exclusionism takes at least two vectors. On the one hand, tensions and confrontations emerge as electoral deliberations proceed. On the other hand, consensus on WhatsApp spaces also emerges during the electoral deliberations as in-groups forge common ground. To analyze the splits in elections-based deliberations on WhatsApp, the article starts with an interrogation of how history and culture inform the Kenyan people’s use of WhatsApp space for electoral deliberations. Among others, the people use the platform to resolve perceived and real political injustices perpetrated in the society by previous governments, resulting in tensions and confrontations. The article argues that the origin of the tensions is the fact that most African people have dual “citizenship,” whereby they simultaneously belong to their ethnic communities while being part of the broader Kenyan nation. It theoretically engages Ekeh and Langmia to argue that the people concurrently fall into the primordial publics and civic publics, leading to dialectical tensions, confrontation, and consensus between the two categorizations. These tensions, confrontations, and consensuses spill over into the WhatsApp groups, with electoral deliberations registering the peak in these splits. The case of the Bungoma County and its linkage to the broader Kenyan nation serve as the site for empirical data. The method for data collection is qualitative. The article uses participant observation and face-to-face interviews to investigate how the people’s historical and cultural values inform their use of WhatsApp space during electoral deliberations. The findings reveal how the people’s historical and cultural values shape their use of WhatsApp space. The implication of the research is to explore the African people’s cultural adaptation of technology and to invite more Afrocentric theorization on technology adaptation in African societies. ",

    "abstract": " Weaving together relational approaches to collective action as well as the concepts of platform architecture and social media affordances, this qualitative study examines the manifestation and contestation of worker solidarity in the platform-mediated gig economy. Based on semi-structured interviews with 30 participants—including riders and labor rights group members involved in the 2021–2022 Foodpanda delivery rider strikes—this article offers a relational and processual view of how worker solidarity was formed, consolidated, and contested throughout the strikes in Hong Kong’s post-union era. The analysis reveals that riders’ grievances against Foodpanda emerged in response to the evolving platform architecture, while non-workplace factors such as the sociopolitical context further shaped riders’ repertoires of action. Riders strategically utilized interpersonal communication networks and various social media affordances to mobilize and strengthen solidarity. Worker solidarity, however, was contested due to internal conflicts among riders and the fear of police. Algorithmic control also serves as a repressive tool to demobilize workers. Thus, solidarity was fragmented and transient. This study theorizes the platform architecture as part of the dynamic process through which worker solidarity is mobilized and contested. It contributes to understanding the varieties of platform labor unrest by examining the relational dynamics of worker solidarity in the changing political context where labor power is likely to be weakened. As such, platform labor unrest is deeply embedded within a wider platform ecology and socio-political context, where workers mobilize among themselves and interact with their opponents, alliances, and other social actors.

    "abstract": " Reddit, one of the largest global social media platforms, has undergone significant transformations since its inception in 2005. From a loosely structured, niche platform to a globally recognized company with a standardized and regulated governance system, Reddit’s evolution has been marked by a shift in the power dynamics between its owners, moderators, and users. 2015 and 2023 were marked by the occurrence of two prominent protests, termed “blackouts.” Moderators of numerous subreddits, though not all, disabled public access to their subreddits, thereby protesting the company’s policies and policy changes and challenging the company’s endeavors to exert further control over the platform. Drawing on Bourdieusian theory and relational methodology, we establish a computational social science approach to investigate the structural causes behind the two blackouts and contextualize the differences between them. We argue that these blackouts signify growing tensions within the socio-technical space of Reddit and an ongoing political, cultural, and economic reconfiguration of its power structure and political economy.

    "abstract": " Generative chatbots based on artificial intelligence technology have become an essential channel for people to obtain health information. They provide not only comprehensive health information but also real-time virtual companionship. However, the health information provided by AI may not be completely accurate. Employing a 3 × 2 × 2 experimental design, the research examines the effects of interaction types with AI-generated content (AIGC), specifically under virtual companionship and knowledge acquisition scenarios, on the willingness to share health-related rumors. In addition, it explores the impact of the nature of the rumors (fear vs hope) and the role of altruistic tendencies in this context. The results show that people are more willing to share rumors in a knowledge acquisition situation. Fear-type rumors can stimulate people’s willingness to share more than hope-type rumors. Altruism plays a moderating role, increasing the willingness to share health rumors in the scenario of virtual companionship, while decreasing the willingness to share health rumors in the scenario of knowledge acquisition. These findings support Kelley’s three-dimensional attribution theory and negativity bias theory, and extend these results to the field of human–computer interaction. The results of this study help to understand the rumor spreading mechanism in the context of human–computer interaction and provide theoretical support for the improvement of health chatbots. ",

    "abstract": " This study conceptualizes “banana populism,” a novel analytical framework to examine how whimsical imagery functions in in contemporary populism. Banana populism utilizes the ordinary—exemplified by the banana—for its ubiquity, inherent humor, and absurdity, transforming these elements into powerful political tools. These articulations effectively mainstream extreme ideologies, invite affective investment from broad publics, and delineate antagonistic frontiers by employing familiar cultural symbols and everyday objects, such as military attire or MAGA hats. Such performative elements not only enhance the authenticity of populist leaders but also make their messages more accessible and emotionally engaging, increasing their appeal and relatability. Furthermore, the memetic nature of banana populism underlines its adaptability and potency on social media, where these performances become part of a participatory and dynamic political discourse. This framework shows how seemingly innocuous visual articulations can profoundly impact political communication and identity formation in contemporary political landscapes. ",

    "abstract": " Online platforms have enacted various policies to maintain a safe and trustworthy advertising environment. However, the extent to which these policies are adhered to and enforced remains a subject of interest and concern. In this work, we present a large-scale audit of adult advertising on Twitter (now X), specifically focusing on compliance with its adult (sexual) content advertising policy. Twitter is an interesting case study in that it—uniquely from other social media platforms—allows posting of adult content but prohibits adult content in advertising. We analyze approximately 35,000 ads on Twitter with respect to their compliance with the adult content ad policy through Perspective API and manual annotations. Among other things, we find that nearly 38% of ads violate Twitter’s adult content advertising policy—of which, the platform eventually removed only about 63% of these non-compliant adult ads. We also find inconsistencies in the moderation of such ads across languages, highlighting the need for more reliable and consistent moderation practices across different languages. Overall, our findings highlight blindspots in Twitter’s adult ad policy enforcement for certain languages and countries. Our work underscores the importance of external audits to monitor compliance and improve transparency in online advertising. ",

    "abstract": "Using three U.S. public opinion survey datasets, this study examines whether use of specific social media platforms affects the gaps in factual and perceived knowledge of three wicked science issues among Americans with different racial and socioeconomic makeup. Less-educated Americans are less likely to gain factual knowledge but more likely to gain perceived knowledge from increased social media use than more-educated Americans. Racial minorities are more likely to gain both factual and perceived science knowledge than White Americans with increased social media use. Furthermore, social media use was linked to wider education-based gaps in factual knowledge and narrower education-based gaps in perceived knowledge among racial minorities than among Whites. Theoretical and practical implications for equitable science communication are discussed.",

    "title": "Interrogating Technological Leapfrogging in Asian Development and Growth Models: Toward a Critical Postcolonial Political Economy Approach",
    "abstract": "This article examines the discourse of technological leapfrogging within dominant Asian development models—namely, the earlier manufacturing-led development (MLD) and the more recent services-led development (SLD)—which posit that developing nations such as India, China, and the Philippines are “catching up” with the West through digitalization, trade, and privatization of modern services. While these models highlight the shift from industrial production to Information and Communication Technology (ICT)-driven growth, they remain rooted in Western-centric modernization paradigms, assuming linear pathways to future progress, the efficiency of technocratic governance, and historical as well as institutional path-dependencies. These models, however, neglect the various “indeterminacies” of postcolonial development, overlooking how spatial asymmetries, historical contingencies, and socio-political contestations at multiple levels continually shape technological transformations across different societies. Challenging these normative assumptions, this article advances a Critical Postcolonial Political Economy (CPPE) approach, synthesizing insights from critical political economy, postcolonial and pluralist economic geographies. The CPPE approach centers on three analytical lenses: first, “social blocs” or the shifting coalitions of state, capital, civil, and political society actors that variously impact technological development and change; second, “plural temporalities” that reveal the non-linear, overlapping tempi of technology politics and development within national contexts; and third, “conjunctural thinking,” which parses technological transformations through moments of contestation, crises, and agency. Rather than prescribing yet another developmental blueprint, the CPPE approach seeks to demonstrate a decolonizing methodological praxis, disrupting grand global and regional narratives such as the “Asian miracle” and “Asian Century” that themselves universalize specific technological pathways to developmental ascendancy. Through situated histories and contested socio-technical transitions, the CPPE approach outlines a more politically generative lens for interrogating growth models across “incomparable geographies.” Ultimately, the article calls for rethinking technological leapfrogging beyond teleological assumptions, centering postcolonial indeterminacy in analyses of Asia’s (uneven) digital development.",

    "title": "Inhabitants of a National “Walled Garden”: Everyday Digital Nationalism in China",
    "abstract": "Digital media have played a significant role in the rise of nationalism in recent years. Existing research, however, tends to focus on more explicit or passionate expressions of nationalist feelings online. In contrast, there has been very little work on the relationship between everyday digital practices and the (re)production of national frameworks among “ordinary” citizens. To address this lacuna, this study develops a novel theoretical framework that employs insights from studies of everyday habits, temporal rhythms and “common-sense” knowledge. This framework is used to examine the everyday digital practices of ordinary people in China drawing on data from media diaries and semi-structured interviews with 45 participants. The Chinese digital infrastructure is particularly conducive to the formation of distinct national digital habits, due to its reliance on domestic platforms and the presence of the “Great Firewall” that limits access to foreign platforms. Yet, as our analysis shows, the nationalizing effects of this digital infrastructure requires “buy-in” from citizens. We first investigate how and why people’s digital activities tend to be confined to the national “walled garden” of Chinese platforms. Second, we highlight the role of WeChat as the primary node in China’s digital ecosystem and demonstrate how ordinary citizens use it, in a largely taken-for-granted manner, to sustain a plethora of nationally bounded relationships and activities. Finally, we examine the tiny number of participants that move beyond this ecosystem and their motivations for both venturing out and returning “home.”",

    "title": "Affective Participation From the In-Between: The Platformization of K-Pop Fandom",
    "abstract": "\n            As K-pop fans around the world participate in their fan communities in hybrid online-offline contexts, their sense of connection with artists and one another is shaped by their unique position\n            in-between\n            co-creators and resistors within the platform ecosystem. This article draws upon 10 months of fieldwork from 2022 to 2023 to offer a framework for how fans navigate platformization and offers a theoretical contribution to platform studies by advancing the theory of affective participation from the in-between. As a process, platformization involves the shifting of everyday experiences from offline interaction to technologically mediated interaction. For K-pop fans, platform infrastructures change participation in the realm of quantification and identification. This project delves into the relationship between K-pop fans and power structures within this contemporary capitalist system. I argue that, although fans work to creatively subvert systems of power within platformization, through navigation practices such as gatekeeping insider knowledge, community policing, and self-cooptation, they reinvent community structuring systems that serve to benefit K-pop industry leaders and platform owners. However, their creative platform use illuminates a potential for affective participation in the\n            in-between\n            —simultaneously subverting and supporting industry expectations. Fans’ unique relationship with industry leaders and one another demonstrate the contradictory textured affective sensations which allow them to participate in fandom in unique ways. By offering this textured approach to affective participation, this article provides meaningful footing for future research on contemporary participation in global platformized contexts.\n          ",

    "abstract": "Although there is a growing number of studies examining the political significance of messaging applications, the regional aspects of messaging applications have been overlooked by many in a global market dominated by American digital platforms. This study proposes an analytical framework of regionality concerning the characteristics of digital platforms, including origin, development, and usage. Messaging applications that are defined as regional have their origin, development, and usage occurring within a single country. This study takes a comparative approach to understand the social and political behaviors on regional messaging applications, including WeChat in China, LINE in Japan, KakaoTalk in South Korea, and WhatsApp and/or Snapchat in the United States. Using an online survey distributed in the four countries, we find that everyday socialization is a determining factor in political conversations on regional messaging applications, which in turn leads to civic and political participation. This mediation effect is confirmed in China, Japan, and South Korea, not in the United States. This study argues for the importance of considering the political economy of digital platforms, the global/regional characteristics of messaging applications, and the role of everyday socialization as a driving mobilizing force in political communication.",

    "abstract": "In developing and least developed economies, traditional and spatially bound communities play a critical role in bridging the gap when formal social welfare systems fall short in meeting essential needs. While the role of traditional communities in addressing societal issues is well recognized, research on imagined communities as agents of social welfare is a new and rapidly developing area of study. This study uses the foundational tenets of Ubuntu to examine the ways in which imagined communities—influenced by social media—use their collective agency to address gaps in Kenya’s formal social welfare system. Drawing data from three storytellers’ YouTube channels, we conducted a thematic analysis of 15 personal accounts to determine how storytellers leverage their social media presence, institutional knowledge, and community trust to address gaps in an under-resourced social welfare system. Findings indicate that personal stories shared and amplified through these digital platforms resonate with the imagined community, forming emotional connections that transcend geographic and socioeconomic boundaries. We identify key actors—storytellers, beneficiaries, public institutions, and the globally dispersed imagined community—and explore how their interactions enhance community well-being. This exploration highlights the crucial role that storytelling through social media plays in mobilizing support and fostering social connections.",

    "title": "Contested Meanings of Hate Speech and the Post-Truth Condition on Digital Platforms",
    "abstract": "In the everyday context, the term “hate speech” has become increasingly politicized and emotionally charged, yet these vernacular constructions of hate speech remain under-explored. Used as both a rhetorical weapon and an object of genuine concern, various understandings of hate speech circulate within interactive everyday cultures of digital media, shaped by the digitalised media environment. With the combination of computational and qualititative research methods, this article explores the struggle over meanings of hate speech. From a large dataset of 289,933 messages, we identified the 10 most relevant themes. We further used articulation theory to analyze different political and social articulations of hate speech. We situate these articulations to the context of post-truth condition, characterized with crisis of trust and truth-telling. Our study identified articulations of confusion, uncertainty, ridicule, trivialization, and censorship in the context of hate speech. The results show that the struggle over the power to define hate speech simultaneously involves a struggle to overturn the definitional power of research institutions and official and knowledge authorities. Overall, the study contributes to the research on hate speech by showing the vernacular, contextual and localized nature of hate speech that emerges in reference to particular political actors, events and debates. Furthermore, the study illustrates the societal importance of the hate speech debate and the ways in which the concept itself, through multiple articulations, is used as tool in the post-truth battle to impede and disturb democratic debate and to serve particular political ends.",

    "abstract": "This special issue explores connective democracy, a new theoretical approach to fighting and understanding political polarization and divisiveness online. Connective democracy asks scholars to think about solutions that bridge societal and political divides, particularly on social media. Our collection of six articles theorizes connective democracy and applies the theoretical concept to global situations, such as nurturing freedom of speech in Myanmar (Burma) and discussions of a new constitution in Chile. The articles in this special issue also consider how connective democracy is useful for understanding current problems related to polarization, such as misinformation and online vitriol, as well as how social media affordances support connective democracy. This body of work contributes to our understanding of how to deal with one of the most challenging problems facing democracy today, rampant polarization and divisiveness online.",

    "abstract": "\n            Political influencers use YouTube to share political media, a practice that has proven integral in the curation of alternative influence networks among the political right. This study examines how Black conservative influencers express Black conservative thought within the broader conservative ecosystem, examining their topics of discussion and comparing these narratives to those of other conservatives within these networks. We employ BERTopic modeling to analyze 17,136 transcripts of YouTube videos produced by Black conservative influencers (\n            N\n             = 70) between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2023, and 158,833 transcripts of videos algorithmically recommended from this content. In addition, we use a pre-trained encoder-only transformer model to estimate the ideology of these influencers compared to those of other conservative actors in their network. We find that Black conservative influencers conveyed a statistically uniform narrative when discussing race and discrimination, a topic that was not only the most prevalent among them but also received the highest engagement, particularly coinciding with the political rise of Donald Trump. In line with traditional Black conservative thought, these influencers incorporated color-blind narratives discounting anti-Black racism. However, reflecting modern shifts in conservativism, Black conservatives also adopted cultural conservatism, particularly discussing the existence of anti-White racism. We discuss our findings in consideration of micro-celebrity practices that present Black conservatives as “authentic” voices on race, and its implications for legitimizing racial animus and White identity politics.\n          ",

Drawing on interviews with 16 digital organizers who were involved in the production of flyers and the dissemination of movement-related information through social media platforms, this article reflects on the challenges to efficiency and efficacy for digital organizers amid democratic backsliding in Hong Kong. These challenges include the fragmentation of voices, diverse forms and motivations for participation, and concerns about trust in a repressive environment. The article concludes by discussing the accountability issues of movement organizing through social media.",

    "abstract": "Social virtual reality (VR) platforms have unleashed new possibilities to reimagine Marshall McLuhan’s classic idea of the “global village” in the digital era. We situated our inquiry in the case of identity negotiation between Chinese mainlanders and diasporas in VRChat, a popular social VR platform. Through a 2-year-long digital ethnography and interviews, this study revealed how Chinese mainlanders and those living abroad have confronted, separated, and integrated each other in identity negotiations. The results highlight the good, bad, and ugly sides of social VR as a novel convergence of VR, Massively-Multiplayer-Online-Role-Playing Games, and social media, particularly how the immersive experience of VR embodiment, avatars, and real-time voice chat may rejuvenate intercultural communication. These findings also illuminate a possible alternative global village enabled by social VR that not only has inherited certain violence from intercultural conflicts but also pioneering new paths to restore constructive communication.",

    "abstract": "Since social media influencers have become popular and monetize their content with the help of advertising deals, they have been associated with morally questionable, deceptive behavior. The list of misconduct is long. It includes, for example, not disclosing sponsored content, withholding negative experiences with promoted products, buying fake followers, and promoting false ideals of beauty. Building on the concept of “dirty work” as a theoretical framework, this article asks which strategies influencers use to soften this moral taint. Qualitative interviews with influencers living in Germany show that they are aware of their negative image in public and use various stigma management strategies. This article offers a perspective that has not yet played a role in the ethics debate about influencers. It asks how influencers, who are often associated with morally questionable practices, immunize themselves against this negative image and find a positive work identity.",

    "abstract": "\n            This editorial introduces the\n            Social Media + Society\n            special issue “Comparative Approaches To Studying Privacy.” Recognizing the importance of privacy in today’s digital societies and volatile political and regulatory environments, the editorial highlights the pressing need for comparative research on the topic and describes the articles in this special issue. The special issue addresses the theoretical, methodological, and practical challenges and opportunities of researching privacy across cultural, social, political, economic, and technological units of comparison. The articles in the special issue explore diverse privacy understandings, attitudes, and practices across contexts, challenging decontextualized and mono-cultural understandings in relation to social media and adjacent technologies. The special issue articles also illustrate fruitful ways privacy can be studied across different units of comparison with qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods. Several contributions in the special issue, including this editorial, not only broaden the scope of privacy research but also encourage engagement with multi-stakeholder perspectives in the context of social media, considering the role of policy, industry, and civil society. In the editorial, we briefly relate the special issue and its contributions to the comparative privacy research framework (CPRF), which serves as a useful starting point and a solid conceptual foundation for comparative privacy research. Finally, we develop a research agenda for future comparative privacy research, which critically examines position of power and epistemological biases, evaluates the comparability of the subject of study, determining and justifying relevant units of comparison, and helps to analyze how these units interact in shaping the concept of privacy.\n          ",

    "abstract": "\n            This study unpacks the implicit and explicit political functions nostalgia takes in incel discussions on the past on the incels.is forum. By combining a discourse theoretical approach with the theoretical framework of fantasy, the study demonstrates how an imagined ideal past is used to construct community and collective identity in an incel-specific, antagonistic way. Nostalgic fantasies articulated on incels.is often evoke a lost utopia, an inevitable dystopian future, and an enemy—usually women and feminism—responsible for this development. The unattainable nature of fantasy continuously feeds attachment to community and works to construct inceldom as a political identity. The study suggests that the dynamics and function of nostalgic narratives in incel discourse differ significantly from far-right nostalgia despite thematic similarities. Acknowledging this difference is crucial in understanding the political implications of nostalgia in incel online communities. This article therefore introduces the concept of\n            incel nostalgia\n            to describe the specific way the past is used to construct and justify incel ideology.\n          ",

    "title": "In the Mood for Likes: A Longitudinal Study of Civil Society Organizations’ Emotional Communication on Social Media",
    "abstract": "Emotional communication, especially through social media platforms, has become a contemporary populist threat. While this phenomenon has been studied in for example news media and social movements, we know less about its influence on civil society organizations, despite their pluralism being a centerpiece in a vibrant democracy. More specifically, we do not know if social media make civil society organizations more isomorphic and thus decreasing the diversity of their emotional communication over time. This question is relevant given the broad range of organizational fields that civil society engages in, as well as the documented push toward especially extreme positivity on social media platforms. Given this background, the article explores the use of positive and negative sentiment, as well as of sentiment intensity, over time in the social media communication of different organizational fields of civil society. We employ sentiment analysis to analyze approximately 100,000 organizational posts on Facebook from 125 Swedish nonprofit organizations during 2015–2020. We find that the pluralism of civil society organizations across different fields, as regards emotional communication, is retained over time, thus not threatening the pluralism of civil society in this way. In addition, emotional communication, and especially positivity, increases over time in all fields in absolute terms. However, considering post length, the relative amount of emotional communication exhibits less of an increase. Rather, across all fields there is an unexpected isomorphism relating to posts becoming longer, while enticing less user engagement. This development, rather than the lack of pluralism, raises democratic concerns.",

    "title": "Market in the Fragmented State: Alibaba and the Chinese Governance Regime of Big Tech",
    "abstract": "This article maps China’s emerging governance regime of big tech firms in the 2020s through the case of Alibaba. Contesting dominant media narratives that frame the Chinese state as either clashing with or aligning with private platforms, it provides an alternative perspective rooted in Chinese political traditions, based on long-term ethnographic observations and industry analysis, and informed by changing global sociotechnical and geopolitical conditions. In this hybrid model, the pragmatic Leninist central state both leverages and controls private tech giants to balance economic growth, social stability, and national security amid geopolitical tensions and a slowing economy. Local governments, meanwhile, maintain a fragile symbiosis with platforms like Alibaba to advance their own political and economic goals. This “market in the fragmented state” contrasts with the current oligarchical U.S. model, where big tech firms often capture state power to serve corporate interests. Despite their monopolistic and infrastructural tendencies, Chinese platforms operate within a fragmented, state-dominated system that both enables and restrains their growth, depending on shifting political dynamics. Understanding this emerging governance regime diversifies the current conceptualization of state market relations globally and state governance of big techs beyond Silicon Valley. It also sheds light on China’s ongoing techno-driven restructuring and global expansion and prompts questions about the influence of geopolitical competition on China’s governance approach and its global implications.",

    "abstract": "\n            In October 2019, widespread protests began in Chile after the government announced an increase in transport fare, which gave way to several social demands. A month later, politicians from different sectors reached an understanding that would open the possibility of writing a new Constitution. Two clear sides emerged: those in favor (Approve) and those against (Reject) the new constitutional project, which would be voted on in a plebiscite in October 2020. In this article, we examine the extent to which this period in Chile involved feelings of dislike or even hatred toward those who think differently, a key element of affective polarization, an increasing phenomenon that sparked the emergence of the concept of connective democracy. The study focuses on the reactions on X/Twitter and YouTube to four TV programs (\n            Tolerancia cero\n            ,\n            Pauta libre\n            ,\n            A esta hora se improvisa\n            , and\n            Estado nacional\n            ) that broadcasted political discussions in the months before the 2020 plebiscite. Our methodology is a qualitative textual analysis, which shows that even though the comments include both negative outparty feelings and negative trait perceptions, as well as positive, informative, and hybrid comments, this does not drift them away from connective democracy. On the contrary, connective democracy still values this type of exchanges, as they allow us to reflect on how the quality and interactions of these connections can be improved.\n          ",

While many studies explored the role of social media and digital platforms in social movements, we focus on the ways local activists use these social media platforms to organize collectively against unwanted urban development. Localized (place-based) contention differs from large-scale social movements: it is less endowed with resources and it is directly related to physical space. We analyze 26 urban conflicts in six Russian cities based on 185 interviews with activists and experts to show how the residents leverage digital platforms’ affordances and argue that the former extensively rely on the latter for coordination, communication, and recruitment purposes. Yet, the nature of place-based conflicts makes blending online and offline organizational activities inevitable. We also demonstrate that despite their benefits, digital platforms also bring organizational challenges. The authoritarian state imposes further constraints, requiring activists to take into account state surveillance and repression in their engagement with social media. Our study contributes to the scholarship on digitally mediated actions, urging a reevaluation of social media’s role in local collective actions.",

    "title": "A Post-Work Approach to Influencer Labor: The Paradox of Sustainability Influencers",
    "abstract": "\n            How do Instagram sustainability influencers communicate criticisms of consumer culture, and try to promote more sustainable alternatives, in the context of a platform and industry that seeks to promote consumption by design? Drawing on an ethnography of Instagram influencers who advocate “zero waste” lifestyle politics, this paper argues that a “sustainability paradox” emerges from the impossibility of aligning environmental values with the commercial norms of the influencer industry. This paradox necessitates continuous negotiation and management for influencers, and routinely excludes them from pathways to paid work. As extensive research on influencer labor has shown, sustainability influencers are far from alone in being systematically marginalized from paid work because they are not “advertiser friendly” or “brand safe” according to the capitalist norms of social media platforms and the influencer industry. The paper makes two key arguments regarding the causes of, and solutions to, this problem. First, the “paradox” faced by sustainability influencers points to the irreparable\n            unsustainability\n            of the influencer industry and the environmentally destructive systems of production, promotion and consumption which it exists to promote. And second, solutions to the systemic problems of exploitative influencer labor cannot be found from tweaks to labor conditions in this unsustainable industry. Instead, the paper makes a case for the value of a “post-work” approach to influencer labor, which broadens critical and political imaginaries for what “influencing” might mean outside of exclusionary and environmentally catastrophic hegemonies of promotional labor and consumption.\n          ",

    "abstract": "\n            This article introduces the analytical approach of\n            practice mapping\n            , using vector embeddings of network actions and interactions to map commonalities and disjunctures in the practices of social media users, as a framework for methodological advancement beyond the limitations of conventional network analysis and visualization. In particular, the methodological framework we outline here has the potential to incorporate multiple distinct modes of interaction into a single practice map; can be further enriched with account-level attributes such as information gleaned from textual analysis, profile information, available demographic details, and other features; and can be applied even to a cross-platform analysis of communicative patterns and practices. The article presents practice mapping as an analytical framework and outlines its key methodological considerations. Given its prominence in past social media research, we draw on examples and data from the platform formerly known as Twitter to enable experienced scholars to translate their approaches to a practice mapping paradigm more easily, but point out how data from other platforms may be used in equivalent ways in practice mapping studies. We illustrate the utility of the approach by applying it to a dataset where the application of conventional network analysis and visualization approaches has produced few meaningful insights.\n          ",

We seek to understand the role and strategies of these “new experts” in presenting, evaluating, and responding to contemporary heterosexual dating harms. Our analysis is informed by the existing literature on digital feminism, gendered abuse, and conceptions of harm, but also recognizes how social media marketing strategies shapes the expertise provided. We conclude that while the emerging expert discourses around online dating seek ostensibly to advocate for women, they are contradictory, likely to contribute to social anxiety, and could risk diluting and individualizing the material reality of abuse.\n          ",

    "abstract": "\n            This article investigates how social media can enable and constrain civil society organizations’ (CSOs) discharge of accountability. Based on a comparative analysis of the Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter (X) posts of the Swedish Red Cross during 1 year (\n            N\n             = 1014), we propose a framework of affordances that illustrate how platform features, practices, norms, and perceptions about audiences jointly shape the accountability potential of a platform. Accountability is overall more content- than process-oriented, emphasizing visibility of action rather than far-reaching social interactivity. Our study, however, reveals important differences between Instagram and Facebook, on the one hand, and Twitter, on the other. Whereas accountability is more short-term, scripted, and donor-oriented in the former, it is more abstract and ad hoc, with mainly indirect efforts at interactivity, in the latter. Our framework of affordances sheds light on the hitherto under-researched intersection between the literature on CSO accountability and the literature on CSO use of social media.\n          ",

    "title": "“Boom-and-Burst”: Linking Online and Offline Elements of Right-Wing “Patriotic” Camps in Brazil",
    "abstract": "\n            This article examines social media’s role in the “online-offline nexus,” focusing on how digital interactions translate into sustained, large-scale, right-wing protests. Using Brazil as a case study, the research combines document analysis with non-participant observation in open right-wing Telegram groups and participant observation at the largest of Brazil’s 100 protest camps. At this camp in Brasília, supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro, as in many other cities, gathered for 70 days between 2022 and 2023 to protest the 2022 presidential election won by Lula da Silva. The camps and online groups prominently displayed nationalist symbols and similar slogans such as “Stolen Election”, “SOS Armed Forces” and “Save Brazil,” reflecting the unified ideology of the self-called “patriots.” Social media—mainly through the (re)circulation of videos, posts, and dedicated content produced by and to demonstrators in Telegram and WhatsApp groups—proved essential in four stages:\n            mobilizing\n            ,\n            organizing\n            ,\n            sustaining\n            , and\n            reorganizing\n            . Introducing the concept of “boom-and-burst,” this study shows how the online-offline nexus both fostered collective identity and facilitated the logistical and ideological underpinnings of prolonged, site-specific demonstrations, actively encouraging violence. In Brazil, the overt support of many state actors, especially the army and police, also played a role. The cycle of intense digital enthusiasm translated into protest camps and, instead of the expected bust, ultimately escalated into acts of violence, with demonstrators planning bombings and vandalizing institutional sites in a disturbing sequel to the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol.\n          ",

    "abstract": "Sharing memes has emerged as a prevalent form of social grooming behavior on digital platforms, yet research has largely focused on the content of internet memes rather than the behavior of sharing them. This study explores whether sharing memes with different humor styles (affiliative, self-enhancing, aggressive, and self-defeating humor styles) relates to subjective well-being through the mediating roles of online bonding and bridging social capital. Using survey data from a representative sample of 1000 participants in the United States, the findings showed that affiliative and aggressive meme-sharing were positively associated with psychological well-being and positive feelings via enhanced online bonding social capital. The findings could contribute to a deeper understanding of social and psychological implications of engaging with memes in online communication.",

    "abstract": "Of the many solutions to address political misinformation spreading on social media, user correction holds special promise for connective democracy given its emphasis on prioritizing user autonomy and fostering communication and connections across lines of disagreement. But for the connective democratic benefits to be realized, these user corrections should ideally come from those who express strong support for democratic norms. Using a nationally representative survey of Americans immediately after the 2020 U.S. presidential election, we find the opposite is true: self-reported correctors also tended to support political violence to achieve their goals. Rather than treating self-reported correction as a clear positive force for democracy, researchers and practitioners should consider the potential drawbacks and limitations of self-reported correction, particularly when coming from those with less supportive attitudes toward connective democracy.",

    "abstract": "TikTok has become an important digital space for solidarity among underrepresented groups. However, it is also a space where stereotypes and offensive jokes are proliferated through unique affordances such as “Use This Sound.” For this study, I focused on Black-Asian multiracials known as “Blasians” and how they used TikTok. I analyzed 56 videos, 47 by Blasian creators and nine by non-Blasian creators, using content analysis and Berger’s typology of 45 humor techniques to uncover common themes and strategies employed by Blasians and non-Blasians on TikTok. Three major findings emerged from the data: First, unlike most social media platforms, the majority of my sample was created by Blasians themselves, with more than half of these videos directly or indirectly referencing racist experiences the creator had encountered using techniques like facetiousness, stereotypes, and wordplay suggesting that a Blasian-specific culture is emerging on TikTok, mirroring elements of Black Twitter. Second, Blasians often relied on monoracial Black and monoracial Asian stereotypes in their videos, demonstrating the multiple dimensions of how they are targeted. Third, non-Blasians relied on Blasian-specific stereotypes, highlighting novel ways in which other minoritized racial groups are racializing Blasians. Taken together, my study sheds light on the racialization process of a growing racial group, the emergence of a digital Black-Asian multiracial culture, and how TikTok united a diverse and broad ethnoracial group.",

    "abstract": "This article draws on the theories of Max Weber to explore how social media can redefine organization and hierarchy in the contemporary labor movement. Through a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative analysis of social media posts and in-depth interviews with key grassroots activists in Denmark, the article highlights how the personal, affective, and participatory nature of social media challenges traditional union legitimacy. The findings suggest that as affect and individual narratives become increasingly powerful tools for the labor movement, unions must explore ways to incorporate these new modes of communication. This includes a deep understanding of the interplay between different forms of legitimacy on digital platforms, and how these can complement each other rather than compete in the pursuit of labor rights and democratic organization. This study contributes to a broader discussion on the impact of digital platforms on organizations, offering a unique perspective on the intersection of technology and power.",

    "abstract": "This study explores how White mummy bloggers in Chinese-foreign marriages negotiate gender, race, and nationhood through sharenting practices on Douyin, China’s popular short video platform. Drawing on a larger digital ethnography project, it analyzes content from three high-profile accounts featuring White mothers raising mixed-blood children in China. Using a translocational positionality lens, the study examines how these women navigate motherhood as racialized migrants within China’s patriarchal family structures, blend their children’s mixed heritage with Chinese cultural symbols, and engage with national belonging through citizenship. The findings highlight how the performative nature of their parenting allows these bloggers to actively shape their own identities and those of their mixed-blood children, navigating structural constraints and cultural differences while engaging with gendered, racialized, and (trans)national discourses that shape family lives and power relations in transnational households. While doing so, their participation in the attention economy also reveals contradictions—where empowerment and commodification coexist.",

    "abstract": "This article examines the key role that Chinese and Indian entrepreneurs have played in the growth of Amazon and the varied ways in which they interact with its marketplace platform. Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, I highlight differences in how Amazon addresses such entrepreneurs, in how they produce for Amazon, and how they brand their goods for global markets. These differences do not simply reflect distinct national cultures. Rather, they emerge from how Amazon crosses national borders, bringing actors from different political and regulatory contexts, with different levels of development and symbolic resources, into direct contact and competition with one another. I propose that to make sense of these configurations, we must conceptualize global platform capitalism not only as a collection of national cases but as a world system—a differentiated unity that reproduces inequality at the same time it drives innovation.",

    "abstract": "Digital activists play a pivotal role in fostering local democracy, civic participation, and social advocacy across sub-Saharan Africa. Using technological, social, and discursive layers of communication, these activists navigate complex socio-political environments to amplify marginalized voices and facilitate local governance dialogues. Platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook enable real-time communication, trust-building, and narrative framing within nano-media spaces, bridging online and offline interactions. Despite their transformative potential, significant challenges persist, including gender disparities, urban-rural divides, and platform-specific limitations that hinder inclusivity and scalability. The commodification of visibility on digital platforms and infrastructural inequities further constrain their impact. Addressing these barriers through improved digital infrastructure, digital literacy initiatives, and institutional support ensures the sustainability of hyperlocal nano-media efforts. These strategies showcase the interplay of local and digital approaches, advancing democracy and civic empowerment while navigating the unique complexities of African contexts.",

Results from an autoregressive structural equation model revealed people felt lonelier when they used dating apps for social approval, but not when they used them to pursue relationships. Perceived success was linked to psychological well-being: people felt lonely and less satisfied when they believed they were not attracting partners and better well-being when they felt successful. Gender differences were observed where women reported being more successful and less lonely but also more anxious about dating than men. However, men were observed to have higher life satisfaction when experiencing higher success. Our findings contribute evidence for the importance of motivations and perceptions in communication technology use and psychological well-being.\n          ",

    "abstract": "As long-standing social media platforms reinvent themselves and new platforms emerge, recent discourses about social media describe the platform landscape as marked by rising uncertainty and volatility. This article deconstructs popular media narratives of emerging, centralized social media platforms, including TikTok, BeReal, and Threads. Through a qualitative textual analysis of mainstream press discourses, we address the current existential juncture in the social media landscape by examining normative ideals of social media usage and the visions animated by these framings. Our study finds that social media’s imagined futures are refracted through the past, surfacing the fundamental importance of nostalgia in narratives of each platform’s emergence. We describe a persistent entanglement between the ongoing production of speculative discourses about future technologies and a yearning for affective experiences of bygone platforms through the concept of nostalgic anticipation. Nostalgic anticipation provides a framework for understanding how today’s narratives of technological change create idealized visions of a digital past while eliding critiques of the social media industry.",

    "abstract": "\n            Examining how different forms of climate protest affect social media debates is critical to understanding their role within societal climate policy discourse. This study compares debates surrounding disruptive and non-disruptive movements on Twitter/X, asking to what extent they lead to ideologically and affectively polarized networks. We analyzed debates around two prominent German climate movements—Fridays for Future and Last Generation—using automated content and network analyses (\n            N\n             = ~5,000,000) and manual content analyses (\n            N\n             = 2,830) of data compiled during 2022 and 2023. In doing so, we identified the types of events, (extreme) frames, users, and interactions that shape the structure of the online debates. The results reveal polarized networks in both debates, with the climate protesters’ antagonists driving discursive polarization. The Last Generation debate, however, has a significantly higher number of antagonistic users, more extreme frames, more toxic cross-group interactions, and less diverse network clusters. Last Generation generated higher individual user engagement, suggesting that debates about disruptive protests are effective at attracting attention, albeit at the cost of distracting from climate policy and expanding antagonistic networks. This debate was more polarized than that around Fridays for Future, dividing users into opposing camps, with fewer political and journalistic actors being on the protesters’ side. Thus, the disruptive protests unleashed two types of connective action: a supportive network that defended the protesters and their goals more extensively than during non-disruptive protests, and an antagonistic backlash network driven by what we term “connective counteraction.”\n          ",

    "abstract": "In the era of digital communication, social media have often been considered a bastion of freedom of speech, both at national and global levels. However, in Myanmar, the military government has imposed strict control over social media since its coup in 2021, while using them to disseminate authoritarian propaganda. Civilians who have voiced opposition against the regime have been arrested, and foreign media networks have withdrawn their operations from the country due to governmental oppression. Recognizing the oppressive political climate and its impact on freedom of speech and public discourse on social media, this study aims to achieve two objectives: (1) constructing a theoretical model of connective democracy for Myanmar by integrating the concepts of freedom of speech and contractarianism, and (2) suggesting effective strategic social media communication strategies to liberate Myanmar. These theoretical and practical approaches will contribute to constructing connective democracy not only in Myanmar but also other countries under political oppression and communication censorship.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we critically analyze TikTok videos related to the #MelaninMansion trend and the #BlackTikTokStrike. Videos analyzed were posted during the hashtags’ peak engagement, 2019–2020, and the summer of 2021, respectively. Drawing from Black cyberfeminism and literatures on Black cyberculture, platform politics, visibility, affect, resistance, refusal, and copyright, we identified shared themes and thematic differences between the hashtags. Based on these findings, we argue #MelaninMansion and #BlackTikTokStrike illustrate two significant moments on TikTok for Black creators, and a marked change in their tactical and affective response to on-platform racism, appropriation, and content theft. We contend the messaging and imaginings found in the videos reveal Black TikTok’s negative experiences on-platform and their understanding of potential technological and policy solutions. We especially note the affective change during the strike, where Black TikTok creators turn from humorous utopian imaginings of on-platform equity and celebrations of Blackness and community, to frustrated refusal of on-platform labor and pessimistic reflections on the (im)possibilities for Black content creation. Despite the sharp turn in tactics and expectations, content from both moments reflects a commitment to Black joy and intracommunity support. We argue our findings reveal how the TikTok platform and non-Black TikTok community together create a toxic technoculture rife with the violence of racism, cultural appropriation, and creative theft. Finally, we note the centrality of Black women to these viral moments, how #BlackTikTokStrike especially centered Black women’s labor and creativity, and that despite this, Black women performed an outsized amount of labor during the strike.",

The Critical Technocultural Discourse Analysis (CTDA) of Instagram posts and interview data revealed that Instagram’s photo affordances allowed designers to showcase their intricate designs and facilitate the cultural digitization of Igbo-centric fashion.

    "abstract": "This study investigates COVID-19-related misinformation on Norwegian Twitter (X), using a mixed-method approach to analyze a large corpus of 426,000 Norwegian-language tweets posted over the course of 3 years, focusing on the interplay between discursive strategies, ideological dynamics, and power relations. The quantitative analysis uses Structural Topic Modeling (STM) to identify and map the prevalence of key discourses. The STM revealed how the COVID-19 misinformation on the platforms was mainly concentrated around two discourses: politics and health. A qualitative critical discourse analysis was used to explore how vaccine-related misinformation reinforced or challenged broader power dynamics and hegemonic ideologies around health, science, and freedom. Informed by the quantitative analysis, the discourse analysis focused on two prevalent misinformation topics, revealing how vaccine-critical discourses contest the authority of health institutions and the government by framing vaccines as dangerous, experimental, and illegal. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of how misinformation circulates and evolves in specific sociopolitical contexts. By analyzing the intersections of ideology, power, and discourse, the study highlights social media’s role in mediating public debates during health crises. The results emphasize that misinformation is not merely false or misleading information but a strategic challenge to hegemony, ideology, and power. Implications include the need for more nuanced approaches to combating misinformation, addressing its ideological and discursive appeal.",

    "abstract": "TikTok and the associated technologies for recording and editing short-form video constitute a large and growing portion of online communication. Previous modalities of social media, including static images and especially text, engendered significant attention to the facticity of the communication: was a statement true or false? Did an event actually take place? For a certain genre of stylized, highly edited short-form video, this is beside the point—which is to produce a compelling video that portrays a prominent figure in a particular light. We conduct an experiment to evaluate whether “edits” of prominent politicians can change voter perceptions. We find that “thirst trap” edits cause an increase in perceptions of politician attractiveness and that “badass” edits improve overall evaluations of Donald Trump (but not Joe Biden). Descriptively, we present a distribution of the evaluations of the attractiveness of Trump, Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr (“RFK”), demonstrating significant variation.",

    "abstract": "\n            Hate speech is widespread in digital media, and such incidents can harm individuals and fuel hostile discourses. Therefore, understanding the factors that shape bystander intervention is crucial. Despite frequent calls for more research, there is a need for greater understanding of how perceived political and digital media literacy are related to the frequency of various forms of online bystander intervention, such as counter-speech or reporting. Based on a national online survey of German citizens (\n            N\n             = 2,691), we investigated how perceived political and digital media literacy of individuals with prior experience in addressing online incivilities (\n            n\n             = 672) relates to (private and public) direct and indirect forms of intervention against online hate speech. The results indicate that a sense of empowerment regarding digital media content particularly increases direct, public interventions, such as uttering counter-speech.\n          ",

    "abstract": "Micro-celebrities have become an integral part of social media culture, engaging with small but loyal audiences even if they do not generate significant income or wield substantial social influence. This study explores a particular subset of micro-celebrities, referred to as “micro-intellectuals.” Unlike influencers who gain popularity by showcasing idealized, often unattainable lifestyles, micro-intellectuals are perceived as authentic and obtain distinctive online status through curating and sharing knowledge. By examining how micro-intellectuals strategically craft their unique online personas, this research seeks to uncover how digital distinction sheds light on the logic behind individual self-presentation in the digital age. Our findings reveal that digital distinction is not only achieved through content but also through the manner and context in which it is presented. Digital platforms function as taste assemblages, where cultural production by users actively contributes to the process of distinction-making. In addition, the study illustrates that digital distinction is often a personalized choice rooted in identity construction, rather than merely a reflection of social class structures.",

    "abstract": "Advancing an affective-discursive approach, this article examines how distant witnessing bolsters digital activist organizing that challenges a Southern authoritarian regime’s nationalist politics on international social media. The research foregrounds an initiative coordinated by a group of overseas dissidents who sought to expose China’s foreign policy regarding the Russian invasion of Ukraine on X (Twitter). Amid ongoing battlefield stalemates that have prolonged the war, this initiative has evolved into a broader form of resistance, staging distant witnessing through X postings to circumvent the party-state’s internet censorship. As this process unfolds, activists capitalize on social media affordances to curate witness testimonies that counter China’s distorted geopolitical narratives and beyond. Resorting to both pre-discursive and discursive gestures, this repertoire contributes to the formation of affective publics, thereby stimulating public contention over the party-state’s authoritarian rule from afar. The findings highlight how such digital platforms as X enable an informal model of organization, allowing Southern activists to act as mediators who coordinate distant witnessing in a transnational context.",

    "abstract": "Digital platforms have long been understood as important spaces where identity performance takes place with networks and interpersonal interaction forming the basis of many theoretical approaches to self. Due to TikTok’s distinctive technical structure, scholars have argued that processes of sociality and identity construction have changed, calling into question some of the founding principles of how we understand identity performance on social media. In this article, we critically engage with these debates by asking how identity is performed in TikTok content in the context of health and illness. Specifically, we explore identity performance in content on two hereditary cancer conditions: BReast CAncer (BRCA) and Lynch Syndrome, carriers of which have a much higher disposition to getting certain types of cancer in their lifetime. Through using computational data collection tools and conducting a qualitative content analysis, we find that identity is performed through the enactment of roles, all of which demonstrate how TikTok’s features still enable interpersonal and networked elements of self to emerge. This article contributes to knowledge on experiences of social media and hereditary cancer by shedding light on the kinds of identity performance that become most visible through ways of sociality shaped by powerful multimodal and algorithmic platforms such as TikTok. In so doing, it also provides unprecedented insight into what content users are exposed to when seeking information and support in relation to a hereditary cancer diagnosis on TikTok.",

This study employs thematic analysis of 144 r/NewTubers posts that explicitly mentioned algorithms. The analysis reveals four main themes: mythologizing and anthropomorphism, demystification of the algorithm, platform gossip, and community backlash. NewTubers often personify the algorithm, attributing human-like qualities and agency to it. This anthropomorphism, however, is frequently challenged by other NewTubers who emphasize the algorithm’s technical nature and the importance of content quality. These narratives highlight the formation of public, non-institutional algorithmic literacies among ACCs as they negotiate the opaque world of platform algorithms.",

    "abstract": "\n            In the void left by struggling local media, localized social media systems have proliferated on the web as key avenues for the exchange of location-specific information. Yet, as local ecosystems shift, there is a need to understand the types of audiences localized social media spaces attract, and whether these spaces can foster healthy communities. This article presents the results of a multi-national, longitudinal user survey of participants (\n            N\n             = 2789) on the social media platform Reddit. We show, for the first time, that people who join localized social media spaces also report higher community attachment and political participation intent than users who join other social media spaces. We find evidence that these pro-community attitudes are stronger for longer-term members of localized social media and those who actively contribute through posts and comments. Surprisingly, we also identify that new residents to an area are more likely to belong to a localized social media forum than long-time residents. This article provides context for how the affordances of technology platforms influence the audiences, behaviors, and community impacts of localized social networks.\n          ",

    "abstract": "Social media communication of government agencies should ideally be truthful and impartial to sustain public trust in government and support democratic goals. However, the politicization of agencies may harm the benefits that impartial and engaged communication brings. In this study, we provide a linguistic framework for analyzing how agency politicization is reflected in the language of government social media communication by asking: How does the agency (1) use speech acts (e.g., commands, requests), (2) talk about itself and others, (3) refer to statistical and scientific information, and (4) express positive and negative sentiment? We demonstrate the application of the framework by conducting a case study of the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s messaging on Twitter across administrations with distinct ideological alignments between the agency and its top administrator. The analysis shows that (1) requests and statistical information were used substantially more under the administrator more aligned with the agency mission; (2) expressive speech acts were used more often during the administration less aligned with the agency mission; and (3) posts were generally positive but more so under the administration less aligned with the agency mission, possibly to counteract increased public criticism. We discuss the results in relation to theories of politicization and government communication, and the implications for citizens and public sector communicators using social media sites.",

This article focuses on the franchised Japanese convenience store as a particularly salient site from which to understand platformization in Japan. It is also crucial for thinking the platform economy historically and regionally within Asia where Japanese-style convenience stores abound, as well as globally given how Japan’s convenience stores were a model of the internet-connected mobile phone that in turn becomes a model for iPhone and Android smartphones. Focusing on the convenience store and its Japanese trajectory of development allows us to see the process of platformization of the franchised, networked, logistically-enabled convenience store from the 1970s to the present. The convenience store is, I argue, a crucial, if overlooked, site for platformization in Asia and beyond. It is also a key site for rethinking the most central of feelings to the platform economy: convenience.",

    "abstract": "As the space for discussing feminism and related issues on domestic social media platforms in China narrows, Chinese women and feminists are increasingly seeking new platforms that provide a more supportive digital environment for advancing gender justice. This article explores the growing transnational engagement of Chinese digital feminism, with a focus on its presence on the foreign-based social media platform, Instagram. Based on interviews with 12 Chinese female Instagram users and an analysis of 184 of their women-focused posts, this study employs thematic and content analysis to explore the intricate, multi-layered transnational connectivity and social representations that contribute to a distributed form of gendered collective memory. The article argues that the digital engagement of Chinese women on Instagram plays a critical role in offsetting the limitations found in domestic social media platforms. This is vital for preserving certain vanished recollections, disseminating feminist narratives, and building gendered collective memory that challenges and reframes the often-distorted and stereotypical perceptions of Chinese women in public consciousness within China’s domestic media landscape. Despite the constrained impact and visibility of their gendered collective memory on Instagram, largely due to the specific class and group these women socially represent, their transnational efforts in shaping a more equitable collective memory remain noteworthy.",

    "title": "Platforms as Partners? Dissecting the Interplay Between Civil Society Organizing and Social Media Platforms",
    "abstract": "\n            A few social media platforms have come to play a central role in civil society organizing, often functioning as organizing partners. But on whose terms? As organizing partners, commercial social media platforms shape the conditions under which civil society actors organize, also shaping organizational dynamics, visibility, and collective action. Far from being neutral partners, these platforms become battlegrounds where civil society actors and platform owners negotiate power, visibility, and control—differently affecting various forms of civil society actors and organizing. Therefore, we need to move beyond the notion of platforms as mere organizing agents to critically examine the opportunities and constraints they create for different civil society actors, as well as how different civil society actors navigate these. This requires considering both exogenous, contextual elements, and endogenous, actor-centered elements of civil society organizing. Doing so allows us to examine how organizing efforts emerge not simply\n            on\n            social media platforms but\n            with\n            them, requiring constant negotiation with platform logics. The collection of articles in this special issue shows how social media platforms enable civil society organizing, but also how platform-driven asymmetries emerge and play out differently according to the different features that characterize the civil society organizations at stake.\n          ",

    "abstract": "This article uses the dashboard camera (commonly, dashcam) to consider platformed logics of injury. Installed in cars, dashcams are often purposed to arbitrate accidents. In Singapore, however, dashcams have fostered huge communities on social media, who regularly post and comment on dashcam footage. Furthermore, due to the nature of their work, food delivery riders also constitute common subjects of these footages. The article explores these relationships by revealing, first, how dashcams have historically coupled exploitation and justice. It has relied on the broken bodies of platform workers for consumer interest, but attached with the promise that the technology can also address the structural injustice of platformed work. This capitalization of injury continues into the present, with dashcams also serving as the key site for the visibility of structural injury among food delivery riders.",

    "abstract": "Research suggests that social media can cause users, especially young adults, to overestimate their knowledge about climate change. Knowledge overestimation may then lead users to communicate more frequently about climate change with others. We test these hypotheses with a four-wave panel survey of respondents aged 18–29 years. We find that social media exposure is positively associated with respondents’ tendencies to overestimate their knowledge about climate change, but we do not find causal effects. Overestimation is also related to perceived information overload, subjective digital literacy, and trust in social media comments. While overestimation did not cause higher outspokenness about climate change, it increased respondents’ efforts to persuade others and engage with politicians. These results have implications for science communication and education.",

We collect data from seven social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Truth Social, Gettr, Instagram, YouTube, and Rumble over the 4 weeks before and after election day. With this unique dataset of posts, we apply computational methods to identify messages that sought to mobilize individuals (online and offline) to donate money, vote, attend events, engage with the campaign online, and visit the campaign’s content on other platforms. We find that Democrats were not on alt-tech platforms in 2022 and that both Republicans and Democrats use video-based platforms for multiple mobilization strategies. Mobilization messages varied for House and Senate candidates of both parties across platforms, before and after election day.\n          ",

    "abstract": "Local short video platforms in India such as Moj and Josh have encountered mixed success in wooing talented creators and new users to their platforms. Some of the challenges they have faced suggest the limits of aspirational politics which is entangled with aspects of authenticity and relatability as well as the political economy of start-up apps and platform capitalisms. I endeavor to understand TikTok’s success in India and also comprehend in what ways Indian short video platforms tried to replicate TikTok’s algorithmic logics and creator/talent acquisition strategies within the cultural context of vernacular creativity in India. The article connects discussions of the popularity of short video platforms with recruitment strategies to tap influential content creators in provincial India. The article contends that while theorizing aspirational politics, it is not enough to study (in isolation) how creators aspire to be more successful and gain more followers and influence. Aspirations are also actively fashioned and nurtured by the platform’s talent scouts, content directors, and studio heads. The Indian government along with corporations also creates aspirational discourses. I conceptualize aspirational politics and entrepreneurial limits in these slippages and ruptures across individual desires and state-corporate-platform discourses of aspiration and entrepreneurship.",

    "abstract": "Despite the popularity of social media influencers (SMIs), little is known about how their content reflects and conveys certain values, leaving a gap in understanding their role as value intermediaries. This content analysis examined the representation of Schwartz values in the Instagram profiles of 59 of the most followed Western SMIs, celebrities, and athletes. Relying on 1256 posts and 2936 stories, the study documented the prevalence of values, modalities of representations (multimodal complexity and post-caption congruence), and differences between SMIs, athletes, and celebrities. Results revealed that 60.3% of the content portrayed at least one value, with achievement, benevolence, and hedonism being the most frequent. Multilevel analyses indicated that SMIs and athletes were more likely to post hedonism and benevolence, while celebrities were more likely to share universalism than SMIs. Most values were represented through low to medium levels of multimodal complexity, and only 15.3% showed post-caption congruence. These findings underscore the need to document how global digital platforms and actors mediate value representation, as they have the potential to shape audience values and cultural norms.",

    "title": "The Rise of Influencer Practices Among Psychologists: From Therapy Rooms to Instagram Reels",
    "abstract": "\n            Professions are neither isolated nor static entities; they operate within a dynamic system that is shaped by the internal and external forces. Today, a novel yet formidable external force is gradually permeating professional domains:\n            influencer creep\n            , driven by neoliberal self-branding rhetoric. This study investigates the diffusion of influencer creep into psychology, a field with strong legal, workplace, and public jurisdiction. Using a multi-method approach, we observed 100 Turkish psychologists’ Instagram practices over 6 months and conducted 20 semi-structured interviews. Findings reveal that Instagram has become an unexpected intermediary in the labor market for psychologists, intensifying to fulfill the three pillars of influencer creep: self-branding, optimization, and authenticity. Psychologists now strategically use the platform as a “visual curriculum vitae,” leveraging its affordances to craft micro-selling points for their self-brand. These efforts also involve negotiating with algorithms, constant optimization efforts, and projecting themselves authentically by trying not to compromise their professional demeanor. Based on these findings, we contend that influencer creep not only alters individual professional practices but also reconfigures the profession itself through four interrelated changes: (a) the expansion of audiences, shifting from small-scale, localized clients to large, mass followings; (b) the redefinition of traditional markers of expertise, where institutional credentials are increasingly replaced by platform-driven metrics; (c) the alteration of traditional gatekeeping structures, as algorithmic systems take on a more prominent role in determining professional recognition and influence; and (d) requiring a new set of skills such as content creation and algorithmic proficiency, often overshadowing conventional professional competencies.\n          ",

    "abstract": "The wanghong economy in China adopts unique platform monetization strategies, including social tipping, virtual gifting, advertising, and more prominently, e-commerce. E-commerce wanghong are one type of influencer focusing on pushing sales through e-commerce services and play a pivotal role in integrating e-commerce and social media. Online shopping festivals have recently catalyzed the intersection of wanghong cultures and e-commerce. A typical example is the e-commerce giant Alibaba, which implemented multi-stage promotional activities during online shopping festivals to provide practitioners with expanded business opportunities. Notably, this flourishing integration of e-commerce and wanghong culture is carefully guided by the Chinese government’s unique political agenda and regulatory framework. To study this dynamic interplay between e-commerce wanghong, platforms, and national policies, we explore how e-commerce wanghong become a kind of “platformed wanghong.” Furthermore, we examine how e-commerce platforms change users’ experiences of time during online shopping festivals, which we refer to as “promotional temporalities.” Finally, we investigate the “nesting strategies” employed by e-commerce wanghong during these events, which are intertwined with the platform’s promotional temporalities and must navigate compliance within the national regulatory framework. Our findings shed light on the complex relationship between e-commerce wanghong, platform strategies, state regulation, and audience engagement in the context of platform economy.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the social meaning of softblocking, a practice on social media in which a user blocks and then immediately unblocks another user, causing a mutual unfollowing. This study finds that softblocking highlights that social media users exercise agency in creating imagined affordances through novel use of pre-installed features to do social work. It also discusses what the rise of softblocking suggests about the demand for reciprocity within social media interaction. With a corpus of 96,541 tweets mentioning softblocking from 2009 to 2020 and corpus-assisted discourse analysis, this study explores (1) how softblocking is differentiated from pre-packaged affordances, (2) how softblocking is negotiated metadiscursively, and (3) how expectations of reciprocity are addressed by softblocking. I find that users expect sustained interaction and value-sharing with those they are in mutual following relationships with and also expect these relationships to be broken reciprocally. This study argues that softblocking meets the demand for disconnective action in a mutual manner, in line with emerging norms of politeness on social media that see reciprocity as politeness.",

    "abstract": "Using survey data from a sample of 378 women who live in the United States and self-identify as either Black or Latinx, this study explores predictors of women’s digital monitoring practices in intimate relationships in the context of intimate partner violence (IPV). We use literature about surveillance, monitoring, and IPV to frame our study. Our results show three significant instances that influence the odds of monitoring a romantic partner: (1) past experiences with digital abuse, (2) past experiences with offline psychological abuse, and (3) age, with younger women having increased odds of engaging in digital monitoring compared to older women. Although relationship satisfaction was negatively associated with digital monitoring, it was not a predictor variable. This suggests that casual surveillance behaviors are highly ambiguous and not necessarily indicative of a poor relationship. In fact, for women with past abuse experiences, digital monitoring may function as a coping mechanism that brings personal reassurance.",

    "abstract": "\n            This article is a critical examination of the social media platform Weverse and its associated e-commerce platform Weverse Shop, platforms developed and operated by the Korean entertainment conglomerate Hybe Corporation. Hybe, perhaps best known for being the corporation that manages the K-pop group BTS, uses Weverse to promote and control economic and affective bonds between popular performers and audiences. This article argues that Weverse represents a type of platform that negotiates other models emerging from American and Chinese contexts, advancing Korean corporate interests through the harnessing of integrated fan activities. The use of platform technologies to administer the relations between commodified musical products, stars, and fans represents the emergence of what we term\n            platform fandom\n            . Platform fandom, we argue, is a corporatized technical relation designed to foster affective attachments between fans and stars, negotiating global audiences in which fan communities lose geographic specificity and, consequently, an ability to cohere through the negotiation of inclusion and exclusion of members. This article uses Weverse as a case to examine the intersection of globalized cultural production and entertainment, problems of global fandoms, and the use of social media platforms to manage and mitigate against the seeming risks fans provide for both corporate idols and corporate investments in cultural products.\n          ",

    "title": "Doing What Is Right: Role of Social Media Users in Resilience to Disinformation",
    "abstract": "Resilience to disinformation on social media relies on the user’s ability to critically assess disinformation and even counter it. Active users, who, with their actions, can curate the information environment of others, can play a crucial role in stopping the dissemination of disinformation. Their activities, such as correcting or reporting, in the decentralized social media environment may prove more effective than institutional responses. Considering this, the study looks specifically at how active users engage with disinformation. Through 60 semi-structured interviews over 3 years, we explore how crises like COVID-19 and the Russia–Ukraine war impact Czech users’ motivations and strategies. Findings indicate that users are driven by a moral obligation to provide accurate information. Both people sharing and correcting disinformation believe in their critical skills, with their desire to help amplified by crises. However, the ones correcting often face frustration and demotivation due to hostile interactions and a lack of visible impact, while the ones sharing remain persistent. Strategies are influenced by the perceptions of the individuals and the type of disinformation. Completely false information is often ignored as not worth debunking, whereas partially false information prompts active correction due to the perceived ease of rebuttal. The study highlights the need for social media platforms to support users in corrective actions and address algorithmic issues that may impede these efforts.",

    "abstract": "The governance of online speech is increasingly a battleground shaped by competing social expectations. This study investigates TikTok’s content moderation in Indonesia and Pakistan, two countries with vast market potential and delicate social and moral stances. Through document analysis and in-depth interviews with government officials, industry representatives, and civil society experts, it examines how stakeholders navigate normative and pragmatic considerations in global speech governance. The findings first highlight distinct regulatory approaches: Indonesia’s collaborative yet paternalistic model preferring fines over bans. It emphasizes administrative compliance through jurisdictional control over platform rules. In contrast, Pakistan’s defensive stance prioritizes infrastructure-level monitoring and restrictions, often resorting to platform bans to enforce control over moral and religious content. Unlike its Silicon Valley counterparts, TikTok demonstrates strategic compliance, deliberately sidestepping controversy by delegating sensitive decisions to state authorities and avoiding political roles. While normative consensus on appropriate content remains elusive, civil society organizations mediate crucial accountability relationships through strategic activism, coalition-building, and international networks. The study discusses the tensions and cost-benefit appraisals of each actor group, identifies essential principles for legitimate speech governance, and examines challenges in translating these principles into actionable frameworks.",

    "title": "Doing the Lord’s Work: Deconstructing Fundamentalist Christianity Through Cathartic Anti-Fandom on Reddit",
    "abstract": "r/fundiesnarkuncensored is a Reddit community that monitors and critiques fundamentalist Christian, namely evangelical, content creators. Many members of the community were formerly conservative Christians who have since deconstructed some or all of their beliefs. This study approaches “fundie snarkers,” particularly those who have deconstructed, through the lenses of anti-fandom and affect theory, to deepen our understanding of anti-fandom as a simultaneously ideological and affective phenomenon. Through individual, semi-structured interviews with 20 members of r/fundiesnarkuncensored, we explore the role that “fundie snarking” plays in members’ deconstruction journeys and vice versa. Participants organized content on the subreddit into three categories based on their affective and intellectual responses to that content: petty snark, or superficial critiques that participants find both guiltily pleasurable and frustratingly rude; structural snark, or systemic critiques of fundamentalism that participants universally esteem; and dark snark, or content that participants find too distressing to engage. Taken together, this “structure of snark” reveals the ambiguity of their anti-fandom by emphasizing that participants have empathy for the fundies they criticize and see the subreddit’s ideal purpose as a tool for deconstruction. Ultimately, through our discussion of the gratifications participants obtain through their engagement with the subreddit, we propose an additional form of anti-fandom: cathartic anti-fandom. Cathartic anti-fandom involves the dislike and critique of ideologies, practices, and communities in which the anti-fan formerly participated and/or by which they were harmed. By filtering fundamentalist Christian teaching through critical commentary and making these ideologies laughable, r/fundiesnarkuncensored provides an accessible and enjoyable space for members to unlearn harmful ideologies.",

We probe this database using Google’s Vision API and Keras with TensorFlow to test whether foreign influence operations can be identified based on the visual presentation of fake user profiles emphasizing gender, race, camera angle, sensuality, and emotion. Our results show that sensuality is a variable associated with operations that replicate the Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency campaign, being particularly prevalent in influence operations that targeted communities in North and South America, but also in Indonesia, Turkey, and Pakistan. Our results also show that the visual identities of fake social media profiles are predictive of influence operations given their reliance on selfies, sensual young women, K-pop aesthetics, or alternatively nationalistic iconography overlaid with text to convey ideological positioning.",

    "abstract": "Facebook groups hold civic potential as fora for connective democracy. Exploring this claim, we offer a contribution to ongoing debates concerning the democratic value of digital communication. Through a mixed-methods approach, including quantitative mapping of approximately 9,000 Danish Facebook groups, netnographic field studies of select groups, and interviews with group moderators, we investigate the groups as “friendlier spaces” of contemporary civic behaviors. We find that the groups enact two key principles of connective democracy: recognizing common identity invites mundane citizenship and negotiating common norms establishes a training ground for political participation. To conceptualize the civic behaviors that arise in the Facebook groups, we introduce the concept of digital community centers, drawing parallels to the cultural history of Danish community centers, which became ubiquitous in the early 1900s and served as hubs for socializing and political exchange throughout the 20th century. We conclude that citizen-led Facebook groups replicate the political potential of traditional community centers, thus serving as their digital equivalents. The groups not only support connective democracy on the ground but also prepare members for formal political participation, thereby holding potential to revitalize democracy in the digital era.",

    "abstract": "Adolescents’ self-presentation on social media as an expression of identity development is influenced by personal norms and perceived social norms of relevant others. Snapchat is popular and widely used by adolescents to express themselves. A Bitmoji, as an alternative to a traditional profile picture, offers a wide range of self-presentation options through an avatar editor, including body stature and pose, individual facial features, and (branded) clothing. Based on 53 in-depth interviews with adolescents between the ages of 11 and 16, we investigated how Bitmojis are used for self-presentation and where the underlying action-guiding norms come from. Our study revealed the high perceived relevance of Bitmojis among adolescents who consciously use their Snapchat avatar to express themselves. True self-behavior is essential for some adolescents, evidenced by single, regular, or daily changes to Bitmojis’ hairstyles and clothing. Others engage in false self-behavior, displaying an ideal self to hide disliked body features or showing a false self to experiment with their digital identity. The perceived social norms of the peer group play an important role for adolescents as their personal norms.",

    "title": "Spaces of Hybridized Prefatory Extremism (HYPE) on Social Media",
    "abstract": "\n            New trends in online extremism are currently unsettling the typical classifications used to assess violent threats to democratic societies. While extremism is usually perceived to be a matter of extreme ideologies and methods, social media enables and shapes distinct hybridization processes by which conspiracy beliefs, personal grievances, and various ad hoc convictions are combined with ideology fragments, consequently producing new extremist narratives. However, research into hybridized extremism has not yet accounted for the specific role of digital platforms and social media. This article develops the concept of\n            hybridized prefatory extremism\n            (HYPE) spaces to account for these recent changes and offers a heuristic framework for future studies to pinpoint the participatory engagement of digital publics in co-creating hybrid forms of extremism which may evolve into violent extremism. Based on five quantitative and five qualitative datasets collected through digital ethnography, the article identifies three domains, which shape HYPE spaces: (1)\n            actors\n            , (2)\n            practices\n            , and (3)\n            content\n            . Through these three domains, we are able to point to how emerging processes of hybridization of extremism are not only a matter of content hybridity, but also a hybridity of technologies, aesthetics, and participation. The conceptualization of HYPE spaces allows researchers and practitioners to carry out further empirical studies to elucidate the distinct role of social media in current trends of extremism and identify and monitor potential risks of hostile and violent action in online spaces.\n          ",

    "abstract": "While social media optimistically holds the potential to ameliorate political divides by increasing cross-cutting political talk, numerous studies suggest that social media has instead exacerbated political polarization. Yet, social media is incredibly heterogeneous and variation in platform affordances may result in markedly different democratic outcomes. In this article, we turn to the principles of connective democracy to inform a cross-topic and cross-platform analysis. Our mixed-methods study compares conversations across Twitter and Reddit, finding that Twitter conversations are highly polarized across topics while Reddit displays some promise for enabling productive, intergroup discourse. We argue that this difference is driven by an affordance of conversational visibility in which users can see and engage with conversations as a whole. We further argue that “community” is a distinctive platform affordance that emerges from shared user expectations. This affordance supports user socialization into democratic norms of productive intergroup contact and therefore may prove particularly important to enhancing connective democracy.",

    "abstract": "The use of social media by terrorists for live broadcasts can orchestrate a disruptive media event. The conceptualization of viewing as a ritual reveals its social functions. This study examines the emotional reception of the Jewish majority and Arab-Palestinian minority in Israel to the documented Hamas attack on October 7, 2023. Data were collected via a questionnaire distributed to 432 participants aged 20 to 28. Despite social differences, both groups reported high video consumption, increased fear, and decreased well-being. In addition, Israeli Arabs expressed empathy for the Jewish victims. While the emotional reactions among Israeli Arabs suggest an inclination toward integration and distancing from Palestinianization, for Jews, watching the atrocities invoked Holocaust memories alongside emotions of rage and a desire for revenge. The study demonstrates that media events can occur solely on social media, even in fragmented broadcasts. Without official narratives and traditional media, a ritual process of communitas and the experience of witnessing a historical moment can still emerge. The ceremonial mechanisms of media events and the resulting social cohesion may help explain the public legitimacy of large-scale military operations in Gaza.",

    "abstract": "Conflict and disagreement are integral to healthy democracies, but the extreme polarization observed on many social media platforms poses a serious risk to the core functions of public communication. This theoretical article draws on the concept of connective democracy, further theorizing it to bridge the gap between empirical online deliberation and polarization research. It introduces and refines the concept of destructive polarization and its symptoms—manifested in user-generated content on social media platforms—and applies connective democracy theory to examine these symptoms’ underlying causes. The framework shifts from the dominant focus on the quality of individual communication acts to a focus on the quality of connections, particularly within dyadic communication. Through this relational perspective, the article explores how reciprocity and listening can serve as remedies to destructive polarization, fostering high-quality connections between citizens online. Reciprocity and listening are discussed as communicative mechanisms that should be nurtured as part of depolarization strategies. Finally, the article offers insights into what platform providers and community managers can learn from this theoretical exercise to promote democratic discourse online.",

The developments over the last two decades on massive data collection, as well as the developments in computational power and data science methods appropriate for extracting insights from digital trace databases, have led to increased importance on the protection of the data of citizens, particularly sensitive data. In this exploratory study, I adopt an inductive thematic analysis approach to create a qualitative matrix based on the current version of the primary legislation protecting personal data for each country in the LAC region. Through a thick description of similarities and differences in the laws, I identify dimensions of variation in the commitment to data protection, such as the moment of approval, the existence of data protection agencies and their resources, the existence of registries, and the type of consent needed from citizens. A mapping of commitment to data protection does not show clear subregional patterns. Still, the adoption of data protection laws grows over time, and it appears to be in part propelled by the economic need to rise to the data protection standards of the European Union.",

    "abstract": "\r\nSociety is transforming due to changes in demographics, the environment, and technology, and thus faces multiple challenges. In this context, data coordination and access, collectively referred to as the digital transformation, are key to addressing anticipated societal tensions. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis interview-based qualitative study focuses on how researchers responsible for large-scale population-based research infrastructure view the opportunities and dilemmas in play in the intersection between data and personal privacy. The objective is to look beyond the glossy formulations of official strategy documents to see how the digital transformation (more specifically, data-driven research) is perceived from the active researcher’s point of view, and what the intellectual negotiation process is like. What is of interest here is how the accessibility of register data is legitimized, and what developments and significant changes are simultaneously taking place. The research questions are:\r\n\r\n\r\n1) How does the research community acknowledge the tensions and dilemmas between the possible risks and harms of large-scale, data-driven, population-based research, and its potential benefits? \r\n\r\n\r\n2) How are the accessibility and coordination of research data justified and discussed by the research community, given the risks and potential, in relation to political and societal goals and policies? \r\n\r\nWith the contemporary Swedish research context as a point of departure, these research questions are addressed based on policy documents about digitalization, and on interviews with researchers.",

    "abstract": "\r\nThis article examines the technological emergence trajectory of Art Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), exploring their initial promise and then failure as transformative commodities disrupting art economies. Operating within an analytical framework of hope, hustle and hype, death and taxes, we investigate the interplay of technological, cultural, and economic trends shaping this trajectory towards failure. We identify the sociotechnical imaginaries clothing art NFTs and consider their relationship to both the acceptance and rejection of this technology. Our analysis contends that the desire to escape economic exclusion created a collective hope through which social adoption occurred. However, delving into the digital graveyards of Art NFTs, we identify external forces such as cultural shifts, social backlash, and regulatory interventions extinguishing the public’s ‘cruel optimism’, leading to the revocation of the social licence to operate for this emerging technology.\r\n",

    "abstract": "\r\nThis study addresses the growing call from scholars, such as Heidi Campbell, for a deeper reflection of methodological approaches to digital ethnography within various religious traditions and communities. In this article, I examine how I utilize a collection of “skillful means” informed by Buddhism, namely a mixed set of digital research methods encompassing reflexive choices and decisions, positioning, and creativities. This set of tools is situationally tailored for and derived from interacting with Chinese Buddhist diasporas in French Canada in the context of digital social media throughout my digital fieldwork. I use ethnographic vignettes to illustrate how these practices, afforded by the Buddhist ideas, digital possibilities, and ethnographic reflexivity, are crucial to constantly navigate, negotiate, and devise new strategies for exploring diverse networked digital field sites through interconnectivity, fluidity, immediacy and disruption and conducting multi-modal participant observation. By presenting the complexity and intricacy of the insider-outsider conundrum, I highlight key digital features of social media platforms such as WeChat, which can be strategically leveraged by a Buddhist researcher and practitioner to actively shape and present their digital image and voice within the communities they studies. I further reflect on how these dynamics can uniquely influence both the individuals and the communities being researched. Finally, I address the caveats and potential pitfalls this approach could potentially bring about.\r\n",

    "abstract": "This study draws on a dataset of 1394 flagged deepfakes from YouTube and TikTok annotated by the race, gender, profession and nationality of the ‘targeted’ individuals. The findings indicate that, by stark contrast to pornographic sites, mainstream deepfakes overwhelmingly feature individuals who are white, male, and—when in politics—authoritarian. A complementary qualitative analysis suggests that very few videos have a political edge, even when featuring politicians. Instead, it is proposed that the chief function of mainstream deepfakes is to be seen as a carnivalesque (apolitical) profanation of the faces of power. These findings challenge previous studies on the demographics of deepfake targets and broaden the scope of the current literature by shedding further light on how AI-assisted video doctoring is used beyond porn and disinformation.",

    "abstract": "The latest wave of AI hype has been driven by ‘generative AI’ systems exemplified by ChatGPT, which was created by OpenAI’s ‘fine-tuning’ of a large language model (LLM). This process involves using human labor to provide feedback on generative outputs in order to bring these into greater ‘alignment’ with ‘safety’. This article analyzes the fine-tuning of generative AI as a process of social ordering, beginning with the encoding of cultural dispositions into LLMs, their containment and redirection into vectors of ‘safety’, and the subsequent challenge of these ‘guard rails’ by users. Fine-tuning becomes a means by which some social hierarchies are reproduced, reshaped, and flattened. By analyzing documentation provided by generative AI developers, I show how fine-tuning makes use of human judgement to reshape the algorithmic reproduction of inequality, while also arguing that the most important values driving AI alignment are commercial imperatives and aligning with political economy.",

Yet research that considers online-service peculiarities in shaping personal experiences in response to corporate data collection and analysis is scarce. This study investigates young adults’ dataveillance imaginaries, sense of dataveillance, and behavioral responses on YouTube, which extensively displays personalized content based on digital traces. Our thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with frequent users demonstrated the perceived self-evidence of dataveillance on this major platform. Users tended to accept and take advantage of, rather than resist, pervasive dataveillance practices. The results also revealed that on YouTube, dataveillance brings greater benefits because it fosters user satisfaction and confirmed that individual attitudes and behaviors related to dataveillance are highly context-dependent. Our fresh service-specific approach contributes to refining user-centered research on everyday dataveillance beyond its expected adverse consequences.\r\n",

    "abstract": "This article analyses written online responses to Swedish retail stores’ social media advertisements broadly addressing the Muslim celebration of Ramadan. It is based on a selection of 19 social media advertisement posts that together generated a total of 2988 responses in discussion threads. The customer responsive comments are analysed through the theoretical lens of race and racism in the digital society and theories of everyday nationhood and nationalism. At large, the result shows that the social media platforms can be seen as facilitators of anti-Muslim racism. However, the advertisements and the responses to them, which express dislike of as well as support for the retailers, Muslim traditions and the Muslim community, illustrate a negotiation of nationhood which is characterized on the one side by racist anger and fear of loss of nation, and on the other side by support for inclusion. Inspired by the concept of ‘predatory inclusion’, the article argues that this paradoxical phenomenon illustrates both inclusion and exclusion. The retail stores’ social media platforms are not only spaces of hatred against Muslims but also a space in which resistance to anti-Muslim racism is articulated and where constructions of Swedishness are challenged.",

The essay draws on the research by the author on innovationism and discusses the concepts of reversed tools, content confusion and attention factory. Utilizing the study by Berg &amp; Valaskivi (2023) on commercial image recognition services and their performance in recognizing religion in images as an example, the essay illustrates failures and imperfections of AI technologies which are often considered more neutral than human beings. The essay calls for critical thinking on digitalization and expansion of AI technologies and encourages prioritization of humane interests as well as social and cultural welbeing over commerciality in technological development. \r\n",

    "abstract": "\r\nOnline political campaigns are often opaque, among other reasons because political parties often target their advertising to specific groups. Therefore, it is challenging for citizens, journalists, and academics to understand what political parties talk about in their campaigns, diminishing the public accountability of political parties. Through the lens of issue ownership theory, this study explores which issues Dutch political parties advertised on Meta during the 2021 national election. The study uses a relatively novel topic modeling process that is meant to limit human bias. We built a model that assigns issues to each ad (based on the ad text), creating a dataset of ad-issues matchings. The study is one of the first to present insights into the issues Dutch political parties communicated about during the national elections of 2021. Our findings show that issue owners are not the biggest advertisers on their issues and reveal that private gifts enable some political campaigns to claim ownership of many issues.\r\n",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               In the second half of the 1940s, the Federal Bureau of Investigation initiated an investigation of the broadcasting industry that had far-reaching consequences for the future of television. This investigation, COMINFIL Radio-TV (short for Communist Infiltration of Radio-TV) provided justification and resources for the Bureau’s surveillance of progressives and efforts to attack and undermine progressive reforms in the postwar era. This article shows how the Bureau used the threat of communist infiltration to infiltrate trade unions, broadcast networks, and progressive organizations. In doing so, this article begins to address a crucial gap in Cold War media historiography—the Bureau’s interventions into broadcasting at a particularly critical moment in the development of television—by documenting government suppression of dissent and censorship.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               No Ordinary Love is a web drama written by Esther Fwati, a Zambian Australian actor-writer, and her friend, Helen Kim, a Korean Australian writer-director. The five-episode web drama, which claims to be “inspired” by Korean television, positions a diasporic story of multiracial, inter-diasporic love between a Zambian Australian woman and a Korean Australian man. Despite its short length, the web drama’s counter-representational choices weave together global media flows and diasporic interpretations of race and family in multicultural Australia. I argue that the show’s explicit counter-representational centering of a Black woman and an Asian man subverts gendered racialization, and its assertion of diasporic communities as commonplace disrupts ideas of Australia as White and Anglophone. However, its representation of immigrant family conflict displaces racism onto the immigrant mother that stands in contrast to Australia as a multicultural nation that is progressive in its acceptance of difference.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               During COVID-19 lockdowns, I started doing watercolor paintings of the interface of the videoconferencing program Zoom. Because I have a neurological disability, Zoom feels horrible for me to use; painting focused me and helped me cope. Using disability and these painting “remediations” as methods, I argue that digital interfaces function by sensorially training users to smoothly integrate as part of their operation. Disability is merely a word for the failure of a medium to properly interpellate a subject into the orientation necessary to facilitate its smooth functionality. Instead of suggesting accommodating upgrades to Zoom, I refuse the ableist demands of increased productivity that Zoom turns into requirements, and that require Zoom in order to register as norms. Using Zoom as a case study, my goal is to push back against the expectation that bodies passively adapt to the roll-out of technical systems, and the norms they operationalize.",

Substack claims to be part of a better future for news workers, yet it has been embroiled in controversy and questions, particularly in recent years. In this article, we draw on interviews we conducted with journalists and writers of color who produce newsletters to better understand the opportunities and limitations of contemporary newsletter platforms. We find that studying the experiences of journalists of color reveals a nuanced and somewhat ambivalent picture of the journalism industry and people of color’s place within it. We find that the Substack models favors the status quo, a reality that further entrenches the success of White journalists. Yet writers of color value the safety enabled by sending writing directly to a small, defined, private audience, a contrast with social media logics and their compulsory visibility.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               The growing presence of trans people in popular culture, including television series, is a well-established fact. However, its broader social impact and particularly consideration of what constitutes a positive representation of the trans community has received little attention from academic literature. This research addresses this gap by focusing on the experiences and interpretations of trans individuals regarding the way they are portrayed in TV series. It does so by conducting a qualitative study of 19 trans Spaniards who participated in two focus groups and nine semi-structured interviews. The findings indicate that the participants view their increased representation as a form of retribution for past under-representation. They also associate positive representation with realism, with two of their primary areas of concern being the need to depict authentic situations and individuals, and lack of involvement of trans people in the creative process. Ultimately, this research highlights the role of television series as amplifiers of trans experiences, voices and stories.",

As we assume our responsibility to guide this journal and impact our fields, we would be remiss to ignore the glaring epicenter of the prevailing global order’s efforts to reproduce itself: the State of Israel’s ongoing campaign of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and its gradual expansion into the West Bank. As scholars of communication, media, culture, and technology, we cannot remain silent nor neutral in the face of livestreamed genocidal violence. We invite scholars of conscience to join us in calls for ceasefire and divestment against Israeli apartheid.",

Contextualized within the UK, US and Israel’s historical and ongoing colonial violence within Palestine over the past 75 years, we assess coverage that stands in contradiction to the often fetishized notion of PSM’s role in serving a broadly conceived and normatively accepted “public,” and challenge the independence afforded to existing PSM structures via a critique of the notion that PSM organizations operate at “arm’s length” from government. Throughout our analysis, we find evidence of systematic failures and highlight PSM’s use as an instrument perpetuating state power and control.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               Fossil fuels face an uncertain future, but they have strong adherents as well as detractors. Even as California debates halting oil extraction, the Biden administration approved large new drilling projects on federal land, in keeping with the United States’ policy of “energy independence” (also called “energy dominance” under Trump). This article examines the Janus face of fossil fuels’ future, reading recent cultural moments in the western US. It shows oil producers (oil lobbyists and oil workers) appropriating acts of signification that affirm life (in particular, in domains of civil rights and environmental justice), inverting language and aesthetics of liberation and resistance to circulate microfascist petroleum supremacy. Such projections of strength may belie a moment of existential precarity for the industry, but these weaponized cultural significations still aim to do harm.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               In August 2019, the U.S. National Football League (NFL) and entertainment company Roc-Nation entered into a partnership to amplify the league’s “social justice efforts.” This partnership received mixed reactions from news media and fans with significant negative criticism. Many accused the NFL of using the celebrity reputation of Roc-Nation founder, Jay-Z, for cultural capital to recoup from the negative press received following the 2016 protest of Colin Kaepernick. This article examines the media discourse following the announcement of the partnership and how it perpetuates a long-existing ideological feud within Black social justice that questions if the path to racial progress must be achieved with the help of white institutions. I argue that the adoption of neoliberal ideologies into contemporary activism has shifted focus from the needs of the communities being served to the brand image and market profits of celebrity activists and corporations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               In this article, we investigate the integrated commodity forms within Internet-based production cultures in India based on four key transactional affordances adopted by Indian creators, which includes screenwriters, directors, producers, and editors. We argue that these affordances encompass the gendered transactions, negotiations within sociocultural contexts, and politics of censorship (state, platform, and self-censorship). To do so, we highlight the self-reflexive practices of creators and their commercialized social life that shape content creation, commissioning, circulation, and popularization of India’s platform productions. Through illustrative examples we demonstrate that Indian content creators are deeply influenced by social, political, and gendered interactions across both local and global networks within Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Digital India’s various converging, overlapping and interconnected new media industries.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               The Woman Life Freedom (WLF) Movement in Iran represents a longstanding struggle for social justice, gender equity, and civil rights. Our study details how this grassroots feminist uprising faced an attempted co-optation by a monarchist Coalition’s rhetoric of unity for regime change. Through an analysis on X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram, we illustrate how apolitical influencers center Man, Homeland, Prosperity (MHP), a far-right mantra alongside WLF to perpetuate a patriarchal Persian nationalism. Given that language and hegemonic politics are closely intertwined, we argue that MHP is WLF’s ontological and epistemic opposite as it violates and oppresses the progressive ethos of a feminist movement. By invoking a sense of nostalgia for a glorious and imperial past (God, King, Homeland), Reza Pahlavi and his Coalition reproduce discourses of a populist, romantic, and patriarchal nationalism around the Persian identity. While WLF is committed to a pluralistic “solidarity,” MHP revolves around a monolithic “unity.”",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               This study examines the social media movement protesting Uganda’s 2014 Anti-Pornography Act (APA) designed to regulate women’s attire. The legislation fueled mob attacks on women wearing miniskirts in public, sparking public protests documented with images of demonstrators bearing placards voicing their dissent. Unlike the traditional public sphere where gatekeeping remains pervasive and entrenched, social media’s loosely regulated platforms give interested users unabated access to issues and the public. Images, text, and hashtags play a vital role in conveying grievances. Through critical discourse analysis (CDA) relevant to communication through images, findings reveal how the circulation of protest images online shapes public opinion and legislative outcomes on contested issues such as sex, morality, and women’s rights. The images operationalize a visual grammar of resistance that negotiates and contests the meaning of women’s bodies in defiance of the repressive government.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               After narrowly losing the Georgia (US) gubernatorial election in 2018, Stacey Abrams adopted a novel approach to secure the Black male vote, staging a series of events known as “Stacey and the Fellas.” This study delves into the discourse surrounding those events and their impact on misogynoir directed at Abrams. We employ a misogynoir framework to investigate the U.S. media narratives that Black women, particularly in politics, must redefine. Finding discourse on racialization, the masculinity of Blackness, and prominent misogynoir, our research sheds light on the communication surrounding Black female candidates on Twitter and their efforts to court Black male voters. These insights hold implications for future campaign strategies and discourse-centered approaches to political engagement.",

We conducted a critical textual analysis of news articles, op-eds, and video clips from some of the most popular news media sources in Ghana and found that while informal work is often done in turbulent material conditions, marginality and precarity of street hawking are exacerbated by media and popular discourses that are anchored by neoliberalism. We also found that such discourses are resisted by counter-discourses. The study challenges neoliberal analyses of work and labor by explicating the tensions between the attraction to neoliberalism and the reality of its failures for informal work.",

However, less attention has been paid to their role within broader society. Using Brantner and Herczeg’s concept of “transcultural ethnic media,” this study identifies typologies of online English or bilingual ethnic media originating in Canada and explores their transcultural potential. A mixed methods approach, through the examination of these media’s mission statements and the analysis of interviews with media practitioners as well as news articles from New Canadian Media (NCM) and The Caribbean Camera (TCC), identifies a set of typologies (cultural, multicultural, and transcultural ethnic media) that can serve as a new conceptual lens through which ethnic media can be studied. Further, transculturality appears to primarily be a function, rather than an intention, for cultural ethnic media, and operates within and between communities for transcultural ethnic media.",

The essays in this forum section challenge these colonial and imperial narratives about Africa. In this introduction, we present the framing of Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in Western media coverage as useful for understanding how Africa has historically been framed in news media reports. The essays cover issues such as the ecological implications of war and decolonial approaches to examining media narratives in the DRC. In Sudan, we see how the United Arab Emirates deploys soft power to entrench their colonial and extractive interests in the country. Through incisive and biting satire, we learn about how to write about Sudan. In communication and media studies, Africa has been presented as a continent mired in suffering and struggle that is in constant need of saving from the West.",

It's grammatically incoherent, it melds non-binary people and trans women into one generic out-group, and it argues that Kamala Harris was somehow a champion for trans people when in fact many of Harris's strongest critics on the left were (and are) trans. But these ads weren't designed to make sense. Instead, they operate within a fascist mode of address that aims to elicit not meaning but sensation: to frighten, to confuse, and then to reorient those affective responses towards fealty to a protective leader. This article thinks through the operations of these media attacks, considers the distinction between transgender illiberalism and fascist illiberalism, and speculates on how trans cultural production might best answer the ascendant fascist aesthetics of nonsense and sensation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               This article examines Trump’s masculinist “alt-media strategy” in the 2024 election to explore the right’s dominance in the online media landscape. Often referred to as “the first influencer election,” post-2024 election analyses have highlighted the pivotal role alternative online media played in securing Trump’s second presidency. While some commentators have focused on the quantitative edge—such as Trump appearing on over twice as many podcasts as Harris—others have emphasized the influence of key MAGA-aligned figures, like Joe Rogan and Elon Musk. This article, however, spotlights a less appreciated but crucial factor: Trump’s historical relationship with alternative online political media, which traces back to the 2016 election cycle. This article calls upon communication scholars to adopt a “cultural-genealogical” lens to fully understand and reckon with the depth of MAGA media power.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               This study examines alternative media (i.e., graffiti) use in contesting the public sphere in the context of the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests. Utilizing the observation method and a theoretical framework of (hybrid) mediation opportunity structure we demonstrate that the protesters have utilized graffiti and street art as the circuit for messages of political resistance in both the material and virtual world. Streets and walls were treated as an extension of the digital sphere by employing graffiti as a memetic means of self-mediation and political resistance in the city.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               The aim for this commentary is two-fold: first, we seek to outline how decades of liberal “post-democratic” hegemony—prevalent across liberal democratic parliaments, journalism, and academia—have enabled the rise of reactionary tech oligarchy. Second, we call for cross-disciplinary and cross-societal alliances that not only reject depoliticized euphemisms such as “polarization,” “populism,” and “post-truth,” but also actively commit to building radical democratic alternatives to both the failed liberal democratic status quo and its authoritarian outgrowth. Departing from the growing overt involvements of tech billionaires in authoritarian movements—financially, politically, discursively—we build on emergent scholarship to highlight failures in understanding the rise of reactionary tech, through its historical roots, financial and political power, and discursive reach.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               This article explores the use of smuggled digital technologies by prisoners in Lebanese carceral spaces. Since 2012, prisoners have smuggled cellphones to document and share their experiences and protests, despite efforts by authorities to restrict this access. The study adopts Martín-Barbero’s mediaciones and Mattoni’s activist media practices, to propose “prison media mobilization”—the strategic and illicit reconfiguration of digital technologies by prisoners to subvert constraints and amplify dissent. The analysis focuses on four approaches: representation, production, circulation, and material practices. By examining recordings and contextual information from significant events in Lebanese prisons, the research shows how contraband digital technologies catalyze mobilizations. These technologies document, incite, propagate, and aid prisoners perform acts of defiance against prison conditions. The study highlights the complexity and innovation in prisoners' media practices, calling for a comprehensive framework to understand media mobilizations in carceral spaces.",

Reconstructing democracy amid fascism will require grass-roots solidarity among communities who have cultivated the necessary cultural, social, and technological protocols to heal systemic harm—racism, sexism, transphobia, nationalism, and other forms of hate.",

Overlooking Christian Zionism, mainstream media framings of the Israeli occupation of Palestine remains deeply Orientalist (Said, 1979). It is invested in telling stories about the (“centuries old”) rivalry between Arabs and Jews; Islam and Judaism, “the Semites” rather than exploring the role of Western Christian theology in shaping this rivalry, and its geopolitical implications, from its outset.",

It then examines the U.S. political conditions in the first months of Trump’s second regime, focusing on the weaponization of immigration policy and repression of anti-genocide speech and activity. It argues that to confront such wide-ranging, vicious attacks, sanctuary today must be grounded in an abolitionist sanctuary for all, mobilized through many local efforts in community defense and building.",

We argue that this moment requires revolutionary visions for enacting radical political coalitions that center our most vulnerable community members. We consider two media texts across time: (1) a 2024 political ad titled “Nonsense” paid for by the Trump campaign; and (2) Sylvia Rivera’s speech at the 1973 Christopher Street Liberation Day Rally in New York City. While both Trump and Rivera turn to the image of the incarcerated transgender person of color in search of sex and gender transition, Rivera allows us to “trans” Trump’s moral crusade through the mobilization of transaffirming love. To love and fight for trans people is to love and fight for the people.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               This study critically examines media discourses surrounding the demolition of red-light districts in Korea following the 2004 sex-trade ban. Through feminist critical discourse analysis (FCDA), it reveals how mainstream media frames these demolitions as part of neoliberal urban renewal, focusing on economic growth and moral reform while criminalizing sex workers. In contrast, some feminist magazines selected here advocate for labor rights and feminist kinship but often reinforce patriarchal ideals and marginalize migrant and queer workers. The study introduces the concept of “anti-sex work gentrification,” emphasizing how gentrification intersects with anti-feminist sexual politics to suppress sex workers. Despite these challenges, sex workers resist through protests and survival strategies. This study highlights the need for intersectional and transnational feminist perspectives that center sex workers' voices in feminist media discourses.",

    "abstract": " The television series Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and PEN15 are contemporary cringe comedies that foreground female experience. While the vast majority of cringe comedies employ documentary form and/or practice and speak insistently in the present tense, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and PEN15 produce stories that not only unfold in the present, but also reframe the past, thereby building into their acts of narration, and by extension their cringe esthetics, a retrospective temporality. In light of themes taken up by both series—themes related to mental health and the construction of female identity and desire—this reframing has significant effects both politically and therapeutically. In this article I analyze the formal means by which a retrospective temporality of cringe is achieved in these series, including the use of musical numbers in Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and unconventional casting in PEN15, and I explore the various prosocial effects that temporality produces for the series’ characters, creators, and spectators.

    "abstract": " In this study, we investigate the influence of streaming platforms, with their relatively new industrial arrangements and relations with the media regulatory structure, on the cultural production of dramas in China. We focus on women-centered net dramas to demonstrate how feminist discourses found a place on streaming platforms, thereby opening up creative yet vulnerable textual possibilities for reflection on gender politics. We situate the production of these net dramas within the political economy and technological conditions of the streaming industry and further consider the implications of such mediated feminism for the pursuit of gender equality in China. Our examination of feminist discourses in streaming culture also resonates with the ongoing global transformation of cultural productions in the television industry. ",

    "abstract": " In the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020, streaming TV platforms responded by releasing playlists curating Black-focused films and series. This begs the question: how do Black lives matter on their own platforms? What kinds of stories are they marketing? By analyzing the trailers on these collections, we found that streaming platforms reduce Black storytelling to their hardship or trauma. Stories of trauma or struggle are more likely to include joy if they focus on famous or successful people. Stories of joy or complex everyday lives are clearly underrepresented and occur as frequently as stories that do not center Black people at all (despite their inclusion on Black-focused playlists). This study critiques and adds nuance to conversations about how the platforms can construct and enact harmful narratives about the Black experience. ",

The study applies thematic and discourse analysis to demonstrate how the brand narrative articulated in interviews with the Duffer Brothers (a set of key promotional paratexts) enforces strict interpretation boundaries for Stranger Things, its creators, and Netflix. Specifically, the promotional discourse (1) draws on the commercial structures and reception patterns of genre franchises and auteurism to produce alignment with the value systems of different audience markets, and (2) capitalizes on cultural oppositions between film and television to connect the Duffers’ original authorship to the idea of Netflix as a unique streaming platform. The article thus suggests a complex branding process at work in the marketing of Stranger Things, preoccupied with notions of authorship, distinction, and the need to navigate fragmented streaming audiences.

    "abstract": " This study sets out to understand how journalism is represented in the Danish fiction series Borgen and the Spanish series El Caso: Crónica de Sucesos. The aim is to provide an understanding of how journalism is conceptualized in non-American fiction. Through textual analysis, we found out that Borgen (years 2010 and up) represents a generational and evolutionary conflict in which journalistic values are restrained by political and commercial imperatives reflecting challenges in Danish journalism. As such, this series criticizes the free press myth—commonly found in American fiction series. El Caso (1960s) also engages with this myth through the representation of journalism practices embedded in Spain’s Francoist regime that balance public and political-religious interests. However, El Caso smooths over this conflict to illustrate how journalists cleverly overcame the censorship of the Catholic church. Both series explore the gendered and cultural obstacles of their respective contexts and eras. ",

    "abstract": " Cancel culture claims, narratives and practices now play out in predominantly platformed spaces, spanning from progressive publics and accountability practices to reactionary/anti-woke/far right publics. We argue that platform affordances, architectures and cultures serve as a nodal point to bring together a disparate set of practices, discourses and ideological positions to facilitate polarized, reactionary, and or strategic networked publics in the context of digital politics and the (re)emergence of culture wars. Papers within this special issue speak to our argument in varying ways. They explore the mechanisms, sentiments, tolerances, and practices in local and global contexts. They consider how certain practices manifesting as social justice interventions apply to negatively impact marginalized groups, theorize the role of and power of platforms in propelling cancelations, and track the rituals associated with cancel culture on platforms. In doing so we encompass perspectives and case studies from the global majority to inform what has to date been a largely Western area of focus and scholarship. ",

    "abstract": " This article examines how media production is shaped under media conglomeration through a close analysis of Space Ghost: Coast to Coast (1994–2008), arguing that animation evinces the corporate strategy of archive reuse through its esthetics. It compares how the limited animation of Hanna-Barbera Productions transformed in the shift to cable and greater media conglomeration under Turner Broadcasting System. Using a thick description of the production process, the chapter illustrates how Cartoon Network programmers remixed the corporate archive to create Space Ghost: Coast to Coast. Through this remixed production process, channel programmers used limited animation esthetics to disclose on their own labor as programmers and producers within Turner’s media empire. It ends by examining how Space Ghost: Coast to Coast’s unique production techniques and esthetics shaped Cartoon Network’s adult programing block, [adult swim]. ",

    "abstract": " Using Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis, this paper examines a sample of X hashtags supporting or criticizing Johnny Depp or Amber Heard in their 2022 domestic abuse/defamation trial, where in both cases there were calls to cancel each. The analysis explores how the acts carried out by the targets for canceling, along with concrete details of their personal circumstances, become set aside as what we call “trigger-ready” interest groups become activated by a perceived transgression in relation to their own more narrow and heterogeneous concerns. Hashtags become an entanglement of vaguely articulated discourses relating to matters including fandom, gender, abuse and conspiracy. These discourses stack up against the target and coalesce into growing outrage. The analysis suggests that intensity of canceling bares little relationship to any actual transgression but to the extent to which these “trigger-ready” groups become involved. This may be a characteristic of wider patterns in online cancel campaigns. ",

    "abstract": " The cultural magazine Kobra (2001−2017) was one of the longest running shows in Swedish public service television history. Kobra defined culture broadly as arts, popular culture and subcultures, both international and Swedish. The study uses three lenses—journalistification, transnationality and cultural/societal criticism—to analyze how Kobra evolved over its long run. It focuses on four globally eventful years 2001, 2005, 2011, and 2016 and shows how the shifting SVT mandate is reflected in the show’s title sequences, program structure, visual features, and text. Transnationality becomes established through topic themed episodes connecting various cultural domains in different parts of the world or through country/city-themed episodes. A close reading from three different years reveals that Kobra exercised transnational systemic criticism through the choice of theme and interview subjects, rather than through evaluation of cultural expression, in line with its increasing journalistification and public service mandate.

    "abstract": " This article looks at the appropriation of cancel-culture activism by anti-queer parental rights activists online. By examining their digitally mediated anti-queer rhetoric, this paper studies how these activists drive public outrage to promote cultural censorship. Surveying digital campaigns by Libs of TikTok and Moms for Liberty, this paper analyzes how their media amplifies “grooming” and “pedophilia” discourses to dynamize older anti-queer stereotypes. Drawing upon the language of child protectionism from 1970s educational debates, this mediated rhetoric demonstrates how anti-queer activists have appropriated the social justice origins of cancel-culture online. By using social media to frame conservative activists as marginalized, these campaigns invert the history of anti-LGBTQ+ media and educational environments to rationalize anti-LGBTQ+ censorship. By looking at how this rhetoric flows from social media into conservative TV journalism, this paper uncovers how this digital activism shapes a broader reactionary media ecology with corrosive democratic effects in the United States.

    "abstract": " Cancel culture in China has multiple specificities that invite further investigation, given the role of the state in producing content and regulating media platforms, alongside the distinct factors that can trigger canceling. This paper draws on social media posts, news articles, and government edicts for several illustrative cases, presenting a critical qualitative account about the involvement of ordinary media users, platforms, and state actors. State pronouncements on celebrity conduct, fan cultures, and digital media content all structure the regulatory environment, but canceling can originate as both bottom-up incidents and state-initiated events, with platform authorities also playing key roles. Whether netizens and the state reinforce each other or the government seeks to temper public anger, the cancel cases demonstrate how ideologies of nation and good citizenship are propagated and sometimes contested through user and state actions, an analysis that helps further theorize the culture and politics of digital platforms.

Some literature suggests that cancel culture offers disempowered individuals and groups methods of identifying and correcting hateful practices. However, I employ the humanities practice of close reading to demonstrate how emotional cancel practices can elide intolerant systems and sustain norms. I analyze The Try Guys’ content, reportage about the group, and YouTube. As I argue, The Try Guys’ claims about enacting an ethical cancellation displace their reliance on “humorously” sexualizing women’s bodies and mocking femininity in videos about incongruously wearing women’s clothing. I also elaborate on direct address literature as a method of articulating cancel culture’s “direct addresses with feelings,” how The Try Guys use the cancellation to render the brand and connect with fans, and how my analysis contributes to related scholarship.

Although a mainly German-speaking group, the IAAPP also regularly referred to studies from the U.S., but only selectively adopted their approaches concerning audiovisual practices in psychiatry. Technological and legal conditions for the implementation of television systems in psychiatric clinics were debated and elaborated by the working group and formed the basis for the development of various methods of television and video therapy. The members of the IAAPP were particularly interested in approaches to self-confrontation through video recordings which should induce self-reflection, compliance with therapeutic measures, or a coherent self-image.

    "abstract": " This article analyzes the Fox Sports 1 sports debate program Speak for Yourself. The article analyzes the thematic frames the show utilizes to espouse and reinforce sport as a site of conservative value-making and male bonding. In using an interracial male pairing of Colin Cowherd and Jason Whitlock, the show mimics similarly popular debate programs on rival network ESPN, such as Pardon the Interruption and First Take. However, Whitlock in particular advances a unique brand of Black conservatism, and his clashes with progressive activists and other black guests represent intraracial tensions among Black sport media members. This paper argues Speak for Yourself brings Newscorp’s conservative messaging to a nominally apolitical space in sport media. ",

    "title": "Emerging Queer Sister Studies: The Transmedia Futurity of Adult Lesbianism From the “Sister-Kid Literature” to the “Older Sister”-Centered TV in Post-2010 China",
    "abstract": " This study explores a pronounced queer women-centered pop cultural imaginary in post-2010 China, namely, “older sister” (jie 姐﻿) fantasies that center around mature women. It contextualizes this imaginary in relation to Asian and Chinese-language girls’ love (GL) and queer women’s cultures. I trace this “older sister” trope on contemporary Chinese TV to the enduring popularity of an online 2012 autobiographical-styled queer women’s story known as the “sister-kid literature.” My analyses of the transmedia metamorphosis of the trope and the wide recitation of the story in contemporary Chinese media and pop cultural terrains reveal an evolving, heteronormativity-intervening temporal logic of adult female homoerotic narratives. By (re)considering the significance of reconstructing this “older sister” imaginary across divergent media to dismantle China’s heteronormative-patriarchal assertions of the (non-)futurity of adult lesbianism, I suggest transformative ways to understand queer women-driven (trans)media productions and cultural activities that are situated in largely LGBTQ-suffocating social and fantasy worlds.

    "abstract": " This paper outlines a cultural critique of the Joe Rogan Experience. Framing the podcast as an adaptive cultural platform, I emphasize how it is ideologically informed by both the established infrastructure and dynamics of communicative capitalism and Joe Rogan’s ethos as a comedian. The paper discusses three ways Joe Rogan and his format negotiate their relationship with platform infrastructures. The first is Rogan’s relationship with Spotify and his interest in shaping “cancel discourses” and, subsequently, his own role as an embedded, “uncancellable” skeptic. The second is the combination of Rogan’s roast universalism and pioneering speech-a-ton format, designed to establish an infrastructure for platforming his cohort of podcasting comedians on YouTube. The third is Rogan’s relationship with platform-owner Elon Musk, whose communicative capitalist agenda has political implications. The paper establishes a theoretical connection between studies of platformisation and the under-studied cultural influence of podcasting comedians. ",

    "abstract": " Historically, companies have invisibilized some media workers to maintain underlying infrastructural ideologies. Likewise, contemporary commercial content moderators (CCMs) are hidden to obscure tensions inherent in digital platforms’ neoliberal ideologies and data economies. Despite this, CCMs are increasingly demanding visibility and legal rights. However, companies are responding by crafting their own narratives about CCMs for different audiences. What representations do these companies create about CCMs, and with what effects? Using thematic analysis of three case study examples, I outline discourses of “heroic battles,” resilience and wellness, and humanness. These discourses naturalize underlying infrastructural ideologies and could impact future legal protections. ",

Such content contemplates, historicizes, promotes, and represents the art form, artists, industry, and regional genres that have together emerged as a central feature of contemporary popular culture. This article explores the spatial and thematic links to the theoretical Global South in Atlanta and Sintonia. Analyzing the series’ respective portrayals of race and inequality from the margins, I examine how hip-hop/ funk and the Global South function as narrative tools and symbolic spaces through which notions of a shared precarity stemming from global flows of capital are constructed, consumed, and challenged. By considering the series’ connections to the Global South, this article contributes to a growing body of work that aims to move beyond research that centers the west and the nation-state. ",

    "title": "Getting NIL for Unpaid Labor: Self-Branding U.S. “Student-Athletes” in the Influencer Marketplace",
    "abstract": " For decades, the NCAA and its member schools profited richly from sports while denying student-athletes “employee” status and a direct compensation share in generating that value. Since 2019, state-level reforms pertaining to student-athletes’ use of their own name, image, and likeness, alongside a landmark Supreme Court decision, radically transformed the collegiate commercial landscape and burgeoned influencer-style, social media endorsement opportunities. Examining nearly 400 news articles published during that time, this qualitative textual analysis tracks and critiques the media coverage and stakeholder discourse around this issue as key policy events (both legislative and judicial) unfolded and shaped these prospects. The essay argues that NIL has been championed as market liberation for those willing to self-brand and hustle gig-economy leads—in keeping with ideals of neoliberalism and especially for already-marginalized female student-athletes—but that any such celebration remains premature when unpaid labor on the field of play persisted exploitatively.

    "abstract": " Through a study of mimetic political videos produced by civil society groups and mainstream political parties during state-level elections in the east Indian West Bengal in 2021, this paper explores how diverse actors evoked politics of fun as a strategy to resist and extend digital nationalism. Fun has been theorized as “a political matter”; and as an agent to undermine hegemony. Fun also remained an indelible feature of right wing mobilization and nationalism. Everyday digital practices are articulated through wit, parody, sarcasm, and “memification”; and translate to joyful conducts, spontaneity and lightness, or fun. Drawing from Lempert’s “mimetic practice,” this research argues that fun emerges as the site of “mimetic resistance” or ideological tension, as diverse political actors negotiate cultural identity through challenge to cultural purity and engagement with news.

    "abstract": " This paper examines the antifeminist appropriation of cancel culture in South Korea, focusing on the controversy surrounding the finger-pinching motif, allegedly associated with Megalia, a now-defunct feminist online community. While cancel culture originated from marginalized groups challenging systemic injustices, it is now appropriated by dominant groups to reinforce social structures—in this case, to protect male privilege and undermine feminism. The study reveals how antifeminist canceling in the country has extended over the years beyond subcultural industries to companies, government agencies, and public institutions. Although both feminists and antifeminists engage in cancel practices, antifeminist canceling has led to the removal of numerous advertisements and the sanctioning of women and precarious workers, reflecting the fundamental gender power imbalance in South Korea. By examining social, public, and institutional responses, I argue that such institutional enforcement upholds and reproduces the antifeminist hijacking of cancel culture, further silencing marginalized communities.

This essay examines the way in which HBO Max, through the Band of Brothers Podcast, has leveraged fan practices of communal rewatching and discussion—a fan-based intimate public—in a way that not only celebrates the original text as a “ground-breaking-genre changing miniseries”, but also enhances the cultural capital of Band of Brothers as an authoritative interpretation of the American experience in World War II—and as a result, enhances brand equity for HBO Max as a corporate steward of national memory. We call this celebration a commemoration of memory: a self-justifying memorialization of a particular expression of cultural memory.",

In response to the issue of fan labor exploitation, the present study addresses fans’ investments and rewards from an affective value perspective, which has rarely been adopted in previous studies. Using participant observation and in-depth interview data from a Chinese real person slash fandom, this study finds that fans engage in affective and digital labor during their activities, creating surplus value in both affective and monetary dimensions for the entertainment industry. In addition, it shows a long tail effect on fan labor exploitation, as they still devote affective and digital labor to the object after their fandom collapses.",

    "abstract": " This article examines the ways in which reality television form and textuality offer openings for participants’ self-representation, regardless of how they are initially characterized by edited dialogue and performance. The tension between production interests, commercial interests, and the self-reflexive desires of participants positions the reality participant in constant negotiation between narrative and performance, agency and commodification. Nevertheless, as this article seeks to establish, the genre’s formal conventions—focusing on the confessional, the reunion, and format rules—allow for textual creases through which participants’ selves gain agency. Examining shows such as The Circle, The Real Housewives, Love Is Blind, Temptation Island, Are You the One?, and Sister Wives, the analyses show how reality TV form, despite being highly produced and controlled, may nonetheless facilitate participants’ reflexive, even resistant self-representation.

To examine the impact of the ruptures between physical mobility and digital fluidity on the media representation of locality, I analyzed two cases (the Korea Tourism Organization’s Feel the Rhythm of Korea project and BTS’ media performances for “Dynamite”) produced during the pandemic. Based on a textual analysis of the chosen video projects, I identified three social techniques in shaping locality: a mixture of the past and present, the territorialization of cultural references and performed bodies, and the rhetorical dichotomization of cultural space. I thus claim that locality is molded through a social practice of subjectivity that theatricalizes place attachment and spatial imagination, both influenced by border closures and digital adoption during the global crisis.

    "title": "Genre in Transnational Television: A Case of Netflix Originals Korean Dramas",
    "abstract": " Recently, South Korea has become one of the largest content providers for Netflix. We analyze the textual characteristics of five Netflix Originals K-dramas – Sweet Home (2020), My Name (2021), Squid Game (2021), Hellbound (2021), and All of Us Are Dead (2022) – to unfold the existing genre conventions and uniquely local factors in the context of transnational television. In the process of transnationalization, genres are continuously and simultaneously evolving in the directions of homogenization and heterogenization. Universal values such as humanism, altruism, and family-oriented solidarity, as expected in the existing genre conventions, were homogenizing factors. However, these homogenizing factors were accompanied by uniquely local, heterogenizing factors arising from traumatic collective memories, political, and economic situations in South Korea. We also found that webtoons played a significant role in the transnationalization of the K-dramas genre. This study contributes to genre studies and transnational television research. ",

    "abstract": " “Cancel culture” has gained tremendous attention in contemporary political discourse. On platforms like YouTube, reactionary ideological entrepreneurs often employ what Ng terms second-order discourses on cancel culture, that is, portraying call-out practices such as shaming public figures as left-wing censorship efforts stifling free speech. This article argues that such call-out practices, generally ascribed to progressive communities, also occur internally within reactionary communities where fans hold ideological entrepreneurs accountable for adhering to potentially extreme political canons. Adopting a fan studies perspective, this exploratory investigation used “close” and “distant” readings on 1.8 million comments from the now-canceled “The Alex Jones Channel” on YouTube (2017–2018). Focusing on Jones’ recantation of the “Sandy Hook Hoax,” the authors show that, akin to traditional fandom conceptions, radical audiences engaged in call-out practices demanding “character” and “narrative” fidelity. This contribution, theorized as “audience capture,” emphasizes the bottom-up efforts of audiences to maintain the radical views of ideological entrepreneurs. ",

    "title": "Ideology as/of Platform Affordance and Black Feminist Conceptualizations of “Canceling”: Reading Twitter",
    "abstract": " As Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter highlights, platforms’ affordances extend further than UI choices and content formats emphasized. Extant work addresses that political perspectives are implicated in the affordances of platforms; however, the notion of “ideology as/of affordance” requires more scholarly attention, namely, from a Black feminist position which grapples with the raced and gendered dimensions of how such shaping of affordances is understood and experienced in digital contexts. A Black feminist analysis offers a critical intervention that examines the dynamics between ideology, digital culture, and relational experiences of autonomy. Thus, our article outlines how “ideology as/of affordance” is a helpful intervention for illuminating the power relations by which both “cancel culture” and “platform affordances” are defined. Specifically, we explicate how white supremacist ideology underpins platform affordances, which in turn shape who is “canceled,” and consider the key connections and disconnections between them. ",

    "abstract": " NIGHT HEAD was a science fiction drama that aired on Japan’s Fuji TV between 1992 and 1993. The series arrived during a wave of interest in the paranormal, a trend that was embraced by commercial television in both dramatic programs and variety/infotainment talk shows. This boom of interest in the paranormal happened within the thriving economic and cultural environment of Japan’s Bubble Era, a period that saw a rapid expansion of television in addition to the prosperity of markets in real estate and industry. NIGHT HEAD portrays a darker vision of 90s Japan, using visual effects and moody, intense images and sounds to conjure a desperate sensibility. This article will offer an analysis of the “attractive” paranormal turn in Japan during the 1990s, using NIGHT HEAD as a case for considering the intersection of youth, visual effects, and the desire for an alternative way of understanding the world beyond rationality.

    "abstract": " Much of the environmental communication literature follows the consensus-building perspective and thus explores how to communicate climate change in ways that can diffuse politico-ideological conflict. My paper, on the other hand, builds on the critical debate approach—which asserts that the depoliticization of climate change acts as a barrier to transformative socio-ecological change—and argues that animated parody offers a powerful rhetorical tool to re-politicize climate change. I develop the paper’s argument through a case study of the Rick and Morty episode “A Rickconvenient Truth”—a parodical take on the 1990s children’s TV show Captain Planet and the Planeteers. By applying reflexive thematic analysis to a dataset of &gt;7,600 Reddit user comments, I reveal that the episode prompts fans to question “standard” ways of thinking about climate change and deliberate radical alternatives for combatting the ecological crisis.

    "abstract": " This article theorizes the work of deaf fans and audiences in securing streaming video captions, which it names the labor of access. While prior scholarship on captions tends to emphasize policy and regulation, streaming video lacks the legislative framework for disability access seen with televisual captions in the United States. Drawing on disability studies and fan studies, this article shifts focus to fan campaigns, which become a central site for renegotiating industry accessibility practices in the absence of regulatory oversight. Using Netflix as a case study, it chronicles how audience campaigns contribute to both the company’s initial provision of streaming captions and the ongoing work of captioning quality control. It then argues that fan-driven access victories in the era of global streaming are uneven and contingent: a successful captioning campaign in one context has no necessary impact in others. ",

    "abstract": "\n            Broadcast static—interference, visual snow or noise—has been a critical part of media history. Typically signaling a breakdown in communication, representation of static has persisted in cinematic and televisual content. Despite static’s ubiquity throughout broadcast media history, it remains an underexamined object of study. In this paper, I turn to two examples of how static is used as a narrative, rhetorical or esthetic device—as a way to explore new technologies to a parallel world (\n            Poltergeist\n            and\n            From\n            ), and as a means to access and rework the past (\n            The Ring\n             and\n            Archive 81\n            ). Drawing upon media histories of hauntings, these examples demonstrate how static offers a temporal gateway between the present, past, and future. I argue that static is a useful framework through which to understand technological change and failure and show how audiences have been active in reading not only texts but broadcast technologies themselves.\n          ",

In this way,\n            Swamp People\n            demonstrates reality television’s power to not only reinforce but also redefine white masculinity as a cultural reality.\n          ",

    "title": "Deinfluencing TikTok During the Cost-of-Living Crisis: Neoliberal Logics of (Over) Consumption Across Popular Media",
    "abstract": "Following the economic recession of 2008, media texts blamed individual consumers and their reckless and wasteful consumption of designer goods and extravagant homes for contributing to the financial crisis. Within the current context of the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the cost-of-living crisis has led to increases in the cost of everyday necessities. At the same time, social media influencers promote excessive consumption of expensive viral products that are often discarded upon purchase. Responding to these socio-cultural events, deinfluencing became a viral trend on TikTok, where users post videos encouraging viewers to purchase certain products rather than other more expensive options. Positioning deinfluencing as an example of cultural responses to financial crises, this article highlights the parallels between deinfluencing and previous discursive articulations that emerged during the 2008 global financial crisis. Deinfluencing reproduces longstanding cultural formations of consumer citizenship while also reacting to the overconsumption promoted by the digital economy.",

Drawing on frameworks of intensive mothering, postfeminist neoliberal subjectivity, and the concept of after neoliberalism, the analysis reveals a contradictory understanding of teen mothers, with the show intending to de-stigmatize teenage parenthood but often failing to achieve positive promotion. Viewers also show similar contention. The contradiction itself, however, represents an overall move toward accepting diverse forms of family. The visible contention reflects “after neoliberalism” in the South Korean context, where welfare strategies gradually transition from self-governing activities based on surveillance and discipline to adopting more supportive approaches.\n          ",

    "title": "Transmedial Texts on Participatory Digital Platforms: Contextualizing the Re-telecast of Ramayana Amidst Covid-19 Lockdown",
    "abstract": "The protocols of physical distancing during the COVID-19 lockdown hindered the production of new entertainment media resulting in reruns of popular television serials. One such re-telecast was of Ramanand Sagar’s (producer-director) Ramayana on Doordarshan (the public service broadcaster in India) which generated notable excitement amongst the audience. In this context, the paper explores three key elements. Firstly, it delves into the Hindu epic, Ramayana, as a transmedial text that has been adapted across various forms, analyzing its transmission across media. Secondly, it investigates the trend of an engaged audience, assessing how viewers, both old and new, interact with the content on online platforms. Thirdly, it examines the character of Sita played by Dipika Chikhlia to understand how digital platforms help in creating diverse interpretations of a popular public image. Appointing a non-participatory digital ethnography methodology, it explores the symbolic meanings of self-branding and audiences’ expectations when “Sita” meets the internet.",

    "abstract": "As the constitutional republics of Modi’s India and Erdoğan’s Turkey are being recast into ethnonational states, bilateral exchanges of television productions between them have soared, particularly dramas focused on women. Positing this as a socio-cultural rather than a merely industrial phenomenon, this article analyzes television flows between India and Turkey to theorize the concept of “elective affinities.” Elective affinities emerge through affects and resonances that exceed cultural proximities yet foster interest and identification across borders when audiences seek out and identify with transnational media that depict ideological, political, or social systems and values that resonate with their experiences. These elective affinities engender “interstitial agency” among women, content creators, and consumers, creating a dialectical space for women’s interests and concerns in televisual flows traversing two distinct yet connected national media contexts that are marked by the rise of authoritarian populism and its gendered politics.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates how users engage with content on TikTok that was originally produced for television. Based on interviews with participants in Costa Rica, we argue that watching television content on TikTok provides valuable insights into the future trajectories of both television and new media. To this end, we first demonstrate that TikTok’s television flow (in Raymond Williams’ sense) is “co-programed” through user interaction with algorithms, rather than being universally predetermined. We then posit the notion of “uncommitted attention” to argue that watching television on TikTok involves active engagement with content and texto-material conditions that make this experience fleeting and unstable. Finally, we examine how users establish cross-platform flows between TikTok and their broader media environments. In this way, we offer insights into how ontologically ambivalent platforms such as TikTok reconfigure traditional television watching.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines how early career workers in Irish Creative Industries perceive creativity in relation to their work experiences. Based on a survey of twenty workers in media, digital, marketing, and social media roles, the findings show workers did not claim creative identities nor see their jobs as creative. Instead they associate creative workplaces with constraints, and with quite “ordinary” and hard work. Nonetheless, they operationalized an idea of creativity and listed creative fulfilment and recognition as rewards for their work. This finding is significant because it departs from accounts of the attraction of creative work as intrinsically tied to questions of identity and rather points to an ideology of the creative as a key attractor for current new entrants, who privilege an ideal notion of creative work even despite their own material experiences that contradict that ideal.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               This article surveys Joseph Weizenbaum's insights on judgment and the academic and computational practices that he thought were threatening it in the 1960s and 1970s. It also details how the writing of Hannah Arendt, the events of the Vietnam War, and Weizenbaum's identity as a Jewish émigré from Nazi Germany shaped his views on judgment. The essay then describes Weizenbaum's attraction to the humanities and less technically oriented education as a way of mitigating these threats. The conclusion reflects on how Weizenbaum's writings relate to present-day concerns about judgment, computational thinking, and the humanities. Reading Weizenbaum helps highlight computer science's problematic faith in “instrumental reason,” computational practices that promote technological solutionism, and the eugenic qualities inherent in the machine metaphor. The essay also underscores the capacity, and continued value, of human judgment in a world imperiled by large socio-technical systems and AI.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               In our current generative AI paradigm, so-called hallucinations are typically seen as a kind of nuisance that will eventually be swept away as the technology improves. There are several reasons to question this assumption. One of them is that the very phenomenon is the result of deliberate business decisions by corporations invested in delivering diverse sentence structures through deep learning and generative pretrained transformers (GPTs). This article urges a fresh view on hallucinations by arguing that, rather than being errors in any conventional sense, they are evidence of a probabilistic system incapable of dealing with questions of knowledge. These systems are epistemologically indifferent. Yet, by presenting as errors to users of generative AI, hallucinations can function as practical reminders of and indexes to the limits of this kind of machine learning. Viewed this way, hallucinations remind us that every time one gets something reasonable-seeming from a system such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, one might as well have been given something quite outrageous; from the machine's perspective, it's all the same.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               This essay turns to genealogy as a theoretical framework for situating “data” in postcolonial India. In doing so, it is concerned with mapping the fields of power that produce the genealogies of knowledge within which information, Big Data, and algorithms are generated and embedded. Thus, rather than seek an originary moment or linear history, the article engages the continuities and discontinuities between past and present formations. It first tracks the centrality of information in development projects launched after independence in 1947, then turns to the author's own research and to ethnographies of Aadhaar, the Indian state's Big Data project that entails the production, archiving, and mining of biometric information. Aadhaar's interlinking of databases is deployed toward the creation of taxonomies and the biopolitical management of populations. While is not in itself an “intelligent” platform, Aadhaar's data is available for intensive mining and knowledge production and forms the basis of computational policy formation and decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               It is becoming increasingly clear that generative AI technologies come with significant environmental costs. Regardless, commercial generative AI services suggest they will facilitate a form of everyday life in which individual users can produce aesthetic content without limits. This mode of everyday aesthetic production is sold to users through fantasies of frictionlessness and immediacy that simultaneously sanitize and expand generative AI's environmental impact. This essay argues that commercial generative AI services thereby solidify what Ulrich Brand and Markus Wissen call the “imperial mode of living,” in which consumerist comforts are directly sustained by environmental destruction and extractivism. Moreover, the essay suggests that the forms of everyday aesthetic production that generative AI services encourage surreptitiously increase what Bernard Stiegler calls “informational entropy,” describing a dependency on technological infrastructures and processes of aesthetic homogenization that entrench and thus make it more difficult to challenge AI's imperial tendencies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               Artists have been using and misusing tools for decades. But the development and commercialization of diffusion-based image generation tools have challenged definitions of reappropriation, complicating the work of artists who use technology to provoke ideological critiques of technological power. In this article, three artists, operating as the Algorithmic Resistance Research Group (ARRG!), present a framework for the creative misuse of generative AI systems. By situating the lineage of technology-based art as “hacking” (and making as a form of inquiry), this article argues that misusing systems as a form of exploration within art making is a useful tool for critical AI discourse. Focusing on an exhibition of work presented at the hacker conference DEFCON 31 in 2023, the article examines creative misuse aligned with specific critiques. By using generative AI tools while rejecting their premises, artists can redefine creativity as a human endeavor, creating work that engages and shapes debate.",

    "title": "Influence of different parental mediation strategies on adolescents’ hedonistic smartphone use: Parent–adolescent reports",
    "abstract": " Hedonistic smartphone usage refers to smartphone activities for instant gratification and pleasure; increased hedonistic use is associated with perceived stress, problematic smartphone usage, and smartphone addiction among adolescents. Parents naturally intervene in adolescents’ screen media use through various mediation strategies, including active mediation of safety, restrictive mediation, monitoring mediation, and technical mediation, to reduce potential negative impacts and online risks. This study aims to identify the relationship between parental mediation strategies and adolescents’ hedonistic smartphone use using the data from 447 adolescents and 432 parents. This study also explores the consideration of a new mediation technique, participatory learning mediation, in the parental mediation model. Multiple regression results revealed positive and negative associations between different parental mediation strategies and adolescents’ hedonistic smartphone use, with restrictive mediation having no effect.

    "title": "Shaping infrastructural futures: The International Telecommunication Union’s visions for mobile communications and the anticipatory politics of 5G standardization",
    "abstract": " This article shows how dominant actors inscribe certain ideas, visions, and predictions of infrastructural futures for international mobile telecommunications through standardization. It argues that standard setting is a key avenue that brings different (and sometimes divergent) interests, groups, concerns, and activities into alignment around a certain vision of social and technological progress. To demonstrate this, two key stages in the 5G standardization process were examined. First, we explored the path to the release of IMT-2020—the standard for 5G networks, devices, and services released by the Radiocommunication Sector of the International Telecommunication Union. Through the standard setting process, two key visions of 5G—one “evolutionary”, the other “revolutionary”—became highly influential ideas of a future worth striving for. Second, we examined how one technical feature of the IMT-2020 standard—the capacity for network slicing—was realized through the work of partner organization the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). In doing so, this article reveals the processes that define the infrastructural conditions that underpin international mobile telecommunications. It also draws attention to how standardization has the potential to redefine the parameters of mobile media and communication in significant ways. ",

    "abstract": " Mobile applications are often positioned as a technologically driven answer to navigating the world with disability; nevertheless, apps created for specialized communities designed to facilitate mobility can quickly meet friction that stymies movement through place. Accordingly, the effectiveness of mobile apps is determined by a complex sociotechnical puzzle that includes cultures, industry regulations, public knowledge and legislation, the unique histories of urban spaces, and infrastructural access. Drawing from short-term autoethnographic approaches designed to evaluate the utility of mobile applications, this article provides a critical assessment of using location-aware gluten-free apps to navigate traveling in an unfamiliar location, context, and culture with celiac disease. These experiences serve as the basis of a critical heuristic for assessing how the success or lack thereof of app functionality is predicated on the complex networked contexts in which they are embedded: cultural histories of place, the spatial layering of information, and infrastructures of monetization.

    "abstract": " The affordances of different media technologies can affect how users develop parasocial relationships with the media figures they encounter on those devices. This study examined the relationship between mobility and parasocial relationships with podcast hosts. Participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk ( n = 165) responded to a survey on a memorable podcast listening experience. The results revealed a conditional indirect effect of mobility on parasocial relationship strength through narrative transportation. Media multitasking moderated this effect. Specifically, there was a positive effect of mobility on transportation that increased incrementally at moderate and high levels of multitasking. ",

We found a surprising number of users surveyed rely on mobile browsers to conduct internet-based tasks ordinarily associated with standalone apps, such as reading emails (34%), watching videos (24%), and listening to music (16%). Interviews revealed several practical and socioeconomic explanations for “browser-centric” smartphone use, including memory conservation on inexpensive mobile handsets and privacy management. We discuss the implications for information systems and technology adoption theories and for applied researchers who work in mobile product spaces. ",

In recent years, gacha games have gathered a considerable consumer base in the mobile gaming market, and these players have demonstrated strong purchasing power with regard to additional game resources. Within the framework of parasocial interaction and the investment model, this study explored factors influencing players’ game commitment and purchase intentions. This study used structural equation modeling and moderation analysis to examine data collected from 2,045 Chinese mobile game players. Satisfaction and investment size were positively correlated with game commitment and in-game purchase intention. Perceived alternatives were negatively correlated with game commitment. Furthermore, parasocial interaction was positively correlated with satisfaction, investment size, and game commitment and negatively correlated with perceived alternatives. The results indicate that these correlations were moderated by game genre. ",

    "abstract": " Smartphones are increasingly present during the exchanges we have with others in real life. Such co-present smartphone use has mainly been examined from a negative perspective, and research has insufficiently recognized the positive role these behaviors may play in social relationships. The main goal of the current study was therefore to offer insight into the processes by which smartphone co-use may be related to positive social dynamics during in-person interactions. Data were collected through two cross-sectional studies among 1) in Austria ( N = 257, Mage = 32.84, SDage = 13.97, 55.9% female) and 2) in Belgium ( N = 180, Mage = 10.79, SDage = 0.66, 54% female) in 2022. Results from Study 1 indicated a significant indirect relationship between co-use and friendship satisfaction mediated through emotional support and companionship. Only for male participants, the relationship between smartphone co-use and perceived companionship was evident. Study 2 further indicated that this relationship was mediated through increased companionship and perceived emotional support for male participants, but not for female participants. As such, the current study offers an important first step in exploring the positive role co-present smartphone use can play in social relationships among different generations. ",

    "abstract": " Balancing everyday tasks with the expectations of others regarding one's availability via smartphone is a challenge, especially for mothers. This research replicated and further developed studies by Halfmann and colleagues in 2021 and 2024 that yielded contradictory results regarding the conditions of feelings of guilt about (not) using the smartphone. More specifically, we investigated how smartphone-related goal conflict, the availability norm, and the parental phone use norm are related to mothers’ feelings of guilt when completing non-stressful everyday tasks. In addition, we researched how smartphone-related goal conflict and guilt are linked with experiences of recovery and task accomplishment. Results from a preregistered experience sampling study among 227 mothers of young children were largely in line with our hypotheses. They revealed, among others, that frequent smartphone use was more strongly linked with guilt when mothers perceived high goal conflict. If the availability norm was salient, little smartphone use was associated with more guilt. The results also indicated that the availability norm partly legitimized frequent smartphone use despite goal conflict. Nevertheless, overall, the findings suggest that mothers tend to experience low levels of guilt about their smartphone usage behavior and that these feelings do not impair the recovery from tasks. ",

Participants acknowledged the dangers of misinformation spread on WhatsApp but were wary of correcting it because of family and friend dynamics; they were afraid of humiliation or embarrassment; they assumed that the information had not spread to too many others; and they perceived some misinformation as harmless memes.

    "abstract": " An increasing number of researchers are focusing on the adverse consequences of parental phubbing, however, it remains unstudied whether and how parental phubbing impact adolescent materialism. To address the research gap, we investigated the temporal and bidirectional relationships between parental phubbing, loneliness, and adolescent materialism. To be thorough, the mediating role of loneliness and the moderating role of gender were examined. Data were collected from 1,447 Chinese adolescents in June 2019 (T1) and January 2020 (T2). The results showed that T1 parental phubbing positively predicted T2 adolescent materialism, and T1 adolescent loneliness positively predicted T2 materialism, whereas neither of the reverse associations held. There were bidirectional relationships between parental phubbing and adolescent loneliness. Loneliness mediated the association between parental phubbing and subsequent adolescent materialism. There were no gender differences in these relationships. These findings enrich the literature by providing the first empirical support for how parental phubbing increases adolescent materialism. ",

    "title": "Off-grid? Resistant media operations by delivery gig workers in response to app-based tracking",
    "abstract": " Tracking by mobile media has become key to coordination and surveillance of delivery gig work. Through their daily app-based media operations, delivery gig workers contribute to the capitalisation and establishment of platform companies’ spatiotemporal regimes. But this app-based tracking has been a source of tension and conflict, particularly in the face of growing organised and unionised resistance by delivery gig workers in Germany. App-based tracking is evolving into an arena for negotiating resistance, conducting counter-surveillance and (temporarily) disrupting platform-based supply chains. These forms of labour resistance and counter-surveillance by individual riders, works councils or trade unions are either 1) directed against app-based tracking itself or 2) seek to operationalise resistance through the use of app-based tracking. Drawing on an empirical analysis of different forms of resistance, this article offers a critical media studies perspective on resistant mobile media operations in response to app-based tracking. Based on a digital ethnography of resistance by German delivery gig workers, it shows how different forms of resistance in delivery gig work are negotiated against and through app-based tracking. We present local and non-hegemonic perspectives on mobile media operations of spatiotemporal coordination and surveillance that enable a critical analysis of the (non-)human power and information asymmetries involved in gig work resistance.

    "abstract": " The characteristics of mobile technology devices have enabled new ways of integrating technology in familial interactions. This study aimed to investigate (1) differences in perspectives of technoference and family-oriented mobile technology use between parents and children, (2) the relation between parent–child interactions that take place via mobile technology and the quality of the parent–child relationship, and (3) its association with the well-being of parents and preadolescents separately. Structural equation modelling was performed on cross-sectional data from 390 parent–child dyads. The findings revealed discrepancies in child technoference perceptions and varying associations of the different types of mobile technology use with the parent–child relationship and parents' and children's well-being. From children's perspective, both parent and child technoference was negative for the parent–child relationship, whereas family-oriented mobile technology use when physically together was beneficial for the relationship and the child's well-being. From parents’ perspective, only child technoference was negatively related to the parent–child relationship and parent's well-being. Overall, the findings underline that mobile technology use can be both detrimental and beneficial, however, the effects can differ depending on the family member and the type of technology use. ",

    "abstract": " Phubbing (i.e., ignoring someone while using a phone) may occur at work, having an impact on the phubbee, the phubber, and the organization at large. We used a mixed-method experiment to examine the impact of phubbing on different work-related variables such as objective performance, subjective states, and first impression judgments during job interviews. Ninety-three participants took part in a simulated job interview based on the Trier Social Stress Test. In the experimental group, participants were repeatedly phubbed during both the interview and the performance test. At the end of the experiment, phubbed participants were asked to describe their experience, and thematic analysis was used to evaluate their responses. Overall, the results of the quantitative analysis revealed that first impressions, judgments, and subjective states were negatively affected by phubbing. Regarding performance, a within-session analysis revealed that participants performed faster on a performance test (mental arithmetic task) when they were not phubbed compared to when they were. A qualitative analysis of responses revealed considerable differences between interviewees in their use of coping strategies (e.g., rationalization of phubbing). These findings suggest the need to address phubbing in a professional setting. ",

    "abstract": " Digital back-feeding is a bottom-up process by which younger generations teach or assist older generations in digital access, usage, and literacy. This study aims to examine how two means of digital back-feeding—proxy back-feeding and learning back-feeding—might be differently impacted by older adults’ perceptions of smartphone use, as well as their impact on older adults’ digital literacy. A cross-sectional questionnaire survey ( n = 433) was conducted in mainland China. Our findings revealed that perceived usefulness and perceived risk of smartphone use were positively associated with older adults’ engagement with both proxy back-feeding and learning back-feeding. Perceived ease of use was found to be negatively associated with older adults’ engagement in proxy back-feeding. In addition, older adults’ digital literacy was found to be negatively associated with proxy back-feeding, but positively associated with learning back-feeding. Results suggest that digital back-feeding is a complicated process that may influence older adults’ digital literacy through different routes, which deserves further investigation to bridge digital divide intergenerationally.

    "abstract": "Digital technologies have become ubiquitous infrastructures worldwide, with WhatsApp emerging as one of the most widely used apps, particularly in the Global South. However, its integration into rural and Indigenous contexts in Latin America remains relatively unexplored. The Jujuy Puna, situated in Northwest Argentina and home to Quechua communities, recently gained internet connectivity through state initiatives. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in two villages, Cusi Cusi and Lagunillas del Farallón, this paper examines the use of WhatsApp in these communities. Furthermore, it investigates the intricate dynamics of WhatsApp usage within the realms of kinship and caregiving. To comprehend this phenomenon, we mobilize the concept of kinship to encompass and explain the myriad practices through which individuals in these villages establish connections and preserve a sense of collectivity using digital technologies like WhatsApp.",

    "abstract": "People aged over 65 (“older adults”) are among the first to enter later life in a digital data-saturated world. Many older adults across the world are surrounded by mobile media and computational data in their everyday lives. Mobile media, including smartphones, tablets, and wearables, are near-ubiquitous in Australia. At the same time, older adults are among the most digitally excluded in the country and older adults have diverse feelings towards mobile media. High rates of mobile media absorption in the everyday lives of older Australians can obscure the heterogeneity of experiences, perceptions, and concerns towards digital data. In this paper, we use creative speculative methods to unearth older adults’ current and future mobile media affordances (contexts of use), fears and concerns, and what using these methods can reveal about contemporary and future-orientated ageing in data practices.",

    "abstract": "\n            In recent years, reports have pointed at the influence of WhatsApp on a variety of outcomes, ranging from elections to collective violence. While academic research should examine the validity of these claims, obtaining WhatsApp data for research is notably challenging, contrasting with the relative abundance (at least until recently) of data from platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, in which the “information diet” of users has been extensively studied. This lack of data is particularly problematic because WhatsApp may be a powerful vehicle for misinformation and hate speech. To help make research on these questions, and more generally research on WhatsApp possible, this paper introduces\n            Whatsapp Explorer\n            , a tool designed to enable WhatsApp data collection on a large scale. We discuss protocols for data collection, including potential sampling approaches, and explain why our tool (and adjoining protocol) arguably allow researchers to collect WhatsApp data in an ethical and legal manner, at scale. Finally, we provide insights from our pilots in India and Brazil, including details on how much data we were able to collect, sampling challenges, and the path forward.\n          ",

    "abstract": "Older age cohorts have been found to exhibit both less interest and less use of digital technologies than younger cohorts, which suggests that they may be less flexible in comparison to younger technology users. However, frequency is not the only differentiating factor between age groups in the context of mobile technology use, as the specific ways in which technologies are used also play a significant role in the daily lives of older adults (65+). Drawing on the selective optimization with compensation (SOC) model, we ask what strategies older adults use to enhance their subjective well-being when using mobile technologies. The thematic analysis is based on 20 elicitation interviews conducted in Central Finland in 2018. Our findings suggest that mobile technologies can act as both a tool to enhance well-being and a source of problems for older adults, and that older adults show considerable creativity in navigating various mobile, digital and non-digital strategies. Furthermore, we argue that these evolving, and thus also in this sense mobile, strategies contribute to the subjective well-being and successful ageing of older adults by providing them with “workarounds” to manage mobile technologies to their benefit.",

    "abstract": "\n            “You are literally sometimes not allowed to say the names of the leaders of political parties on television. You cannot broadcast their pictures; that alone tells the whole story” (Participant J). Pakistani journalists, particularly political journalists, are going through unprecedented censorship and suppression. They are frequently abducted, harassed, and even killed for reporting on issues that challenge the country's powerful quarters. Pakistan also shares a place on Reporters Without Borders’ list of most censored nations with countries such as Burma, China, Iran, North Korea, Russia, and Vietnam, where governments use repressive tactics such as digital censorship and surveillance to threaten journalists and engineer draconian laws to punish them for doing their jobs. This study analyzes Pakistani political journalists’ perceptions and views of the roles of mobile media and mobile social media in negotiating state censorship and control. Drawing on the conceptual framework of\n            communities of practice\n            , on-ground interviews were conducted with Pakistani political journalists and reporters during the 2024 Pakistani general election. It is argued that mobile media such as smartphones and mobile social media, particularly X, have provided an alternative “free speech zone” to independent political journalists in Pakistan. However, it has also led to a surge in fake news, misinformation, and politically motivated propaganda across online and digital platforms due to the lack of effective regulation and oversight.\n          ",

    "abstract": "The widespread use of smartphones has raised concerns about problematic usage behaviors, including excessive screentime and frequent phone checking, which can disrupt daily functioning. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a multifaceted nudge-based intervention in reducing smartphone use through subtle changes to smartphone settings. The intervention incorporated adjustments such as disabling face/touch ID, setting longer passwords, switching to grayscale mode, and removing social media apps from the home screen. A randomized within-subject cross-over trial with counterbalancing was conducted over a two-week period using a daily diary approach paired with objective smartphone usage data to track the impact of these interventions on both smartphone screentime and checking behavior. Multilevel modeling on 163 young adults with 1508 observations indicated that the intervention significantly reduced both screentime and checking frequency compared to the control condition. However, participants reported higher levels of stress during the intervention, potentially due to the frustration of partial restrictions without full disengagement from their smartphones. These findings highlight not only the potential of multifaceted nudges to reduce smartphone use but also the importance of carefully selecting and combining strategies to avoid unintended stress. This study provides a practical, cost-free and scalable foundation for refining smartphone interventions, contributing to the growing body of research on nudge-based strategies to promote healthier phone habits.",

    "title": "Mobile communication: From gender differences to value production theory",
    "abstract": "In this paper, I propose to explore the relationship between women and the mobile phone through the lens of political economy critique and the Marxian theory of value, as revisited by feminist scholars. In the first part, I offer metatheoretical reflections on strategies to revitalize the theoretical framework of mobile communication studies. I analyze the limitations of how mobile (and digital) studies have, so far, framed the issue of gender. I propose an initial paradigm shift in these studies by broadening the scope of gender and mobile communication research beyond the confines of traditional studies on gender differences, moving toward an exploration of the relationship between women and capital in mobile communication. I continue by proposing a second shift in mobile phone studies, illustrating how mobile communication is increasingly becoming human–machine communication and how the use of mobile phones is actually structured as reproductive labor. I then introduce the theory of value, a well-established sociological theory first proposed by Marx and later reelaborated by feminist scholars. I apply this theory to mobile communication, by expanding it further. Following this, I present a third paradigm shift, advocating a transition from studying the social consequences of mobile communication to investigating the deeper socioeconomic forces driving the adoption of mobile phones and digital technologies for women. The feminist reworking of the theory of value supports these paradigm shifts, enabling us to explore mobile communication within the domestic sphere in a novel way, particularly as it relates to housework and digital labor.",

    "title": "Integrated mobilities: Toward a critical hardware approach to mobile media",
    "abstract": "This article introduces a critical hardware approach to mobile media and communication, focusing on the role of iPhone chipsets. While advanced semiconductors have long been recognized as driving innovation in mobile devices, their specific affordances, arrangements, and politics of composition have received limited critical attention. We begin by examining how hardware, such as integrated circuits and other microelectronics, have factored into mobile media and communication studies, and media studies more broadly, and explain how the dominant understanding of them in terms of facilitating compact device packaging, although powerfully true, is insufficient for understanding the range of critical aspects relevant to device hardware. Next, we introduce a framework for analyzing circuit integrations that can serve as a critical framework for understanding the technical design and operations of smartphones and other mobile media. With this background in hand, we then turn to a comparative analysis of the hardware of three generations of iPhones: the original iPhone, iPhone 5, and iPhone 12.",

    "title": "Polymedia within constraints: Negotiating smartphone usage among socioeconomically marginalized older female adults in the Global South",
    "abstract": "Revisiting polymedia within the ageing context, this research unfolds dynamics experienced by marginalized older groups in the Global South when navigating an increasingly complicated media landscape on smartphones. While polymedia shifts the focus from individual media platforms to an integrated media environment that can potentially expand communicative opportunities, existing discussions on this socio-technological transformation tend to neglect the role of user agency, particularly in socially constrained contexts such as marginalized ageing. Giving a voice to socioeconomically restricted older female adults in the Global South, this research illuminates their engagement with polymedia is contingent upon the intersection of individual ageing experiences as well as uneven social structures and the lack of policy support for digital inclusion in a broader context. The findings highlight their contextualized strategies to make sense of polymedia, revealing their evolving understanding of nuances in media affordances and how they develop their unique media preferences. Simultaneously, the diverse constraints limiting their exploration of polymedia can sometimes transform theoretical communicative opportunities into obstacles, leading to a loss of control within the polymedia environment.",
