    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n          The issue of a national apology to the Stolen Generations by the Federal Government has for some time been central to cultural and political debate in Australia. Responses to the Bringing them Home report-the text that generated a national audience for narratives of child removal-including the mechanics of apology, have come to substantially generate the terms of the Australian reconciliation debate. The desire for the performance of official sorrow has come to dominate arguments about racial atonement to the extent, as several of our contributors note, that more material achievements may have been neglected. \n          This is not to endorse Prime Minister Howard's prioritisation of 'practical' reconciliation, in which the only specific policy the government is prepared to advocate is the provision of basic rights to Indigenous people, but to recognise some of the limitations of the apology focus. The continuation of deliberations about whether or not non-indigenous Australians should express sorrow has the potential to feed into a lengthy history of anxious white Australian self-definition. \n          Reconciliation, and the sorrow which may or may not constitute it, therefore becomes the latest in an endless series of attempts to ascertain Australia's national identity - this time informed by a moral responsibility for historical wrongdoing. In his article, Jen Kwok suggests the potential for the concept of reconciliation to become safely amorphous, expressing the fear that an interest in reconciliation can be acquired for the sake of appearance. In this way, the narrative of a nation reconciled through a governmental process helps to inform ongoing constructions of whiteness.\n\n          While Australia's initial ten-year period of reconciliation has officially ended, the issue of a Federal Government apology has not. Prime Minister Howard's version of an apology-the personal sorrow that never becomes official-seems part of the conservative parties' deliberate obfuscation of the importance of official recognition of indigenous concerns, in the same way that a treaty is dismissed as unnecessary. In this issue, Lynette Hughes takes the conservatives' refusal to acknowledge the need to apologise as a starting point for deliberations on the worth of the concept, with a timely focus on Pauline Hanson's unapologetic re-entry onto the centre of the political stage. \n\n          If Hanson's emergence in 1996 was notable for her grouping of otherness-'Aborigines' and 'Asians'-as threat, this was a simple identification of two forms of difference, in indigeneity and non-white migration, that have been historically constructed as imperilling white Australia. Guy Ramsay takes up an historical connection between two such groups: Chinese and Indigenous peoples of North Queensland during the latter half of the nineteenth century. This community of Others was seen as a significant threat to the 'codes' and 'norms' of white behaviour, as legislation was introduced to restrict the immorality and vice necessarily attached to racial mixing. \n\n          In our feature article, Peta Stephenson also analyses the reasons why the common experience of Australian racism by immigrant and Indigenous people has not forged significant bonds between the two groups. Beginning with a letter written by members of the Vietnamese community in response to the Federal Government's ongoing refusal to apologise to the Stolen Generations, Stephenson traces some of the current reasons for the lack of interaction between those theorised as Other in settler-indigene and Anglo-Ethnic conceptions.   \n\n          Despite, or perhaps because of, the historical proofs of the mistreatment of migrant groups, there is reason to suggest continuity in the behaviour of settler nations towards non-white peoples. Rita Wong's examination of the Canadian government's treatment of recent refugees to Canada provides similarities with Australia's own human rights record in this area. This impulse to criminalise refugee seekers is certainly one shared by both nations. The racialisation of the refugees in the media and government rhetoric implies that the persecution of Asians in Canada is not only an historical event.\n\n          A further relevant international comparison to the Australian situation is evident in South Africa, where issues of reconciliation and apology for historical misdeeds have gained great societal prominence. Despite the limitations of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, there was an intimacy to the discourses of apology made possible by the presence of 'perpetrator' and 'victim' in the same room: institutional space was provided by the Commission for the confessions of the perpetrators of human rights violations.\n\n          These personal reconciliations intensify the focus on the apology to the 'victims' of human rights violations, and emphasise the personal accountability of those who perpetrated such acts. From her article on the workings of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Andie Miller's conclusion suggests that the official impulse to reconcile-a feature of both Australia's and South Africa's version of national redemption-cannot produce results that are acceptable to all elements of society. Likewise, an emphasis on personal investment in an 'apology' is apparent in the contributions of Kwok and Hughes in this issue.  \n\n          Even now, the reconciliation issue remains the locus of much angst and self-reflection. Having a gathering such as Australia Deliberates: Reconciliation for the 21st Century -- which was screened mid-February 2001 by the ABC -- aptly demonstrates the range of complex societal changes which need to take place. More to the point, the concept of reconciliation must move, as Jackie Huggins argues, from being a deed to becoming a plan (\"Australia Deliberates\").\n\n          \n          References\n\n\"Australia Deliberates: Reconciliation for the 21st Century\".

    "title": "Who Owns Your Sickness in the New Corporate Wellness?",
    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n       \n                     Workplace wellness programs raise the question: Who owns the health and sickness of the employee? \n          Once, they belonged to the person and his/her doctor, in a kind of binary health relationship. Now companies have made it a triangular relationship. But actually, it's rectangular - the government is also shaping this relationship by occupying a fourth corner. As Nikolas Rose (1989) points out in his exploration of the place of individual in the corporate state, history suggests that it might be the government whose corner is dominant.\n          Rose notes that \"Taylorism\", the scientific pursuit of maximum efficiency of human labour which was fashionable early last century, is now seen not just as the creation of industrialists like Henry Ford. Much more broadly, it reflected a philosophy current in the western industrialised nations like the US, UK and Germany. Achieving optimum output from men and machines was \"part of a wide family of political programmes that sought to use scientific knowledge to advance national efficiency through making the most productive use of material and human resources.\" \n          Reflecting prevailing political climates, national governments had already begun to introduce legislation which regulated the relationship between capital and labour. Ostensibly, these laws were intended to protect the rights of workers, but Rose suggests that their ultimate motivation was to ensure the nation received social dividends from the labour market. \n          That was then. Now, social dividends from employment may be different but governments are still pursuing them. It was a labour government in Australia in the 1980s which first required employees to fund their own aged pensions (by trading off pay increases for superannuation). In another manifestation of their worry about the costs of an ageing population, governments are now prodding workers to become their own health managers, through the agency of wellness programs at work. \n          Wellness programs really began to flourish in the last 20 years, most visibly in the Unites States where pressure from the employee health insurance system and high participation targets set by the Federal Government have made them the rule. \"As a result, work-site health promotion programs are becoming increasingly prevalent. In 1985, 65 percent of work sites with 50 or more employees offered at least one health promotion activity. The [Government's] Healthy People 2000 goals aim to increase this proportion to 85 percent and to increase employee participation in these programs.\" (Meurer et al. 1997, p. 384) \n          In other countries, pressure from insurance/litigation may be weaker, but employers have increasingly seen workplaces as suitable locations for health campaigns targeted at their employees, and governments have become supportive of such programs because of the public health benefits and convenience. They might be viewed as privatised community health promotion. In Australasia: \"The idea of using workplaces as sites to promote health is attractive from a public health point of view. It provides an opportunity for adults to gain access to health promotion initiatives and enables them to participate in programs planned according to their needs in a familiar physical and social setting. It also provides an opportunity for health promotion efforts to extend to the worker's home and involve his/her family.\" (Williams 1991, p. 490) \n          From an employer's perspective, workers' sickness has always been a matter of interest because of the duty of care. In the distinctive social environment of work, their health has belonged at least partly to the company, but the wellness programs may be further stripping away the autonomy of health. Moral philosopher R S Downie and his co-writers (1990) believe that health promotion is not value-free. \"It endeavours to persuade people to adopt certain lifestyles.\") It attempts to transfer to the employees values held by the organisation, promoting a particular lifestyle - in this case, a healthy one. \n          Participation in wellness programs provides benefits which flow in two directions. The company donates the resources which allow the employees to avoid sickness and to live healthier lives. The employees donate a longer and more productive working life to the company and society. In this way, these programs conform with the dominant current management philosophy describing the relationship between employee and employer. Just as Hirschhorn (1988) describes how workers won social freedoms in exchange for psychological \"unfreedoms\" (the work ethic) in the industrial revolution , so Rose describes how modern, caring management practice is all about \"aligning the wishes, needs and aspirations of each individual who works for the organisation with the successful pursuit of its objectives\". A win-win situation? \n          In some organisations, some employees may not see it that way. The fact that wellness programs are declared \"voluntary\" may not necessarily rectify a perception of compulsion. Employees may believe that nothing is truly voluntary at work. With these concerns in mind, Stokols et al. (1995) advocate ethical guidelines to prevent job discrimination based on health status and related potential conflicts of interest. They say that the bottom-line benefits to management of health-promotion campaigns cannot legitimately include discriminating against employees who refuse to make healthy lifestyle choices. \n          Discrimination might exist on another level. What is the company to make of workers who choose to continue an unhealthy lifestyle which may put them at greater risk of a succumbing to a health hazard at work? The most well-known of such consequences is the predisposition to bronchial illness caused by smoking. \n          Of course, there are two sources of sickness at work; self-induced and work-induced. Smoking cigarettes may cause self-induced sickness. Mining asbestos may cause work-induced sickness. If it was once clear who was responsible for which sickness, the advent of workplace wellness programs has reduced the clarity. Such health promotion can make it seem that the employer has taken responsibility for both self-induced and work-induced sickness, or perhaps the worker has. Wellness programs are culturally ambiguous. Their very introduction signifies the employer's care for employees' health, but the function of the program is to teach the employees how to take responsibility for it. So Blewett and Shaw (1995) wonder whether health promotion programs change the balance of responsibility between employer and employee. The origin of this issue, they suggest, is in the World Health Organisation's 1986 Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion, which describes health promotion as \"the process of enabling individuals and communities to increase control over the determinants of health and thereby improve their health.\" (cited in Blewett &amp; Shaw 1995, p. 462) The writers argue that the health promotion rhetoric is increasingly focused on promoting 'self-responsibility' for health in the workplace, and the skills of health self-care. \n          If governments value wellness programs, and business likes them, is the workplace a conducive cultural setting for wellness to be marketed? Do workplace health promotion programs obviate the well-documented communication barriers from which community programs suffer? It seems they might. \"Worksites afford a high degree of leverage for influencing the health of the population,\" according to Stokols et al. (1995, p. 1136) \"Leverage\" is a reference to the big percentage of the population (the employed) they reach, as well as the power of persuasion in a workplace. The persuasion can derive from the corporate culture which employers strive to create in their organisations - a mono-culture whose values are aligned with those of all members. It can also derive from company rules - all members of the organisation, whether value-sharers or value-rejectors, are captured by the requirement to conform with wellness objectives. Thus, in western industrial democracies, where smoking is banned it is usually because they are places of work. \n          It is necessary to ask the question: Do employees exposed to health promotion at work make good use of self-care skills. Williams (1991) notes that the uptake of health promotion campaigns, not at work but in the broad community, is greatest among those who least need the benefits - that is, it correlates with socio-economic status. Wellness programs in industrial settings provide opportunities for health promotion to reach lower-paid trades and \"blue-collar\" employees not well served by these community campaigns. However, poor health behaviours are based on life-long habits, usually reinforced by people's lifestyles, reference groups and family structure. These habits take time and persistence to counteract. It is only in the long term that participation gives employees positive benefits, and therefore positive reinforcement for their healthy efforts. Noblet and Murphy (1995, p. 18) report that \"early workplace programs relied heavily on behaviour change techniques as their health promotion strategy.\" Therefore, many failed to produce lasting change because they did not take advantage of the complex social and cultural structure that exists within each workplace. The writers suggest that recently \"activities have expanded beyond risk reduction strategies to a settings approach that addresses the social, organisational, environmental and cultural factors.\" (Noblet and Murphy 1995, p. 18) \n          In conclusion, it is likely that the motivation for companies to run health promotion campaigns will increase, but wellness may be a concept which fits somewhat awkwardly in the employer-employee relationship. Perhaps care for employees is the factor which will bring outcomes beneficial to all. Farnell (1987) expresses such care this way: An organisation's health comprises three components, its financial health, its organisational health (openness, trust, morale, etc) and the personal health of its members. No employer should consider the organisation in good shape without addressing each component. \n          \n          References \n          \nBlewett, V. and Shaw, A. \"Health promotion, handle with care.\" Journal of Occupational Health and Safety Australia and New Zealand 11 (1995): 461-5.\n            Downie, R., Fyfe, C. and Tannahill, A.

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n       \n                    The following essay constitutes a theoretical journey through the landscape of the NAMES Project AIDS Quilt, one narrated from the perspective of those who live on to mourn, to remember. To some critics, my approach might at once appear radical or unorthodox since I focus on how Quilt spectators engage with the artifact and are thereby implicated in the history of the epidemic, rather than on how the dead are made to speak from beyond the grave. My intent is not to invalidate the claims made or the conclusions reached by other critics who have written persuasively about how the Quilt facilitates a voice (both individual and collective) for those who have died of AIDS-related illnesses; indeed, such critics have contributed a wealth of significant knowledge to critical understandings of the pedagogical and political functions of the Quilt. My intent, rather, is to respond to a set of as yet unexplored questions about how the ever-evolving landscape of the AIDS epidemic has altered the nature and purpose of Quilt spectatorship.  \n          When the Quilt was created in 1985, “naming names” was an important strategy for political survival, especially given the institutional apathy that silenced and marginalized all who were infected and/or affected by the epidemic. However, over the past sixteen years, apathy has slowly given way to increased attention by medical and media institutions. No longer is memory and reverence enough. Now, we must ask ourselves how the Quilt can continue to be used to combat the emergent obstacles that have sprung up in the wake of apathy and silence. This is not to suggest that remembrance, mourning, and reverence are not still significant responses to the epidemic; we cannot forgot the past, lest we repeat it. But it is to suggest that as we look back, we also must move forward and continue to chart new horizons for how our minds and bodies engage with the Quilt as a social and political space. Throughout this essay, then, my conclusions are at best tentative, offered more as a gesture of hope than as a model for survival. It is my hope that critics can continue to press against social spaces both with caution and determination because those actions matter. We must act with caution because there can be devastating consequences of asserting claims to visibility and location. We must act with determination because there are equally perilous consequences of not doing so. \n          Since its meager beginnings, the NAMES Project AIDS Quilt has undergone exponential changes in size, shape, and scope, but critical responses to the Quilt have remained stagnant with most critics attributing to the Quilt a single meaning and purpose: to revere the dead. Cultural critic Peter S. Hawkins, for instance, argues that \"the Quilt . . . is most profoundly about the naming of names\" (760), while journalist Jerry Gentry suggests that the Quilt bespeaks \"a national and international constructive expression of grief\" (550), a grief which most powerfully resonates in the loss of individual lives. While \"naming names\" is a politically important function of the Quilt, critics who read the artifact as only motivated by memory assume that exhibitions of the artifact facilitate a static model of performance. For such critics, the Quilt represents a mass graveyard--both as a place of interment and as a place in which ideological meanings are circumscribed by the fixity and stillness of reverence. (This reading is partly enabled by the fact that each panel measures the size of a human grave.) Not only does this reading universalize the meaning of the Quilt but also it establishes a monolithic viewing position from which to receive that meaning. \n          Here, I outline an alternative model of reception which is implicit in the design and display of the Quilt. While this model acknowledges reverence as one potential response to the Quilt, it does not foreclose other ways of reading. Rather than facilitating a grave performance, then, the Quilt enables performances within the grave. These performances are constituted in/through a dynamic exchange between speaker and listener, text and context, and work to produce a range of ideological meanings and subject positions. \n          To understand how the Quilt locates its viewers within a particular subject position, it is first necessary to specify the speaker-listener relationship established in displays of the Quilt. This relationship is played out through a series of confessional utterances which, as Michel Foucault explains in The History of Sexuality, Volume 1, imply a dialectic relationship between speaker and listener in which subjectivity is predicated on subjection (61-62). The speaker's desire to confess necessitates the presence of a listener, one not wholly passive since his/her presence incites and enables the will to confess. In this way, both speaker and listener are marked as active/passive agents in an exchange characterized by reciprocity and negotiation. Because speakers and listeners simultaneously serve as subject and object of the confession, the exchange cannot be represented as static (active/passive) or unidirectional (sender-message-receiver). \n          Since many critics already have carefully delineated the processes through which the Quilt directs the address of the panels and constitutes the dead as subjects, here I want to focus on how spectators are constructed as subjects who bear witness. Critics typically posit viewers of the Quilt as unified, coherent, monolithic subjects; yet Foucault's discussion of the confessional exchange assumes a subject-in-process. For me, this process is most accurately characterized as schizophrenic. My use of schizophrenia is tropic rather than diagnostic, in that the term works figuratively to describe subject formation rather than to identify the nature of psychiatric disturbance. Two characteristics (which are derived from the symptomatology of the psychic disorder schizophrenia) define the schizophrenic spectator: one, the loss of \"normal\" associations; and two, the presence of \"auditory hallucinations.\" \n          The first characteristic of schizophrenic spectators is the loss of \"normal\" associations. Remi J. Cadoret notes that in schizophrenics, \"[t]hought processes appear to lose their normal associations, or usual connecting links, so that the individual is often unable to focus his [sic] thinking upon a particular mental task\" (481). For schizophrenics, conventional relational markers (such as chronology, causality, temporality, and spatiality) no longer order cognition; instead, these markers are distorted (if not entirely ineffectual), creating for the schizophrenic a fractured sense of self in/and world. Without these normal associations, the schizophrenic wanders aimlessly (and often in isolation) through a chaotic world in search of structure, meaning, and purpose. \n          Temporal associations provide perhaps the most common means of ordering experience. Viewed as a linear progression characterized by movement, change, and renewal, time structures the historical and the everyday by sequencing, demarcating, and hierarchizing events. Within the Quilt, this sense of progression is supplanted by perpetual repetition of the present. Elsley has offered a similar observation, noting that the Quilt operates in a \"transitory present\" tense, it \"exists in a continual state of becoming\" (194). In one sense, this perpetual present tense derives from the fact that no two displays of the Quilt are identical. Panels are ordered differently, new names and panels are added, older panels begin to show signs of wear-and-tear. A perpetual present tense also derives from the fact that the Quilt charts the progression of an epidemic that is itself ongoing, incomplete. Thus, the landscape of the Quilt is re-mapped in light of advances in HIV-treatment, softening/tightening of social mores, and changes in AIDS demographics. \n          Another common means of ordering experience is though spatial associations. Location orders the social through architecture, urban planning, and zoning, endowing spaces with a well-defined purpose and layout. Yet the Quilt provides few signals regarding how spectators are intended to navigate its surface. As Weinberg notes, the Quilt is a \"great grid\" with \"no narrative, no start or finish\" (37). By describing the Quilt as a \"grid,\" Weinberg implicitly ascribes to the artifact a controlling logic, a unified design--what in quilting parlance is termed a patchwork sampler. This design pattern, however, does not direct the flow of spectators in a single stream of traffic. This is so because, unlike a Drunkard's Path or Double Wedding Band pattern in which the individual panel blocks work together to create a unified design across the surface of the quilt, a patchwork sampler is constituted by a series of single panel blocks, each with a unique design, history, and logic. As a result, patrons' movements are guided by associations and punctuated by pauses, interruptions, and abrupt changes in course. The randomness of engagement is further enabled by the muslin walkways which visually separate the panels, marking each as distinct and disallowing any sense of continuity (narrative, spatial) among them. The routes which visitors of the Quilt traverse thus are transitory and ephemeral, simultaneously charted and erased in the moment of passing by. \n          The second characteristic of schizophrenic spectators is the presence of auditory hallucinations. Cadoret defines these hallucinations as \"the perception of auditory stimuli, or sounds, where none are externally present . . . . The voices . . . may repeat his [sic] thoughts or actions, argue with him [sic], or threaten, scold, or cure him [sic]\" (481). Auditory hallucinations can lead the schizophrenic to believe that s/he is under constant surveillance or can cause the schizophrenic to slip further into a self-contained, isolated world of delusion. \n          That the Quilt is made up of \"a myriad of individual voices\" (Elsley 192) is immediately apparent in the number of individuals who have taken part in its construction and display. With each quilt panel, spectators are confronted with multiple voices--the person who has died, the person(s) who made the block, the person(s) who stitched the block to others for a specific display, and so on. Moreover, the Quilt places these \"individual voices . . . in the context of community\" (Elsley 191). For Quilt spectators, then, memories of a life lived coexist with grief over a life cut short, anger at institutional apathy and systemic homophobia, faith in the import of remembering those who have died, and so on. Each of these voices vie for the spectator's attention, facilitating a gaze that is dynamic, multidirectional, mobile. Because the gaze is not fixed, the Quilt cannot convey a solitary truth claim to its viewers; rather, spectators must immerse themselves within the delusion and confusion of voices, imposing some sense of order on their own viewing experiences. \n          Given that persons with AIDS continue to be marginalized within American culture, my use of the schizophrenic spectator to trace the reception dynamic of Quilt exhibits might appear to perpetuate, rather than unsettle, dominant ideological formations. Of course, this is the critical conundrum at the center of all investigations into subject formation: that is, \"how to take an oppositional relation to power that is, admittedly, implicated in the very power one opposes\" (Butler 17). Despite the potential pitfalls, I nonetheless use the trope of schizophrenia precisely because it recognizes the ways in which Quilt spectators, persons with AIDS, and persons who have died of AIDS-related illnesses are divested of the power and authority to speak even before they begin speaking. Furthermore, because the schizophrenic subject is founded on ever-shifting affinities (in time, across space), the position enables spectators to chart alternative lines of relation among institutional practices, ideological formations, and individual experiences, thus potentially mobilizing and sustaining a shared political program. It is on these twin goals of pedagogy and polemics that the NAMES Project originally was founded, and it is to these goals that we now must return. \n          \n          References\n          \nButler, Judith.

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n          In early February 2001, the greater Ipswich region was dotted with advertising posters for New Idea featuring a full picture of Pauline Hanson, dressed in lily white. The determined look of a much put-upon woman ready to do battle for home and hearth is worn into her slightly smiling face. The heading reads \"PAULINE’S BACK – ‘I’ll NEVER say sorry’\".\n          Central in the conceptualisation of this issue of M/C was consideration of what a change of Prime Minister might mean for prospects of an apology to the Stolen Generations, given that the current leader is never likely to give one. In New Idea, Hanson makes it clear that she will not apologise, and yet she is unclear in her own inimitable way: \"I will never say sorry to the Aborigines. ¼ Why should I say sorry? I don’t think John Howard should say sorry either. Once he does, the Government will be liable to pay out huge compensation to the Aborigines. That’s what they’re after – money!\" (Lloyd 14).\n          Here Hanson is clearly missing the point of the whole ‘Bringing Them Home’ Inquiry and yet, in the midst of all her aggression, she suddenly makes a valid point: \"[t]hey want an admission that we did wrong by them and continue to do so. ¼ We should accept and acknowledge what has happened and make sure it never happens again\" (Lloyd 14). This is punctuated by the declaration that members of the Stolen Generations should somehow simply stop ‘dwelling on it’ – it is this different attitude that is needed to effect ‘change’, and by ‘change’ Hanson does not necessarily mean any improvements for Indigenous peoples. The article goes on to link the apology with ‘handouts’, which should cease, and the problem of ‘divisions’ within the country as a result of Native Title and land rights. \n          Clearly New Idea has chosen to market this story by choosing a headline which uses the topical issue of an apology to the Stolen Generations, and created a new focus of anger for Hanson’s supporters in the process: an article intended to promote Hanson’s attempts at political survival becomes an onslaught against the acknowledgment of history’s mistakes. As the rise of Pauline Hanson has illustrated, such a message holds considerable weight in public sentiments, even among people who do not directly embrace such ideas. \n          Hanson came close to expressing personal sorrow towards Indigenous people in the initial letter which brought her celebrity in 1996: \"I would be the first to admit that, not that many years ago, the Aborigines were treated wrongly but in trying to correct this they have gone too far. I don’t feel responsible for the treatment of Aboriginal people in the past because I had no say, but my concern is for now and the future\" (14). Howard has done better, offering a far less conditional personal apology on occasion and acknowledging, after a period of equivocation when he first became Prime Minister, the disadvantage faced by Indigenous people. However, he is still unwilling to offer an official apology as leader of the nation (\"Transcript of the Prime Minister\"). \n          Apology may certainly involve fear of compensation, as Hanson argues, and we must acknowledge the difficulty of making an apology that is meaningful. The act of saying sorry does not absolve all blame and those supporting a genuine form of reconciliation must recognise, and continually combat, the enduring dynamics of racialisation and denial.\n          The best example of a formal apology to the Stolen Generations would include profound sorrow for what my forebears and I, and those from whom I have so richly benefited, have done and are doing to Indigenous people. However, I am unwilling to accept that an apology could be as politically or practically significant in itself as current movements seems to suggest. At most, it is only an opening into a process that might lead to a better way for Indigenous and non-Indigenous people to deal with each other, but would seem very unlikely to change relations between Indigenous peoples and the Australian state. Years of hearing about Reconciliation and calls for governments to make amends with Indigenous peoples for the great crimes of Australian history have left me frustrated and despondent. This is partly because the current Federal Government does not seem driven to constructive action, and partly because reconciliation would seem to entail something more tangible than ‘performances’ of redemption and sorrow.\n          When moves for a public forum for apology to the Stolen Generations were first made I struggled with the usefulness of the idea. It may be a good first step to acknowledge that horrible wrongs have been done, to express sorrow that such things have happened – and it is certainly better than (the still very common) outright or partial denial. Social justice, however, does not come from the confessional, and concepts such as an apology and Reconciliation can have diametrically opposed meanings in practice for different people. \n          What has it meant for the Prime Minister of Australia to express personal sorrow? What have the formal apologies of other political leaders in Australia actually meant? Apologies of this nature are not to be made at all lightly. I am of the opinion that an apology to the Stolen Generations needs to take into account a web of interrelated events and political aspirations linked to the invasion of this continent. \n          I take the apologies of State political leaders and the Federal Opposition with reservation. Former Prime Minister Paul Keating, in announcing the Federal Government’s acceptance of the Native Title decision, made magnanimous admissions of guilt on behalf of the Australian state, including special mention of the Stolen Generations. Yet within the same speech he initiated the major acquisition of Aboriginal lands with the Native Title Act. In the first instance, this did little more than guarantee the title interests of non-Indigenous invaders and their descendants. It seems that nothing is returned or acknowledged to Aboriginal people without something more significant being taken. The symbolic politics of being seen to be righting the historical wrongs has to go much further if this ritual is not to be repeated. The persistence of colonialist practices in Australian government structures and policies that pertain to Indigenous Australians is an issue yet to be addressed. \n          In this environment, apologies are accompanied by repetitions of those same or related abuses. In early 1994, Aunty Maureen Watson of the Brisbane Council of Elders spoke of the situation of the German people and government who, having apologised for the Holocaust, made guarantees that it would never happen again. She made the point that this has never happened in Australia, and with increasing political conservatism, it seems unlikely that laws against the denial of historical atrocities would be considered in this country.\n          In relation to the realities of past government policies towards Indigenous peoples and the Stolen Generations, it is clear that many people are outraged and welcome the chance to say so. \n          If people took the implications of apology seriously, they would realise that merely saying sorry is not enough. Even while the act of apologising raises the issue of compensation, this politically significant step is a necessary one.\n          The possibility of an apology has introduced the opportunity for Australians to think about the tragedies of our nation’s past and our inherited responsibility for these events, and for the benefits we have gained as a result. It has also provided an opportunity for individuals involved in the removals to think carefully about their involvement and to make amends for their individual actions. It cannot be, however, a substitute for the great recompense that is due Indigenous peoples, and merely serves as a starting point.\n          \n          References\n\n Hanson, Pauline. \"Equal Justice for All\".

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n       \n                     The mobile telephone, or cellular telephone as it is called in North America, is the fastest-growing consumer product of the past decade. [1] Despite its popularity, metaphors of risk, contamination, and illness frequently run through stories about cellphone use. These representations are based mostly on a lingering but unproven link between brain cancer and cellphone use. Despite numerous scientific studies, none have definitively ruled out the risk and none have found conclusive evidence of harm. The claim that cellphone use is potentially dangerous or downright carcinogenic is supported instead by plenty of anecdotal evidence, rumour, urban myth, and \"junk science.\" \n          What is interesting to me is that these different representations of cellphone use as a practice that poses relative, absolute and no risk can coexist and persist, despite obvious contradictions. I suggest that Donna Haraway's concept of breached boundaries and Ulrich Beck's notion of \"risk society\" can be employed superficially to make sense of how we negotiate these different representations. \n          In order to begin a discussion about why cellphone use in North America continues to be represented as a potentially risky practice, it is necessary to mention one story that is frequently credited as being the starting point for the narrative of fear and anxiety informing these representations. In spite of its germinal status, the story is but the latest embodiment of the narrative. \n          It begins in August 1988 in Florida when David Reynard gave his wife Susan the gift of a cellphone. Seven months later, a medical scan revealed a tumour in Susan's brain. She claimed that as a result of being bombarded by radiation from the cellphone, the damaged cells either caused her tumour or accelerated the growth of an existing tumour. In April 1992, Susan launched a lawsuit against the phone's manufacturer, the company that provided the cellular service, and the retail store that sold the phone. A month after filing the lawsuit, Susan died of brain cancer. \n          In January 1993, David Reynard was interviewed on the highly-rated CNN show Larry King Live. The interview sent shockwaves through the telecommunications industry. Stock prices of the major cellphone companies fell and some subscribers cancelled their contracts and returned their phones. Spokespeople for the industry countered David's accusations with claims that electromagnetic energy is as harmless as the oxygen we breathe. In fact, they said, it is already all around us in natural and artificial forms, including in emissions from the earth and sun. \n          A spokesperson for Motorola, a major cellphone manufacturer, predicted that Susan's lawsuit would fail because \"thousands\" of studies had been conducted, which proved that radiation emitted by cellphones was not dangerous to users. In fact, no such studies existed. The lie was revealed when journalists and Susan's lawyer asked to see the studies. Almost as if to make up for the lie, the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association,[2] a lobby group for North American cellular service providers, created the Wireless Research Center. Not surprisingly, the Center produced findings during its six-year mandate that were mostly favourable to the industry. \n          In 1995, Susan's lawsuit was dismissed by a judge who said no reliable scientific evidence had been presented to link cellphone use to cancer. Expert witnesses for the defence had argued that the evidence presented on her behalf was merely wild speculation, \"junk science,\" and a perversion of science masquerading as real science. \n          Over a dozen similar lawsuits have been filed in the U.S. and the U.K. since. Few of them have surpassed Susan's lawsuit in notoriety and none have earned a favourable ruling. While it is still both mocked and venerated in the popular media and is the focus of derision in the telecom industry press and in medical science journals, the question central to the case (but does it cause cancer?) is still unresolved and so are the contradictions now associated with it. \n          Did Susan's own body generate her tumour or was it generated by cellphone radiation? Where is the line between junk science and real science? Is artificial radiation from a cellphone as harmless as natural radiation from the earth or sun? These questions are indicative of some of the boundary breakdowns that Haraway claims are causing disorder and contradiction in late twentieth-century Western culture, namely between human and machine, between the physical and non-physical, and between natural and artificial. \n          According to Beck, the degeneration of these boundaries are also indicative of a risk society characterised by environmental degradation. Because this degeneration is both perceived and potential, it hardly matters anymore what is rational or irrational, legitimate science or junk science. Both factual and fictional texts contribute to our knowledge of risks surrounding cellphone use as a biohazard that is a threat to individual bodies and to the social body. \n          A series of events occurring throughout the 90s in North America added to the ambiguity and mystery surrounding cellphone use. Numerous rumours circulated about the practice sparking explosions at petrol stations and causing interference with car brakes, airbags, and electric wheelchairs. In addition, Health Canada and the U.S . Food and Drug Administration issued several bulletins to alert the public that cellphone use could cause heart pacemakers, hospital monitoring equipment, and aeroplane navigational instruments to malfunction. \n          Susan's lawsuit ended when the court imposed closure, but the narrative embodied by the lawsuit continued in these rumours and warnings. The lawsuit was an event with a clear beginning and end. The narrative of fear and anxiety about contamination that could lead to illness, disease, and death preceded the lawsuit and was already embodied in other stories, particularly ones surrounding cancer and AIDS. \n          When Susan launched her lawsuit, in some media reports, the cellphone was called the \"new cancer villain\" and the potential link between cancer and cellphone use was deemed the \"yuppies version of AIDS.\" The comparison of cellphone use to cancer and AIDS functions both as a cultural and biological metaphor. It links the practice explicitly with disease and implicitly with death, and it also recalls the narrative of fear and anxiety surrounding cancer and AIDS, two potentially fatal diseases which preceded the introduction of cellphones. \n          Seventeen years have passed since the cellphone became widely available in North America. Currently, almost nine million Canadians, or one in three people, own a cellphone. In the United States, there are 108 million users. Subscriptions there are increasing at the rate of approximately 46,000 each day or about one new owner every two seconds. \n          The recent flood of private talk in public places in North America is being represented in popular media as a contamination of the social body, a morally repugnant practice, and a menace to civil society. A moral panic has arisen over cellphone use because it allows conversations to be audible and the user to be visible where before they were inaudible and the user was invisible by virtue of being hidden away in homes, offices, and phone booths. In public places the voice of the cellphone user extends the self and claims more space, which in turn impinges on the personal space of others. It is like a stranger's unwelcome touch. \n          Proof that the moral panic has reached a new level in Canada may be evident in a request from the federal government last March for public opinion on whether devices known as silencers or jammers should be licensed for use so that businesses and institutions can disable cellphones within a particular radius when necessary. \n          As a result of the popular use of the term \"cellphone\" in North America, a neat conflation of meaning is occurring between cellphone use as a potential threat to biological cells in the human body and the practice as a perceived threat to the physical spatial cells of personal spaces that comprise the social body. \n          Stories about cellphone use as hazard articulate a narrative of fear and anxiety we share that cannot simply be dismissed as absurd. How people respond to cellphone use and the health questions and moral panic surrounding it cannot be decided by medical or legal experts alone. Consequently, in a risk society characterised by a peculiar synthesis of \"empirical knowledge\" and \"indefinite uncertainty,\" the question \"does it cause cancer?\" becomes irrelevant. According to Beck, it may be more useful to ask \"how do we want to live?\" \n          \n          Endnotes\n          [1] \"Cellphone\" (a contraction of cellular and telephone) is the popular term for \"mobile telephone\" in North America. \"Mobile phone\" usually refers to car phones with an antennae mounted on the roof or window of the car. \n          [2] The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association was recently renamed the Cellular Telecommunications &amp; Internet Association. \n          References \n          \nAdams, Barbara, Ulrich Beck, and Joost van Loon, eds.

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n            My thesis is that new media, starting with analog broadcast and going through digital convergence, blur the line between work time and free time. The technology that we are adopting has transformed free time into potential and actual labour time. At the dawn of the modern age, work shifted from tasked time to measured time. Previously, tasked time intermingled work and leisure according to the vagaries of nature. All this was banished when industrial capitalism instituted the work clock (Mumford 12-8). But now, many have noticed how post-industrial capitalism features a new intermingling captured in such expressions as \"24/7\" and \"multi-tasking.\" Yet, we are only beginning to understand that media are driving a return to the pre-modern where the hour and the space are both ambiguous, available for either work or leisure. This may be the unfortunate side effect of the much vaunted \"interactivity.\" \n          Do you remember the old American TV show Dobie Gillis (1959-63) which featured the character Maynard G. Krebs? He always shuddered at the mention of the four-letter word \"work.\" Now, American television shows makes it a point that everyone works (even if just barely). Seinfeld was a bold exception in featuring the work-free Kramer; a deliberate homage to the 1940s team of Abbott and Costello. Today, as welfare is turned into workfare, The New York Times scolds even the idle rich to adopt the work ethic (Yazigi). \n          The Forms of Broadcast and Digital Media Are Driving the Merger of Work and Leisure More than the Content\n          It is not just the content of television and other media that is undermining the leisured life; it is the social structure within which we use the media. Broadcast advertisements were the first mode/media combinations that began to recolonise free time for the new consumer economy. There had been a previous buildup in the volume and the ubiquity of advertising particularly in billboards and print. However, the attention of the reader to the printed commercial message could not be controlled and measured. Radio was the first to appropriate and measure its audience's time for the purposes of advertising. Nineteenth century media had promoted a middle class lifestyle based on spending money on home to create a refuge from work. Twentieth century broadcasting was now planting commercial messages within that refuge in the sacred moments of repose. Subsequent to broadcast, home video and cable facilitated flexible work by offering entertainment on a 24 hour basis. Finally, the computer, which juxtaposes image/sound/text within a single machine, offers the user the same proto-interactive blend of entertainment and commercial messages that broadcasting pioneered. It also fulfills the earlier promise of interactive TV by allowing us to work and to shop, in all parts of the day and night. We need to theorise this movement. \n          The theory of media as work needs an institutional perspective. Therefore, I begin with Dallas Smythe's blindspot argument, which gave scholarly gravitas to the structural relationship of work and media (263-299). Horkheimer and Adorno had already noticed that capitalism was extending work into free time (137). Dallas Smythe went on to dissect the precise means by which late capitalism was extending work. Smythe restates the Marxist definition of capitalist labour as that human activity which creates exchange value. Then he considered the advertising industry, which currently approaches200 billion in the USA and realised that a great deal of exchange value has been created. The audience is one element of the labour that creates this exchange value. The appropriation of people's time creates advertising value. The time we spend listening to commercials on radio or viewing them on TV can be measured and is the unit of production for the value of advertising. \n          Our viewing time ipso facto has been changed into work time. We may not experience it subjectively as work time although pundits such as Marie Winn and Jerry Mander suggest that TV viewing contributes to the same physical stresses as actual work. Nonetheless, Smythe sees commercial broadcasting as expanding the realm of capitalism into time that was otherwise set aside for private uses. \n          Smythe's essay created a certain degree of excitement among political economists of media. Sut Jhally used Smythe to explain aspects of US broadcast history such as the innovations of William Paley in creating the CBS network (Jhally 70-9). In 1927, as Paley contemplated winning market share from his rival NBC, he realised that selling audience time was far more profitable than selling programs. Therefore, he paid affiliated stations to air his network's programs while NBC was still charging them for the privilege. It was more lucrative to Paley to turn around and sell the stations' guaranteed time to advertisers, than to collect direct payments for supplying programs. NBC switched to his business model within a year. Smythe/Jhally's model explains the superiority of Paley's model and is a historical proof of Smythe's thesis. Nonetheless, many economists and media theorists have responded with a \"so what?\" to Smythe's thesis that watching TV as work. Everyone knows that the basis of network television is the sale of \"eyeballs\" to the advertisers. \n          However, Smythe's thesis remains suggestive. Perhaps he arrived at it after working at the U.S. Federal Communications Commission from 1943 to 1948 (Smythe 2). He was part of a team that made one last futile attempt to force radio to embrace public interest programming. This effort failed because the tide of consumerism was too strong. Radio and television were the leading edge of recapturing the home for work, setting the stage for the Internet and a postmodern replication of the cottage industries of pre and proto-industrial worlds. The consequences have been immense. \n          The Depression and the crisis of over-production\n          Cultural studies recognises that social values have shifted from production to consumption (Lash and Urry). The shift has a crystallising moment in the Great Depression of 1929 through 1940. One proposal at the time was to reduce individual work hours in order to create more jobs (see Hunnicut). This proposal of \"share the work\" was not adopted. From the point of view of the producer, sharing the work would make little difference to productivity. However, from the retailer's perspective each individual worker would accumulate less money to buy products. Overall sales would stagnate or decline. Prominent American economists at the time argued that sharing the work would mean sharing the unemployment. They warned the US government this was a fundamental threat to an economy based on consumption. Only a fully employed laborer could have enough money to buy down the national inventory. In 1932, N. A. Weston told the American Economic Association that: \" ...[the labourers'] function in society as a consumer is of equal importance as the part he plays as a producer.\" (Weston 11). \n          If the defeat of the share the work movement is the negative manifestation of consumerism, then the invasion by broadcast of our leisure time is its positive materialisation. We can trace this understanding by looking at Herbert Hoover. When he was the Secretary of Commerce in 1924 he warned station executives that: \"I have never believed that it was possible to advertise through broadcasting without ruining the [radio] industry\" (Radio's Big Issue). He had not recognised that broadcast advertising would be qualitatively more powerful for the economy than print advertising. By 1929, Hoover, now President Hoover, approved an economics committee recommendation in the traumatic year of 1929 that leisure time be made \"consumable \" (Committee on Recent Economic Changes xvi). His administration supported the growth of commercial radio because broadcasting was a new efficient answer to the economists' question of how to motivate consumption. Not so coincidentally network radio became a profitable industry during the great Depression. \n          The economic power that pre-war radio hinted at flourished in the proliferation of post-war television. Advertisers switched their dollars from magazines to TV, causing the demise of such general interest magazines as Life, The Saturday Evening Postet al. Western Europe quickly followed the American broadcasting model. Great Britain was the first, allowing television to advertise the consumer revolution in 1955. Japan and many others started to permit advertising on television. \n          During the era of television, the nature of work changed from manufacturing to servicing (Preston 148-9). Two working parents also became the norm as a greater percentage of the population took salaried employment, mostly women (International Labour Office). Many of the service jobs are to monitor the new global division of labour that allows industrialised nations to consume while emerging nations produce. (Chapter seven of Preston is the most current discussion of the shift of jobs within information economies and between industrialised and emerging nations.) \n          Flexible Time/ Flexible Media\n          Film and television has responded by depicting these shifts. The Mary Tyler Moore Show debuted in September of 1970 (see http://www.transparencynow.com/mary.htm). In this show nurturing and emotional attachments were centered in the work place, not in an actual biological family. It started a trend that continues to this day. However, media representations of the changing nature of work are merely symptomatic of the relationship between media and work. Broadcast advertising has a more causal relationship. As people worked more to buy more, they found that they wanted time-saving media. It is in this time period that the Internet started (1968), that the video cassette recorder was introduced (1975) and that the cable industry grew. Each of these ultimately enhanced the flexibility of work time. \n          The VCR allowed time shifting programs. This is the media answer to the work concept of flexible time. The tired worker can now see her/his favourite TV show according to his/her own flex schedule (Wasser 2001). Cable programming, with its repeats and staggered starting times, also accommodates the new 24/7 work day. These machines, offering greater choice of programming and scheduling, are the first prototypes of interactivity. The Internet goes further in expanding flexible time by adding actual shopping to the vicarious enjoyment of consumerist products on television. The Internet user continues to perform the labour of watching advertising and, in addition, now has the opportunity to do actual work tasks at any time of the day or night. \n          The computer enters the home as an all-purpose machine. Its purchase is motivated by several simultaneous factors. The rhetoric often stresses the recreational and work aspects of the computer in the same breath (Reed 173, Friedrich 16-7). Games drove the early computer programmers to find more \"user-friendly\" interfaces in order to entice young consumers. Entertainment continues to be the main driving force behind visual and audio improvements. This has been true ever since the introduction of the Apple II, Radio Shack's TRS 80 and Atari 400 personal computers in the 1977-1978 time frame (see http://www.atari-history.com/computers/8bits/400.html). The current ubiquity of colour monitors, and the standard package of speakers with PC computers are strong indications that entertainment and leisure pursuits continue to drive the marketing of computers. However, once the computer is in place in the study or bedroom, its uses fully integrates the user with world of work in both the sense of consuming and creating value. This is a specific instance of what Philip Graham calls the analytical convergence of production, consumption and circulation in hypercapitalism. The streaming video and audio not only captures the action of the game, they lend sensual appeal to the banner advertising and the power point downloads from work. \n          In one regard, the advent of Internet advertising is a regression to the pre-broadcast era. The passive web site ad runs the same risk of being ignored as does print advertising. The measure of a successful web ad is interactivity that most often necessitates a click through on the part of the viewer. Ads often show up on separate windows that necessitate a click from the viewer if only to close down the program. In the words of Bolter and Grusin, click-through advertising is a hypermediation of television. In other words, it makes apparent the transparent relationship television forged between work and leisure. We do not sit passively through Internet advertising, we click to either eliminate them or to go on and buy the advertised products. \n          Just as broadcasting facilitated consumable leisure, new media combines consumable leisure with flexible portable work. The new media landscape has had consequences, although the price of consumable leisure took awhile to become visible. The average work week declined from 1945 to 1982. After that point in the US, it has been edging up, continuously (United States Bureau of Labor Statistics). There is some question whether the computer has improved productivity (Kim), there is little question that the computer is colonising leisure time for multi-tasking. In a population that goes online from home almost twice as much as those who go online from work, almost half use their online time for work based activities other than email. Undoubtedly, email activity would account for even more work time (Horrigan). On the other side of the blur between work and leisure, the Pew Institute estimates that fifty percent use work Internet time for personal pleasure (\"Wired Workers\"). \n           Media theory has to reengage the problem that Horkheimer/Adorno/Smythe raised. The contemporary problem of leisure is not so much the lack of leisure, but its fractured, non-contemplative, unfulfilling nature. A media critique will demonstrate the contribution of the TV and the Internet to this erosion of free time. \n          \n          References\n          \nBolter, Jay David, and Richard Grusin.

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n           One might rightly think that the first female television chief executive in Australia, Maureen Plavsic, would have some important and useful advice and words of wisdom about what being successful in business involves. Apparently, Ms Plavsic considers being 'passionate' about what you do is central to being successful in contemporary business practice (Kitney 26). At first glance, this might seem a perfectly natural contemporary way to talk. The purpose of this paper is to step back from that idea of 'passion' as a driver of contemporary practice and to consider how it became inevitable that the passionless manager or employee is a failed species. I argue that emotion, and passion, as heightened emotion, have come to play a newly understood role in our work lives. \n          There are various identifiable mechanisms, in any specific historical period, that produce ways of thinking about appropriate behaviour for groups such as managers. Foucault (\"Governmentality\") has described this specification as a form of governmentalisation of the population. They are targeted in various ways, in relation to how they should 'feel' at work (http://home.iprimus.com.au/panopticon1/). This includes through advertisements selling communication skills for managers, in training manuals, through training courses, in management books, professional journals and self-help books, and through organisational practices such as the development of 'human' resource departments. Numerous academics, including Hochschild, Mumby and Putnam, Fineman, and Tracy have also taken considerable interest in the way emotion has come to play such as important part in work-life. They, too, have contributed significantly to legitimising new ways to think about the heart and its place in business. \n          Through knowing and enacting or even resisting the broad range of discourses circulating around these ideas, individuals produce themselves 'as a work of art' (Foucault, \"On the Genealogy\"; \"Technologies\"). Indeed,Foucault insists that the production of the self should be understoodas 'a creative activity' (Foucault, \"On the Genealogy\" 351). The body is continually 'finely tuned', constructed, and reconstructed as a 'performing self' (Schilling 35) through the constitution of knowledge about what is appropriate for the managerial identity. This notion of identity, as a work of art, is used in this paper, following Hall, to suggest 'the meeting point, the point of suture,between, on the one hand, the discourses which attempt to \"interpellate\", speak to us or hail us into place as subjects of particular discourses, and on the other, the processes which produce subjectivities, which construct us as subjects which can be \"spoken\" ' (5-6). By taking this social and discursive perspective on 'passion', as heightened emotion, it is possible to understand some of the processes by which passion has come to be thought about as 'corporate capital'. \n          What are the some of the key discursive practices that achieve this identity? One interesting package that may well have produced Maureen Plavsic's response about 'being passionate' comes in the form of the idea of 'emotional capital'. The term has some resonances with other familiar descriptors, including the relationship between women and emotion. However, it directly recalls two different sets of contemporary knowledge about good managers: the idea of 'emotional intelligence' and the centrality of 'capital' in various forms of good business practice. I will briefly unpack each of these two ideas below. \n          The idea of emotional intelligence, popularised by Goleman, is 'hot', both in education and in business (http://www.mngt.ac.nz/ejrot/). Throughout the world, government reports and training programs are tapping into cognitive psychologists' discoveries that successful people and companies become so because they bring their 'heart' to work, not just their heads. The language of emotional intelligence has entered everyday language from newspaper reports to professional development journals. Self-help specialist Daniel Goleman uses the authority of the academic discipline of cognitive psychology to re-present the emotions as 'a different kind of intelligence' (36) and to signify their relationship to other forms of intelligence. He uses Gardner's 1993 book on multiple intelligences to claim that interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligence are the keys to self-knowledge and other-knowledge (Cited in Goleman, 39) and that what individuals can achieve is 'appropriate' emotion (56) if they can name and use emotion properly. Goleman provides a rationale for the changing valorisation of the emotions, giving EQ an equal significance with IQ, describing emotional intelligence as a 'master' aptitude, one that 'affects all other abilities, either facilitating or interfering with them' (80). \n          More recently, communication guru Kevin Thomson has provided carefully elaborated strategies for achieving the idealised state of Passion at Work. In this book and his companion text Emotional Capital, he argues for the role of emotional capital as central to business success. The elision of two relatively stable and legitimate discourses of the idea of 'capital' and 'emotional intelligence' is a clever rhetorical move. He links emotional capital directly to the idea of intellectual capital. Contemporary obsession with the new technologies and the developing new economy, based on service, has led to renewed interest in the storage and use of organisational knowledge as a form of intellectual capital, as Drucker rightly forecast. By drawing together the resources of this meaning for 'capital' and 'emotion', Thomson's term has considerable respectability and appeal for business. Eliding the idea of intellectual capital and intellectual property further strengthens this. This issue of ownership will be commented on in the latter part of the paper. \n          Thomson goes on to argue, in Emotional Capital, that emotional capital is the 'fuel to fire your intellectual capital' (6). This emotional capital is 'begging to be valued as brand and corporate capital' (6). Legitimising strategies such as these make the idea of emotion and the more specific instrumentalisation of passion very attractive to managers looking for success in their work. Thomson offers simple, accessible promises for success based on these ideas. In 'Six Secrets for Personal Success' he suggests, again and again, that passion is the key. The final chapter puts this idea in perspective. It is called the 'Passion Pack: The 'How to' Mobilise Hearts and Minds and Generate Buy-in to Change' (169-211). This section contains a set of 'practical tools' to 'arouse your desire' to be passionate (170). \n          A writer, like Thomson, has the capacity to be very influential. He was President of the International Association of Business Communicators (with a worldwide membership of 40 000) in 1998-1999, contributes regularly to professional journals, and works the speaking circuit. Just like Tom Peters before him, the capacity of persuasive management 'gurus' to put a spin on ideas combines with the important discursive moves made by other more powerful capacities to speak. These moves include the pronouncements of academics, including psychologists, educators, and governments, who are all looking for ways to shape up the population for own their various agendas. \n          The capacity for 'naming' emotions, such as 'being passionate', has been identified as a characteristic of training programs and therapy approaches to communication training throughout the world, by researchers such as Cameron. Naming plays a critical part in developing and promoting emotional capital. This capacity allows and encourages fine-grained work on the self. However, it also puts a new spin on the relationship between managers and their organisations. Rather than to imagine emotions in the 'private' domain, it is now much more acceptable to manage the public heart of the manager. The instrumentalisation of emotion encourages on-going fine-tuning of behaviours and feelings in oganisations. What's more, managers themselves can opt to be trained by psychologists and communication specialists in learning to name and direct or redirect their previously unmanageable and often 'unwanted' emotional lives towards more productive work, as this now contributes to the emotional capital of the organisation. \n          This emotional capital can contribute, alongside the intellectual and financial capital, to the success of the business. Maureen Plavsic's interview demonstrates that, at least at the very top of business, her intellectual/emotional property is not contested. For such a successful CEO, maybe the payoffs are good enough for her to make the creative move of reconstituting her identity in line with such demands. It remains to be seen how successful such moves will be in wooing managers further down the organisation. However, the governance of the population operates, not solely through its repressive capacities, but also through the seduction that images like 'emotional capital' conjure up for managers. If they enrol for communication training programs, they are offered not only the capacity to master the 'master aptitude', but also they are told from many different discursive terrains that they will achieve guaranteed access to business success. Becoming corporate capital is increasingly hard to resist in the new work order. \n          \n          References\n          \nCameron, Deborah.Good to Talk?: Living and Working in a Communication Culture.

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n       \n           \n          In \"On Being Ill\" Virginia Woolf asks why novelists have routinely preferred certain emotions over illness for driving plot. They have canonized passions as much as plotlines: love motivates protagonists; jealousy sustains entire trilogies; loneliness wins our sympathy, but illness almost never drives an epic. Illness does, in fact, have thematic potential: the ill could be catalysts for climax because they are direct. \"A childish outspokenness [exists] in illness; things are said, truths blurted out\" (13). Because the sick already foresee their deaths, they invest less in the future but want more from the moment. They would find strong antagonists in their already-canonical opposites, the Vigorous. Why couldn't \"The Good and the Bad\" give way to \"The Healthy and the Diseased\"? Woolf wants to direct our attention, at least, to this possibility. \n          She does also admit to the impracticality of reinventing our methods of interpretation. We inhabit ideologies, as Slavoj Zizek later tells us in different words. Woolf herself avoids the technical, impersonal term \"ideology\" but, I will argue, she develops a model of the rules that circumscribe her culture. She argues that interpretive strategies for literary and daily events motivate each other: we have come to expect a rise and fall, a tragedy and dénouement, in our lives and our books. I suggest not only that she describes ideology but that she also prefigures what could be called a modern strategy of escape: she suggests we can only figure the boundaries of ideology by performing our victimization to them. \n          Woolf begins by offering exaggerated versions of the existing categories of the \"healthy\" and \"sick.\" She positions herself - as an author of a sane, or comprehensible, text - on the side of the healthy. She finally performs a seemingly self-conscious failure by slipping onto the side of the diseased. Here she enacts the martyrdom that Slavoj Zizek has elsewhere argued is the sole way to gesture outside of symbolic systems we inhabit. \n          Woolf and Zizek's models diverge in argumentative style but converge in an emphasis on the sick. Both suggest the sick have sole, limited access to pre-symbolic instincts, if not to pre-symbolic thinking. Both suggest communities sustain ideology through a refusal to incorporate moments of disjunction or trauma into the public stories they create. Healthy subjects refuse the destruction of extreme surprise; only the sick lack the energy necessary for the same sustained self-preservation. \n          Woolf especially credits biology for the difference. The ill have unique access to unconventional ideas not because of intelligence or a passionate decision, but because they lack the physical resources for sustaining a public story. Of course this biological binary also partially restricts Woolf to one side of the divide: as long as she sustains a literary dialogue, she contributes to the very literary conventions that model public myth. All acts of communication (literary and other) help sustain ideology, which is simply the story that can elicit understanding between healthy members of a community. \"The army of the upright marches to battle,\" Woolf writes (16): bakers, shoemakers, politicians, and even allegedly racial philosophers play the roles needed to allow a joint drama to run fluidly. \"In health [a constant] pretence [is] kept up\" (14); ultimately only when we radically, biologically change - when \"the bed is called for [and we] cease to be soldiers in the army of the upright [- can] we become deserters\" (14), which is also precisely why Woolf's \"we\" here is performative. She voices transgression while surrendering her claims to it. With \"we\" she recovers pre-symbolic instinct: \"…still we must wriggle. We can not stiffen peaceably into glassy mounds\" (17). She sometimes suggests ideology is less universal than contingently psychological: We simply want our life stories, like some long book we have started to read, to keep making the sense we have invested in. \n          Zizek in turn consistently insists on an impermeable division between ideology and what lies beyond it. He would agree with Woolf that by merely partaking in language games, we confirm and sustain a dominant symbolic order. But Zizek harbors less hope for \"escape.\" He argues that linguistic systems necessarily commit their inhabitants to boundaries. Language is the structure of ideology, which always successfully hides its secret, Lacan's objet petit a, within it. Symbolic systems, and the political systems that use them to instate their control, avoid the central lack, even though efforts at \"avoidance\" are actually unnecessary. The objet petit a is defined precisely as that surplus that escapes signification. To mention the unmentionable is already impossible. \n          Zizek's subjects sustain public myth merely by acting sane: \"Our belief is already materialized in the external ritual; in other words, we already believe unconsciously\" (Object 43). Even political revolutionaries who attempt resistance contribute to a public story by weighing in on one side of an existing dichotomy. Zizek explains that the Jacobites failed because they failed to rethink the system they inhabited. They severed the head of a King instead of convincing themselves that the king was a mere human being. Admitting to the terms of monarchy meant preserving the system; and ultimately, whoever fights or argues within a system preserves some of its foundations. Zizek's model does echo Woolf's when he states that only the sick escape the cycle of perpetuity: \"The subject who thinks he can avoid this paradox and really have a free choice is a psychotic subject….who is not really caught up in the signifying network\" (Object 166). Those who can 'think new' are those who misread language altogether. \n          Having established the division common to both theorists, Woolf finds herself in an impasse. She leaves herself no room for intellectual reinvention. In the end of her essay, she drops her own voice to point to someone else's work. She offers us Augustus Hare and titles him a second life-model alongside the Sick, as the Untalented. The untalented and sick relate because both fail through biological limitation; both escape genre by a natural inability to produce it. So Woolf makes a strange rhetorical move, devoting an unbalanced last fourth of her essay to summarizing Hare's bad novel, The Story of Two Noble Lives. She ends her own work with a book she says \"flounders\" (20); Hare's story is sick in temper, or poorly edited; he describes insignificancies when he needs clarity. She finishes on her own descriptive word, \"agony,\" describing Hare's own suffering heroine. \n          This final imbalance marks Woolf's refusal to finish, and it finds an important companion strategy in her choice of words. Woolf's rhetorical move here recurs often in her speeches, which benefit from the verbal play. She picks a central term that falls short of its alleged duty (here, \"Illness\"; in \"Craftsmanship,\" it was \"words\"). She positions the refrain as if it fully encompassed the central subject of her work and positions herself as the narrator who wants to speak merely about \"illness.\" Of course, as said, Woolf is actually talking about more than the status of the sick in literature in \"On Being Ill.\" She is trying to suggest several possible avenues to the unexpected. She nonetheless launches the essay pretending to be talking about the ill, and throughout continues to enact her own satisfaction with the subject. Zizek clarifies again: Woolf shows some complicity in ideology by performing a game she knows to be flawed but \"proceeds as if [she] did not know\" (For 53). Zizek characterizes the members of any ideology by that schizophrenia: subjects know that prevailing assumptions are flawed but proceed as if they did not know. A subject would never be able to claim that 'the objet petit a lies here' or that, 'the emperor is wearing no clothes,' because the nudity or lack at the center of a symbolic system is actually defined by its inaccessibility. Efforts to name the objet petit a might, at best, shift its location. \n          This division inherent to ideology - between knowledge and the inability to change - is also our only potential insight into its failures. We cannot unravel a story while we partake in it; we can only reinvest in its existing terms. But Zizek suggests we might be able to signify a flaw by becoming martyrs to the system we inhabit. A martyr like Socrates performs his complicity within a system but then falls victim to it, silently revealing the flaw at the center of the system that condemns him. Both Zizek and Henry Sussman mention Socrates as a subject who performs an ironic martyrdom: He refuses to fight or take sides in Athenian law but allows the performance of his failure to explain what he can not fully say, himself. Woolf becomes a similar sort of martyr when she silently surrenders to the failure of her central term. She sets the scene for her own failure, which Zizek calls the \"'dramatization' [which] gives the lie to the theoretical position by bringing out its implicit presuppositions\" (For 42). \n          Woolf's refusal to note the limitations of her central term also strengthens the effect of her failure by allowing the reader to work for her own discoveries. The reader feels more allegiance to what she uncovers herself than to the issues Woolf directly develops (like the status of the sick in the canon; our forced sympathies, etc..). The reader who privately interprets also encounters a certain subtlety in the text that strengthens her relationship to her discoveries. Woolf's central term, \"illness,\" is - however incomplete - actually not so distant from the central idea of the essay. Woolf does not use the term overtly ironically or even as a metaphor to speak of a distinct second topic. \"Illness\" is in fact almost sufficient for Woolf's central idea. And even though we are left to note the gap between that term in the title and the developing ideas, Woolf's emphatic embrace of the word does not entail overt acting on her part. She performs and does not perform. She, even more importantly, refuses to acknowledge her performance, leaving us to trust our own instincts in a new interpretation. The decision to trust our own interpretation is hard: with even a slight shift in our ideas about the history of reading (imagining Woolf's Victorian residue, her faith in the very language she struggles to rework), her intent looms impossibly distant. We might imagine Woolf's own complicity with her central term. Like this, she becomes Zizek's \"master,\" a self-satisfied leader who looks away from us. We are attracted by her distraction but are suspended in our desire to know what she keeps from us. On the one hand we can guess that Woolf is satisfied with her terms. On the other hand, we note her failure and are excited by a search for her unspoken frustration. \n          Woolf's final silence excites us to independent imagination (why doesn't she criticize her terms?). We experience a free-falling freedom that would not have come through a direct explanation of language. Woolf can find no perfect central term; she motions towards the flaws in all central terms, and somehow comments on the impossibility of health. \n          \n          References\n          \nWoolf, Virginia.

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n          The keyword for this issue, \"Sick,\" has produced a broad range of critical conceptualisations. The articles that appear in this Sick issue present a variety of different interpretations of sickness and the sick, and address a number of different \"sick\" elements of both past and contemporary society, of social issues in the United States, in Australia and in England, or those that cross cultural and geographical boundaries. \n          Everyone gets sick, but for our purposes the universality of the term is less interesting than its specific expressions; the way it attaches itself to certain contexts, certain bodies, certain modes and effects of discourse. If and when we get sick (sick in body, sick in mind, sick in behaviour or speech) our own and others reaction to this is governed by powerful representations and ideas that abound in culture. To some, this is a banal point, but the idea of sickness has a particular condition of privilege in culture. What is actually constituted by the term \"sick\" is subject to tremendous change historically and socially, but this slippery signifier is stable in its effectivity. \n          In this issue, we present articles that engage with and critique \"sick\" as it erupts into numerous biological, social, and historical discourses. The interventions range from pop culture, to medical science, to the intensely personal. \n          Our feature article, Tara Brabazon's \"Welcome to the Robbiedome,\" begins this intervention into a discussion of sickness by addressing the application of the term \"sick\", with its simultaneously positive and negative connotations, to Robbie Williams and gender performativity. Beginning with the horrified reactions of talk-show hosts to the inherent \"sickness\" of Williams' \"Rock DJ\" film-clip, Brabazon follows the singer's example, stripping back the layers of performance threading through film-clips, interviews and recorded statements in an exploration of what is meant when the term \"sick\" is applied in this case, and what this appellation means to both performer and viewer. \n          In \"Sick Puppies and Other Unbecoming Things,\" Laurie Johnson considers the complex effects generated by John Carpenter's breathtakingly gruesome remake of The Thing. Johnson traces some of the critical responses to the film, that connect its representations of bodily contagion to the then-new terror of the AIDS virus. He then develops a reading of the film as depiction of Deleuze and Guattari's notion of becoming. \n          Several articles in this issue indicate that a literary and critical focus on sickness is not an exclusively modern interest. Ilana Simons', for example, traces Virginia Woolf's commentary on the absence of illness as a literary device in the article \"The Sick and the Unexpected.\" Through an analysis of Woolf's essay \"On Being Ill,\" Simons emphasises the thematic potential for illness, with its \"childish outspokenness\" and obsession with the immediate moment. This article not only focuses on a critical study of a text explicitly concerned with physiological illness, but also engages in a debate between physical, literary and critical manifestations of sickness. \n          Sickness as a focus for critical thought creates a rich and often radical mix of theoretical approaches. Heath Diehl's article, \"Performing (In) The Grave: Schizophrenic Subjectivities and the NAMES Project AIDS Quilt,\" perhaps belongs to the more creatively radical end of the spectrum. Diehl's analysis of the means by which the quilt, as a physical and cultural object, constructs those people who view it as fractured subjects, is an intriguing and original intervention into one of the more elaborate records of human illness and frailty produced in the United States. \n          Sickness as an idea is not one that is culturally or temporally stable. Susan Mckay in \"Beyond Biomedicine: Renegotiating the Sick Role for Postmodern Conditions\" describes and discusses transformations in relationships between culture, individuals, and the discourses that construct and mediate their experiences of illness and sickness. She shows how the ascendancy of scientific discourses about illness has pacified the suffers of sickness, subordinating their experiences to that of the scientific, knowing physician. But this relationship is changing. New avenues of expression are opening up, allowing patients to explore their own agency. McKay sees this as a postmodernist reaction to the modernist gaze of biomedical discourse. \n          \"'There's Not Much Thrill About a Physiological Sin': Neurasthenia in Willa Cather's 'The Professor's House,'\" continues the questioning of the role and presentation of sickness in literary texts which began with Ilana Simons's article. Todd Robinson assesses Cather's attempt to engage with and critique the nervous disorder neurasthenia. This paper not only concentrates on the discussion of this \"lack of nerve force\" in Cather's protagonist, Godfrey St Peter, but simultaneously highlights a dialogue between the presentation of illness within the text, and the language of the contemporary medical discourse. \n          The mobile phone is one of the most contentious cultural artefacts of our times. Its capacity to cause sickness, whether physical or social, is thoroughly embedded in the cultural narratives that surround it. Judith Nicholson, in \"Sick Cell: Representations of Cellular Telephone Use in North America,\" considers these narratives to be examples of what Haraway terms \"boundary breakdowns,\" disruptions in the culturally-negotiated barriers between human and machine, nature and artifice. \n          Adam Dodd, in \"Paranoid Visions\": Germ Theory, Ernst Haeckel, and the Biopolitics of Warfare, reveals a fascinating moment in the history of biological science, in his description of the peculiar ideas that abounded following the widespread adoption of microscopic imaging devices in the nineteenth century. In particular, he focuses on the hybridised scientific mysticism of Ernst Haeckel, whose pseudo-Darwinian claims about the status of the microbiological was one of the many threads that contributed to national socialism. \n          The focus of Leila Green's article, \"Is it sick to want to live to 100? The popular culture of health and longevity,\" is one of the most popular of popular obsessions, alternative health practices. Taking as her target group the now-aging baby boomers, Green considers the ways in which movements epitomised by texts such as the aptly named RealAge: Are You as Young as You Can Be? encourage a \"sick\" obsession with healthy, vibrant, chronologically defiant old age. \n          Sickness is a state explicitly connected with the body of the suffering individual, with issues of invasion and intrusion, loss of privacy and loss of dignity. Janna Nadler discusses these issues in her article \"Two Voices are Stronger Than One? Reconfiguring Breast Cancer Narratives as Collaborative and Communal in Sandra Butler &amp; Barbara Rosenblum's Cancer in Two Voices.\" This article takes as its focus a text written by a breast cancer sufferer and her partner. From this perspective, Nadler opens up the traditionally incommunicable experience of personal illness to critical scrutiny, addressing matters from the subjective and objective status of the sick body to the broader societal reverberations caused by personal illness. \n          The relationships between worker, business, and the state have undergone massive change throughout the last century. In \"Who owns your sickness in the new corporate wellness\" notions of workers' health and the structures created to maintain and contain it are interrogated by David Leith. Leith shows how transformations in public policy and workplace practice are leading to a confusion as to who exactly is responsible for personal health. \n          Finally, the discussions of agency, of the importance of the individual voices of patients and sufferers, culminates in the poetry of Ric Masten, and its revelation of his own experience of sickness. Masten's work blends personal, chatty journal-style entries with poetic passages to create a year-long account of a struggle with prostate cancer.

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n       \n                     In January of 1908 H. Addington Bruce, a writer for the North American Review, observed that \"On every street, at every corner, we meet the neurasthenics\" (qtd. in Lears, 50). \"Discovered\" by the neurologist George M. Beard in 1880, neurasthenia was a nervous disorder characterized by a \"lack of nerve force\" and comprised of a host of neuroses clustered around an overall paralysis of the will. Historian Barbara Will notes that there were \"thousands of men and women at the turn of the century who claimed to be ‘neurasthenics,’\" among them Theodore Roosevelt, Edith Wharton, William and Henry James, and Beard himself. These neurasthenics had free roam over the American psychiatric landscape from the date of Beard’s diagnosis until the 1920s, when more accurate diagnostic tools began to subdivide the nearly uninterpretably wide variety of symptoms falling under the rubric of \"neurasthenic.\" By then, however, nearly every educated American had suffered from (or known someone who had) the debilitating \"disease\"--including Willa Cather, who in The Professor’s House would challenge her readers to acknowledge and engage with the cultural phenomenon of neurasthenia. \n          Cultural historian T.J. Jackson Lears, long a student of neurasthenia, defines it as an \"immobilizing, self-punishing depression\" stemming from \"endless self-analysis\" and \"morbid introspection\" (47, 49). What is especially interesting about the disease, for Lears and other scholars, is that it is a culture-bound syndrome, predicated not upon individual experience, but upon the cultural and economic forces at play during the late nineteenth century. Barbara Will writes that neurasthenia was \"double-edged\": \"a debilitating disease and [...] the very condition of the modern American subject\" (88). Interestingly, George Beard attributed neurasthenia to the changes wracking his culture:\n          \n            Neurasthenia is the direct result of the five great changes of modernity: steam power, the periodical press, the telegraph, the sciences, and the mental activity of women. (qtd. in Will, 94)\n          \n          For Beard, neurasthenia was a peculiarly modern disease, the result of industrialization and of the ever-quickening pace of commercial and intellectual life. Jackson Lears takes Beard’s attribution a step further, explaining that \"as larger frameworks of meaning weakened, introspection focused on the self alone and became ‘morbid’\" (49). These frameworks of meaning--religious, political, psychosexual--were under steady assault in Beard’s time from commodifying and secularizing movements in America. Self-scrutiny, formerly yoked to Protestant salvation (and guilt), became more insular and isolating, resulting in the ultimate modern malady, neurasthenia. \n          While Willa Cather may have inherited Beard’s and her culture’s assumptions of illness, it ultimately appears that Cather’s depiction of neurasthenia is a highly vexed one, both sympathetic and troubled, reflecting a deep knowledge of the condition and an ongoing struggle with the rationalization of scientific psychology. As an intellectual, she was uniquely positioned to both suffer from the forces shaping the new disease and to study them with a critical eye. Godfrey St. Peter, the anxious protagonist of The Professor’s House, becomes then a character that readers of Cather’s day would recognize as a neurasthenic: a \"brain-worker,\" hard-charging and introspective, and lacking in what Beard would call \"nerve force,\" the psychological stoutness needed to withstand modernity’s assault on the self. Moreover, St. Peter is not a lone sufferer, but is instead emblematic of a culture-wide affliction--part of a larger polity constantly driven to newer heights of production, consumption, and subsequent affliction. Jackson Lears theorizes that \"neurasthenia was a product of overcivilization\" (51), of consumer culture and endemic commodification. Beard himself characterized neurasthenia as an \"American disease,\" a malady integral to the rationalizing, industrializing American economy (31). \n          Cather reinforces the neurasthenic’s exhaustion and inadequacy as St. Peter comes across his wife flirting with Louis Marsellus, prompting the professor to wonder, \"Beaux-fils, apparently, were meant by Providence to take the husband’s place when husbands had ceased to be lovers\" (160). Not only does this point to the sexual inadequacy and listlessness characteristic of neurasthenia, but the diction here reinforces the modus operandi of the commodity culture--when an old model is used up, it is simply replaced by a newer, better model. \n          Interestingly, Cather’s language itself often mirrors Beard’s. St. Peter at one point exclaims to Lillian, in a beatific reverie:\n          \n            \"I was thinking [...] about Euripides; how, when he was an old man, he went and lived in a cave by the sea, and it was thought queer, at the time. It seems that houses had become insupportable to him\" (156).\n          \n            The Professor’s \"symptom of hopelessness,\" Beard might explain, \"appears to be similar to that of morbid fear--an instinctive consciousness of inadequacy for the task before us. We are hopeless because our nerve force is so reduced that the mere holding on to life seems to be a burden too heavy for us\" (49). Both Beard and Cather, then, zero in on the crushing weight of modern life for the neurasthenic. The Professor here aches for rest and isolation--he, in Beard’s language, \"fears society,\" prompting Lillian to fear that he is \"’becoming lonely and inhuman’\" (162). \n          This neurasthenic craving for isolation becomes much more profound in Book III of the novel, when St. Peter is almost completely estranged from his family. Although he feels he loves them, he \"could not live with his family again\" upon their return from Europe (274). \"Falling out, for him, seemed to mean falling out of all domestic and social relations, out of his place in the human family, indeed\" (275). St. Peter’s estrangement is not only with his family (an estrangement perhaps rationalized by the grasping or otherwise distasteful St. Peter clan), but with the human family. It is a solipsistic retreat from contact and effort, the neurasthenic’s revulsion for work of any kind. \n          Neurasthenia, if left untreated, can become deadly. Beard explains: \"A certain amount of nerve strength is necessary to supply the courage requisite for simple existence. Abstaining from dying demands a degree of force\" (49). Compare this to the scene near the end of the narrative in which St. Peter, sleeping on the couch, nearly dies:\n          \n            When St. Peter at last awoke, the room was pitch-black and full of gas. He was cold and numb, felt sick and rather dazed. The long-anticipated coincidence had happened, he realized. The storm had blown the stove out and the window shut. The thing to do was to get up and open the window. But suppose he did not get up--? How far was a man required to exert himself against accident? [...] He hadn’t lifted his hand against himself--was he required to lift it for himself? (276)\n          \n          This classic scene, variously read as a suicide attempt or as an accident, can be understood as the neurasthenic’s complete collapse. The Professor’s decision is made solely in terms of effort; this is not a moral or philosophical decision, but one of physiological capacity. He is unwilling to \"exert\" the energy necessary to save himself, unwilling to \"lift his hand\" either for or against himself. Here is the prototypical neurasthenic fatigue--almost suicidal, but ultimately too passive and weak to even take that course of action. Accidental gassing is a supremely logical death for the neurasthenic. This appropriateness is reinforced by the Professor at the end of the narrative, when he remembers his near death:\n          \n            Yet when he was confronted by accidental extinction, he had felt no will to resist, but had let chance take its way, as it had done with him so often. He did not remember springing up from the couch, though he did remember a crisis, a moment of acute, agonized strangulation. (282)\n          \n          Again, the Professor is a passive figure, couch-ridden, subject to the whims of chance and his own lack of nerve. He is saved by Augusta, though, and does somehow manage to carry on with his life, if in a diminished way. We cannot accredit his survival to clinical treatment of neurasthenia, but perhaps his vicarious experience on the mesa with Tom Outland can account for his fortitude. \n          Treatment of neurasthenia, according to Tom Lutz, \"aimed at a reconstitution of the subject in terms of gender roles\" (32). S. Weir Mitchell, a leading psychiatrist of the day, treated many notable neurasthenics. Female patients, in line with turn-of-the-century models of female decorum, were prescribed bed rest for up to several months, and were prohibited from all activity and visitors. (Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" has long been considered a critique of Mitchell’s \"rest cure\" for women. Interestingly, St. Peter’s old study has yellow wall paper.) Treatments for men, again consistent with contemporary gender roles, emphasized vigorous exercise, often in natural settings: \n          \n            Theodore Roosevelt, Thomas Eakins, Frederic Remington, and Owen Wister were all sent to the Dakotas for rough-riding exercise cures [...] Henry James was sent to hike in the Alps, and William James continued to prescribe vigorous mountain hikes for himself[.] (32)\n          \nDepleted of \"nerve force,\" male neurasthenics were admonished to replenish their reserves in rugged, survivalist outdoor settings. Beard documents the treatment of one \"Mr. O,\" whom, worn out by \"labor necessitated by scholarly pursuits,\" is afflicted by\n          \n            a settled melancholia, associated with a morbid and utterly baseless fear of financial ruin...he was as easily exhausted physically as mentally. He possessed no reserve force, and gave out utterly whenever he attempted to overstep the bounds of the most ordinary effort. [As part of his treatment] He journeyed to the West, visited the Yellowstone region, and at San Francisco took steamer for China [...] and returned a well man, nor has he since relapsed into his former condition. (139-41) \n          \nBeard’s characterization of \"Mr. O\" is fascinating in several ways. First, he is the prototypical neurasthenic--worn out, depressed, full of \"baseless\" fears. More interestingly, for the purposes of this study, part of the patient’s cure is effected in the \"Yellowstone region,\" which would ultimately be made a national park by neurasthenic outdoors man Theodore Roosevelt. This natural space, hewn from the wilds of the American frontier, is a prototypical refuge for nervous \"brain-workers\" in need of rejuvenation. \n          This approach to treatment is especially intriguing given the setting of Book II of The Professor's House: an isolated Mesa in the Southwest. While St. Peter himself doesn’t undertake an exercise cure, \"Tom Outland’s Story\" does mimic the form and rhetoric of treatment for male neurasthenics, possibly accounting for the odd narrative structure of the novel. Cather, then, not only acknowledges the cultural phenomenon of neurasthenia, but incorporates it in the structure of the text. \n          Outland’s experience on the mesa (mediated, we must remember, by the neurasthenic St. Peter, who relates the tale) is consistent with what Jackson Lears has termed the \"cult of strenuousity\" prevalent in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. According to Lears neurasthenics often sought refuge in \"a vitalistic cult of energy and process; and a parallel recovery of the primal, irrational sources in the human psyche, forces which had been obscured by the evasive banality of modern culture\" (57). Outland, discovering the mesa valley for the first time, explains that the air there \"made my mouth and nostrils smart like charged water, seemed to go to my head a little and produce a kind of exaltation\" (200). Like Roosevelt and other devotees of the exercise cure, Outland (and St. Peter, via the mediation) is re-\"charged\" by the primal essence of the mesa. The Professor later laments, \"his great drawback was [...] the fact that he had not spent his youth in the great dazzling South-west country which was the scene of his explorers’ adventures\" (258). \n          Interestingly, Outland’s rejuvenation on the mesa is cast by Cather in hyperbolically masculine terms. The notoriously phallic central tower of the cliff city, for instance, may serve as a metaphor for recovered sexual potency:\n          \n            It was beautifully proportioned, that tower, swelling out to a larger girth a little above the base, then growing slender again. There was something symmetrical and powerful about the swell of the masonry. The tower was the fine thing that held all the jumble of houses together and made them mean something. It was red in color, even on that grey day. (201) \n          \nNeurasthenics embraced \"premodern symbols as alternatives to the vagueness of liberal Protestantism or the sterility of nineteenth-century positivism\" (Lears xiii). The tower stands in striking contrast to St. Peter’s sexless marriage with Lillian, potentially reviving the Professor’s sagging neurasthenic libido. \n          The tower also serves, in Outland’s mind, to forge meaning out of the seemingly random cluster of houses: \"The notion struck me like a rifle ball that this mesa had once been like a bee-hive; it was full of little cluff-hung villages, it had been the home of a powerful tribe\" (202). Outland’s discovery, cast in martial terms (\"rifle ball\"), reinscribes the imperialistic tendencies of the exercise cure and of Tom’s archeological endeavor itself. \n          Tom Lutz notes that the exercise cure, steeped in Rooseveltian rhetoric, exemplified \"a polemic for cultural change, a retraining, presented as a ‘return’ to heroic, natural, and manly values...The paternalism of Roosevelt’s appeal made sense against the same understanding of role which informed the cures for neurasthenia\" (36). Outland seems to unconsciously concur, reflecting that \"Wherever humanity has made that hardest of all starts and lifted itself out of mere brutality, is a sacred spot\" (220-1). While Outland does have genuine admiration for the tribe, his language is almost always couched in terms of martial struggle, of striving against implacable odds. \n          On a related note, George Kennan, writing in a 1908 McClure’s Magazine edited by Cather, proposed that rising suicide rates among the educated by cured by a \"cultivation of what may be called the heroic spirit\" (228). Cather was surely aware of this masculinizing, imperializing response to neurasthenic ennui--her poem, \"Prairie Dawn,\" appears at the end of Kennan’s article! Outland’s excavation of Cliff City and its remains subsequently becomes an imperializing gesture, in spite of his respect for the culture. \n          What does this mean, though, for a neurasthenic reading of The Professor’s House? In part, it acknowledges Cather’s response to and incorporation of a cultural phenomenon into the text in question. Additionally, it serves to clarify Cather’s critique of masculinist American culture and of the gendered treatment of neurasthenia. This critique is exemplified by Cather’s depiction of \"Mother Eve\": \"Her mouth was open as if she were screaming, and her face, through all those years, had kept a look of terrible agony\" (214-15). Not only does this harrowing image undermine Outland’s romantic depiction of the tribe, but it points to the moral bankruptcy of the cult of strenuousity. It is easy, Cather seems to argue, for Roosevelt and his ilk to \"rough it\" in the wilderness to regain their vigor, but the \"real-life\" wilderness experience is a far harsher and more dangerous prospect. Cather ultimately does not romanticize the mesa--she problematizes it as a site for neurasthenic recovery. More importantly, this vexed reading of the treatment suggests a vexed reading of neurasthenia and of \"American Nervousness\" itself. \n          Ultimately, in spite of his best efforts to recover the intense experience of his past and of Tom Outland’s, St. Peter fails. As Mathias Schubnell explains, Cather’s \"central character is trapped between a modern urban civilization to which he belongs against his will, and a pastoral, earth-bound world he yearns for but cannot regain\" (97). This paradox is exemplified by the Professor’s early lament to Lillian, \"’it’s been a mistake, our having a family and writing histories and getting middle-aged. We should have been picturesquely shipwrecked together when we were young’\" (94). The reader, of course, recognizes the absurdity of this image--an absurdity strongly reinforced by the image of the deceased \"Mother Eve\" figure. These overcivilized men, Cather suggests, have no conception of what intense experience might be. \n          That experience has been replaced, the Professor explains, by rationalizing, industrializing forces in American culture:\n          \n            Science hasn’t given us any new amazements, except of the superficial kind we get from witnessing dexterity and sleight-of-hand. It hasn’t given us any richer pleasures...nor any new sins--not one! Indeed, it has taken our old ones away. It’s the laboratory, not the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sins of the world. You’ll agree there is not much thrill about a physiological sin...I don’t think you help people by making their conduct of no importance--you impoverish them. (68)\n          \nSt. Peter, the neurasthenic humanist, gets here at the heart of his (and America’s) sickness--it has replaced the numinous and the sacred with the banal and the profane. The disorder he suffers from, once termed a sin, has become \"physiological,\" as has his soul. It is worthwhile to contrast the Professor’s lament with Beard’s supremely rational boast: \"It would seem, indeed, that diseases which are here described represent a certain amount of force in the body which, if our knowledge of physiological chemistry were more precise, might be measured in units\" (115). The banal, utterly practical measuring of depression, of melancholia, of humanity’s every whim and caprice, Cather suggests, has dulled the luster of human existence. The Professor’s tub, then, becomes an emblem of the relentless stripping away of all that is meaningful and real in Cather’s culture: \"Many a night, after blowing out his study lamp, he had leaped into that tub, clad in his pyjamas, to give it another coat of some one of the many paints that were advertised to behave like porcelain, but didn’t\" (12). Porcelain here becomes the religion or art which once sustained the race, replaced by the false claims of science. The Professor, though, seems too world-weary, too embittered to actually turn to religious faith. Perhaps God is dead in his world, eliminated by the Faustian quest for scientific knowledge. \"His career, his wife, his family, were not his life at all, but a chain of events which had happened to him\" (264). Godfrey St. Peter, like the rest of the neurasthenics, is doomed to an incurable sickness, victim of a spiritual epidemic which, Cather suggests, will not soon run its course. \n          \n          References\n          \nBeard, George M.

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n          One of the greatest joys in watching Foxtel is to see all the crazy people who run talk shows. Judgement, ridicule and generalisations slip from their tongues like overcooked lamb off a bone. From Oprah to Rikki, from Jerry to Mother Love, the posterior of pop culture claims a world-wide audience. Recently, a new talk diva was added to the pay television stable. Dr Laura Schlessinger, the Mother of Morals, prowls the soundstage. attacking 'selfish acts' such as divorce, de facto relationships and voting Democrat. On April 11, 2001, a show aired in Australia that added a new demon to the decadence of the age. Dr Laura had been told that a disgusting video clip, called 'Rock DJ', had been televised at 2:30pm on MTV. Children could have been watching. The footage that so troubled our doyenne of daytime featured the British performer Robbie Williams not only stripping in front of disinterested women, but then removing skin, muscle and tissue in a desperate attempt to claim their gaze. This was too much for Dr Laura. She was horrified: her strident tone became piercing. She screeched, \"this is si-ee-ck.\" . My paper is drawn to this sick masculinity, not to judge - but to laugh and theorise. Robbie Williams, the deity of levity, holds a pivotal role in theorising the contemporary 'crisis' of manhood. \n          To paraphrase Austin Powers, Williams returned the ger to singer. But Williams also triumphed in a captivatingly original way. He is one of the few members of a boy band who created a successful solo career without regurgitating the middle of the road mantras of boys, girls, love, loss and whining about it. Williams' journey through post-war popular music, encompassing influences from both Sinatra and Sonique, forms a functional collage, rather than patchwork, of masculinity. He has been prepared to not only age in public, but to discuss the crevices and cracks in the facade. He strips, smokes, plays football, wears interesting underwear and drinks too much. My short paper trails behind this combustible masculinity, focussing on his sorties with both masculine modalities and the rock discourse. My words attack the gap between text and readership, beat and ear, music and men. The aim is to reveal how this 'sick masculinity' problematises the conservative rendering of men's crisis. \n          \n            Come follow me\n              I'm an honorary Sean Connery, born '74 \n  There's only one of me … \n            Press be asking do I care for sodomy \n            I don't know, yeah, probably \n            I've been looking for serial monogamy \n            Not some bird that looks like Billy Connolly \n            But for now I'm down for ornithology \n            Grab your binoculars, come follow me.\n            'Kids,' Robbie Williams\n          \n          \n          Robbie Williams is a man for our age. Between dating supermodels and Geri 'Lost Spice' Halliwell [1], he has time to \"love … his mum and a pint,\" (Ansen 85) but also subvert the Oasis cock(rock)tail by frocking up for a television appearance. Williams is important to theories of masculine representation. As a masculinity to think with, he creates popular culture with a history. In an era where Madonna practices yoga and wears cowboy boots, it is no surprise that by June 2000, Robbie Williams was voted the world's sexist man [2]. A few months later, in the October edition of Vogue, he posed in a British flag bikini. It is reassuring in an era where a 12 year old boy states that \"You aren't a man until you shoot at something,\" (Issac in Mendel 19) that positive male role models exist who are prepared to both wear a frock and strip on national television. \n          Reading Robbie Williams is like dipping into the most convincing but draining of intellectual texts. He is masculinity in motion, conveying foreignness, transgression and corruption, bartering in the polymorphous economies of sex, colonialism, race, gender and nation. His career has spanned the boy bands, try-hard rock, video star and hybrid pop performer. There are obvious resonances between the changes to Williams and alterations in masculinity. In 1988, Suzanne Moore described (the artist still known as) Prince as \"the pimp of postmodernism.\" (165-166) Over a decade later, the simulacra has a new tour guide. Williams revels in the potency of representation. He rarely sings about love or romance, as was his sonic fodder in Take That. Instead, his performance is fixated on becoming a better man, glancing an analytical eye over other modes of masculinity. \n          Notions of masculine crisis and sickness have punctuated this era. Men's studies is a boom area of cultural studies, dislodging the assumed structures of popular culture [3]. William Pollack's Real Boys has created a culture of changing expectations for men. The greater question arising from his concerns is why these problems, traumas and difficulties are emerging in our present. Pollack's argument is that boys and young men invest energy and time \"disguising their deepest and most vulnerable feelings.\" (15) This masking is difficult to discern within dance and popular music. Through lyrics and dancing, videos and choreography, masculinity is revealed as convoluted, complex and fragmented. While rock music is legitimised by dominant ideologies, marginalised groups frequently use disempowered genres - like country, dance and rap genres - to present oppositional messages. These competing representations expose seamless interpretations of competent masculinity. \n          Particular skills are necessary to rip the metaphoric pacifier out of the masculine mouth of popular culture. Patriarchal pop revels in the paradoxes of everyday life. Frequently these are nostalgic visions, which Kimmel described as a \"retreat to a bygone era.\" (87) It is the recognition of a shared, simpler past that provides reinforcement to heteronormativity. Williams, as a gaffer tape masculinity, pulls apart the gaps and crevices in representation. Theorists must open the interpretative space encircling popular culture, disrupting normalising criteria. \n          Multiple nodes of assessment allow a ranking of competent masculinity. From sport to business, drinking to sex, masculinity is transformed into a wired site of ranking, judgement and determination. Popular music swims in the spectacle of maleness. From David Lee Roth's skied splits to Eminem's beanie, young men are interpellated as subjects in patriarchy. Robbie Williams is a history lesson in post war masculinity. This nostalgia is conservative in nature. The ironic pastiche within his music videos features motor racing, heavy metal and Bond films. \n          'Rock DJ', the 'sick text' that vexed Doctor Laura, is Williams' most elaborate video. Set in a rollerdrome with female skaters encircling a central podium, the object of fascination and fetish is a male stripper. This strip is different though, as it disrupts the power held by men in phallocentralism. After being confronted by Williams' naked body, the observing women are both bored and disappointed at the lack-lustre deployment of masculine genitalia. After this display, Williams appears embarrassed, confused and humiliated. As Buchbinder realised, \"No actual penis could every really measure up to the imagined sexual potency and social or magical power of the phallus.\" (49) To render this banal experience of male nudity ridiculous, Williams then proceeds to remove skin and muscle. He finally becomes an object of attraction for the female DJ only in skeletal form. By 'going all the way,' the strip confirms the predictability of masculinity and the ordinariness of the male body. For literate listeners though, a higher level of connotation is revealed. The song itself is based on Barry White's melody for 'It's ecstasy (when you lay down next to me).' Such intertextuality accesses the meta-racist excesses of a licentious black male sexuality. A white boy dancer must deliver an impotent, but ironic, rendering of White's (love unlimited) orchestration of potent sexuality. Williams' iconography and soundtrack is refreshing, emerging from an era of \"men who cling … tightly to their illusions.\" (Faludi 14) When the ideological drapery is cut away, the male body is a major disappointment. Masculinity is an anxious performance. Fascinatingly, this deconstructive video has been demeaned through its labelling as pornography [4]. Oddly, a man who is prepared to - literally - shave the skin of masculinity is rendered offensive. \n          Men's studies, like feminism, has been defrocking masculinity for some time. Robinson for example, expressed little sympathy for \"whiny men jumping on the victimisation bandwagon or playing cowboys and Indians at warrior weekends and beating drums in sweat lodges.\" (6) By grating men's identity back to the body, the link between surface and depth - or identity and self - is forged. 'Rock DJ' attacks the new subjectivities of the male body by not only generating self-surveillance, but humour through the removal of clothes, skin and muscle. He continues this play with the symbols of masculine performance throughout the album Sing when you're winning. Featuring soccer photographs of players, coaches and fans, closer inspection of the images reveal that Robbie Williams is actually every character, in every role. \n          His live show also enfolds diverse performances. Singing a version of 'My Way,' with cigarette in tow, he remixes Frank Sinatra into a replaying and recutting of masculine fabric. He follows one dominating masculinity with another: the Bond-inspired 'Millennium.'\n          \n            Some say that we are players \n              Some say that we are pawns \n              But we've been making money \n              Since the day we were born\n            \n          Robbie Williams is comfortably located in a long history of post-Sinatra popular music. He mocks the rock ethos by combining guitars and drums with a gleaming brass section, hailing the lounge act of Dean Martin, while also using rap and dance samples. \n          Although carrying fifty year's of crooner baggage, the spicy scent of homosexuality has also danced around Robbie Williams' career. Much of this ideology can be traced back to the Take That years. As Gary Barlow and Jason Orange commented at the time,\n          \n            Jason: So the rumour is we're all gay now are we?\n              Gary: Am I gay? I am? Why? Oh good. Just as long as we know.\n              Howard: Does anyone think I'm gay?\n              Jason: No, you're the only one people think is straight.\n              Howard: Why aren't I gay? What's wrong with me?\n              Jason: It's because you're such a fine figure of macho manhood.(Kadis 17)\n            \n          For those not literate in the Take That discourse, it should come as no surprise that Howard was the TT equivalent of The Beatle's Ringo Starr or Duran Duran's Andy Taylor. Every boy band requires the ugly, shy member to make the others appear taller and more attractive. The inference of this dialogue is that the other members of the group are simply too handsome to be heterosexual. This ambiguous sexuality has followed Williams into his solo career, becoming fodder for those lads too unappealing to be homosexual: Oasis. \n          \n            Born to be mild\n              I seem to spend my life \n            Just waiting for the chorus \n            'Cause the verse is never nearly \n            Good enough\n            Robbie Williams \"Singing for the lonely.\"\n          \n          Robbie Williams accesses a bigger, brighter and bolder future than Britpop. While the Gallagher brothers emulate and worship the icons of 1960s British music - from the Beatles' haircuts to the Stones' psychedelia - Williams' songs, videos and persona are chattering in a broader cultural field. From Noel Cowardesque allusions to the ordinariness of pub culture, Williams is much more than a pretty-boy singer. He has become an icon of English masculinity, enclosing all the complexity that these two terms convey.\n          Williams' solo success from 1999-2001 occurred at the time of much parochial concern that British acts were not performing well in the American charts. It is bemusing to read Billboard over this period. The obvious quality of Britney Spears is seen to dwarf the mediocrity of British performers. The calibre of Fatboy Slim, carrying a smiley backpack stuffed with reflexive dance culture, is neither admitted nor discussed. It is becoming increasing strange to monitor the excessive fame of Williams in Britain, Europe, Asia and the Pacific when compared to his patchy career in the United States. Even some American magazines are trying to grasp the disparity. \n          \n            The swaggering king of Britpop sold a relatively measly 600,000 copies of his U.S. debut album, The ego has landed … Maybe Americans didn't appreciate his songs about being famous. (Ask Dr. Hip 72)\n          \n          In the first few years of the 2000s, it has been difficult to discuss a unified Anglo-American musical formation. Divergent discursive frameworks have emerged through this British evasion. There is no longer an agreed centre to the musical model. \n          Throughout 1990s Britain, blackness jutted out of dance floor mixes, from reggae to dub, jazz and jungle. Plied with the coldness of techno was an almost too hot hip hop. Yet both were alternate trajectories to Cool Britannia. London once more became swinging, or as Vanity Fair declared, \"the nerve centre of pop's most cohesive scene since the Pacific Northwest grunge explosion of 1991.\" (Kamp 102) Through Britpop, the clock turned back to the 1960s, a simpler time before race became 'a problem' for the nation. An affiliation was made between a New Labour, formed by the 1997 British election, and the rebirth of a Swinging London [5]. This style-driven empire supposedly - again - made London the centre of the world. \n          Britpop was itself a misnaming. It was a strong sense of Englishness that permeated the lyrics, iconography and accent. Englishness requires a Britishness to invoke a sense of bigness and greatness. The contradictions and excesses of Blur, Oasis and Pulp resonate in the gap between centre and periphery, imperial core and colonised other. Slicing through the arrogance and anger of the Gallaghers is a yearning for colonial simplicity, when the pink portions of the map were the stable subjects of geography lessons, rather than the volatile embodiment of postcolonial theory. Simon Gikandi argues that \"the central moments of English cultural identity were driven by doubts and disputes about the perimeters of the values that defined Englishness.\" (x) The reason that Britpop could not 'make it big' in the United States is because it was recycling an exhausted colonial dreaming. Two old Englands were duelling for ascendancy: the Oasis-inflected Manchester working class fought Blur-inspired London art school chic. This insular understanding of difference had serious social and cultural consequences. The only possible representation of white, British youth was a tabloidisation of Oasis's behaviour through swearing, drug excess and violence. Simon Reynolds realised that by\n          \n            returning to the three minute pop tune that the milkman can whistle, reinvoking parochial England with no black people, Britpop has turned its back defiantly on the future. \n              (members.aol.com/blissout/Britpop.html)\n            \n          Fortunately, another future had already happened. The beats per minute were pulsating with an urgent affirmation of change, hybridity and difference. Hip hop and techno mapped a careful cartography of race. While rock was colonialisation by other means, hip hop enacted a decolonial imperative. \n          Electronic dance music provided a unique rendering of identity throughout the 1990s. It was a mode of musical communication that moved across national and linguistic boundaries, far beyond Britpop or Stateside rock music. While the Anglo American military alliance was matched and shadowed by postwar popular culture, Brit-pop signalled the end of this hegemonic formation. From this point, English pop and American rock would not sail as smoothly over the Atlantic. While 1995 was the year of Wonderwall, by 1996 the Britpop bubble corroded the faces of the Gallagher brothers. Oasis was unable to complete the American tour. Yet other cultural forces were already active. 1996 was also the year of Trainspotting, with \"Born Slippy\" being the soundtrack for a blissful journey under the radar. This was a cultural force that no longer required America as a reference point [6]. \n          Robbie Williams was able to integrate the histories of Britpop and dance culture, instigating a complex dialogue between the two. Still, concern peppered music and entertainment journals that British performers were not accessing 'America.' As Sharon Swart stated\n          \n            Britpop acts, on the other hand, are finding it less easy to crack the U.S. market. The Spice Girls may have made some early headway, but fellow purveyors of pop, such as Robbie Williams, can't seem to get satisfaction from American fans. (35\n          \n          British performers had numerous cultural forces working against them. Flat global sales, the strength of the sterling and the slow response to the new technological opportunities of DVD, all caused problems. While Britpop \"cleaned house,\" (Boehm 89) it was uncertain which cultural formation would replace this colonising force. Because of the complex dialogues between the rock discourse and dance culture, time and space were unable to align into a unified market. American critics simply could not grasp Robbie Williams' history, motives or iconography.\n          \n            It's Robbie's world, we just buy tickets for it. Unless, of course you're American and you don't know jack about soccer. That's the first mistake Williams makes - if indeed one of his goals is to break big in the U.S. (and I can't believe someone so ambitious would settle for less.) … Americans, it seems, are most fascinated by British pop when it presents a mirror image of American pop. (Woods 98\n          \n          There is little sense that an entirely different musical economy now circulates, where making it big in the United States is not the singular marker of credibility. Williams' demonstrates commitment to the international market, focussing on MTV Asia, MTV online, New Zealand and Australian audiences [7]. \n          The Gallagher brothers spent much of the 1990s trying to be John Lennon. While Noel, at times, knocked at the door of rock legends through \"Wonderwall,\" he snubbed Williams' penchant for pop glory, describing him as a \"fat dancer.\" (Gallagher in Orecklin 101) Dancing should not be decried so summarily. It conveys subtle nodes of bodily knowledge about men, women, sex and desire. While men are validated for bodily movement through sport, women's dancing remains a performance of voyeuristic attention. Such a divide is highly repressive of men who dance, with gayness infiltrating the metaphoric masculine dancefloor [8]. \n          Too often the binary of male and female is enmeshed into the divide of rock and dance. Actually, these categories slide elegantly over each other. The male pop singers are located in a significant semiotic space. Robbie Williams carries these contradictions and controversy.\n          \n            NO! Robbie didn't go on NME's cover in a 'desperate' attempt to seduce nine-year old knickerwetters … YES! He used to be teenybopper fodder. SO WHAT?! So did the Beatles the Stones, the Who, the Kinks, etc blah blah pseudohistoricalrockbollocks. NO! Making music that gurlz like is NOT a crime! (Wells 62)\n          \n          There remains an uncertainty in his performance of masculinity and at times, a deliberate ambivalence. He grafts subversiveness into a specific lineage of English pop music. The aim for critics of popular music is to find a way to create a rhythm of resistance, rather than melody of credible meanings. In summoning an archaeology of the archive, we begin to write a popular music history. \n          Suzanne Moore asked why men should \"be interested in a sexual politics based on the frightfully old-fashioned ideas of truth, identity and history?\" (175) The reason is now obvious. Femininity is no longer alone on the simulacra. It is impossible to separate real men from the representations of masculinity that dress the corporeal form. Popular music is pivotal, not for collapsing the representation into the real, but for making the space between these states livable, and pleasurable. Like all semiotic sicknesses, the damaged, beaten and bandaged masculinity of contemporary music swaddles a healing pedagogic formation. Robbie Williams enables the writing of a critical history of post Anglo-American music [9]. Popular music captures such stories of place and identity. Significantly though, it also opens out spaces of knowing. There is an investment in rhythm that transgresses national histories of music. While Williams has produced albums, singles, video and endless newspaper copy, his most important revelations are volatile and ephemeral in their impact. He increases the popular cultural vocabulary of masculinity. \n          [1] The fame of both Williams and Halliwell was at such a level that it was reported in the generally conservative, pages of Marketing. The piece was titled \"Will Geri's fling lose its fizz?\" Marketing, August 2000: 17.\n          [2] For poll results, please refer to \"Winners and Losers,\" Time International, Vol. 155, Issue 23, June 12, 2000, 9\n          [3] For a discussion of this growth in academic discourse on masculinity, please refer to Paul Smith's \"Introduction,\" in P. Smith (ed.), Boys: Masculinity in contemporary culture. Colorado: Westview Press, 1996.\n          [4] Steve Futterman described Rock DJ as the \"least alluring porn video on MTV,\" in \"The best and worst: honour roll,\" Entertainment Weekly 574-575 (December 22-December 29 2000): 146.\n          [5] Michael Bracewell stated that \"pop provides an unofficial cartography of its host culture, charting the national mood, marking the crossroads between the major social trends and the tunnels of the zeitgeist,\" in \"Britpop's coming home, it's coming home.\" New Statesman .(February 21 1997): 36.\n          [6] It is important to make my point clear. The 'America' that I am summoning here is a popular cultural formation, which possesses little connection with the territory, institution or defence initiatives of the United States. Simon Frith made this distinction clear, when he stated that \"the question becomes whether 'America' can continue to be the mythical locale of popular culture as it has been through most of this century. As I've suggested, there are reasons now to suppose that 'America' itself, as a pop cultural myth, no longer bears much resemblance to the USA as a real place even in the myth.\" This statement was made in \"Anglo-America and its discontents,\" Cultural Studies 5 1991: 268.\n          [7] To observe the scale of attention paid to the Asian and Pacific markets, please refer to http://robbiewilliams.com/july13scroll.html, http://robbiewilliams.com/july19scroll.html and http://robbiewilliams.com/july24scroll.html, accessed on March 3, 2001\n          [8] At its most naïve, J. Michael Bailey and Michael Oberschneider asked, \"Why are gay men so motivated to dance? One hypothesis is that gay men dance in order to be feminine. In other words, gay men dance because women do. An alternative hypothesis is that gay men and women share a common factor in their emotional make-up that makes dancing especially enjoyable,\" from \"Sexual orientation in professional dance,\" Archives of Sexual Behaviour. 26.4 (August 1997). Such an interpretation is particularly ludicrous when considering the pre-rock and roll masculine dancing rituals in the jive, Charleston and jitterbug. Once more, the history of rock music is obscuring the history of dance both before the mid 1950s and after acid house.\n          [9] Women, gay men and black communities through much of the twentieth century have used these popular spaces. For example, Lynne Segal, in Slow Motion. London: Virago, 1990, stated that \"through dancing, athletic and erotic performance, but most powerfully through music, Black men could express something about the body and its physicality, about emotions and their cosmic reach, rarely found in white culture - least of all in white male culture,\": 191\n          \n          References\n          \nAnsen, D., Giles, J., Kroll, J., Gates, D. and Schoemer, K. \"What's a handsome lad to do?\" Newsweek 133.19 (May 10, 1999): 85.\n            \"Ask Dr. Hip.\" U.S. News and World Report 129.16 (October 23, 2000): 72.\n            Bailey, J.

It\n\t        reminds me of a different but related question I once asked someone\n\t        who worked at Rotate This!, a particularly popular Toronto DJ refuge,\n\t        a few days after I had bought my first turntable:\n\t      DJO: \"How do you stop that popping and crackling sound your record\n\t        gets when you scratch back and forth on the same spot for a while?\"\n\t      CLERK: \"You buy two copies of everything, one you keep at home all\n\t        wrapped-up nice and never use, and the other you mess with.\"\n\t      My last $150 had just managed to pay for an old Dual direct drive\n\t        record player. The precious few recently-released records I had were\n\t        gifts. I nodded my head and made my way over to the rows of disks\n\t        which I flipped through to make it look like I was maybe going to buy\n\t        something. Lp cover after lp cover stared back at me all with names I\n\t        had absolutely never heard of before, organised according to a hyper-\n\t        hybridised classification scheme that completely escaped my\n\t        dictionary-honed alphabetic expectations. Worst of all, there seemed\n\t        to be only single copies of everything left! A sort of outsider's\n\t        vertigo washed over me, and 3 minutes after walking into unfamiliar\n\t        territory, I zipped back out onto the street. Thus was to begin my\n\t        love/hate relationship with the source of all DJ sounds, surliness\n\t        and misinformation--the independent record shop. My query had\n\t        (without my planning) boldly pronounced my neophyte status. The\n\t        response it solicited challenged my seriousness. How much was I\n          willing to invest in order to ride \"the wheels of steel\"?\n\t      Sequence 1\n\t      Will Straw describes the meteoric rise to prominence of the CD format,\n              \n  If the compact disk has emerged as one of the most dazzlingly\n  effective of commodity forms, this has little to do with its\n  technical superiority to the vinyl record (which we no longer\n  remember to notice). Rather, the effectiveness has to do with its\n  status as the perfect crossover consumer object. As a cutting-edge\n  audiophile invention, it seduced the technophilic, connoisseurist\n  males who typically buy new sound equipment and quickly build\n  collections of recordings. At the same time, its visual refinement\n  and high price rapidly rendered it legitimate as a gift. In this,\n  the CD has found a wide audience among the population of casual\n  record buyers.(61)\n\t      Straw's point has to do with the fate of musical recordings within\n\t        contemporary commodity culture. In the wake of a late 70's record\n\t        industry slump, music labels turned their attention toward the\n\t        recapturing of casual record sales (read: aging baby boomers). The\n\t        general\n\t        shape of this attempt revolved around a re-configuring of the record-\n\t        shopping experience dedicated towards reducing \"the intimidation seen\n\t        as endemic to the environment of the record store.\"(59) The CD\n\t        format, along with the development of super-sized, general interest\n\t        (all-genre) record outlets has worked (according to Straw) to\n\t        streamline record sales towards more-predictable patterns, all the\n\t        while causing less \"selection stress.\"(59) Re-issues and\n\t        compilations, special-series trademarks, push-button listening\n\t        stations, and maze-like display layouts, combined with department\n\t        store-style service (\"Can I help you find anything?\") all work\n\t        towards eliminating the need for familiarity with particular music\n\t      \"scenes\" in order to make personally gratifying (and profit\n\t        engendering) musical choices. Straw's analysis is exemplary in its\n\t        dissatisfaction with treating the arena of personal musical choice as\n\t        unaffected by any constraints apart from subjective matters of taste.\n\t      Straw's evaluation also isolates the vinyl record as an object\n\t        eminently ready (post-digital revolution) for subcultural\n\t        appropriation. Its displacement by the CD as the dominant medium for\n\t        collecting recorded music involved the recasting of the turntable as\n\t        outdated and inferior, thereby relegating it to the dusty attic,\n\t        basement or pawn shop (along with crates upon crates upon crates of\n\t        records). These events set the stage for vinyl's spectacular rise\n\t        from the ashes. The most prominent feature of this re-emergence has\n\t        to do not simply with possession of the right kind of stuff (the\n\t        cachet of having a music collection difficult for others to borrow\n          aside), but with what vinyl and turntable technology can do.\n\t      Bridge\n\t      In Subculture: The Meaning of Style, Dick Hebdige claims that\n\t        subcultures are,\n\t      \n\t        cultures of conspicuous consumption...and it is through the\n\t          distinctive rituals of consumption, through style, that the\n\t          subculture at once reveals its \"secret identity\" and communicates\n\t          its forbidden meanings. It is basically the way in which commodities\n\t          are used in subculture which mark the subculture off from more\n\t          orthodox cultural formations.(103\n\t        \n\t       Hebdige borrows the notion of bricolage from Levi Strauss in order\n\t        to describe the particular kind of use subcultures make of the\n\t        commodities they appropriate. Relationships of identity, difference\n\t        and order are developed from out of the minds of those who make use\n\t        of the objects in question and are not necessarily determined by\n\t        particular qualities inherent to the objects themselves. Henceforth a\n\t        safety pin more often used for purposes like replacing missing\n\t        buttons or temporarily joining pieces of fabric can become a punk\n\t        fashion statement once placed through the nose, ear or torn Sex\n\t        Pistols tee-shirt. In the case of DJ culture, it is the practice of\n\t        mixing which most obviously presents itself as definitive of\n\t        subcultural participation. The objects of conspicuous consumption in\n\t        this case--record tracks.\n\t       If mixing can be understood as bricolage, then attempts \"to discern\n\t        the hidden messages inscribed in code\"(18) by such a practice are not\n\t        in vain. Granting mixing the power of meaning sets a formidable\n\t        (semiotic) framework in place for investigating the practice's\n\t        outwardly visible (spectacular) form and structure. Hebdige's\n\t        description of bricolage as a particularly conspicuous and codified\n\t        type of using, however, runs the risk of privileging an account of\n\t        record collecting and mixing which interprets it entirely on the\n\t        model of subjective expression.(1.) What is necessary is a means of\n\t        access to the dialogue which takes place between a DJ and her records\n\t        as such. The contents of a DJ's record bag (like Straw's CD shopping\n\t        bag) are influenced by more that just her imagination, pocket book\n\t        and exposure to different kinds of music. They are also determined in\n\t        an important way by each other. Audio mixing is not one practice, it\n\t        is many, and the choice to develop or use one sort of skill over\n\t        another is intimately tied up with the type and nature of track one\n          is working with.\n\t      Sequence 2\n\t      The raw practice of DJing relies heavily on a slider integral to DJ\n\t        mixers known as the _cross-fader_(ital). With the standard DJ set up,\n\t        when the cross-fader is all the way to the left, the left turntable\n\t        track plays through the system; vice versa when the fader is all the\n\t        way to the right. In between is the \"open\" position which allows both\n\t        inputs to be heard simultaneously. The most straightforward mixing\n\t        technique, \"cutting,\" involves using this toggle to quickly switch\n\t        from one source to another--resulting in the abrupt end of one sound-\n\t        flow followed by its instantaneous replacement. This technique can be\n\t        used to achieve a variety of different effects--from the rather\n\t        straightforward stringing together of the final beat of a four bar\n\t        sequence from one track with a strong downbeat from something new in\n\t        order to provide continuous, but sequential musical output, to the\n\t        thoroughly difficult practice of \"beat juggling,\" where short\n\t        excerpts of otherwise self-contained tracks (\"breaks\") are isolated\n\t        and then extended indefinitely through the use of two copies of the\n\t        same record (while one record plays, the DJ spins the other back to\n\t        the downbeat of the break in question, which is then released in\n\t        rhythm). In both cases timing and rhythm are key. These features of\n\t        the practice help to explain DJ predilections for tracks which make\n\t        heavy, predictable use of their rhythm sections.\n\t      \"Blending\" is a second technique which uses the open position on the\n\t        cross-fader to mix two inputs into a live sonic collage. Tempo,\n\t        rhythm and \"density\" of source material have an enormous impact on\n\t        the end result. While any two tracks can be layered in this way,\n\t        beats that are not synchronized are quick to create cacophony, and\n\t        vocals also tend to clash dramatically. Melodic lines in general pose\n\t        certain challenges here since these are in particular keys and have\n\t        obvious starts and finishes. This is one reason why tracks produced\n\t        specifically for DJing often have such long, minimal intros and\n\t        exits. This makes it much easier to create \"natural\" sounding blends.\n\t        Atmospheric sounds, low-frequency hums, speech samples and repetitive\n\t        loops with indeterminate rhythm structures are often used for these\n\t        segments in order to allow drawn-out, subtle transitions when moving\n\t        between tracks. If an intro contains a fixed beat (as is the case\n\t        often with genres constructed specifically for non-stop dancing like\n\t        house, techno and to some extent drum and bass), then those who want\n\t        seamless blends need to \"beat match\" if they want to maintain a\n\t        dancer's groove. The roots of this technique go back to disco and\n\t        demand fairly strict genre loyalty in order to insure that a set's\n\t        worth of tracks all hover around the same tempo, defined in beats-per-\n\t        minute, or BPMs. The basic procedure involves finding the downbeat of\n\t        the track one wishes to mix through a set of headphones, releasing\n\t        that beat in time with the other record while making fine tempo-\n\t        adjustments via the turntable's pitch control to the point where the\n\t        track coming through the earphones and the track being played over\n\t        the system are in synch. The next step is \"back-spinning\" or \"needle\n\t        dropping\" to the start of the track to be mixed, then releasing it\n\t        again, this time with the cross-fader open. Volume levels can then be\n\t        adjusted in order to allow the new track to slowly take prominence\n\t        (the initial track being close to its end at this point) before the\n\t        cross-fader is closed into the new position and the entire procedure\n\t        is repeated. \n\t      Scratching is perhaps the most notorious mixing technique and\n\t        involves the most different types of manipulations. The practice is\n\t        most highly developed in hip hop (and related genres like drum and\n\t        bass) and is used both as an advanced cutting technique for moving\n\t        between tracks as well as a sonic end-in-itself. It's genesis is\n\t        attributed to a South Bronx DJ known as Grand Wizard Theodore who was\n\t        the first (1977) to try to make creative use of the sound associated\n\t        with moving a record needle back and forth over the same drumbeat, a\n\t        phenomena familiar to DJs used to cueing-up downbeats through\n\t        headphones. This trick is now referred to as the \"baby scratch,\" and\n\t        it along with an ever-increasing host of mutations and hybrids make-\n\t        up the skills that pay the bills for hip hop DJs. In the case of many\n\t        of these techniques, the cross-fader is once again used heavily in\n\t        order to remove unwanted elements of particular scratches from the\n\t        mix, as well as adding certain staccato and volume-fading effects.\n\t        Isolated, \"pure\" sounds are easiest to scratch with and are therefore\n\t        highly sought after by this sort of DJ--a pastime affectionately\n\t        referred to as \"digging in the crates.\" Sources of such sounds are\n\t        extremely diverse, but inevitably revolve around genre's which use\n\t        minimal orchestration (like movie-soundtracks), accentuated rhythms\n\t        with frequent breakdowns (like funk or jazz), or which eschew musical\n          form all together (like sound-effects, comedy and children's records).\n\t      Exit\n\t      To answer the question which started this investigation, in the end,\n\t        how wrecked my records get depends a lot on what I'm using them for.\n\t        To be sure, super-fast scratching patterns and tricks that use lots\n\t        of back-spinning like beat-juggling will eventually \"burn\" static\n\t        into spots on one's records. But with used records costing as little\n\t        as $1 for three, and battle records (2.) widely available, the effect\n\t        of this feature of the technology on the actual pursuit of the\n\t        practice is negligible. And most techniques don't noticeably burn\n\t        records at all, especially if a DJ's touch is light enough to allow\n\t        for minimal tone-arm weight (a parameter which controls a turntable's\n\t        groove-tracking ability). This is the kind of knowledge which comes\n\t        from interaction with objects. It is also the source of a great part\n\t        of the subcultural bricoleur's stylistic savvy. Herein lies the\n\t        essence of the intimidating power of the indie record shop--its\n\t        display of intimate, physical familiarity with the hidden\n\t        particularities of the new vinyl experience. Investigators confronted\n\t        with such familiarity need to find ways to go beyond analyses which\n\t        stop at the level of acknowledgment of the visible logic displayed by\n\t        spectacular subcultural practices if they wish to develop nuanced\n\t        accounts of subcultural life. Such plumbing of the depths often\n\t        requires listening in the place of observing--whether to first-hand\n\t        accounts collected through ethnography or to the subtle voice of the\n\t        objects themselves.\n\t      (1.) An example of such an account: \"DJ-ing is evangelism; a desire\n\t        to share songs. A key skill is obviously not just to drop the\n\t        popular, well-known songs at the right part of the night, but to pick\n\t        the right new releases, track down the obscurer tunes and newest\n\t        imports, get hold of next month's big tune this month; you gather\n\t        this pile, this tinder, together, then you work the records, mix\n\t        them, drop them, cut them, scratch them, melt them, beat them all\n\t        together until they unite. Voilà; disco inferno.\"\n  Dave Haslam, \"DJ Culture,\" p. 169.\n\t      (2.)

    "title": "The Work of Consumption",
    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n           Russell Belk,in an amazing 1995 essay on consumption (where 22 of the 38 pages are references, demonstrating hyper-consumption in action), argues that the 1990s heralded a new understanding of consumer behaviour. In the shifting paradigm identified by Belk, the analytical focus of consumer behaviour research became translated from 'Economic/Psychological' to 'Sociological/Anthropological', and from a 'Focus on buying' to a 'Focus on consuming' (61). This made intuitive sense in a world of postmodern marketing (Brown), and it re-enforced an idea that had been put forward by Dallas Smythe that audiences are sold to advertisers . The value of an audience lies in its potential to consume, and Virginia Nightingale subsequently explored this dynamic in her argument that consumption is work: \n          \n            \"It is because of the relationship between advertising and television that watching television is work. Watching television is a leisure activity in the pursuit of which viewers are asked to lose themselves, to blur the distinctions between reality and fantasy. They are asked to forget that watching television is also work, to see television advertisements not as a continual reminder of the work of purchasing, but as entertainment. They are asked to believe that what they see on television is what they want to see, specially selected to please them.\" (33-4)\n          \n          Nightingale had previously argued that consumption in the domestic context was not only work, but quintessentially women'swork: \n          Commercial television is an integral part of the modern shopping world. In this age of image advertising, it is from television that the meanings of brands are learned. If women learned to shop in the nineteenth century, they had to be taught to shop for others in the twentieth. The unpredictable woman of the nineteenth century had to be transformed into predictable, programmable 'Mum' one hundred years later. The branding of food commodities and the establishment of television as an efficient system of brand information assisted a change in the mode of address of the shopping world to women purchasers. In the cut-price world of the 50s and 60s seduction was out and value was in. In a shopping world of comparable brands, Mum has to learn not only the meaning, the lifestyle connotations of branded products from television advertising, but their meanings for the members of the family destined to consume her purchases (33). \n          This way of looking at the world although illuminating begged the question as to an appropriate definition of work. Why did watching television seem so much less like work than, say, typing an article, or working as a waiter? Staying alive breathing, metabolising requires work at some level; what differentiates the 'going to work' side of working: and how does this relate to a consumer society which (as Belk identifies) increasingly involves an emphasis upon consumption rather than production? \n          Greg Hearn, Tom Mandeville and David Anthony estimate that \"consumption now accounts for about 60 per cent of GDP ... mass communication, advertising and the consumer economy form a nexus that is centrally implicated in the operation of Western societies\" (104). They go on to argue that the \"central assertion of postmodern views of consumption is that social identity can be interpreted as a function of consumption\" (106). Citing Lunt and Livingstone, Hearn et al. suggest that \"fuelled by their ability to modify and process the building blocks of identity (images, visual codes, phrases and ideas), our current mass media, via identity construction, have expanded consumption in advanced industrial societies\" (107). Identity construction, however, is a given of existence it is impossible to live without some kind of identity, and impossible to adopt an identity in a vacuum, with no relationship to the social world in which the individual lives. Given that identity-construction is a necessity of existence, and will also necessarily reflect an individual's social practices and their consumption characteristics, can it be seen as 'work'? (And, if not, why not?) One way this problem can be investigated is through changes in work patterns in contemporary societies. \n          Among the most dramatic socio-economic developments of the past two generations has been the changing role of women in the workforce. Some women still in employment are members of the generation which, as recently as the 1960s, were obliged to surrender their jobs upon marriage. Many were subsequently re-employed on a casual basis, but others were unable to resume a career of any sort given that they now had 'family responsibilities' (even if that 'family responsibility' was their spouse alone). The reason behind the compulsory female resignations was the patriarchal view that it was the husband's role to provide financially for his wife. For a married woman to hold a job was akin to double dipping the job was there to support a woman who had no husband to support her; or for a man with a wife (and sometimes other family) to provide for. \n          When women successfully campaigned against this discriminatory practice, and later in favour of equal pay for equal work, the ultimate result was that the real wages of men fell. Two-income families do not earn twice a 'living' wage; they earn a living wage between them. The advent of equal pay for women means that only a small proportion of women (or men) have the choice of making domestic and community-based unwaged labour the focus of their daily life, without the effect of this choice being a much smaller financial engagement in consumer society. \n          The gender dimension to money-earning remains considerable, even in this age of equal opportunity legislation. In particular, the 'wages for housework' campaign has been all but lost over the past thirty years. Further, although it is now unlawful for women to receive less money than their male counterparts for equal work, women's average pay continues to lag significantly behind that of men (WEL). This is one way of demonstrating that traditional women's work tends to be less well paid than men's work. Nursing, teaching and office work all remain low-paid compared with executive occupations, although compulsory post-schooling study requirements might be higher in the female areas. And it is commonplace to note that in traditionally female occupations (like primary school teaching) although males might be out-numbered 5:1 it tends to be a man who gets promoted. (Less a case of the glass ceiling: more a case of the invisible escalator.) \n          In capitalist societies, the original source of monetary wealth lies in power the power to control labour/work for the profit of an individual other than the labourer. This is a hangover from feudal agrarianism, and a precursor to the information age (Bell). In all human society, power confers advantage, including the capacity to direct the work of others. While this was true of the feudal lord, the merchant prince and the early industrialist, it achieved its purest form with the introduction of monetary rewards for labour. Frederic Jameson (77) comments that: \n          \n            \"technology may well serve as adequate shorthand to designate that enormous properly human and anti-natural power of dead human labour stored up in our machinery, an alienated power, what Sartre calls the counterfinality of the practico-inert, which turns back on and against us in unrecognizable forms and seems to constitute the massive dystopian horizon of our collective as well as our individual praxis.\"\n          \n          What Jameson says of technology in general would be equally true of the particular technology of money. Accumulated capital, and its constituent parts of coins, notes, currencies and data sets represents 'dead human labour', in the sense of work expended in the past in the production of goods and services. It is this stored human labour which buys the carrots, or the magazine subscription, and which represents an exchange for the time and energy that would have been required to grow the carrots, or produce the magazine. Similarly, the income paid to the carrot-grower, the journalist, the designer and the advertiser represents to them a distilled recompense for their work. Arguably, the energy that produced the labour for which one is paid is 'dead' energy controlled by another and exchanged for money. \n          At an individual level, the roles played in the personaeof a person earning money, or a person spending money (a common indication of consumption) are very different: with the role of the person earning money much more circumscribed. Joshua Meyrowitz (29-31) spends some time in explaining Goffman's analysis of the roles of the waiter, using metaphors from drama of front/back region/stage: \n          Waiters for example are in a front region when they serve people in a restaurant dining room. In the front region waiters are usually polite and respectful. Their appearance and manner is one of cleanliness and efficiency. They do not enter into the dinner conversations of restaurant patrons. They do not comment on their customers' eating habits or table manners. They rarely, if ever, eat while in the sight of patrons. \n          When waiters step from the dining room into the kitchen, however, they suddenly cross a line between the onstage and backstage areas. In the kitchen waiters are in an area which is hidden from the audience and they share this area with others who perform the same or similar roles vis-a-vis the audience. Here, then, waiters may make remarks to each other about the 'strange behaviour of the people at table seven', they may imitate a customer, or give advice to a 'rookie' on methods of getting big tips. In the kitchen food may be handled and discussed with somewhat less respect than in the dining room, and waiters may 'get out of costume' or sit in a sloppy position with their feet up on a counter... \n          We expect to be treated differently in a restaurant than in a doctor's office. We expect the doctor to appear confident, concerned, patient and professional and slightly superior. We expect a waitress to be efficient, respectful and nonintrusive. And we demand these differences in 'character' even if the waitress is a student earning her way through medical school. \n          This analysis indicates that where behaviour is related to money where a person is paid to fulfil a role; the production of the goods or services the behaviour is more constrained and circumscribed by the expectations of the employer/consumer. The behaviour of people who are paying for a service, whose intention is to consume, is the least constrained. It may be that Kerry Packer has awful table manners, but few restauranteurs would fail to be pleased to see him walking through their door. \n          At the level of the individual producer/consumer in consumer societies, money is seen to exert decisive control in the lives of workers. Is it possible to think of a better, less obviously coercive way to get people into cars, and onto freeways and clocking into the office on such a regular, reliable basis: other than their being paid to do so? American academic Camille Paglia does not think so: \"Capitalism, whatever its problems, remains the most efficient economic mechanism yet devised to bring the highest quality of life to the greatest number... Because I have studied the past, I know that, in America and under capitalism, I am the freest woman in history\" (Menand 27). \n          Paglia obviously considers herself sufficiently well paid. Since access to money limits access to goods, to some experiences and to travel, money is a potent incentive to behave in a way that is rewarded by society. Even so, not everyone is able to exhibit the work behaviour that social systems are most inclined to reward. The stresses of unemployment lie in its curtailing of options; in its implications for health, housing, leisure, and educational opportunities; and in the fact that the need to get more money monopolises the time of the unemployed. \n          The old adage 'time is money' is only partly true. In some respects the two share an inverse relationship: 'free' time is inversely related to money. For the vast majority of the population, the opportunity to convert work/labour into money significantly limits the time available in which to enjoy consuming the rewards for their labours. When people have 'free' time, it is frequently because the opportunity to earn money by the production of goods and services is absent. Consequently possible consumption activities are also severely limited. \n          There are no hard and fast rules in Jameson's late capitalist society, but the general case might be that we are paid to produce goods, services and information through our controlled work, while consumption is generally constructed as a voluntary activity. It is partly that voluntariness which implicates consumption in identity construction, makes it an expression of individual difference, and renders it potentially pleasurable. Arguably, however, the voluntary nature of consumption together with the impossibility of notconsuming prevents it from being categorised unambiguously as 'work'. \n          The relationship of work to money helps explain why it may be work to watch television, but it's a different kind of work from that performed at the Coles check-out. Identity-construction may be a major consumer project using raw materials provided by the mass media, but it is not work we're paid to do. No-one else is prepared to use their stored labour to recompense us for our everyday work as non-professional television viewers, or for our project of self-individuation as expressed through the production of our personal identity. \n          \n          References\n          \nBelk, Russell. \"Studies in the New Consumer Behaviour.\" Acknowledging Consumption: A Review of New Studies.

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n           In the summer of 1999, four ships carrying 599 Fujianese people arrived on the west coast of Canada. They survived a desperate and dangerous journey only for the Canadian Government to put them in prison. After numerous deportations, there are still about 40 of these people in Canadian prisons as of January 2001. They have been in jail for over a year and a half under mere suspicion of flight risk. About 24 people have been granted refugee status. Most people deported to China have been placed in Chinese prisons and fined. \n          It is worth remembering that these migrants may have been undocumented but they are not \"illegal\" in that they have mobility rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognizes everyone's right to leave any country and to seek asylum. It can be argued that it is not the migrants who are illegal, but the unjust laws that criminalize their freedom of movement. In considering people's rights, we need to keep in mind not only the civil and political rights that the West tends to privilege, but equally important social and economic rights as well.\n          As a local response to a global phenomenon, Direct Action Against Refugee Exploitation (DAARE) formed in Vancouver to support the rights of the Fujianese women, eleven of whom at the time of writing are still being held in the Burnaby Correctional Centre for Women (BCCW). In DAARE’s view, Immigration Canada's decision to detain all these people is based on a racialized group-profiling policy which violates basic human rights and ignores Canadian responsibility in the creation of the global economic and societal conditions which give rise to widespread migration. \n          In light of the Canadian government's plans to implement even more punitive immigration legislation, DAARE endorses the Coalition for a Just Immigration and Refugee Policy's \"Position Paper on Bill C31.\" They call for humanitarian review and release for the remaining Fujianese people. This review would include a few released refugee claimants who are still in Canada, children, women who were past victims of family planning, people facing religious persecution and, of course, those who are still in prison after 18 months and who have never been charged with any crime. Suspicion of flight risk is not a valid reason to incarcerate people for such a long time.\n          Who Is a Migrant?\n\n          \n            The lines between \"voluntary\" and \"forced\" migration are no longer adequate to explain the complexities of population movements today. Motives for forced displacement include political, economic, social and environmental factors. This spectrum runs from the immediate threats to life, safety and freedom due to war or persecution, to situations where economic conditions make the prospects of survival marginal and non-existent. (Moussa 2000).\n          \nTerms like \"economic migrant\" and \"bogus refugee\" have been used in the media to discredit migrants such as the Fujianese and to foster hostility against them. This scapegoating process oversimplifies the situation, for all refugees and all migrants are entitled to the basic respect due all human beings as enshrined in the UN Declaration of Human Rights. There can be multiple reasons for an individual to migrate—ranging from family reunification to economic pressures to personal survival; to fear of government corruption and of political persecution, to name just a few. The reduction of everything to merely the economic does not allow one to understand why migration is occurring and likely to increase in the future. \n          Most immigrants to Canada could also be described as economic migrants. Conrad Black is an economic migrant. The privileging of rich migrants over poor ones romanticizes globalization as corporate progress and ignores the immense human suffering it entails for the majority of the world's population as the gap between the wealthy and the poor rapidly increases.\n          Hundreds of years ago, when migrants came to this aboriginal territory we now call Canada, they came in order to survive—in short, they too were \"economic migrants.\" Many of those migrants who came from Europe would not qualify to enter Canada today under its current immigration admissions guidelines. Indeed, over 50% of Canadians would not be able to independently immigrate to Canada given its current elitist restrictions. \n          One of the major reasons for an increase in migration is the destruction of rural economies in Asia and elsewhere in the world. Millions of people have been displaced by changes in agriculture that separate people from the land. These waves of internal migration also result in the movement of peoples across national borders in order to survive. Chinese provinces such as Fujian and Guangdong, whose people have a long history of overseas travel, are particularly common sources of out-migration.\n          In discussing migration, we need to be wary of how we can inadvertently reinforce the colonization of First Nations people unless we consciously work against that by actively supporting aboriginal self-determination. For example, some First Nations people have been accused of \"smuggling\" people across borders—this subjects them to the same process of criminalization which the migrants have experienced, and ignores the sovereign rights of First Nations people. We need ways of relating to one another which do not reenact domination, but which work in solidarity with First Nations' struggles. This requires an understanding of the ways in which racism, colonialism, classism, and other tactics through which \"dividing and conquering\" take place. For those of us who are first, second, third, fourth, fifth generation migrants to this land, our survival and liberation are intimately connected to that of aboriginal people.\n          History Repeating Itself?\n          The arrival of the Fujianese people met with a racist media hysteria reminiscent of earlier episodes of Canadian history. Front page newspaper headlines such as \"Go Home\" increased hostility against these people. In Victoria, people were offering to adopt the dog on one of the ships at the same time that they were calling to deport the Chinese. From the corporate media accounts of the situation, one would think that most Canadians did not care about the dangerous voyage these people had endured, a voyage during which two people from the second ship died. \n          Accusations that people were trying to enter the country \"illegally\" overlooked how historically, the Chinese, like other people of colour, have had to find ways to compensate for racist and classist biases in Canada's immigration system. For example, from 1960 to 1973, Canada granted amnesty to over 12,000 \"paper sons,\" that is, people who had immigrated under names other than their own. The granting of \"legal\" status to the \"paper sons\" who arrived before 1960 finally recognized that Canada's legislation had unfairly excluded Chinese people for decades. From 1923 to 1947, Canada's Chinese Exclusion Act had basically prevented Chinese people from entering this country. \n          The xenophobic attitudes that gave rise to the Chinese Exclusion Act and the head tax occurred within a colonial context that privileged British migrants. Today, colonialism may no longer be as rhetorically attached to the British empire, but its patterns—particularly the globally inequitable distribution of wealth and resources—continue to accelerate through the mechanism of transnational corporations, for example. As Helene Moussa has pointed out, \"the interconnections of globalisation with racist and colonialist ideology are only too clear when all evidence shows that globalisation '¼ legitimise[s] and sustain[s] an international system that tolerates an unbelievable divide not only between the North and the South but also inside them'\" (2000). Moreover, according to the United Nations Development Programme, the income gap between people in the world's wealthiest nations and the poorest nations has shifted from 30:1 in 1960 to 60:1 in 1990 and to 74:1 in 1997. (Moussa 2000)\n          As capital or electronic money moves across borders faster than ever before in what some have called the casino economy (Mander and Goldsmith), change and instability are rapidly increasing for the majority of the world's population. People are justifiably anxious about their well-being in the face of growing transnational corporate power; however, \"protecting\" national borders through enforcement and detention of displaced people is a form of reactive, violent, and often racist, nationalism which scapegoats the vulnerable without truly addressing the root causes of instability and migration. In short, reactive nationalism is ineffective in safe-guarding people's survival. Asserting solidarity with those who are most immediately displaced and impoverished by globalization is strategically a better way to work towards our common survival. Substantive freedom requires equitable economic relations; that is, fairly shared wealth. \n          Canadian Response Abilities\n          The Canadian government should take responsibility for its role in creating the conditions that displace people and force them to migrate within their countries and across borders. As a major sponsor of efforts to privatize economies and undertake environmentally devastating projects such as hydro-electric dams, Canada has played a significant role in the creation of an unemployed \"floating population\" in China which is estimated to reach 200 million people this year. Punitive tactics will not stop the movement of people, who migrate to survive. According to Peter Kwong, \"The well-publicized Chinese government's market reforms have practically eliminated all labor laws, labour benefits and protections. In the \"free enterprise zones\" workers live virtually on the factory floor, laboring fourteen hours a day for a mere two dollars—that is, about 20 cents an hour\" (136). As Sunera Thobani has phrased it, \"What makes it alright for us to buy a t-shirt on the streets of Vancouver for $3, which was made in China, then stand up all outraged as Canadian citizens when the woman who made that t-shirt tries to come here and live with us on a basis of equality?\"\n          Canada should respond to the urgent situations which cause people to move—not only on the grounds upon which Convention refugees were defined in 1949 (race, religion, nationality, social group, political opinion) which continue to be valid—but also to strengthen Canada's system to include a contemporary understanding that all people have basic economic and environmental survival rights. Some migrants have lives that fit into the narrow definition of a UN Convention refugee and some may not. Those who do not fit this definition have nonetheless urgent needs that deserve attention. \n          The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives has pointed out that there are at least 18 million people working in 124 export zones in China. A living wage in China is estimated to be 87 cents per hour. Canadians benefit from these conditions of cheap labour, yet when the producers of these goods come to our shores, we hypocritically disavow any relationship with them. Responsibility in this context need not refer so much to some stern sense of duty, obligation or altruism as to a full \"response\"—intellectual, emotional, physical, and spiritual—that such a situation provokes in relations between those who \"benefit\"—materially at least—from such a system and those who do not.\n          \n          References \n          \nAnderson, Sarah, et al.

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n           In a letter responding to the Federal Government’s refusal to offer a formal apology to the ‘Stolen Generation’ of Indigenous Australians, members of the Vietnamese-Australian community expressed an understanding (often lacked by Anglo-Australians) of the need to appreciate their position as migrants in relation to the Indigenous community:\n          \n            \"We are here now, living in cities and towns that once were their hunting grounds, their camping places, their sacred sites. We are the beneficiaries of their dispossession, and we acknowledge their loss. We understand about the loss of home, family and cultural values, and we too would like to express our deep sorrow to all indigenous Australians for their suffering and offer our support for genuine reconciliation.\" (Le and Nguyen 14)\n            \n          This letter remains one of the few instances in which the contemporary positioning of migrant and Indigenous peoples is discussed in relation to one another.\n          It is demonstrative of some of the points of continuity between the ways Aboriginal and migrant collectivities (especially those who are racially ‘marked’) experience Australian society but, more often than not, these connections remain under-theorised. In Australian debates concerning the significance of descent, belonging and culture, there have been two distinct, yet connected currents (Curthoys 21). One of these debates concerns the positioning of Indigenous and settler Australians within a (continuing) history of colonisation and genocide. The other debate centres on immigration, multiculturalism and ethnic/cultural diversity. Ghassan Hage argues that such distinctions are a reflection of a white governmental tendency that conceives ‘white-Aboriginal’ and ‘Anglo-Ethnic’ relations in oppositional terms. The whites \"relating to Aboriginal people appear as totally unaffected by multiculturalism, while the ‘Anglos’ relating to the ‘ethnics’ appear as if they have no Aboriginal question about which to worry\" (24). It is only since the mid to late 1990s that debates on both Indigenous and immigration policies (re-ignited by independent member of parliament Pauline Hanson in 1996) have been explicitly connected.\n          This article examines the ambiguous and often strained relationship between the positioning of Indigenous and migrant peoples in contemporary Australian society. While the above letter suggests a degree of sympathy and empathy between recent migrant collectivities and Aboriginal people, such a level of recognition and understanding cannot be taken for granted. The following account of Aboriginal-migrant relations indicates that these are structured by both \"complex conflicts and points of solidarity\" (Perera and Pugliese 5). Given that both diasporic and Indigenous communities can be the targets of white supremacist ideologies and hostilities, some commonalities between these collectivities become apparent. The \"attraction of outsiders to fellow outsiders, the stranger (the [I]ndigenous made a stranger in her or his own land) to the stranger from elsewhere\" (Docker and Fischer 15), can result in the creation of common interests and affiliations. However, diasporic communities do not share the same history of colonisation (in Australia, at least) with Indigenous Australians, and may be perceived as yet another set of invaders. Just like the colonisers, more recent migrants are beneficiaries of the original dispossession and (continuing) colonisation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians.\n          The Indigenous and the Diasporic: Tensions and Uncertainties\n          The shared knowledge of being located on the margins of white Australian society has enabled Aboriginal and non-white racial minorities to see many similarities in their circumstances and experiences. Both Aboriginal and non-Anglo migrant collectivities have largely been excluded from dominant ideologies of Australian national belonging. Those migrants who have come to Australia as refugees can often appreciate the feelings of cultural domination and loss that many Aboriginal people experience on a daily basis. Both Aboriginal and NESB collectivities have also come under pressure to adopt the assumed monolithic Australian culture. The assimilation policy offered a chance for Aborigines and NESB migrants to ‘fit in’, but this was on the proviso that they conform. Both NESB and Aboriginal communities experience ongoing structural disadvantages in Australian society and its economy. These collectivities can also suffer discrimination and hostility in their social relations with fellow Australians. \n          Despite these similarities, however, there is often a lack of identification between Aboriginal and migrant collectivities. Australian Indigenous and immigrant peoples have very divergent histories and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people often resist being drawn under the rubric of multiculturalism. Instead, many Indigenous Australians have attacked multiculturalism, claiming that the idea of the equal validity of every culture \"reduces them to the status of just another ethnic minority\" (Bulbeck 273). Many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people wish to reinforce their status as the ‘first’ or Indigenous peoples of this country; an insistence that does not necessarily assist recognition of the ways in which racism and ethnocentrism impact upon ‘Other’ minorities. \n          Another reason for the relative lack of engagement between Indigenous and diasporic communities is that the political agenda of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is different from that of other minority collectivities. Indigenous activists have expressed understandable and substantiated fears that the focus on multiculturalism not only overlooks the Indigenous status of Aborigines as ‘first peoples’, but can distract attention from the issues of land rights and Native Title (Gunew 455). Lois O’Donoghue recognises both advantages and disadvantages in contemporary multiculturalism: \"Perhaps Aboriginal people have benefited from the greater appreciation of cultural diversity which has resulted from the admission of other points of view\". However, \"we are the original inhabitants of this land, and our sufferings, past and present, make some form of special recognition a moral imperative\" (qtd. in Bulbeck 274).\n          Another difficulty lies is that newly arrived migrants are extended various social rights and privileges that have only relatively recently been granted to Indigenous Australians. Many Indigenes have resented the fact that new groups may be better treated than themselves, with some migrants taking on \"the racist stereotypes of Anglo-Australian society\" (Vasta 51). In Sang Ye’s interviews with various Chinese migrants in The Year the Dragon Came, for instance, one interviewee claimed that: \"Nearly all the Aborigines are unemployed or refuse to take jobs that are available; they’re outside the pubs or on the grass getting drunk on beer\" (182). These comments show very clearly that the common experiences of racism that many NESB and Aboriginal Australians share do not automatically guarantee understanding or political solidarity between the two groups (Perera and Pugliese 14).\n          The above quotation also illustrates the way in which NESB Australians can reproduce dominant white Australian characterisations of contemporary Aboriginality. Aboriginal people continue to face popular conceptions of themselves as drunken, lazy, intellectually inferior, or as suitable only for servile or menial work (Morris 171-173). As Ruby Langford Ginibi maintains: \n          \n            They’ve got us stereotyped as nothing but lazy layabout boongs, you know, and they see a Koori fella staggering down the street charged up and they say, ‘Oh, they’re all like that,’ but they never stop, or pause to think, ‘Hey, what’s made this person like this?’ You can’t do what has been done to a race of people without it having disastrous results. (qtd. in Little 105\n            \n          As long as Anglo- and NESB Australians focus on the low socioeconomic position of Aboriginal people without considering the lasting effects of colonialism, Aborigines will continually be cast as the culprits of their own positioning. Widely-circulated conservative ideologies that blame Aboriginal people for their own victimisation overlook the enduring legacies of colonisation. As Arthur Corunna states in Sally Morgan’s My Place: \"You see, the trouble is that colonialism isn’t over yet\" (212). According to Suvendrini Perera and Joseph Pugliese, \"[i]t is vital that the structural disadvantages and racisms faced by indigenous peoples not be relegated to history, but be seen as ongoing in contemporary Australia\" (10).\n          Many Aboriginal communities also feel that because migrants have not, in Australia at least, suffered the same extent of cultural domination, they are less disadvantaged. John Docker argues that each individual in 1788 and since who has come to Australia, however variegated their experiences and \"however much there has been racism and ethnocentrism and differential access to power ha[s] benefited from the original invasion and dispossession of the Aboriginal peoples, and still benefit[s]\" (54). For Aboriginal people migrant groups could be seen as another set of invaders, \"not brothers and sisters on the margins, not the fellow oppressed and dispossessed\" (Docker 54). Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have thus avoided conflating their own political agendas – at the foreground of which are land rights and Native Title – with the very different concerns of various migrant communities (Brewster 16).\n          Many Aboriginal people feel that because those migrating to Australia can retain their language, and often have families or communities to go to, they are less disadvantaged. Langford Ginibi’s comments are illustrative:\n          \n            Even the people who migrate here are on a higher social level than we are, and we’re the first people of this land! My people were forced to give away using our language and culture, and adopt the ways of the white man, but the people who migrated here don’t give away their language or culture to become Australian citizens.\" (52)\n            \n          In her autobiography Born a Half-Caste, Marnie Kennedy makes similar claims: \"Every nationality in Australia is allowed to speak its language. They have their own gatherings. These are the things that make Aborigines very bitter because they were made to give up everything that was sacred to them\" (4-5).\n          Given the tensions and contradictions outlined above, long-lasting and productive relations between Aboriginal and NESB peoples can sometimes be difficult to forge, but it is important that NESB people recognise their responsibility in the ongoing dispossession of Indigenous Australians. NESB migrants (and all non-Aboriginal Australians) remain the beneficiaries of colonisation but, unlike their Anglo-Australian counterparts, non-white migrants have been racially marked and had their ability to claim the title ‘Australian’ questioned. Ongoing analysis of the positioning of NESB collectivities in relation to Aboriginal peoples will assist in undermining the central conflict of Black vs. white in reconciliation debates. Further research might also help disrupt the continuing cleavage of ‘the immigrant’ and ‘the Indigene’ in contemporary paradigms of reconciliation, providing a space for discussion on the potential role and contribution of NESB Australians to the reconciliation process.\n          \n          References \n          \nBrewster, Anne.

    "title": "Work and Masculine Identity in Kevin Smith's New Jersey Trilogy",
    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n           There's a moment in Chasing Amy (Kevin Smith, US, 1997) when the character Banky Edwards defends his masculinity. He and childhood friend Holden McNeil are artists who work on a comic named Bluntman and Chronic; Holden produces the pencil drawings which Banky inks over and colours in. When confronted with the suggestion that all he does is tracing, Banky first defends himself, and then resorts to physical and verbal violence: \"I'LL TRACE A CHALK LINE AROUND YOUR DEAD FUCKING BODY, YOU FUCK ... YOUR MOTHER'S A TRACER!\" (Smith 182, 184). Banky is defending the work that he does, the art, from charges that it is an infantile activity, and the violence he engages in is the kind of behaviour associated with masculinity in general and groups of young single men in particular, who \"usually [have] a delinquent character, including a penchant for gratuitous violence\" (Remy 45). \n          Kevin Smith's first three films, Clerks (1994), Mallrats (1995) and Chasing Amy, formed a loose sequence known as the New Jersey Trilogy, with each focussing on the relationship between a sensitive male and his girlfriend. The relationship is threatened by interaction with the male's crude best friend. The films appear to be romantic comedies, a genre whose usual narrative trajectory is a series of barriers to social union in the form of marriage; however, aside from the studio-backed Mallrats, Smith's films resist the closure typical of his chosen genre. In Clerks and Mallrats the relationship is threatened by a lack of college aspirations, which would lead to a job which could support a nuclear family. Smith is depicting members of the slacker generation(popularised if not coined by Richard Linklater's film) or Generation-X (a term of earlier origin but used by Douglas Coupland's 1991 novel), who would not immediately be associated with work. However, here the lack of a solid job seems to be a cause for angst rather than for a liberation from the tyranny of full-time employment, and on closer inspection the characters' sense of self-worth is tied to their relation to the realm of work. \n          Despite consciousness raising by feminists, it has been argued that the heterosexual male is still expected be \"the strong rock, the sexual performer, expected to always cope, not to collapse, expected to be chivalrous, to mend fuses and flat tyres, to make the moves in courtship, expected not to be passive or weepy or frightened, expected to go to war and be killed, or be prepared to kill others\" (Horrocks 143). The man without work is cast adrift, still in search of an identity. Banky's work is clearly linked to his sense of self-identity, otherwise he would not feel the need to defend it. \n          The sorts of pressure put upon the male characters by their girlfriends, especially in Clerks and Mallrats, are echoed in anecdotal research conducted by Michael Lee Cohen, a twenty-something who felt that there was more to his generation then simply drop outs from society. He argued that, although the generation which reached its twenties in the mid to late 1980s and early 1990s is popularly thought of as a \"dis-generation\": \"disenchanted, disenfranchised, disgruntled, disconnected, and disatisfied\" (Cohen 3) as well as \"disillusioned ... and frighteningly distrustful\" (295), the truth was more complex. One interviewee described the pressure upon him as \"Do well in school, do what the teachers say, get good grades, get out, get a boss, do what your boss says. And after thirty years you'll be a boss, and you'll be able to have kids and a car and a house and a lawn mower, and you'll die with an insurance policy that will provide for your kids' college education or their kids' or whatever\" (224). This is equated by Cohen with the American Dream, an ideology which espouses concepts of freedom, both of movement and speech, of social mobility (upwards) and of second chances, but which can be boiled down to the need to consume disguised as the freedom to consume. \n          To become a man is to enter into an order of consumption barely paid for by work. In his interviews, Cohen noted that few associated the American Dream with social justice, freedom or opportunity, but instead cited variations upon the materialistic \"husband, wife, and a decimaled number of kids living in a nice house with a picket fence, two cars, and maybe a couple of dogs\" (290). There remains the aspiration to the bourgeois nuclear family, despite this generation's experience of broken families. The males (and presumably females) are, to paraphrase Tyler Durden from Fight Club, a generation of males raised by women. Given their absent father, they are much less likely to have seen males acting as primary bread winners - especially when they have brought up by women, many of whom have had to work themselves. Furthermore the boom-bust cycle of economics over the last two decades and the explosion of commodity fetishism fed by ever increasing exposure to advertising produces a generation which aspires to owning material goods, but which often despairs of gaining employment which will pay for that consumerism. \n          The New Jersey Trilogy focusses on members of just such uncertain men, men who are moving from the homosocial or fratriarchal bonds formed during school to the world of work and the pressure for a heterosexual bond. Fathers are absent from Smith's work, aside from Jared Svenning in Mallrats. (There are, on the other hand, mothers mentioned if not seen. An Oedipal analysis of Smith's characters would perhaps prove fruitful.) The sequence features men with no discernible job (Mallrats), dead end jobs (Clerks) and apparent dream jobs (Chasing Amy). Drawing comics for a living would appear to be a dream come true, but it has the unfortunate side effect of transforming leisure into work. \n          Clearly work is not the only theme to be traced in the trilogy: the cases of fratriarchal bonds are illuminating for notions of masculinity, and I hope to publish my work on this elsewhere. Equally, despite the focus on male characters and their desire, the narrative comedicly undercuts masculinity in favour of the female characters, offering the space for a feminist interpretation. Smith is also concerned with depictions of race and homosexuality, and indeed of religious, particularly Catholic, belief. In the brief space available to me here I can only examine the theme of work. \n          In Mallrats T S Quint and Brody Bruce go to the mall, not to shop, but to get away from their problems with respective girlfriends. T S is a student enmired in the ideological pressure of his heterosexual relationship. In contrast Brody has not got the kind of college ambitions that his girlfriend wishes him to have and still lives with his mother. Further, he has no visible means of support and seems unlikely to gain a job which will allow him to partake in the Dream. In addition, he and T S resist the work of consumerism, by window shopping rather than purchasing goods. This leads them into conflict with Shannon Hamilton, the manager of Fashionable Male, who hates mallrats for their lack of shopping agenda (cf. Fiske et al. and Fiske). With the addition of capital, the leisure time displayed in Mallrats could easily be transformed into work time. \n          Whilst resisting being transformed into consumers, Brody and T S's winning back of their girlfriends (effectively as prizes in a tv quiz show) does place them within a bourgeois social order. Brody is rewarded with a career as a television host; given that this is on American television, it is likely that his work is in fact to deliver audiences to commercial breaks to provide the broadcaster's revenue (see Jhally). \n          The central characters in Clerks work at neighbouring stores: Randal at a video rental store and Dante in a convenience store. Like Brody, Dante is expected to harbour college ambitions which would lift him out of this hell (his name is significant, and the script mentions that he has a copy of Inferno on his shelves [Smith 3]). Given their appearances in Clerks: The Animated Series (2000) and the cameos in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001) it seems unlikely that they are going to escape from these jobs - which after all would only ultimately substitute one job for another. \n          The despair Dante feels in his work defines his character. As a retailer, he is stuck in a node between goods and consumer, within sight of the items which are part of the home but perhaps unable to afford them. Furthermore he is held responsible for the goods' inability to grant the pleasure which consumption always promises: whether it be cigarettes or pornography. \n          His friend Randall, despite being surrounded by videos at his place of work, will drive to another video store to rent his own: \"I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie\" (97). In this way Randal can at least make some attempt to maintain the distinction between work and leisure, whereas Dante brings his Saturday hockey game to work and plays it on the roof of the convenience store. \n          Finally, in this brief survey, in Chasing Amy Holden and Banky have managed to escape their family homes and have carved out a bachelor life together, having turned their comics hobby into a business. What borders on an art form is implicated in economics, especially when it is revealed that likeness rights need to be paid to the originals of their Bluntman and Chronic characters, Jay and Silent Bob. Especially when compared to the other comic producers - the black and gay Hooper and the lesbian Alyssa Jones - the duo are highly successful, having both a comfortable income and fratriarchal bonds. However two things destroy the friendship: Banky's desire to to sell the rights to an animated cartoon version of their creation and Holden's on-off relationship with Alyssa. \n          In a seemingly calculated rejection of the romantic comedy framework, Smith has Holden fall out with his friend and fail to win the girl. Holden retreats from economic success, killing off the creation, preferring to produce a more personal, self-financed comic, Chasing Amy, an account of his affair with Alyssa. This appears to be a step away from being exploited, as he appropriates the means of production, but just as the bourgeoise family is constructed to support capitalism and requires the individual to work, so his stepping away from capitalism removes him from the bourgeois order of the family. \n          In the New Jersey trilogy Smith depicts representatives of generation-X, who nevertheless relate to different kinds of work. Selling goods is obviously work, but it should also be clear that leisure is work by other means. Even in the moments when characters attempt to escape from the breadwinning that used to be central to masculinity, the results still define their character. Work still defines a male character's sense of identity and his position within the social order. \n          \n          References\n          \nCohen, Michael Lee.

    "abstract": "\n      \n\n        Wife (1975) is a novel ostensibly about immigration, but it is also about gender, ethnicity, and power. Bharati Mukherjee's well-known essay, \"An Invisible Woman\" (1981), describes her experience in Canada as one that created \"double vision\" because her self-perception was put so utterly at odds with her social standing (39). She experienced intense and horrifying racism in Canada, particularly in Toronto, and claims that the setting of Wife, her third novel, is \"in the mind of the heroine...always Toronto\" (39). Mukherjee concludes the article by saying that she eventually left Toronto, and Canada, because she was unable to keep her \"twin halves\" together (40). In thinking about \"mixing,\" Mukherjee’s work provides entry points into \"mixed\" or interlocking structures of domination; the diasporic female subject in Mukherjee’s Wife struggles to translate this powerful \"mix\" in her attempt to move across and within national borders, feminisms, and cultural difference. \"An Invisible Woman\", in many ways, illuminates the issues that are at stake in Mukherjee's Wife. The protagonist Dimple Dagsputa, like Mukherjee, experiences identity crisis through the cultural forces that powerfully shape her self-perception and deny her access to control of her own life. I want to argue that Wife is also about Dimple's ability to grasp at power through the connections that she establishes between her mind and body, despite the social forces that attempt to divide her. Through a discussion of Dimple's negotiations with Western feminisms and the methods by which she attempts to reclaim her commodified body, I will rethink Dimple's violent response as an act of agency and resistance. \n        Diasporic Feminisms: Locating the Subject(s):\n        Mukherjee locates Wife in two very different geographic settings: the dusty suburbs of Calcutta and the metropolis of New York City. Dimple’s experience as a diasporic subject, one who must relocate and find a new social/cultural space, is highly problematic. Mukherjee uses this diasporic position to bring Dimple’s ongoing identity formation into relief. As she crosses into the space of New York City, Dimple must negotiate the web created by gender, class, and race in her Bengali culture with an increasingly multiple grid of inseparable subject positions. Avtar Brah points out that diaspora is useful as a \"conceptual grid\" where \"multiple subject positions are juxtaposed, contested, proclaimed or disavowed\" (208). Brah points to experience as the site of subject formation; a discursive space where different subject positions are inscribed, repeated, or contested. For Brah, and for Mukherjee, it is essential to ask what the \"fields of signification and representation\" are that contribute to the formation of differing subjects (116). Dimple’s commodification and her submission to naming in the Bengali context are challenged when she encounters Western feminisms. Yet Mukherjee suggests that these feminisms do little to \"liberate\" Dimple, and in fact serve as another aspect of her oppression. Wife is concerned with the processes which lead up to Dimple’s final act of murder; the interlocking subject positions which she negotiates with in an attempt to control her own life.\n        Dimple believes that the freedom offered by immigration will give her a new identity: \"She did not want to carry any relics from her old life; given another chance she could be a more exciting person, take evening classes perhaps, become a librarian\" (42). She is extremely optimistic about the opportunities of her new life, but Mukherjee does not valourize the New World over the Old. In fact, she continually demonstrates the limited spaces that are offered on both sides of the globe. In New York, Dimple faces the unresolved dilemma between her desire to be a traditional Indian wife and the lure of Western feminism. Her inability to find a liveable place within the crossings of these positions contributes to her ultimate act of violence.\n        At her first party in Manhattan, Dimple encounters the diaspora of Indian and Pakistani immigrants who provide varying examples of the ways in which being \"Indian\" is in conversation with being \"American.\" She hears about Ina Mullick, the Bengali wife whose careless husband has allowed her to become \"more American than the Americans\" (68). Dimple quickly learns that Amit is sharply disapproving of women who go to college, wear pants, and smoke cigarettes: \"with so many Indians around and a television and a child, a woman shouldn’t have time to get any crazy ideas\" (69). The options of education and employment are removed from Dimple’s grasp as soon as she begins to consider them, leaving her wondering what her new role in this place will be.\n        Mukherjee inserts Ina Mullick into Dimple’s life as a challenge to the restrictions of traditional wifehood: \"Well Dimple...what do you do all day? You must be bored out of your skull\" (76). Ina has adopted what Jyoti calls \"women’s lib stuff\" and Dimple is warned of her \"dangerous\" influence (76). Ina engagement with Western feminisms is a form of resistance to the confines of traditional Bengali wifehood. Mukherjee, however, uses Ina’s character to demonstrate the misfit between Western and Third World feminisms. Although the oppressions experienced in both geographies appear to be similar, Mukherjee points out that neither Ina nor Dimple can find expression through a feminism that forces them to abandon their Indianess. Western feminist discourse has been much maligned for its Eurocentric construction of a monolithic Third World subject that ignores cultural complexity. Chandra Talpade Mohanty’s \"Under Western Eyes\" (1988) is the classic example of the interrogation of this construction. Mohanty argues that \"ethnocentric universality\" obliterates the differences within the varied category of female (197), and that \"Western feminist writings on women in the third world subscribe to a variety of methodologies to demonstrate the universal cross-cultural operation of male dominance and female exploitation\" (208-209). Mukherjee addresses these problems through Ina’s struggle; Western feminisms and their apparent \"liberation\" fail to provide Ina with a satisfying sense of self. Ina remains oppressed because these forms of feminism cannot adequately deal with the web of cultural and social crossings that constitute her position as simultaneously \"Indian\" and \"American.\" The patriarchy that Ina and Dimple experience is not simply that of the industrialized first world; they must also grapple with the ways in which they have been named by their own specific cultural context. Mohanty argues that there is no homogenous group called \"women,\" and Mukherjee seems to agree by demonstrating that women's subject positions are varied and multi-layered. \n        Ina’s apparently comfortable assimilation is soon upset by desperate confessions of her unease and depression. She contrasts her \"before\" and \"after\" self in caricatures of a woman in a sari and a woman in a bikini. These drawings represent, \"the great moral and physical change, and all that\" (95). Mukherjee suggests, however, that the change has been less than satisfactory for Ina, \"‘I think it is better to stay a Before, if you can’...’Our trouble here is that we imitate badly, and we preserve things even worse’\" (95). Ina’s confession alludes to her belief that she is copying, rather than actually living, a life which might be empowering. She has been forced to give up the \"before\" because it clashes with the ideal that she has constructed of the liberated Western woman. In accepting the oppositions between East and West, Ina pre-empts the possibility of being both. \n        Though Dimple is fascinated by the options that Ina represents, and begins to question her own happiness, she becomes increasingly uncomfortable with the absolutes that Ina insists upon. Ina’s feminist friends frighten Dimple because of their inability to understand her; they come to represent a part of the American landscape that Dimple has come to fear through her mediated experience of American culture through the television and lifestyle magazines. Leni Anspach’s naked gums, \"horribly pink and shiny, like secret lips, only more lecherous and lethal, set themselves up as enemies of decent, parsimonious living\" (152). Leni’s discourse threatens to obliterate any knowledge that Dimple has of herself and her only resistance to this is an ironic reversal of her subservient role: \"After Leni removed her cup Dimple kept on pouring, over the rim of Leni’s cup, over the tray and the floating dentures till the pregnant-bellied tea pot was emptied\" (152). Dimple’s response to the lack of accommodation that Western feminism presents is tied to her feeling that Ina and Leni live with unforgiving extremes: \"that was the trouble with people like Leni and Ina who believed in frankness, happiness and freedom; they lacked tolerance, and they abhorred discussions about the weather\" (161). Like Amit, Ina offers a space through her example where Dimple cannot easily learn to negotiate her options.\n        The dynamic between these women is ultimately explosive. Ina cannot accept Dimple’s choices and Dimple is forced to simplify herself in a defence that protects her from predatory Western feminisms:\n        \n          I can’t keep up with you people. I haven’t read the same kinds of books or anything. You know what I mean Ina, don’t you? I just like to cook and watch TV and embroider’...’Bravo!’ cried Ina Mullick from the sofa where she was sitting cross legged. ‘And what else does our little housewife do? ‘You’re making fun of me,’ Dimple screamed. ‘Who do you think you are?’ (169-170.\n          \n        Dimple lacks the ability to articulate her oppression; Ina Mullick can articulate it but cannot move outside of it. Both women feel anger, depression, and helplessness, but they fail to connect and help one another. Mukherjee demonstrates that women from the Third World, specifically those who come into contact with the diaspora, are not homogenous subjects; her various representations of negotiation with processes of identity constitution show how different knowledges of self are internalized and acted out. \n        Irene Gedalof’s recent work on bringing Indian and Western feminisms into conversation proceeds from the Foucauldian notion that these multiple discursive systems must prevail over the study of woman or women within a single (and limiting) symbolic order (26). The postcolonial condition of diaspora, Gedalof and other critics have pointed out, is an interesting position from which to begin talking about these complex processes of identity making since it breaks down the oppositions of South and North, East and West. In crossing the South/North and East/West divide, Dimple does not abandon her Indian subject position, but rather attempts to keep it intact as other social forces are presented. The opposition between Ina and Dimple, however, is dissolved by the flux that the symbol \"woman\" experiences. This process emphasizes differences within and between their experiences in a non-hierarchical way. \n        Rethinking the Mind/Body Dichotomy: Dimple’s Response\n        This section will attempt to show how Dimple’s response to her options is far more complex than the mind/body dichotomy that it appears to be upon superficial examination. Dimple’s body does not murder in an act of senseless violence that is divorced from her mental perception of the world. I want to rethink interpretations like the one offered by Emmanuel S. Nelson: \"Wife describes a weak-minded Bengali woman [whose]...sensibilities become so confounded by her changing cultural roles, the insidious television factitiousness, and the tensions of feminism that, ironically, she goes mad and kill her husband\" (54-55). Although her sense of reality and fantasy become blurred, Dimple acts in accordance with the few choices that remain open to her. In slowly guiding us toward Dimple’s horrifying act of violence, Mukherjee attempts to examine the social and cultural networks which condition her response. The absolutes of Western feminisms offer little space for resistance. Dimple, however, is not a victim of her circumstances. She reclaims her body as a site of inscription and commodification through methods of resistance which are inaccessible to Amit or her larger social contexts: abortion, vomiting, fantasies of mutilating her physical self, and, ultimately, through using her body as a tool, rather than an object, of violence. These actions are responses to her own lack of power over self representation; Dimple creates a private world in which she can resist the ways her body has been encoded and the ways in which she has been constructed as a divided object.\n        In her work on the body in feminist discourse, Elizabeth Grosz argues that postructuralist feminists such as Luce Irigaray, Helene Cixous, and Judith Butler conceptualize female bodies as: \"crucial to understanding women’s psychical and social existence, but the body is no longer understood as an ahistorical, biologically given, acultural object. They are concerned with the lived body, the body insofar as it is represented and used in specific ways in particular cultures\" (Grosz 18). In emphasizing difference within the sexes, these postructuralist thinkers reject the Cartesian dualism of mind and body and do much for Chandra Talpade Mohanty’s project of considering the ways in which \"woman\" is a heterogenously constructed and shifting category. Mukherjee presents Dimple’s body as a \"social body\": a \"social and discursive object, a body bound up in the order of desire, signification and power\" (Grosz 18-19). Dimple cannot control, for example, Amit’s desire to impregnate her, to impose a schema of patriarchal reproduction on her body. Yet, as I will demonstrate, Dimple resists in ways that she cannot articulate but she is strongly aware that controlling the mappings of her body gives her some kind of power.\n        This novel demonstrates how the dualisms of patriarchal discourse operate, but I want to read Dimple’s response as a reclaiming of the uncontrollable body; her power is exercised through what Deleuze and Guattari would call the \"rhizomatic\" connections between her body and mind. Their book, A Thousand Plateaus (1980), provides a miscellany of theory which, \"flattens out the relations between the social and the psychical,\" and privileges neither (Grosz 180). Deleuze and Guattari favour maps and rhizomes as conceptual models, so that all things are open, connectable, and subject to constant modification (12). I want to think of Dimple as an assemblage, a rhizomatic structure that increases in the dimensions of a multiplicity that changes as it expands its connections (8). She is able to resist precisely because her body and mind are inseparable and fluid entities. Her violence toward Amit is a bodily act but it cannot be read in isolation; Mukherjee insists that we also understand the mental processes that preface this act.\n        Dimple’s vomit is one of the most powerful tropes in the novel. It is a rejection and a resistance; it is a means of control while paradoxically suggesting a lack of control. Julia Kristeva is concerned with bodily fluids (blood, vomit, saliva, tears, seminal fluid) as \"abjections\" which necessarily, \"partake of both polarized terms [subject/object, inside/outside] but cannot be clearly identified with either\" (Grosz 192). Vomiting, then, is the first act that Dimple uses as a means of connecting the mind and body that she has been taught to know only separately. Vomiting is an abjection that signifies Dimple's rhizomatic fluidity; it is the open and changeable path that denies the split between her mind and her body that her social experiences attempt to enforce. Mukherjee devotes large sections of the narrative to this act, bringing the reader into a private space where one is forced to see, smell, and taste Dimple’s defiance. She initially discovers her ability to control her vomit when she is pregnant. At first it is an involuntary act, but she soon takes charge of her body’s rejections: \n        \n          The vomit fascinated her. It was hers; she was locked in the bathroom expelling brownish liquid from her body...In her arrogance, she thrust her fingers deep inside her mouth, once jabbing a squishy organ she supposed was her tonsil, and drew her finger in and out in smooth hard strokes until she collapsed with vomiting (31)\n          \n        Dimple’s vomiting does contain an element of pathos which is somewhat problematic; one might read her only as a victim because her pathetic grasp at power is reduced to the pride she feels in her bodily expulsions. Mukherjee’s text, however, begs the reader to read Dimple carefully. Dimple acts through her body, often with horrible consequences, but she is resisting in the only way that she is able.\n        In New York, as Dimple encounters an increasingly complicated sociocultural matrix, she fights to find a space between her role as a loyal Indian wife and the apparent temptations of the United States. Ina Mullick’s Western feminism asks her to abandon her Bengali self, and Amit asks her to retain it. In the face of these absolutes, Dimple continues to attempt her resistance through her body, but it is often weak and ineffectual: \"But instead of the great gush Dimple had hoped for, only a thin trickle was expelled. It gravitated toward the drain, a small slimy pool full of bubbles. She was ashamed of it; it seemed more impersonal than a cooking stain\" (150). Mukherjee asks us to read Dimple through her abjections--through both mind and body (not entirely distinct entities for Mukherjee)--in order to understand the murder. We must gauge Dimple's actions through the open and connectable relationships of body and mind. Her inability to vomit \"pleasurably\" signifies a growing inability to locate a space that is tolerable. Vomiting becomes a way for Dimple to tie her multiple subject positions together: \"Vomiting could be pleasurable; thinking of all the bathrooms she had vomited in she felt nostalgic, almost middle-aged\" (149). This moment at the kitchen sink occurs when Leni and Ina have fractured her sense of a stable Indian identity. In an interview, Mukherjee admits that Dimple’s movement to the United States means that she begins to ask questions about her oppression; she begins to ask herself questions about her own happiness (Hancock 44). These questions, coupled with Leni and Ina’s challenging presence, leads to Dimple to desire a reconnection and a sense of control.\n        Undoubtedly, Dimple’s act of murder is misguided, but Mukherjee sensitively demonstrates that Dimple has very little choice left. Dimple does not simply break down into a body and mind that are unaware of their connections, rather she begins to operate on several levels of consciousness. Shen Mei Ma interprets Dimple’s condition as schizophrenic, and explores this as a prominent trope in Asian diaspora literatures. She uses R.D. Laing’s classic explanation of schizophrenia as a working definition:\n        \n          The term schizoid refers to an individual the totality of whose experience is split in two main ways: in the first place, there is a rent in his relation with his world, and, in the second, there is a disruption of his relation with himself...Moreover, he does not experience himself as a complete person but rather as ‘split’ in various ways, perhaps a mind more or less tenuously linked to a body, as two or more selves, and so on (Ma 43)\n          \n        Ma analyses this condition (which can be seen, like gender and race, as a socially constructed state of being), as a \"defense mechanism\" against an unbearable world; the separation in space and memory that the diasporic subject experiences results in a schizophrenic, or divisive, tendency. I agree with Ma's use of Laing's definition of schizophrenia in the sense that this understanding is certainly more useful than Emmanuel Nelson's insistence on Dimple's \"madness.\" Reading Dimple's response with an interest in Deleuze and Guattari's conceptual rhizomes, however, leads me to resist using a definition that is linked to mental illness. This may be a prominent trope in Asian diaspora literature, but it is also necessary, and perhaps more useful, to recognize that Dimple's act of violence and her debatable \"madness\" are ultimately less important than reading her negotiation as a means of survival and her response as an act of resistance. \n        Many critics interpret the final act of murder as \"an ironic twist of Sati, the traditional self-immolation of an Indian wife on the funeral pyre of her husband\" (Ma 58). This suggestion draws up Dimple’s teenage desire to be like Sita, \"the ideal wife of Hindu legends\" who walks through fire for her husband (6). The violence perpetrated against women who naturalize Sita’s tradition is wrenched into an act in which Dimple is able to exercise some control over her fate. The act of murder is woven with the alternate text of industrial/commercial culture in a way that demonstrates Dimple’s desperate negotiation with the options available to her:\n        \n          The knife stabbed the magical circle once, twice, seven times, each time a little harder, until the milk in the bowl of cereal was a pretty pink and the flakes were mushy and would have embarrassed any advertiser, and then she saw the head fall off - but of course it was her imagination because she was not sure anymore what she had seen on TV and what she had seen in the private screen of three A.M. (212-213)\n          \n        The tragedy of this conclusion surely lies in the events that are left unsaid: what is Dimple’s fate and how will society deal with her violent choice? Ma’s article on schizophrenia points to the most likely outcome--Dimple will be declared insane and \"treated\" for her illness. Yet my reading of this act has attempted to access a careful understanding of how Dimple is constructed and how this can contribute to rethinking her violent response. Dimple's mind is not an insane one; her body is not an uncontrollable, hysterical one. Murder is a choice for Dimple--albeit a choice that is exercised in a limited and oppressive space.\n        \"Mixing\" is an urgent topic; as globalization and capitalist homogenization make the theorization of diaspora increasingly necessary, it is essential to consider how gendered and raced subject positions are constituted and how they are reproduced within and across geographies. This novel is important because it forces the reader to ask the difficult questions about \"mixing\" that precede Dimple’s act of spousal violence. I have attempted to address these questions in my discussion of Dimple’s negotiations and her resistance. Much has been written about this novel in terms of Dimple’s \"split,\" but very few critics have tried to examine Dimple’s character in ways that penetrate our limited third person access to her. Mukherjee’s own writing in \"An Invisible Woman\" suggests the urgency of rethinking characters like Dimple and the particular complexities of immigration for non-English speaking housewives. Mukherjee’s relative position of privilege has given her access to far more choices than Dimple has, but notably, she avoids turning Dimple’s often suicidal violence inward. Instead, Mukherjee shows how the inward is inescapable from the outward: in murdering Amit, the violence Dimple perpetrates is, after all, a rearticulation of the violence from which her limited subject position cannot completely escape. \n        Footnote:\n        In thinking about Dimple's response, it is important to note that, of course, her actions and her words are always conditioned by the position that she has naturalized. Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\"(1988) argues that the subaltern subject cannot \"speak\" because no act of resistance occurs that can be separated from the dominant discourse that provides the language and the conceptual categories with which the subaltern voice speaks (Ashcroft et al 1998 217-218).The violence of Dimple's response must be seen as an ironic subversion of a television world that enforces patriarchal norms.\n          \n        References \n        \n Ashcroft, Bill, Gareth Griffiths and Helen Tiffin.

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n           People generally assume that memory is a personal experience which requires little to no work. It just happens. We believe that as human beings we are simply able to recall the past within our own minds. Social memory is actually a public and interactive process requiring ongoing cultural memory-work. Furthermore, the mass media situate cultural recall as largely exterior to the individual. Social beings often engage in cultural work that they are not fully conscious of: memory-work is a site of semi-unconscious labour. \n          Collective memory is a necessary part of social life because it is through memory of the past that humans are able to situate themselves in the present. We all understand our surroundings and make sense of our place within the present-moment, by contextualising the present in relation to the past. Memory's relationship with time is very unusual as memory is an action that necessarily occurs in the present, yet it must always refer to the past. Having a repository of memory to draw from requires active labour because memory exists through the act of remembering. In other words, remembering is an activity that occurs on various levels of consciousness and presumes a baseline or collection of stored memory available for recall. Accordingly, I present mass remembering as the unconscious work necessary for the maintenance of social memory. In this piece I explore the specific form of memory-work within the mass-mediated realm of popular and commercial culture. \n          Collective memory is the result of a dynamic process whereby groups come to have a shared mixed-medium narrative of social history. Collective memory requires ongoing cultural practices of remembrance which are the foundation of memory-work. The end products of these cultural practices are popular historical representations that are then mass distributed and subsequently internalised by groups of individuals and a cultural memory is created. In the age of the mass media, memory-work centres on the reproduction, distribution and consumption of mass-mediated representations. Memory-work thus involves memory-workers in commercial culture. As the production of a collective historical memory is a necessary orienting component of any society, historically specific memory systems develop in order to accommodate this need. There are two types of memory-workers who must necessarily work together within the modern system in order to secure and maintain a collective vision of the past: producers and consumers. \n          Producers within late modernity construct textual, visual, and audio-visual representations of the past that circulate in popular culture. By the twentieth century most of these commemorative practices began to create image-based representations (Hutton 4). These cultural products embody a historically specific vision of social history. Common examples of such products include newspaper accounts of world events and commercial films with historical themes (such as the assassination of JFK or the sinking of Titanic). The production of these rememberings constitutes the conscious aspect of memory-work. Producers represent the numerical minority in the construction of mass mediated collective memory yet they are simultaneously the elite holders of social power within this form of knowledge construction. This is especially important when examining historical representations of those frequently marginalised along lines of gender, race and class within processes of creating social knowledge. \n          Consumers participate in the maintenance of collective memory by engaging in the consumption of popular historical representations. This modern method of remembering, which is the unconscious work behind memory, generally occurs during leisure time within capitalist commercial culture. Going to the movies or watching television are common leisure time activities that involve the absorption of cultural products which embody historical representations. Collective memory is then a site where the work and leisure realms are blurred. While consumers of popular culture are consciously engaging in recreational activities they are simultaneously participating in memory-work and the incorporation of historical narratives into their memories. \n          \n            \"For some populations at some times, commercialised leisure is history a repository of collective memory that places immediate experience in the context of change over time.\" (Lipsitz 15) \n          \nThis phenomenon increases in relation to the growth of commercial culture and technologically driven image-based representations and is therefore at all-time high in the twenty-first century. \n          The consumption of social historical memory has not traditionally occurred in the realm of leisure. From the fifth century B.C. through the eighteenth century, Western cultures produced and consumed collective memory with the aid of mnemonists who worked in mnemonic theaters (Hutton 27-30). When people attended the mnemonist's theater it was for the explicit purpose of acquiring refined collective memory. Oral cultures relayed narratives of social memory through personal and communal storytelling. Similar to mnemonic theaters, receivers of these stories were cognisant that they were participating in the transmission of social memory. It was not until the advent of print culture, and eventually the audio-visual mass media, that people began to consume social historical memory during recreational activities. This has made memory-work wholly pervasive yet largely invisible. \n          The nature of collective memory and memory-work has also drastically changed with the coming of the mass media. Citizens of the virtual community are able to remember people, places, and events of which they have no personal experience. This not only transforms the experience of time and space, but also the process of memory-work. \n          \n            \"Time, history, and memory become qualitatively different concepts in a world where electronic mass communication is possible. Instead of relating to the past through a shared sense of place or ancestry, consumers of electronic mass media can experience a common heritage with people they have never seen; they can acquire memories of a past to which they have no geographic or biological connection.\" (Lipsitz 5) \n          \nSocial historical memory is then experienced as disembodied and fragmented in the age of the mass media. Additionally, memory-work no longer occurs between small groups of individuals involved in intimate communication, but it is placed exterior to the individual through a proliferation of flowing representations (Hutton 21). \n          With the placement of memory as exterior to individuals, producers of social memory must engage virtual citizens in memory consumption in order to keep the modern memory system in balance. Memory-workers engage members of consumer culture in remembrance (Irwin-Zarecka 151), which in turn transforms them into silent memory-workers. In order to achieve this end the material to be embedded in cultural rememberings is selected based on its commercial value (Irwin-Zarecka 169). For this reason social memory is (re)constructed to blend in with the prevailing world view. It is simply easier to sell cultural visions that dominant groups already believe to be true. This helps us to understand for example the repeated proliferation of conventional gendered images of social history. Challenging traditional histories through the construction of resistive representations threatens the commercial success of social memory embedded in popular commercial products. Citing the expansion of women on television Lipsitz asserts that the electronic mass media \"privilege forms of communication emanating from aggrieved and marginal communities\" (14). I could not disagree more strongly. This analysis does not account for the commercial dependence of accepted forms of memory or the exclusion of women and other marginalised persons from positions of authority within the mass media. \n          The production of social memory within the corporate mass media has exteriorised memory through the construction of historical imagery. Likewise, the media retains control over both the form and content of the material immortalised in news and film. These historical transformations in collective memory have created a mass of memory-workers who unconsciously labour for the maintenance of memory during their leisure time. This phenomenon clearly changes the dissemination of historical memory but it also broadens the definition of memory-work to include unconscious labour on the part of all members of the virtual community. Under this conceptualisation we can envision a two-class labour force consisting of the elite members of the mass media and the majority of memory-labourers, consumers. \n          \n          References\n          \nHutton, Patrick H.

    "title": "An ANTaR Opinion about \"Sorry\" Reconciliation and the Public Debate",
    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n          To my mind the word sorry is important as a national symbol  a symbol that addresses the dispossession and cultural damage caused to the Stolen Generation by past governments. This apology is important on a number of levels  because it is a recognition of past wrongs, a recognition that our present society is a beneficiary of these wrongs and a recognition that those wrongs have tangible and extensive effect on Indigenous people today. When it is provided by individuals, I dont believe it should be confused with an admission of personal responsibility. It more closely resembles an expression of sympathy or empathy. \n          I think the symbolism of a national apology is an important tool in influencing the national consciousness and preserving the moral integrity of this nation. In saying this, however, the significance of a national apology only extends this far. Such a symbol is an initial step. An apology is the starting point from which real change can occur.\n          I believe in comprehensive social change, and this position is reflected in the organisation to which I belong  Australians for Native Title and Reconciliation (ANTaR). ANTaR began in 1997 as a response to John Howards Ten Point Plan and at the request of the National Indigenous Working Group (NIWG) for a non-Indigenous support group. The National ANTaR body consults a number of prominent Indigenous leaders, including such inspirational individuals as Pat Dodson and the elected ATSIC Chair Geoff Clarke. \n          The Ten Point Plan was the Liberal Governments response to new native title developments brought by the High Courts Wik decision in 1996. In our initial project we gathered 100,000 signatures protesting the existence of the Ten Point Plan and its ramifications upon the concept of native title. It became Australias largest public art installation  the Sea of Hands. In the Sea of Hands each of those original signatures was attached to a plastic hand and displayed en masse in public parks and venues. The Sea of Hands has toured Australia and made appearances in most major cities and in places such as Alice Springs, the Gold Coast and Cherbourg. \n          We aspire to bring Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities together. We believe this can only be done where there is an environment of communication and respect. Our definition of reconciliation lies beyond symbolic rhetoric. We wish not only for a substantive change in the opinions of mainstream society but for the effects of this to impact upon the daily lives of Indigenous people. This includes not only the improvement of health, education and social welfare but also involves cementing in Australian law the human rights and legal rights to which Indigenous peoples have a legitimate right.\n          I support a national apology and the reconciliation campaign on the basis that it is a first step towards changing mainstream society and providing the dignity and respect Indigenous peoples deserve. I support practical reconciliation on the basis that adequate living standards are something that all Australians should expect. I support land rights, the concept of a treaty and the concept of Aboriginal sovereignty because these are just legal rights and because they are reinforced by international and British colonial law. \n          What I fear most in the ongoing public debate is that these issues, which have overriding importance to the future of Indigenous people and thus to the posterity and reputation of our nation, are being slowly acquired by parties who may not really have these interests at heart. One example is the concept of practical reconciliation as espoused by current Prime Minister John Howard. It was inevitable that as the national reconciliation movement gained pace we would see the politicisation of the concept. \n          John Howards position in the last few years has been to emphasise the importance of social welfare in the scope of the reconciliation debate. He has coined his approach as practical reconciliation. In an interview with Fran Kelly he said:\n          \n\"It is what I call practical reconciliation. The real problem of the indigenous in this community still remains that they are disadvantaged compared with the rest of us in things like education, health and job opportunities. And reconciliation to me is all about removing that disadvantage.\"\n          The insidious nature of this project however is only revealed when we look at the Federal Governments performance in terms of the protection of Indigenous peoples legal rights. The legal integrity of the original Ten Point Plan was criticised by legal bodies no less prestigious than the governments own legal counsel. Henry Burmester, Chief Counsel and the governments second most senior legal adviser, described crucial aspects of the legislation as racially discriminatory. It also came under attack from the Brian Harradine. \n          The UN Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) continued criticism of the new act on an international level. The government sent a delegation that included the current Minister of Aboriginal Affairs, Phillip Ruddock, to the March 2000 meeting in Geneva in an attempt to convince it to reverse its opinion. After the CERD Committee repeated its criticism that the legislation was racially discriminatory, the Government announced a whole-of-government review of Australias participation in the treaty bodies system  an act unprecedented by any other western nation. \n          The UN Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) continued criticism of the new act on an international level.

I would suggest to the many ordinary Australians out there in the community who are committed to a reconciled vision of this country that they remain aware that their moral cause is also a political game and that they seek to be critical when listening to those in power.   \n\n        \n      \n    ",

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n       \n                     Despite the period's fashionable aspiration to a materialist, scientific objectivity, the new wilderness revealed by the microscope in the nineteenth century did not lend itself quickly or easily to sober, observational consensus. Rather, the nature of the microscopic world was, like the cosmos, largely open to interpretation. Since techniques of observation were largely undeveloped, many microscopists were not certain precisely what it was they were to look for, nor of the nature of their subjects. Did monstrosity lurk at the threshold, or was the microscope a window to the divine designs of the creator? Monstrosity and the microscopic may be a familiar relationship today, but prior to Pasteur and Koch's development of a germ theory of disease in the 1870s, the invisible world revealed by the microscope was not especially horrific, nor did it invalidate long-standing notions of the divinity of Nature. It is more than probable that many microorganisms were, prior to their identification as causal agents of disease, looked upon and admired as beautiful natural specimens. Certain microscopists may have suspected early on that all was not well at the microscopic level (suspicion of wilderness is traditional within the Western cartographic project), but by and large nineteenth century microscopy was deeply enmeshed in the extensive romanticism of the period, and most texts on the nature of the microorganism prior to the late nineteenth century tend to emphasise (in retrospect, a little naively), their embodiment of the amazing, wonderful complexity of the natural world.  \n          Germany was the center of this modern fusion of romanticism, naturalism, and microscopic visuality, where the prolific microgeologist, Christian Godfried Ehrenberg (1795 - 1876) achieved considerable attention through his discovery of the intricately symmetrical, skeletal remains of unknown microorganisms in the calacerous tertiaries of Sicily and Greece, and Oran in Africa. Documenting these fossils in Microgeologie (1854), he established for them the group Polycystina, in which he also included a series of forms making up nearly the whole of a silicious sandstone prevailing through an extensive district of Barbadoes. These widely admired microscopic sea-dwelling organisms were later discovered and studied in their living state by Johannes Muller, who named them Radiolaria. Ehrenberg's pursuit of natural beauty, rather than monstrosity, was clearly appealing throughout the mid-to-late nineteenth century. Central to the aesthetic evaluation of the natural world inspired by his discoveries was a privileging of symmetrical forms as divine signifiers. Drawing heavily from Ehrenberg's approach to the natural world, it had been the intention of Gideon Algernon Mantell, Vice-President of the Geological Society of London and author of The Invisible World Revealed by the Microscope (1850), to \"impart just and comprehensive views of the grandeur and harmony of the Creation, and of the Infinite Wisdom and Beneficence of its Divine Author; and which, in every condition and circumstance of life, will prove a never-failing source of pleasure and instruction\" (ix-x). \n          An admirable project indeed, but increasingly problematic in the wake of evidence suggesting the infinite wisdom and beneficence of the divine author included the scripting of destructive, ruthless, mindless, invisible agents of suffering and death against which human beings were granted little, if any, defence. What did such evidence say of our allegedly privileged role in the story of life on Earth? Where might the raw, biological body reside within such an arrangement? Precisely at the vulnerable center of the controversy surrounding the nature of its own existence. Not surprisingly, consensus on what the body actually is has always been fairly frail, since it closed its modern formation in conjunction with the revelation of the body's mysterious, \"hidden powers\" through the lens of the microscope, which radically expanded, and confused, the cartographic field. Renaissance anatomical representation, thought once to be so authoritative and thorough (maybe too thorough), now seemed superficial. And moreover, as shown by the discovery of electricity and its extensive, shockingly experimental application to the body, we were enigmatic entities indeed, consisting of, and vulnerable to, mysterious, untamed forces of attraction and repulsion. The invention of the \"Leyden jar\" in the eighteenth century, which allowed the storage and regulation of electrical charge, had been turned almost immediately to the human body, often with all the playful naivete of a child. As Sarah Bakewell (2000) writes: \n          \n            One experimenter, Jean-Antoine Nollet (1700-70), liked to demonstrate the power of the new equipment by lining up 180 of the king's guards with hands clasped and connecting the man on the end to a Leyden jar, so that the whole line leaped involuntarily into the air. (36) \n          \nThe discovery that the biological body was an electrical organism unquestionably inspired the exorbitant interest in the \"ether\" that underpinned much nineteenth century spiritualism, horror fiction, and the emergence of paranoia as a cultural condition in the modern era. Most notably, it disrupted the notion of an external God in favour of a \"divine power\" running through, and thus connecting, all life. And as psychiatry has since discovered, the relation of the body to such a deeper, all-pervasive, unmappable power - an ontology in which matter has no empty spaces - is \"profoundly schizoid\" (Anti-Oedipus 19). \n          But this did not prevent its intrusion into nineteenth century science. Biologist Ernst Haeckel (1834 - 1919), nineteenth century Germany's most vocal advocator of Darwinism, openly subscribed to a mystical, arguably delusional approach to the natural world. Drawn to study of the microscopic by Ehrenberg, Haeckel was likewise attracted to the patterned aesthetic of the natural world, especially its production of symmetrical forms. Although he drew his fair share of critics, it is unlikely he was ever considered \"sick\", since neither paranoia nor schizophrenia were recognised illnesses at the time. Yet in retrospect his writings clearly indicate a commitment to what would now be regarded as a paranoid/schizophrenic ontology in which \"matter has no empty spaces\". Haeckel's recourse to monism may be understood, at least in part, as a reaction to the agency panic provoked by the invasion narrative central to the germ theory of disease: if all is One, notions of \"invasion\" become redundant and transformed into the internalised self-regulation of the whole. Devoted to monism, Haeckel was adamant that \"ever more clearly are we compelled by reflection to recognise that God is not to be placed over against the material world as an external being, but must be placed as a \"divine power\" or \"moving spirit\" within the cosmos itself\" (Monism 15). This conception of God is synonymous with that discussed by Deleuze and Guttari in their exploration of the nervous illness of Judge Daniel Schreber, in which God is defined as the Omnitudo realitatis, from which all secondary realities are derived by a process of division (Anti-Oedipus 13). Like a textbook schizophrenic, Haeckel stressed the oneness of the cosmos, its operation under fundamental conditions of attraction and repulsion, the indissoluble connection between energy and matter, the mind and embodiment, and God and the world. His obsession with the \"secret powers\" of the Creator led him to adopt the notion of a \"cosmic ether\", which was itself almost totally dependent on contemporary research into the properties of electricity. Haeckel wrote that \"the ether itself is no longer hypothetical; its existence can at any moment be demonstrated by electrical and optical experiment\" (Monism 23). \n          Recognising the inherent conflict of nature whilst providing convincing evidence of its divine, harmonious beauty through his hundreds of spectacularly symmetrical, mandala-like representations of Radiolarians and other microscopic forms in Die Radiolarian (1862) and Kunstformen der Natur (1899), Haeckel furthered his views through several popular manifestos such as Monism as Connecting Religion and Science: The Confession of Faith of a Man of Science (1894), The Wonders of Life: A Popular Study of Biological Philosophy (1905), and The Riddle of the Universe at the Close of the Nineteenth Century (1911). For Haeckel, clearly entranced by the hypersignificance of nature, the struggle for biological survival was also a mystical one, and thus divinely inspired. Tying this notion together with the Volkish tradition, and clearly influenced by the emerging germ theory, which emphasised conflict as precondition for (apparently mythic) harmony, Haeckel wrote that: \n          \n            We now know that the whole of organic nature on our planet exists only by a relentless war of all against all. Thousands of animals and plants must daily perish in every part of the earth, in order that a few chosen individuals may continue to subsist and to enjoy life. But even the existence of these favoured few is a continual conflict with threatening dangers of every kind. Thousands of hopeful germs perish uselessly every minute. The raging war of interests in human society is only a feeble picture of the unceasing and terrible war of existence which reigns throughout the whole of the living world. The beautiful dream of God's goodness and wisdom in nature, to which as children we listened so devoutly fifty years ago, no longer finds credit now - at least among educated people who think. It has disappeared before our deeper acquaintance with the mutual relations of organisms, the advancement of ecology and sociology, and our knowledge of parasite life and pathology. (Monism 73-74). \n          \nThe \"war of existence\", according to Haeckel, was ultimately an expression of the ethereal power of an omnipresent God. Denying real difference between matter and energy, he also implicitly denied the agency of the subject, instead positing the war of existence as a self-regulating flow of divine power. Biological survival was thus synonymous with the triumph of divine embodiment. Since Haeckel was resolutely convinced that nature was hierarchically structured (with the Aryan Volk fairly close to the top), so too were its expressions of God. And since God was not a being external to the Self, but rather the vital spirit or soul running through all being, divinity may be contained by organisms in varying degrees depending on their level of evolution. Domination of others was thus a prerequisite for the pursuit of God. And this was the essence of Haeckel's highly problematic distortion of the Darwinist theory of evolution:\n          \n            At the lowest stage, the rude - we may say animal - phase of prehistoric primitive man, is the \"ape-man\", who, in the course of the tertiary period, has only to a limited degree raised himself above his immediate pithecoid ancestors, the anthropoid apes. Next come successive stages of the lowest and simplest kind of culture, such as only the rudest of still existing primitive peoples enable us in some measure to conceive. These \"savages\" are succeeded by peoples of a low civilisation, and from these again, by a long series of intermediate steps, we rise little by little to the more highly civilised nations. To these alone - of the twelve races of mankind only to the Mediterranean and Mongolian - are we indebted for what is usually called \"universal history. (Monism 5-6) \n          \nThis fairly crude, very German take on Darwinism, with its emphasis on the transference of biological principles to the social realm, contributed to the establishment of the preconditions for the emergence of National Socialism in that country shortly after Haeckel's death in 1919. In The Scientific Origins of National Socialism (1971), Daniel Gasman reveals the extent of Haeckel's descent into mysticism and its part in the wider development of the Volkish myths that underpinned Nazism in the twentieth century. And although the \"sick\" ideals of Nazism are undeniably deplorable, upon review of the cultural circumstances in which Haeckel's ideas developed, many of them seem inevitable for a frightened, paranoid culture convinced - based on scientific evidence - that life itself can only ever be a form of war: the very notion that continues to underpin, and indeed sustain, the germ theory of disease in the modern era\n          \n          References \n          \nBakewell, Sarah. \"It's Alive!\" Fortean Times October 2000: 34-39.\n            Carpenter, William B.

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n           Here at Queensland University of Technology, the former Arts Faculty has been replaced by a new Faculty of Creative Industries led by the internationally renowned scholar John Hartley. This has entailed a great deal of reorganisation, planning and debate - very little of which need concern us here. However there was one discussion that does bear fairly directly on my topic. This had to do with whether the discipline of journalism should be included within Creative Industries. Though this was eventually resolved in the affirmative some felt that to call a journalist 'creative' was tantamount to an insult. \n          What was at stake here was the old issue of the relationship between the journalist and reality. When the word 'creative' is rejected as non-relevant to the practice of journalism what we have is a signal that the doctrine of empiricism is still alive and well. This remains the staple fare of journalist educators despite having been subjected to devastating attacks by Roy Bhaskar in The Possibilities of Naturalism: A Philosophical Critique of the Contemporary Human Sciences (1979) and in Scientific Realism &amp; Human Emancipation (1986). \n          As Bhaskar has pointed out for the empiricist \"…the ultimate objects of knowledge are atomistic events. Such events constitute given facts and their conjunctions exhaust the objective content of our idea of natural necessity. Knowledge and the world may be viewed as surfaces whose points are in isomorphic correspondence…\" (Bhaskar 24). \n          Within the empiricist worldview the task of the journalist is to boldly go and find out the facts and report them back to the reader. Similarly within the same outlook the task of the documentary photography can be seen as the recording of what is. \n          Outside the realm of the journalist educator few would today subscribe to such a view of the role of the photographer. Not only has theory advanced beyond classical empiricism, but such has been the strength of the reaction, that theorists such as Simon Watney have felt compelled to write an 'obituary notice' for the British Documentary tradition (12). Watney claimed that the activity of the photographers was motivated by a theoretical assumption that they recorded or reported the truth. For Watney it would seem that the truth is that there is no such thing as the truth and that the photographers served institutional and ideological interests. However drawing upon Bhaskarian Critical Realism it is a fairly easy task to refute scepticism in the strong form that Watney advances. To start with, the claim that it is true that there is no truth is itself self-cancelling. Nor can scepticism about the possibility of truth sustain an account of, for example, medical science where our knowledge is progressive and accumulative. \n          More serious for the practice of documentary photography have been the technological advances that have called into question the very possibility of our ever knowing how 'creative' i.e. how much of a faker a photographer has been. It is to the consideration of just this one aspect of the impact of the new digital technology that I now turn. \n          Photography in the Digital Age: Distinguishing between truth and evidence\n          The digital camera would appear to have given the photographer the power of unlimited creativity and indeed to have put her in the position of Absolute Creator. Especially worrying to some is that the evidential status of the photograph has been definitively called into question. Commentators such as Dai Vaughan in For Documentary (1999) see this as the end of relationship between the camera and reality. Brian Winston has expressed similar views in Claiming the Real: The Documentary Film Revisited (1995). \n          It is important to point out here that we need to avoid confusing the question of evidence and that of truth. The latter concept is ultimately an ontological matter while that of evidence belongs to the realm of epistemology. It is failure to make this distinction that has led to the apocalyptic tone adapted by Vaughan and others. \n          Moreover photography has never had a simple relationship with reality. Photography and fakery have gone hand in hand since the inception of the medium. Dorothea Lange's touching up of her famous Migrant Mother and Robert Capa's faking of the death of the Spanish republican soldier are just two of the most famous examples. The latter produced one of the most famous of all war photographs. Entitled Falling Soldier, it was taken in September 1936 during the Spanish Civil War. It purports to show a soldier at the moment of death. He is thrown backward and his rifle has been flung out of his hand. \n          Capa himself claimed that the photograph was taken when he and the man he was to photograph:\n          \n            …were on the Cordoba front, stranded there, the two of them, Capa with his precious camera and the soldier with his rifle. The soldier was impatient. He wanted to get back to the Loyalist lines. Time and again he climbed up and peered over the sandbags. Each time he would drop back at the warning rattle of machine-gun fire. Finally the soldier muttered something to the effect that he was going to take the long chance. He clambered out of the trench with Capa behind him. The machine guns rattled and Capa automatically snapped his camera, falling beside the body of his companion. Two hours later, when it was dark, and the guns were still, the photographer crept across the broken ground to safety. Later he discovered that he had taken one of the finest action shots of the Spanish war (Whelan 96).\n            \n          \nCapa's photograph went around the world and it was very effective in mobilising support for the anti-fascist Spanish Republican cause, that is Capa's photo helped the good guys. There has however been a fair deal of controversy over whether this photo was faked. The evidence seems to suggest that it was (Whelan 95-100). Does it matter? Richard Whelan in Robert Capa (1985) concludes: \"To insist upon knowing whether the photograph actually shows a man at the moment he has been hit by a bullet is both morbid and trivialising, for the picture's greatness ultimately lies in its symbolic implications, not in its literal accuracy as a report on the death of a particular man\" (100). \n          Nigel Warburton in Varieties of Photographic representation: Documentary, Pictorial and Quasi-documentary (1991) however, strongly disagrees. He argues that a question of trust is involved between the photojournalist and her audience and violation of this is by no means a trivial matter. As he puts it: \"The photojournalist's main responsibility is to aim to instil true beliefs in the viewers of their pictures. What is more, not all means are acceptable means of instilling these beliefs: the journalist and the photojournalist both have a duty to instil these beliefs by presenting evidence\" (207). \n          I am in agreement with Warburton here; trust between the photographer and her audience is crucial, especially if one's aesthetic practice is linked to claims that it is part of an emancipatory endeavour. Though of course the matter of truth cannot be reduced to a question of trust. What ultimately is at stake with regard to truth is the relationship of the photograph to the objective manifold, i.e. the ontological status of the photograph. This can be seen as isomorphic as in correspondence models. For example: Is the photograph of Carlo Giuliani, being shot in Genoa at the anti G8 demonstrations, a photograph of Carlo Giuliani being shot? A more satisfactory approach than the correspondence one is, I believe, to be found within Critical Realist model of truth advanced by Roy Bhaskar in Dialectic: The Pulse of Freedom (1993). Here the question of truth ultimately comes down to the capacity of the photograph to uncover alethia - truth as the reason for things, not merely propositions. \n          Complex as these issues are there is nevertheless a fairly simple moral behind the exposure of Capa's fakery. No matter how impressive the process of faking there is always the possibility that this will be at some time exposed. The subsequent exposure of the violation of trust can be a serious blow to a photographer's professional credibility. \n          A somewhat different position on the relationship between digital technology and photography has recently been advanced by Pedro Meyer in an internet article The Renaissance of Photography (Oct 1 1995). He begins with Camille Silvy's 1858 photograph 'River Scene France'. He reveals that this painting is in fact a composite, or a fake if you wish. Silvy solved the technical problem of photographing clouds and a landscape by photographing them separately and joining them in the development process. Meyer concludes this analysis of Silvy's photograph with an endorsement from the grand daughter of Ansel Adams that he would have welcomed digital photography. \n          The next example, which Meyer considers, is that of the two photographs of the Kent University murders in 1970. The recent publication of the photo in 1995 Life Magazine had the pole behind the student's head airbrushed out. No one knows who did this and the photo was reprinted without the pole many times and the elimination of the pole attracted no notice. As Meyer notes however a debate eventually ensued on the Internet. He cites a Brian Masck as arguing that the pole should not have been airbrushed out. Masck went on to make the claim that if photography is to be believed it must not be touched up. This opinion bore directly upon the normative fiduciary level or trust aspect of truth when Masck says:\n          \n            The photographer therefore has a huge burden of responsibility to maintain the credibility of his images, and the employer (publisher) in turn has a burden or responsibility to the photographer as well as the reader to do the same…Once the SOURCE cannot be believed photojournalism is dead.\" (n.pag)\n            \n          \nMeyer responds to this by pointing out that the criterion for truth here is more exact than in writing. In writing we need confirmation from a second source. All that has happened in photography is that we now need confirmation of the photograph. It can no longer stand alone as evidence. \n          So photography for Meyer is now freed from the burden of being evidence and can take its place along side the other arts. He does however still fudge the truth question somewhat in his analogy with writing. The use of digital techniques is compared with proofreading in writing. Thus he writes:\n          \n            All pictures, such as with text, are confirmed from several different sources when in doubt; otherwise it's the photographer's responsibility to deliver an image with integrity towards the events, which in turn will be constantly monitored. We understand that integrity is not a matter of how the picture was made, but what it's supposed to communicate. Just as editors don't oversee if the writers do so by hand or type on a computer, our photographers are free to use any tool they want. The veracity of an image is not dependent on how it was produced, any more than a text is credible because no corrections were done on it. (n.pag) \n            \n          \nThis I think will not do. To begin with it would be quite possible to imagine a set of circumstances in which a written text would have more credibility if it were uncorrected. More seriously the phrase 'integrity towards the events' need clarification. If this means that the photo claims to be a record or semiotic trace of an event then the advent of digital techniques mean that it is impossible to assume such 'integrity'. The evidential nature of photography has been irrevocably challenged. To repeat an earlier point it is important to make a clear distinction between evidence and truth. We must understand here that what has been challenged is our capacity to take the evidential status of a photograph for granted. Nevertheless photographs can still prove a record or a semiotic trace of an event, but we can no longer accept the photograph as proof. Despite what the constructionists would have us believe, the referent still lives! \n          Meyer finishes his article with another interesting comparison between a photograph and a painting by Van Gogh. They may be of the same tree. In the painting the tree is transformed into something wonderful. It glows with a kind of transcendent spirituality. By contrast in the photograph the tree is simply a tree. It does though serve the purpose of alerting us to the contrast between recording reality and transforming it through the imagination. Here Meyer quotes the Mexican poet Veronica Volkow as saying: \"With the digital revolution, the photograph breaks its loyalty with what is real, that unique marriage between the arts, only to fall into the infinite temptations of the imagination. It is now more the sister of fantasy and dreams than of presence\" (n.pag) \n          If Volkow were correct then photojournalism would indeed seem to be dead. But of course there will always be a place for documentary photography. Artistic expression will improve with digital techniques; that is true. But the photograph's ability to provide a semiotic trace will always be welcomed. However, with the growth and spread of digital photography what will gradually disappear is the naive belief in the transparency of the photograph. \n          Conclusions\n          Interrupting the Flow: Neo Heracliteanism and the Practice of Photography\n          The avant-garde filmmaker, poet and theorist Trinh T. Minh-ha has argued in When The Moon Waxes Red: Presentation, Gender And Cultural Politics (1991) for an extreme irrealist position in documentary by claiming: 'Reality runs away, reality denies reality. Filmmaking is after all a question of \"framing\" reality in its course' (43). The first part of this quotation gives us the moment of Heraclitus, who argued : \"You cannot step twice into the same rivers; for fresh waters are forever flowing in upon you.\" (Warner 26). \n          However, there is an even more extreme element in Heraclitean thought and that is associated with his student and follower Cratylus, who seemingly claimed that it was impossible to step into the river at all. The flux of life was so thorough that it was impossible to capture. In Plato Etc Roy Bhaskar cites the anecdote by Aristotle, which has it that Cratylus eventually despaired so much of his ability to say anything about reality that he ended up as an elective mute and would merely point (52). It is the Cratylan position that lies behind Trinh T. Minh-ha's statement 'reality denies reality' (43) for if this phrase has any meaning it must be that it is impossible to know the real. Indeed to my mind Trinh T. Minh-ha's theoretical work is much closer to Cratylus than Heraclitus. \n          If however Heraclitus' fragments 41 &amp; 42 suggest unending flux, fragment 81, which says \"We step and do not step into the same rivers: we are and are not\" (Warner 26). gives us the moment of the intransitive structure which is relatively enduring underneath the flux of actuality. The distinction between the intransitive (i.e. ontological) dimension and the transitive (i.e. narrowly epistemological) dimensions was first advanced by Roy Bhaskar in his Realist Theory of Science (1978). \n          This emphasis on the difference between the intransitive and transitive dimensions helps us to understand that it is the intransitive dimension or the enduring level of ontology or reality that is the domain of the creative photographer. When the photograph gives us access to this level of reality then we are in the presence of what Cartier Bresson has called 'the decisive moment' and the photographer as creator in the sense not of faking or recording but of revealing reality is born. \n          \n          References:\n          \nBkaskar, Roy.

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n       \n                     I am not afraid to say \n            unembellished \n            I am dying \n            but I do not want to do it\n          looking the other way (Lorde 48) \n          In this poem, written by Audre Lorde shortly before her death from breast cancer, Lorde seems to echo the sentiments of Butler and Rosenblum in their collaborative cancer narrative, Cancer in Two Voices, which deals with the experience of disease and dying. Yet in representing their experience of cancer collaboratively, Butler and Rosenblum not only avoid \"looking the other way,\" but construct a text with which they can look to - and garner support from - each other, as well as a larger community. In Cancer in Two Voices Sandra Butler and Barbara Rosenblum necessarily transgress and re-approach dominant metaphors (or \"embellishments\") of breast cancer and disease by presenting us with a \"cancer narrative\" which is written collaboratively, in two voices. Consequently, this text presents the experience of breast cancer in the voices of both the \"survivor\" and \"victim,\" the \"healthy\" and \"ill,\" the \"object\" and \"subject.\" In their vacillation between the \"I\" and the \"we,\" Butler and Rosenblum simultaneously support and resist dominant representations of breast cancer as a terrifying, dichotomizing, solitary condition. In her introduction, Butler describes breast cancer as \"a shared epidemic - a collective experience\" (iv), indicating from the start that the \"two voices\" which invoke and involve their community in the experience of cancer consciously resist solitude in favour of solidarity. In choosing to construct their narrative in two voices, Butler and Rosenblum attempt to approach and reconfigure an illness that has been repeatedly figured as isolating and taboo as, rather, sacred and communal. \n          One of the most evident ways in which Butler and Rosenblum implicate the reader in a community which can no longer remain \"at a safe distance\" from the disease is by linking together traumatic experiences and images of breast cancer victims, Holocaust Survivors, and AIDS victims. The cancer narrative itself is prefaced by a section entitled \"Coming Home - 1983\" which evokes images of Holocaust survivors and discusses their sense of Jewish identity. Foreshadowing her own experience of a scarred body on the beach, Barbara describes the Holocaust survivors that she met: \"I went to the beach with them and saw their scarred bodies...they excavated the flesh of my living relatives\" (6). Later, on vacation with Sandy, Barbara goes swimming naked: \"Freedom, complete freedom for my mutilated body. Freedom to swim, to move, to announce to the world I am whole in spirit if not in form, with an inkling of wholeness in my new form. Sandy and I snuggled in the water, her body unbelievably comforting and close to mine. Glorious freedom painted on her face as well\" (73). In this image, although Rosenblum refers to her \"mutilated body,\" the image is overtaken by that of a couple, comforted by each other's bodies. In this way, she heals the scars and indicates how others might heal their scars. It is interesting, however, that this special moment of comfort between two lovers occurs while Sandy and Barbara are in another \"element.\" \n          In many ways, the double-voiced narrative of Cancer in Two Voices acts as a collaboration (i.e. an act of treason) against the patriarchal, in stitutional powers which traditionally generate and control the dominant metaphors and treatments of breast cancer. Rosenblum and Butler transfer the role of the \"oppressor\" or \"enemy\" onto the male doctors as well as the disease itself (53-54). In particular, Barbara expresses her anger at the medical establishment by chronicling her malpractice suit against Kaiser Hospital, which failed to diagnose her cancerous tumor sooner. Thus, Butler and Rosenblum transform the patriarchal institution of medicine into a force which is as culpable as the cancer itself. \n          Marcella Paul explains that \"an outstanding characteristic of the illness is the secretiveness which has been associated with it. The presence of cancer is often denied or concealed by both cancer victims and their doctors, and this secrecy suggests that the illness is viewed as dirty and evil as well as painful and life-threatening\" (32-33). Furthermore, since the breast cancer 'victim' is identified with the disease itself, she (her very identity) becomes denied, concealed, \"dirty.\" Thus, another way in which Butler and Rosenblum resist dominant approaches to cancer is to write frankly and openly about the disease and its effects. Rosenblum writes, \"[t]he major identity change I made was my decision to be public with my cancer. I was going to enter it, use it, embrace it, and eventually incorporate it as part of me. I was going to write about it in my journals, in my articles. I was going to counsel women who needed help\" (67). Rather than identifying the disease as 'outside' herself, Rosenblum resolves to immerse her identity in it and, in doing so, perhaps change the character of (and the way that women respond to) the disease itself. Similarly, Butler works to help \"other women to see. To look into their lives without flinching or turning away\" (99). \n          Just as Butler and Rosenblum bear witness to Barbara's disease, so too do they insist on the importance of \"being seen - something that as a lesbian couple [they] have never taken for granted\" - in their decision to have a ceremony of commitment (Butler 117). Perhaps, Butler and Rosenblum's inclusion of the dimensions of their lesbian relationship in the cancer narrative adds another layer of resistance against the dominant (i.e. phallic, patriarchal) taboos of cancer - another way in which Butler and Rosenblum rupture and re-figure the traditional modes of narration, images, and metaphors of disease. Julia Watson reads autobiographies \"as acts not just of coming to voice but as negotiations in naming the unspeakable\" (141); thus, Butler and Rosenblum 'speak' the 'unspeakable' on two accounts: their lesbian relationship and their experience of breast cancer. \n          There are times in the cancer narrative when the concept of \"us\" and of \"community\" which Butler and Rosenblum construct fails to console. As Barbara undergoes the pain of chemotherapy and advanced cancer, she writes that a \"painful disentangling is necessary\" for both her and Sandra. Despite their closeness, Barbara's ability to communicate with Sandra is impeded by her sense of isolation. Rosenblum writes, \"I feel totally alone in my cancer. Alone in my agony. Alone in the pain\" (95). Whereas Barbara expresses the solitary experience of being in her body, Sandra writes that \"her body has become 'our' body\" (172). This is one significant place where Butler's and Rosenblum's collaborative and communal paradigms break down. Rosenblum explains, \"when I have sensations in my body, it's an unsharable experience . Even a private language such as I have with Sandy, is a self-contradiction. There cannot be private language . I observe myself trying to talk but am isolated in an imprisoned, solipsistic world, experiencing the terror, panic, and isolation because we believe in common language, common culture, common understandings\" (129-130). \n          The physical pain, experienced by only one of the \"two voices\" interferes with Butler and Rosenblum's desire for commonalities. As a result, Rosenblum must express her experience in solitude - alone, despite Sandy's \"wanting to be included\" (169). Barbara acknowledges the truth in the dominant metaphors of cancer as isolating, but juxtaposes it with a sense of connectedness. Although her belief in their connectedness has been shaken by her unbearable loneliness, Barbara asserts that this very loneliness connects her to the human condition, and therefore to a wider human community. Similarly, while Rosenblum describes her \"unstable body\" as \"terrifying and confusing,\" resulting in a sense of helplessness, instability, and unpredictability (163), perhaps this journal/letter-writing - a chronicle of the instability of Barbara's body - is a means of gaining control and stability over her condition. It is a way of climbing out of her \"crisis of meaning,\" of attempting to resist the sense that she is \"no longer fluent in the language of [her] body, its signs and symbols\" (165). In writing, Rosenblum looks \"for new, stable ground\" (166). She asserts, \"[i]nstead of losing myself, instead of being consumed by this disease - and it can consume you if you don't watch it - instead, I grew. I turned it into a possibility for opening up to myself, for discovering, and for exploring new areas\" (193). \n          Rosenblum's account of her mastectomy resists the sense of dreaded mutilation. Despite her \"horrified\" reaction the first time she looked at her chest - \"I touched myself at least twenty-five times a day, looking for my breast. But it wasn't there anymore...I hated my body\" - Barbara's horror wears off (36). In \"Living in an Unstable Body,\" Rosenblum writes: \"Losing a breast did alter my body image, as well as my body, but I never felt a diminishment of my femininity. My breasts were never the center of my womanness\" (160). Furthermore, upon witnessing Deena Metzger's mastectomy scar, Butler describes \"a tree of life tattooed over her scar, her chest now 'an illuminated manuscript'\" (31). Perhaps Cancer in Two Voices is the same sort of \"illuminated manuscript\" as Metzger's tattoo - one which reinvents the image of the mastectomy as a body illuminated rather than mutilated. Rather than \"look away\" from the mastectomy scar, Sandra approaches it with tenderness, even kissing it: \"my mouth moving along the ruffled skin of her scar brought tears to both our eyes\" (31). Similarly, the cancer narrative that Butler and Rosenblum write together is a means of looking at, touching, and publicly displaying the scars (emotional and physical) that result from breast cancer. Thus, perhaps it is accurate to say, that in writing a cancer narrative in two voices, Sandra and Barbara's individual voices are raised to the level of collective experience and - in refiguring dominant metaphors - the cancer narrative is given alternate form and is introduced into the community rather than being excluded from it. \n          \n          References \n          \nButler, Sandra and Barbara Rosenblum.

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n           The effects of translation have been felt in the development of most languages, but it is particularly marked in English language and literature, where it is a highly charged topic because of its fundamental connection with colonial expansion. Britain shaped a \"national\" literary identity through borrowing from other languages and infected and inflected other languages and literatures in the course of cultural migrations that occurred in Europe since at least the medieval period onward. As Stephen Greenblatt points out in his essay, \"Racial Memory and Literary History,\" the discovery that English is a \"mixed, impure, and constantly shifting medium\" is not a new one, citing the preface to the first etymological dictionary in English, published in 1689, in which its author describes English as a hybrid tongue: \n          \n            a Composition of most, if not all the Languages of Europe; especially of the Belgick or Low-Dutch, Saxon, Teutonic or High-Dutch, Cambro-British or Welsh, French, Spanish, Italian, and Latin; and now and then of the Old and Modern Danish, and Ancient High-Dutch; also of the Greek, Hebrew, Arabick, Chaldee, Syriack, and Turcick. ((Skinner A3v-A4r, in Greenblatt 52) \n            \n          \nThe \"English\" literary canon has translated material at its heart; there is the Bible, for instance, and classical works in Greek, which are read and discussed in translation by many who study them. Beowulf is a translation that has been canonized as one of the \"original\" texts of English literature, and Shakespeare was inspired by translations. Consider, for instance, Greenblatt's description of The Comedy of Errors, where a \"Plautine character from a Sicilian city, finding himself in the market square of a city in Asia Minor, invokes Arctic shamanism – and all this had to make sense to a mixed audience in a commercial theater in London\" (58), and there is a strong sense of the global cultural discourse that has been translated into a \"national\" and international canon of literature in English. \n          English as a language and as a literature, however, has not been contained by national boundaries for some time, and in fact is now more comfortably conceived in the plural, or as uncountable, like a multidirectional flow. English has therefore been translated from solid, settled, and certain representations of Anglo-Celtic culture in the singular to a plurality of shifting, hybrid productions and performances which illuminate the tension implicit in cultural exchange. Translation has become a popular trope used by critics to describe that interaction within literatures defined by language rather than nation, and as a mutable and mutual process of reading and reinscription which illuminates relationships of power. \n          The most obvious power relationship that translation represents, of course, is that between the so-called original and the translation; between the creativity of the author and the derivation of the translator. In The Translator's Invisibility (1995), Lawrence Venuti suggests that there is a prevailing conception of the author as a free and unconstrained individual who partially shapes the relationship: \"the author freely expresses his thoughts and feelings in writing, which is thus viewed as an original and transparent self-representation, unmediated by transindividual determinants (linguistic, cultural, social) that might complicate authorial individuality\" (6). The translation then can only be defined as an inferior representation, \"derivative, fake, potentially a false copy\" (7) and the translator as performing the translation in the manner of an actor manipulating lines written by someone else: \"translators playact as authors, and translations pass for original texts\" (7). The transparent translation and the invisibility of the translator, Venuti argues can be seen as \"a mystification of troubling proportions, an amazingly successful concealment of the multiple determinants and effects of English-language translation, the multiple hierarchies and exclusions in which it is implicated\" (16). That is, translation exerts its own power in constructing identities and representing difference, in addition to the power derived from the \"original\" text, which, in fact, the translation may resist. Recognition of this power suggests that traditional Western representations of translation as an echo or copy, a slave toiling on the plantation or seductive belle infidèle, each with its clear affinity to sexual and colonial conquest, attempts to deny translation the possibility of its own power and the assertion of its own creative identity. However, the establishment of an alternative power arrangement exists because translations can \"masquerade as originals\" (Chamberlain 67) and infiltrate and subvert literary systems in disguise. As Susan Stewart contends in Crimes of Writing: Problems in the Containment of Representation, if we \"begin with the relation between authority and writing practices rather than with an assumption of authorial originality, we arrive at a quite different sense of history\" (9) and, indeed, a different sense of literary creativity. This remainder of this paper will focus on Nicole Brossard's Le désert mauve and Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient, to exemlify how a translator may flaunts her creativity, and allow the cultural position of the translator vis à vis language, history, or gender to be critically exposed by the text itself. \n          Québécoise feminist writer Nicole Brossard's 1987 novel, Le désert mauve [Mauve Desert], is perhaps the most striking example of how a translator foregrounds the creative process of reading and re-writing. Brossard constructed her novel by becoming her own reader and asking questions, imagining dialogues between the characters she had already created. This \"interactive discourse\" shaped the text, which is a dialogue between two versions of a story, and between two writers, one of whom is an active reader, a translator. Le désert mauve is a structural triptych, consisting of Laure Angstelle's novel, Le désert mauve, and Mauve l'horizon, a translation of Angstelle's book by Maude Laures. In the space between the two sites of writing, the translator imagines the possibilities of the text she has read, \"re-imagining the characters' lives, the objects, the dialogue\" (Interview, 23 April 96). Between the versions of the desert story, she creates a fluid dimension of désir, or desire, a \"space to swim with the words\" (Interview). \n          Brossard has said that \"before the idea of the novel had definitely shaped itself,\" she knew that it would be in a \"hot place, where the weather, la température, would be almost unbearable: people would be sweating; the light would be difficult\" (Mauve Desert: A CD-ROM Translation). That site became the desert of the American southwest with its beauty and danger, its timelessness and history, and its decadent traces of Western civilization in the litter of old bottles and abandoned, rusting cars. The author imagined the desert through the images and words of books she read about the desert, appropriating the flowers and cacti that excited her through their names, seduced her through language. Maude Laures, the translator within Brossard's novel, finds the desert as a dimension of her reading, too: \"a space, a landscape, an enigma entered with each reading\" (133). From her first readings of a novel she has discovered in a used bookshop, Laures, confronts the \"the issue of control. Who owns the meaning of the black marks on the page, the writer or the reader?\" (Godard 115), and decides the book will belong to her, \"and that she can do everything because she has fallen in love with the book, and therefore she's taken possession of the book, the author, the characters, the desert\" (Interview). The translator is fascinated by Mélanie, the 15-year-old narrator, who drives her mother's car across the desert, and who has been captivated by the voice and beauty of the geometrician, Angela Parkins, imagining dialogues between these two characters as they linger in the motel parking lot. But she is unwilling to imagine words with l'homme long (longman), who composes beautiful equations that cause explosions in the desert, recites Sanskrit poems, and thumbs through porno in his hotel room. \n          Le désert mauve was an attempt by Brossard to translate from French to French, but the descriptions of the desert landscape – the saguaro, senita, ocotillos, and arroyo—show Spanish to be the language of the desert. In her translation, Maude Laures increases the code switching and adds more Spanish phrases to her text, and Japanese, too, to magnify the echo of nuclear destruction that resonates in l'homme long's equations. She also renames the character l'homme oblong (O'blongman) to increase the dimension of danger he represents. Linking the desert through language with nuclear testing gives it a \"semantic density,\" as Nicholis Entrikin calls it, that extends far beyond the geographical location to recognize the events embedded in that space through associative memory. L'homme long is certainly linked through language to J Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the original atomic bomb project in Los Alamos, New Mexico and his reference to the Bhagavad Gita after seeing the effects of the atomic bomb: \"I/am/become Death—now we are all sons of bitches\" (17). The translator distances herself by a translating Death/I /am/death—I'm a sonofabitch\" (173). \n          The desert imagined by Laure Angstelle seduces the reader, Maude Laures, and her translation project creates a trajectory which links the heat and light of the desert with the cold and harsh reflective glare of sunlit snow in wintry Montréal, where the \"misleading reflections\" of the desert's white light is subject to the translator's gaze. Laures leans into the desert peopled with geometricians and scientists and lesbians living under poisonous clouds of smoke that stop time, and tilts her translation in another direction. In the final chapter of Laure Angstelle's novel, Mélanie had danced in the arms of Angela Parkins, only to find she had run out of time: Angela is shot (perhaps by l'homme long) and falls to the dance floor. Maudes Laures is constrained by the story and by reality, but translates \"There was no more time\" into \"One more time,\" allowing the lovers' dance to continue for at least another breath, room for another ending. \n          Brossard has asserted that, like lesbian desire or the translator, the desert was located in the background of our thoughts. Ondaatje's novel, The English Patient (1992), locates the translator in the desert, linking a profession and a place which have both witnessed an averting of Western eyes, both used in linguistic and imperial enterprises that operate under conditions of camouflage. Linked also by association is the war in the Sahara and the nuclear bombs dropped on Japan. As in Brossard, the desert here is a destination reached by reading, how \"history enters us\" through maps and language. Almásy, \"the English patient,\" knew the desert before he had been there, \"knew when Alexander had traversed it in an earlier age, for this cause or that greed\" (18). Books in code also serve to guide spies and armies across the desert, and like a book, the desert is \"crowded with the world\" (285), while it is \"raped by war and shelled as if it were just sand\" (257). Here the translator is representative of a writing that moves between positions and continually questions its place in history. Translators and explorers write themselves out of a text, rendering themselves invisible and erasing traces of their emotions, their doubts, beliefs, and loves, in order to produce a \"neutral\" text, much in the way that colonialism empties land of human traces in order to claim it, or the way technology is airbrushed out of the desert in order to conceal \"the secret of the deserts from Unweinat to Hiroshima\" (295). Almásy the translator, the spy, whose identity is always a subject of speculation, knows how the eye can be fooled as it reads a text in disguise; floating on a raft of morphine, he rewrites the monotone of history in different modes, inserting between the terse lines of commentary a counternarrative of love illumined by \"the communal book of moonlight\" (261), which translates lives and gives them new meaning. \n          The translator's creativity stems from a collaboration and a love for the text; to deny the translation process its creative credibility is synonymous in The English Patient with the denial of any desire that may violate the social rules of the game of love by unfairly demanding fidelity. If seas move away to leave shifting desert sands, why should lovers not drift, or translations? Ultimately, we are all communal translations, says Ondaatje's novel, of the shifting relationship between histories and personal identities. \"We are not owned or monogamous in our taste or experience\" (261). This representation of the translator resists the view of identity \"which attempts to recover an immutable origin, a fixed and eternal representation of itself\" (Ashcroft 4) by its insistence that we are transformed in and by our versions of reality, just as we are by our readings of fiction. \n          The translators represented in Brossard and Ondaatje suggest that the process of translation is a creative one, which acknowledges influence, contradictory currents, and choice its heart. The complexity of the choices a translator makes and the mulitiplicity of positions from which she may write suggest a process of translation that is neither transparent nor complete. Rather than the ubiquitous notion of the translator as \"a servant an invisible hand mechanically turning the word of one language into another\" (Godard 91), the translator creatively 'forges in the smithy of the soul' a version of story that is a complex \"working model of inclusive consciousness\" (Heaney 8) that seeks to loosen another tongue and another reading in an eccentric literary version of oral storytelling. \n          \n          References\n          \nAshcroft, Bill.

Whether it’s video, electronic shit, studio shit, painting, you name it, the psychology is in place. It’s the DJ.\" – Paul D. Miller, AKA DJ Spooky, qtd. in Tobin\n          \n        \n          \"Turn it up! Bring the noise.\" – Public Enemy, \"Bring the Noise\n          \n        \"Turn down that damned noise!!!\" Thus began the nightly negotiation with my father during my adolescence — him firmly rooted in his recliner as he stared at the television, me locked in my bedroom, fingers nudging the stereo knobs to experiment with acceptable volumes. It was never, \"turn down the music,\" or \"lower that Boogie Down Productions album,\" it was always, \"turn down that damned noise!!!\" I hear his words echoed daily in the attitudes of many of the pre-service teachers that I work with as they navigate the tumultuous maelstrom of education in postmodern culture. \n        Perhaps my students merely reveal legacies of their own educational experiences, or perhaps they embody the transitional dissonance of an epochal shift. Regardless of the \"origin\" of their discomfort, they seem to turn to those of us engaged in preparing them as teachers to sanitise the \"mess\" they encounter in schools. They desire Skinnerian behaviorist reductionism (if \"x\" then \"y\"). They seek to tame the \"noise\" of the extraordinarily complex endeavor of teaching and learning. I fiddle with the volume knob of my own teaching, crank it up, and offer them hip hop pedagogies.1 \n        By hip hop pedagogies I do not mean simply the inclusion of hip hop culture (e.g., DJing, rapping, graffiti art, dancing) as objects of study in the classroom, although these are indeed worthwhile curricular considerations. Instead of dominant modes of schooling which are informed by a factory model of efficiency and knowledge transmission (Adams et al.), I suggest a fundamental reorientation to pedagogies guided by the aesthetics of hip hop culture, particularly the power of recombinant textuality embodied in hip hop’s \"noisy mix.\"\n        Dick Hebdige locates the origins, as diffuse as they are, of hip hop music in the fundamental nature of the mix, noting that \"(r)ap is DJ (disc jockey) and MC (Master of Ceremonies or Microphone Controller) music . . . (I)t relies on pre-recorded sounds. . . . The hip hoppers \"stole\" music off air and cut it up. Then they broke it down into its component parts and remixed it on tape\" (141). Paul Miller identifies the possibilities inherent in such processes:\n        \n          DJ culture – urban youth culture – is all about recombinant potential. It has as a central feature a eugenics of the imagination. Each and every source is fragmented and bereft of prior meaning – kind of like a future without a past. The samples are given meaning only when re-presented in the assemblage of the mix (7)\n          \n        In hip hop, mixing occurs within discursive realities of \"noise.\" Tricia Rose notes that the \"sonic power\" of hip hop, with its \"distinctive bass-heavy, enveloping sound does not rest outside of its musical and social power\" (63). She summarizes the significance of this sonic barrage:\n        \n          \"Noise\" on the one hand and communal countermemory on the other, rap music conjures and razes in one stroke. Rap's rhythms . . . are its most powerful effect. Rap's primary focus is sonic . . . Rap music centers on the quality and nature of rhythm and sound, the lowest, \"fattest beats\" being the most significant and emotionally charged . . . The arrangement and selection of sounds rap musicians have invented via samples, turntables, tape machines, and sound systems are at once deconstructive (in that they actually take apart recorded musical compositions) and recuperative (because they recontextualise these elements creating new meanings for cultural sounds that have been relegated to commercial wastebins) . . . (64-65\n          \n        Herein lies one of the most transformative possibilities of hip hop pedagogies – the model it offers as a recombinant text, as a mix. Miller explains:\n        \n          It is in this singularly improvisational role of \"recombiner\" that the DJ creates what I like to call a \"post symbolic mood sculpture,\" or the mix; a disembodied and transient text . . . The implications of this style of creating art are three fold: 1) by its very nature it critiques the entire idea of intellectual property and copyright law, 2) it reifies a communal art value structure in contrast to most forms of art in late capitalist social contexts, 3) it interfaces communications technology in a manner that anthropomorphisizes it. (12-13\n          \n        If we were to begin thinking of our classrooms/schools as a mix, as recombinant, fluid texts where the copyrighting privilege of authority in the guise of \"teacher\" is challenged, where the entire process of teaching and learning becomes communal, and where human/technological cyborgs are valued, we can see how hip hop pedagogies might be transformative. The classroom might become, in my favorite image of postmodern education that William Doll borrows from Milan Kundera and Richard Rorty, a \"fascinating imaginative realm where no one owns the truth and everyone has the right to be understood\" (151).\n        Such pedagogical orientations toward the mix invite students to reject modernist attempts to channel and control learning – to \"school\" the body and mind. Instead, as Potter notes, \"hip-hop aims for a world made hole, aporic, fracturing the fragmented, graffiti on graffiti\" (8, emphasis in original). Instead of the master narratives of modernity, it \"offers us a model . . . as it produces knowledge in the active consumption of the everyday materials the world makes available . . . it is a work which instructs in its process, indeed, by its process\" (Block 339). \n        Is this not a better way to envision our work in schools, which Pinar et al. see as ultimately an engagement with larger conversations of what it means to prepare the next generation (847)? Such mixing infuses life into pedagogies as meanings are reassembled, and acknowledges a \"new paradigm\" that does \"not necessarily require new data, but rather (is) characterized by clever and substantively different ways of recasting what we already know\" (Samples 187). \"The previous meanings,\" Miller concludes, are \"corralled into a space where the differences in time, place, and culture, are collapsed to create a recombinant text or autonomous zone of expression\" (14). Hip hop pedagogies offer such \"zones\" of hybrid selves, hybrid cultures, and hybrid conversations that are recombined continually through collisions with cultures, histories, and technologies.\n        So that’s the noisy mix I share with my students as most salient to postmodern education – cacophonous, turbulent, and sure to infuriate my father, even now.\n        Notes\n        1. I follow Gore in her use of the plural form of pedagogy: \"(Pedagogies) use is important to signify the multiple approaches and practices that fall under the pedagogy umbrella\" whereas \"rely(ing) on the singular form is to imply greater unity and coherence than is warranted\" (7).\n          \n        References\n        \n Adams, Natalie et al.

    "title": "The Promotion of a Secular Work Ethic",
    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n           The compulsion to work has clearly become pathological in modern industrial societies. Millions of people are working long hours, devoting their lives to making or doing things that will not enrich their lives or make them happier but will add to the garbage and pollution that the earth is finding difficult to accommodate. They are so busy doing this that they have little time to spend with their family and friends, to develop other aspects of themselves, to participate in their communities as full citizens.  \n          Unless the work/consume treadmill is overcome there is little hope for the planet. The work ethic, and the corresponding respect accorded to those who accumulate wealth, are socially constructed but rapidly becoming dysfunctional for social and environmental welfare. Much has been written about the role of Protestant preachers in the rise of the work ethic but the continued reinforcement of a secular work ethic owes much to literature, particularly self-help books and children's literature of the nineteenth century, which promoted work as a route to success and a sign of good character. \n          In the centuries following the Protestant reformation the emphasis on work as a religious calling was gradually superseded by a materialistic quest for social mobility and material success. This success-oriented work ethic encouraged ambition, hard work, self-reliance, and self-discipline and held out the promise that such effort would be materially rewarded. Through example and reiteration, the myth that any man, no matter what his origins, could become rich if he tried hard enough became firmly established. The self-made man owed his advancement to habits of industry, sobriety, moderation, self-discipline, and avoidance of debt (Beder). \n          In early America the middle classes \"controlled the major institutions of social influence\" the schools, churches, factories, political offices and publishing companies and used them to propagate work values (Cherrington 32-3). Their children learned the value of hard work from their parents and this was reinforced by school teachers, classroom readers and popular books. \n          Benjamin Franklin was one of the best-known early propagators of work values. Poor Richard and Franklin's autobiography sold millions of copies at the time and was translated into many languages for sale abroad. In his books he urged thrift, industry, pursuit of money and hard work. \n          \"Newspapers, books, interviews, speeches, and literature abounded with praise of the successful who had made it on their own\" (Bernstein 141). Success was defined in terms of doing well in business and making lots of money. Owning one's own business was supposed to be a route to success that was open to all, as Abraham Lincoln explained in an 1861 speech to Congress: \n          \n            \"The prudent, penniless beginner in the world, labors for wages awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself, then labors on his own account for awhile, and at length hires another new beginner to help him. This is a just, and generous, and prosperous system; which opens the way to all gives hope to all, and consequent energy and progress, and improvement of conditions to all.\" (qtd. in Chinoy 4)\n            \n          \nThe earliest textbooks published in America promoted work values as part of good character and the formula to success. These included the Peter Parley books first published by Samuel Goodrich during the 1820s and 30s (Peter Parley was a pseudonym). Goodrich wrote some 150 children's books beginning with Tales of Peter Parley about America. The Parley books covered geography, history, commerce and even mathematics. \n          McGuffey's Eclectic Readers were the standard English textbooks in American schools from 1830s through to 1920s. They were first published in 1836 and became perhaps the most widely read children's books in the 19th century with 122 million copies of the six readers sold to an estimated four fifths of US school children (Cherrington 36). American children learned to read and write using these books, which also taught middle-class values including the work ethic and success through hard work: \"Work, work, my boy, be not afraid; Look labor boldly in the face\" (qtd. in Bernstein 161). They are again being promoted today by conservative groups in the US (see for example http://www.liberty-tree.org/ltn/mcguffeys-reader.html and http://www.aobs-store.com/reviews/mcguffey.htm). \n          American story books also taught work values. Horatio Alger (1832-99) was one of the most prolific American writers. He wrote some 130 books that taught work values to young boys. Twenty million copies of Alger's books were sold with titles such as Strive and Succeed, Ragged Dick, Mark the Matchboy, Risen from the Ranks, Bound to Rise. They typically told of poor boys who became self-made men through their own efforts and perseverance. \n          In the twentieth century children continued to learn at school about how various successful businessmen had started from humble origins. From the 1940s the American Schools and Colleges Association presented an annual \"Horatio Alger Award\" to businessmen whose \"rise to success symbolizes the tradition of starting from scratch under our system of free competitive enterprise\" (Chinoy 1) and there are still a range of Alger associations and awards current today (see for example http://www.ihot.com/~has/ and http://www.horatioalger.com/). \n          Self-help books supplemented fiction in showing the way to success. Books at the turn of the 20th century with names such as The Conquest of Poverty, Pushing to the Front, Success under Difficulty, all preached the message of how any motivated, hard-working individual could overcome life's obstacles. \n          Work as a route to success was also promoted in Britain in books, newspapers and official reports. Workers were urged to work hard towards success, to be independent and raise themselves above their lowly stations in life through saving, striving, and industriousness. Nineteenth century organisations such as the Bettering Society promoted thrift and self-improvement and criticised measures to aid the poor (Roach 69). Samuel Smiles was one of the foremost advocates of \"the spirit of self-help\". His 1859 book Self-Help argued: \n          \n            \"In many walks of life drudgery and toil must be cheerfully endured as the necessary discipline of life... He who allows his application to falter, or shirks his work on frivolous pretexts, is on the sure road to ultimate failure... even men with the commonest brains and the most slender powers will accomplish much...\" (qtd. in Ward 22-3)\n            \n          \nThe myth of the self-made man was also evident in popular music hall songs in the 19th century, such as Work Boys Work by Harry Clifton (1824-1872): \n          \n            ...labour leads to wealth\n            and will keep you in good health,\n            so its best to be contented with your lot.\n          \n Whilst it was true that some of the early English manufacturers started off as workers themselves, they tended to come from the middle classes and as time went by the opportunity for working people to become capitalists were reduced as the income gap between capitalists and workers broadened. \n          In fact the much publicised gospel of improvement and self-help served only to obscure the very limited prospects and achievements of the self-made men within early and later Victorian society, and investigations of the steel and hosiery industries, for instance, have shown how little recruitment occurred from the ranks of the workers to those of the entrepreneurs. (Thomis 86) \n          However, there were enough oft-repeated stories of individuals moving from poverty to wealth to keep alive, at least in the minds of the well-to-do, the idea that hard work could lead from rags-to-riches, despite this not being the case for the vast majority of people who were born in poverty and died in poverty after a life time of hard work (Furnham 198). In this way the affluent were able to feel comfortable about poverty in their midst, blaming it on individual weakness rather than societal failings. \n          In Britain, as in America, the myth of the self-made man persisted in children's literature into the twentieth century. Academic Philip Cohen noted: \n          When I was growing up in the early 1950s it was still possible to get given 'improving books' for one's birthday, consisting of biographies of self-made men, engineers, inventors, industrialists, entrepreneurs, philanthropists and the like. These men, and they were all men, had usually lived in the 'heroic' age of nineteenth-century capitalism and the books themselves were clearly prepared for the edification of the young. (Cohen 61) \n          The contemporary reception by audiences of the texts discussed in this article is unknown. In particular, the degree to which children were able to resist the none too subtle moral lessons contained in their texts and stories is a question requiring empirical research that has yet to be carried out. However, it is evident that the promotion of the work ethic has been a successful enterprise and this article has shown that 19thcentury books played an active part in that. Although not everyone subscribes to the work ethic today, the myth of the self-made man remains a myth in most English speaking countries, even though the disparities between rich and poor are widening and it is becoming more and more difficult for the poor to become rich through talent, effort and opportunities. \n          Despite the dysfunctionality of the work ethic it continues to be promoted and praised, accepted and acquiesced to. It is one of the least challenged aspects of industrial culture. Yet it is based on myths and fallacies which provide legitimacy for gross social inequalities. If we are to protect the planet and our social health we need to find new ways of judging and valuing each other which are not work and income dependent. \n          \n          References\n          \nBeder, Sharon.

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n           Women in Universities\n          Women have been fighting for the right to participate in universities since 1873, when Sophia Jex Blake went to court with her fight to enrol at Edinburgh University. In rejecting her application, one of the judges stated: \n          It is a belief, widely entertained, that there is a great difference in the mental constitution of the two sexes, just as there is in their physical conformation. The powers and susceptibilities of women are as noble as those of men; but they are thought to be different, and, in particular, it is considered that they have not the same power of intense labour as men .... (Scutt 224) \n          In Australia, from the 1850s to the 1880s, both the University of Sydney and The University of Melbourne refused to admit women as students. In 1879, the Chancellor of the University of Sydney suggested that: \n          The best course to be taken by advocates of advanced education for women, would be to found some sort of affiliated college for them in the vicinity of the University ... if there really be a widespread wish on the part of young women for a higher education ...\" (Scutt 228). \n          Having finally won the right to study at university in 1881, and to enter the academic workforce, women are still finding many of the old prejudices remain. Numerous studies have demonstrated that women's experiences in academe are qualitatively different from men's and that women are systematically paid lower salaries than men of equivalent academic achievement, age and length of service (Bagilhole 431-47; Loder 713-4; McElrath 269-81;). Studies have shown that differences in the experiences of male and female faculty are largely explained by gender (Booth &amp; Burton 312-33; Everett 159-75; Over &amp; Lancaster 309-18; Ready 7) and sex discrimination is highlighted as an ongoing contributor to the inequity (Allport 5-8; Hall &amp; Swadener 1; Tuohy 8). \n          A recent UNESCO-Commonwealth (http://www.unesco.org/) report states that: \n          ... in spite of advances which women have made in many areas of public life in the past two decades, in the area of higher education management they are still a long way from participating on the same footing as men. With hardly an exception, the global picture is one of men outnumbering women at about five to one at middle management level and at about twenty to one at senior management level (Singh 4). \n          The introduction in Australia of Sex Discrimination legislation (http://www.hreoc.gov.au/sex_discrimination/) in 1984 and more recently, Affirmative Action policies ( http://www.austlii.edu.au/) in employment and promotion rounds in some universities has not improved women's situation to the extent expected. In 1978, women held 16% of full time academic posts while gaining 25% of all higher degrees and 30% of undergraduate degrees (Commonwealth Government statistics cited by Over and McKenzie 61-71). In 1999, 54% of students were women yet women's participation in academe had only increased to 35% (DETYA) (http://www.deet.gov.au/). \n          Women are mainly employed at the lowest academic levels. In 1999, 72% of women were employed at Levels A and B (Associate Lecturer/Lecturer) compared to 46% of men, with only 8% of women reaching Levels D and E (Associate Professor/Professor) compared to 26% of men. Women continue to be clustered in the traditionally female areas of Health, Education and Arts while few seem to have successfully broken through the barriers in the traditionally male areas of Engineering, Architecture or Agriculture (DETYA) (http://www.deet.gov.au/). Business has traditionally been viewed as a male preserve but enrolments have increased to the point where women almost equal men. However, the staff ratio of men to women remains very low at 70/30 (DETYA) (http://www.deet.gov.au/). \n          The slow growth rate for women in academe belies the fact that more women than men are now completing university degrees. The purpose of this study was to determine how well the experiences of academic women in the male-dominated faculties of business and commerce, reflect the literature on women in universities, in general. Previous empirical studies have found inequitable treatment of women without necessarily exploring the processes of discrimination. \n          The Study\n          This study involved interviews with academic women who had been employed in faculties of business and commerce for at least five years. The research used the 'snowballing' technique: participants initially comprised women known to me but as these women told female colleagues of my study I was given the names of other women who were willing to participate. \n          Participants comprised twenty-one women from three universities in Western Australia, two universities in New South Wales and one Victorian university. One woman had recently left academe and started her own business because of discriminatory practices she had encountered and another was contemplating leaving. In each university, women comprised a minority of the faculty and felt disadvantaged in some way. \n          A semi-structured interview was used to explore with the women the issues that had been identified from previous studies of sex discrimination in the academic profession. Open-ended questions were used and the interviews conducted face to face, or, in the case of those interstate, via telephone or email. The women spoke frankly about their experiences. \n          \nFindings and Discussion\n          Promotion \n          Each of the women in this study said that their university had established an internal promotion policy based on merit. However, they felt the greatest problem they had encountered in gaining promotion was in determining the criteria upon which they would be judged each year, and in meeting those criteria. \n          \"I have been chasing promotion for over five years. At first I was told that I would not be promoted until I got my masters degree so I worked really hard to complete it but then a male colleague was promoted without a masters. Once I got the masters I was told I needed to publish to be promoted but in the next year someone else was promoted without any publications. You go all out to meet the criteria each year but in the next year the promotions committee changes and so do the criteria for that year\"(Lecturer applying for Senior Lecturer position). \n          The promotion procedure at one university was explained by a Senior Lecturer who had served on promotion committees on two occasions. \n          \n          \n            \"There are about ten criteria upon which promotion can be based. When the applications are received we all get together to determine which are the criteria to be applied. In the last promotion round only four of the ten criteria were used so only people satisfying those criteria were selected.\"                \n            \n          When asked whether the criteria were the same as the previous year she replied: \n          \n            \"Last year there was more emphasis on qualifications and publications. This year community involvement and involvement in university affairs were judged as more important ... it varies from year to year\".\n            \n          On questioning about the promotion procedures at their universities, women stated they were largely dissatisfied with the process, that they were presumed to be satisfied with their lot while the men were actively encouraged to apply.\n          \n            \"I was told not to bother to apply (for a senior lecturer position) as I would not get it ... that there was a queue of people to be promoted before me - (named males) - and until they were promoted, I would not be considered\" (Lecturer). \n               \n\n            \"The position was advertised with a specific male applicant in mind and specifically excluded me by stating that the appointee must have supervisory experience. Women in my department are not given the opportunity to supervise students so I didn't even bother applying.\"(Lecturer aspiring to a Senior Lecturer position). \n          \nOne woman, upon inquiring why she was not promoted, was told that she should be grateful to have tenure and asked why she wanted to be promoted, anyway. \"They would never have said that to a male, they would have expected a male to be working towards promotion\" (Associate Lecturer). \n          All women interviewed stated that they had problems keeping up with the 'goal posts' which moved from year to year. The 'moving of the goal posts' is one means by which universities are able to maintain the position of women at lower levels. Unsurprisingly, some women said they felt that promotion at their university was based on politics rather than merit. \n          However, defining merit in universities is problematic. According to Burton (430), definitions of what is meritorious depend upon the power of particular groups to define it and, as a result, can change. The narrow view of merit is 'the best person for the job' which Burton (113) describes as an \"overwhelming tendency to select in your own image\". Burton (430) and Allport (5) claim universities define merit along male cultural lines with current selection, remuneration and career progression practices strongly influenced by an underlying gender bias. Burton (430) argues that there is still a tendency for work to be ranked as 'men's' or women's work with lower status attributed to the latter and an assumption that different skills and abilities are needed for each. \n          Over and McKenzie (61-71) claim that women are disadvantaged by the fact that invalid merit criteria are applied to them which men as a group are more likely to satisfy. They state that the academic careers of most women do not fit the stereotypic male experience and it is mainly men who decide whether women should be promoted. \n          At one university in the study, the merit criteria for senior lecturer include the requirement that aspirants have a number of overseas conference presentations. \n          \n            \"Some of us are single working mothers and overseas conference attendance is out of the question because who's going to mind our children while we are away? The senior males were astonished when I mentioned that this was a problem for me. It had never occurred to them\" (Associate Lecturer on why women at her university do not apply for promotion).\n           \n          \nFamily Responsibilities \n          The women commented on the numerous difficulties they had encountered in combining an academic career with responsibility for children. They felt that certain male faculty members perceived married women with children as lacking in career commitment, whereas married men with families were viewed as being more stable and committed to their careers. \n          One married woman claimed that when she needed to go home to tend a sick child, her male Head of Department told her she should \"get her priorities right\". In 1992, Family Responsibility provisions were added to the Sex Discrimination Act (http://scaleplus.law.gov.au/html/pasteact/0/171/top.htm). However, it would appear that individual practice doesn't always follow as a result of changes in policy. \n          \nEqual Pay \n          On the subject of equal pay for equal work, the women said that they were often paid lower wages than their male colleagues despite having higher qualifications and equivalent teaching and research experience. Some women felt that the barriers between academic levels were used to artificially maintain the wage gap between men and women, regardless of qualifications and ability. This was felt to be particularly the case between the levels of Associate Lecturer (Level A) and Lecturer (Level B). \n          \n            \"They find excuses to keep you at Associate Lecturer so that they can pay you less to do the same work that you would be doing as a lecturer ... lecturing, coordinating units and so on\"(Associate Lecturer). \n          \n          \n          \"There are no men below Lecturer in my Department, either lecturing or with Masters degrees. As soon as they get their Masters they are promoted to Lecturer.... I'm coordinating units as an Associate Lecturer while some male lecturers have less responsibility' (Associate Lecturer with Masters degree and publications)\n            \n\n          Two women said that they had been performing higher level duties (Level B) for up to five years while working on their Masters but their university refused to pay them at the higher level until they had completed their degree. Even when they satisfied all the requirements for the Masters degree and had a letter from their supervisor saying they had satisfied all the requirements, the university refused to pay them until they had actually graduated, which was some time later. Shortly afterwards their university took on two men to perform the same duties, paying these at the higher level even though they had not completed a masters degree. \n          One former lecturer claimed that she was employed at a time when there was a large turnover of staff in her department. A number of new staff were appointed of whom she was the only female. Although she and the other new staff were all employed at Lecturer Level B, it wasn't until later on that she discovered that the men were appointed at the top of the Lecturer salary scale while she was appointed at the bottom, with a salary differential of about10 000pa. This was despite the fact that both she and the men had similar qualifications and work experience at commencement. \n          \nTeaching Loads \n          Another complaint by women concerned inequitable teaching loads. An analysis in one Business School showed that women had higher teaching loads while men were given more time off for research. The women complained that the supervision of post-graduate students was divided up between the men, and women were excluded. \n          Since research publication and student supervision are usually the most highly ranked criteria in academic promotion rounds, women who are not given the opportunity to participate in these areas are disadvantaged when applying for promotion. This problem is compounded since women are overwhelmingly employed at the lower levels where responsibility for the majority of teaching takes place. This leaves them with little time left to devote to research even if given the opportunity. \n          The women also said they were often pressured into taking on higher duties than those prescribed in the Position Classification Standards for their level. They tended to acquiesce because of their need to prove they were better than men to gain promotion. One woman said that the extra administrative duties she had been given meant that she had less time for research which actually reduced her prospects for tenure and promotion. She said she didn't dare complain as the men in her department would use it as an excuse to question her commitment to her job. \n          Conclusion\n          An examination of women's perceptions and experiences in the workplace can help us understand the informal processes that work against women. The experiences of the women discussed in this paper provide an insight into the subtle processes that continue to operate in some higher education institutions to prevent women from reaching their full potential. Although equal opportunity legislation (http://www.hreoc.gov.au/about_the_commission/legislation/index.html) has been enacted to prevent discrimination and disadvantage to women, the implementation of policy does not always filter through to the operational levels. It is still possible to circumvent legislation in subtle ways, perhaps without even being aware that these practices are discriminative. \n          The women in this study spoke frankly about their experiences and the difficulties they had encountered in gaining equal recognition to men, with very few satisfied that they were receiving equitable treatment. The women felt that their work was not valued as highly as that of the men they worked with and they were given less opportunities for advancement. \n          Overall, the interviews with the women revealed interesting insights into their experiences in pursuing academic careers and in trying to gain recognition for their achievements. The collective experiences of the women provide an insight into the subtle ways in which disadvantage can be engendered. \n          The findings of this study have serious implications for university administrators, particularly deans and heads of schools. There are many well-qualified women academics and universities cannot afford to overlook the valuable contribution these women can make to teaching, research and university governance. \n          \n          References\n          \nAllport, Caroline. \"Improving Gender Equity: Using Industrial Bargaining\".

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n          \n\t\t  \n\t\t  In the age of digital transformations of images, communications, and storytelling, Marshall McLuhan's insight that \"the medium is the message\" can be augmented with the corollary that the media is the mix. Digital forms of narrative are not only characterized by their mixed, hybrid forms and content, but their recombinations 1 draw the spectator into the mix in unforeseen ways. By mixing varying degrees of non-linearity and interactivity in what are ultimately animations, digital narratives create new kinds of digital spectatorship.\n\t\t  The examples I'll explore here are three films, Conceiving Ada, Gamer, and Time Code. In different yet interconnected ways, each privileges the mix of media over content, or rather, foregrounds the mix as content. These digital narratives divert the reader/spectator/ participant from the traditional ways of making meaning--or at least sense--of narrative. \n          One way to illuminate the examples is to explore how they mix linearity and interactivity. In teaching The Theory and Practice of Digital Narrative, my students and I developed a model for analyzing how different works create new modes of storytelling, and fresh relations of looking at and within the frame.2 Extending some of the terms that Janet Murray develops in Hamlet on the Holodeck: The Future of Narrative in Cyberspace, the diagram posits an x axis of linearity and a y axis of agency.3 \n           \n            Click here for an animated version of this graph. \n          The linearity axis spans narratives from most linear (one plot line that progresses chronologically through time and space to one outcome through a series of cause and effect occurrences represented from a singular point of view) to non-linear (narratives that could be circular, rhizome-shaped, achronological, synchronic, multiple plotlines, multiple points of view, multidimensional).4 The agency axis spans media that call for very little active participation from the reader/spectator/listener to media that demands a high level of interaction. Of course, all \"reading\" is in some way active, both in the physical acts of seeing and turning pages/clicking a mouse 5 and in comprehending, imagining, remembering, and making meaning. Nevertheless, there is a distinction between page-turning and making choices in a hypermedia work, and Murray uses the term agency to suggest an \"active creation of belief\" (as opposed to Coleridge's \"willing suspension of belief\"). Digital environments require that belief be created and reinforced; as William Gibson posited in Neuromancer, the imagined place of cyberspace is a \"consensual hallucination,\" a social agreement to act as if the places in cyberspace exist. The willing creation of belief is a social agreement that relies on a like-minded community. The more self-reflexive and unconventional the narrative, the more it calls for the will to believe. \n          These examples of digital cinema \"interpellate,\" or hail, their spectators as willing agents in the common project of the creation of belief. The subjectivity that these films seek to create for their viewers is one of being an active, technologically-savvy spectator. Instead of encouraging participation in, to use Guy Debord's phrase, the society of the spectacle, these digital narratives perform a Brechtian function in a distinctly technological manner that derives from the mix of media that is digital cinema. The term \"digital cinema\" has acquired many meanings, ranging from movies shot on digital video in a manner we associate with film (i.e.: single camera) to digital exhibition of media in digitally-equipped movie theaters and streaming video on the web. Lev Manovich defines digital cinema as \"a particular case of animation which uses live action footage as one of its many elements.\"6 Manovich's historical argument suggests commonalities between the earliest moving images and current developments in digital media; animation was marginalized in the development of cinema, and although some of its techniques were adopted by the avant garde, only now animation returns at the very center of digital cinema.7 \n          Lynn Hershman Leeson's film Conceiving Ada explores digital media in both form and content. In the film Emmy, a contemporary computer software engineer, uses technology to make contact with Ada Lovelace, who invented the first computer language in Victorian England. The narrative moves between Emmy in the present day and Ada in the past as Emmy figures out how to send a software agent into the past to retrieve information. Although the plot doesn't really make sense scientifically, it resonates emotionally; despite the 150 years separating their lives, Emmy and Ada face some of the same issues as women working with technology.\n          Instead of building sets, Leeson developed a technique of blending live action footage shot against a blue screen with digitized photographs of Victorian inns. As she explains in the technical notes of the DVD of the film (and also on the Conceiving Ada website): \n          I felt it important to use the technology Ada pioneered. Virtual sets and digital sound . . . provided environments in which she moves freely through time, becomes liberated and, ultimately, moves into visibility.\n          The actors and filmmaker collaborated in what amounts to a consensual hallucination:\n          On the set, these images were maneuvered through several computers where mattes were added and images were put into perspective or enlarged. They were then laid onto digital videotape while the actors were performing. Actors could reference their location through a monitor that showed them their \"virtual\" environment. . . . The immediacy of shooting live action while simultaneously manipulating digitized backgrounds in real time was, remarkably, exhilarating.\n          \n          By mixing past and present, fact and fiction, personal and professional, digital and analog, live action and animation, Conceiving Ada tells its powerful story in both form and content. Although it is not immediately obvious that the sets are virtual rather than actual, much of the story takes place in front of and inside Emmy's computer equipment. There are many shots of Emmy gazing into the computer, trying to make her programs work, and when she does make contact with Ada, she can see her memories and talk with her on the computer screen. The film frame often encompasses the computer screen, so we too see the graphic interfaces Emmy designs and animates. By mixing some of the techniques of video art with film style and the malleability of the digital image, Leeson extends her trailblazing career in many directions at once in a work that is a mix about mix. A representation of intense digital interactivity, Conceiving Ada's heroines, creators, and spectators use technology, and specifically digital imaging technology, to create agency.\n          Like Conceiving Ada, Time Code is also an example of digital cinema that calls attention to the digital techniques used in its production, and enlists its spectators as accomplices in creating the narrative. Time Code is itself the product of improvisation, and uses digital technology to capture \"real time.\" Director Mike Figgis divides the screen into four frames; each quadrant contains a continuous 90-minute take of an unscripted, improvised performance, all shot simultaneously with four Sony Dvcam DSR-130s; the film was blocked out on music paper. Figgis describes his movie as a \"black comedy about a 90-minute slice of life in Hollywood,\" and it takes filmmaking as one of its subjects along with jealousy, infidelity, and a fin-de-siecle philosophical and artistic exhaustion. The audio mix of the theatrical release of the film shifts its emphasis between the quadrants, thus directing the spectator's attention to a certain quadrant. Choosing to focus on a quadrant is a kind of spectator-editing. Looking at the entire frame means seeing a new kind of animation, created by multiple screens, encompassing multiple points of view. (See Time Code clip here.)\n          \n          The film folds in on itself self-reflexively. The plot centers around the intersecting lives of four characters involved personally and/or professionally with Red Mullet, Inc., a movie studio (which is the real-life name of Figgis's production company; see www.red-mullet.com), and becomes increasingly Brechtian as the movie builds to the climactic scene in which a hot young independent filmmaker pitches a movie that, like the one we are watching, splits the screen and follows the interactions between four characters. In what could be taken as a manifesto for digital cinema that counters the \"chastity\" of DOGME 95 with the passionate embrace of technology, the filmmaker announces, \"Montage has created a fake reality. . . . Technology has arrived, digital video has arrived, and is demanding new expressions, new sensations. . . . It's time to say again: Art, Technology: a new union.\" She shows the studio executives storyboards of how four cameras will follow four characters, who are really four aspects of the same character at different points in their lives. But the filmmaker's passionate and theoretical speech is undercut by the context of black comedy that infuses the film: artistic praxis clashes with business practice, and all the plotlines peak as Stellan Skarsgard's Alex bursts into laughter and exclaims, \"This is the most pretentious crap I've ever heard. . . . Do you think anybody around this table has a clue about what you're talking about?\"\n          \n          Figgis assumes his audience does, that Bauhaus, Soviet montage, and Guy Debord are not as foreign to his spectators as they are to the executives; the filmmakers both within and outside the frames show their theoretical orientation.\n          Time Code is the first major work of digital cinema. It creates a new kind of animation based on subjectivity and point of view, and calls for an active creation of belief from the spectator-editor who takes in and ultimately creates the narrative of the film. The DVD extends the spectator's agency even further. Among its special features is a documentary about how the film was shot 15 times, all four cameras operating simultaneously around the actors' improvisation. Figgis chose the fifteenth version for the theatrical release, but also includes the first version on the DVD. Because the making of the film, and how it uses digital technology, is so central to the spectator's experience, the director's commentary and interviews with the cast reinforce the spectator as an active creator of belief and meaning in the film. \n          Moreover, by including a special audio mixing feature, the DVD gives the medium a new level of interactivity. Using the remote control of a DVD player, the spectator/participant can switch between the audio of the different quadrants. Because the audio is a major aspect of directing the spectator's attention (in addition to visual elements such as movement and stasis), being able to make choices in the audio mix is, to use the music metaphor that the film is based on conceptually, to become the conductor of the film.8 The medium is the mix.\n          Like Time Code and Conceiving Ada, the new French film Gamer is also a particularly digital mix. Gamer moves between live action and digital environments as its main character Tony gets the idea for, designs, and then is swindled out of a computer game. The first time the film environment switches to the game environment is when the hero is in a car chase and his car morphs into a game graphic of a car. The shift between a reality created by conventional film style and the unconventional use of game graphics style reveals the main character's subjectivity, for his reality (and other characters' as well) are constructed through their interaction in the playing and making of games. \n          Gamer is aesthetically and viscerally ambitious in the range of live action and computer graphic interfaces it moves between. The adrenalized state of game-playing mixes with a fictionalized account of game design. Gamer succeeds in creating an immersive text about two differently immersive mediums, film and computer games. When the film depicts how live action can be made digital, and both shows and denies the indexicality of the digital image, it explores the nature of digital cinema in a way that is complementary to the projects of Conceiving Ada and Time Code.\n          \n          \n           \n          In addition to fostering new relations of looking, these digital narratives make forays into nonlinearity. Conceiving Ada and Gamer both have discursive plots that revise the conventions of the linear plot, moving between nested narrative frames in time, space, and subjectivity. Time Code is in one way relentlessly linear, but its synchronic depiction of multiple physical and emotional points of view ruptures the cinematic conventions of time and space constructed by the dominant style of continuity editing. Taken separately, these three films hover around the center point of my diagram, raising the issues of agency and linearity that will continue to be at the center of digital narrative. Taken together the films offer a model of digital transformation that points the way to what is bound to be a medium that increasingly involves its audience in thinking about and then participating in increasingly immersive, nonlinear, and interactive experiences.\n          \n          Notes\n          1. In the “renew” issue of M/C, David Marshall suggests that one of the areas Cultural Studies can look to is how the culture industries that produce “recombinant culture,” make efforts “to incorporate new technologies into different forms in order to reconstitute audiences in ways that in their distinctiveness produce value that is exchangeable as capital.” This essay is part of a larger work that attempts to open up some of the avenues suggested by Marshall.

My students and I have had much discussion about what to term the bottom of the agency axis. “Passive” seems too simple, yet other terms we’ve come up with such as structured, controlled, limited, voyeuristic, or (my favorite) enslaved don’t seem to work.

In a footnote, Manovich makes an interesting point on avant-garde strategies such as collage, painting on film, combining print with animation and live action footage, and combining many images in a single frame: “what used to be exceptions for traditional cinema became the normal, intended techniques of digital filmmaking, embedded in technology design itself.” Innovative forays into the mix of digital media like my examples illuminate not only the emergence of exceptional techniques but also of innovative narrative and spectatorial strategies. \n          8. Figgis is using the quadrant method once again in a new film, Hotel, which recently finished production in Florence. During the filming, there was a brilliant site that every day had a new page with the four-quadrant split. In addition to quicktimes of footage of the shoot and the actors in the hotel where the film is set, there were some of the cleverest animations I have ever seen on the web. Unfortunately the site shut down after the shoot finished, but it will be up again in May, most likely at www.filmfour.com/hotel, but check www.red-mullet.com as well. \n           \n        \n      \n    \n",

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n\tIntroduction\n          There has been a long history of contact between Indigenous and Chinese people in Australia.  This is clearly evident within contemporary Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities through the significant presence of individuals with Chinese ancestry.  Early Indigenous-Chinese contact, however, was not sanctioned by White authorities: such contact was seen to contest White dominion and counter government anti-miscegenation policy.  Through incorporating the voices of contemporary descendants of Indigenous-Chinese unions, this paper demonstrates how White authorities resorted to removal legislation to reassert their position within normative racial discourse.\n\tContact\n          \"In these perilous times (1996), when race in Australia has suddenly become a respectable topic and there flows forth a plethora of words on and about Aborigines and Asians - the most visible, it seems, of the minorities in this land - it is perhaps pertinent to remember that, once, the two came together during those times when being descended from the Indigenous peoples of Australia was seen as a liability.\" (Mudrooroo 259)\n          Contact between Indigenous and Chinese people in Australia has a history that dates back at least 150 years.  Early Chinese immigration during the mid to late nineteenth century centred around regional Australia, away from areas highly populated by White colonists (Loh 3).  Such regions had significant Indigenous populations, and the absence of White dominance allowed relatively frequent and free association between Indigenous people and the exclusively male Chinese immigrant (Anderson and Mitchell 32-33; Choi 13; Giese 39,46; Jack et al. 52; Keen 175; May 89; Trigger 216).  Widespread hostility toward Chinese-White intercultural relationships and marriages throughout Australian society further facilitated more intimate Indigenous-Chinese relationships (May 209).\n          Across Australia, the Indigenous and the Chinese communities suffered the common indignities of segregation from and rejection by White society.  Members of both communities endured the regular embarrassment of a White Australians objections \"to sitting amongst Chinese and aborigineswatching manners which are certainly not attractive\" (May 140).  Newspapers of the time frequently scandalised \"the many evils which were rampant among aboriginals and Chinese\" (\"Relief of Aboriginals\" 5).  The two cultures were drawn together by their common experience of marginalisation from White society:\n          \"The Chinese and the Aboriginals sort of come togetherYouve only got to look at, read the history of Chinese and Aboriginal people, how they was, well, genocide tooand they sort of come to live together as a peopleHe [Chinese neighbour] didnt know that we had Chinese in us or anything, he just treated us as, as any normal human being.  Its just that the White people didnt like us thats all, so he was sort of struggling through the same sort of thing.\"\n          \"It wasnt, wasnt strange to have a name like [Chinese family name].  But to be required to get passes because we were Aboriginal, we were treated as Aborigines I guess.  In those early days it was like, in those developing towns, you found on the margins of those communities the Aboriginal community, the Chinese community.\"\n          In general, relations between the Chinese and Indigenous communities were relatively harmonious with mutual tolerance commonplace, although isolated incidences of violence have been recorded (Anderson and Mitchell 27,36; Evans et al. 257-58; Fisher 88; Giese 25,39,48; Hornadge 21-22; Jones 59; May 209; Reynolds 41; Rolls, Sojourners: Flowers and the Wild Sea 97,194,205,289-90,487; Rolls, Citizens: Flowers and the Wild Sea 34-35,87,100,106-08,188,426).  In North Queensland, Aborigines with Chinese language skills even served as translators for the Chinese in their dealings with White Australians (Anderson and Mitchell 31-32).  Tensions between Indigenous and Chinese people, it seems, were of less consequence than those between Indigenous and White Australians, who at the time were actively engaged in state-sponsored cultural genocide (Tatz 49-50).\n          Indigenous-Chinese contact led to an evolving social experience that entailed economic security and mutual benefit, including marriage and companionship, the exchange of commodities, opium and alcohol sales, and Indigenous labour for Chinese employers:\n          \"Everything was just chaos, messed up, and so I think, on Nanas side, I can understand Nana, why she done it, because he probably had a future for her  Chinese  he just had a future for her.  She knew that her family would be fed and back them days you only worried about a feed and a bed and how to survive.  So I think it was a survival thing for her, because the Aboriginal nation was just chaotic and they just messed it right up, they took everybody away.\"\n          \"I know stories from old men from Thursday Island, actually, who used to come through Darwin in the merchant, merchant navyThe Chinese and the Murris used to knock around togetherTheyd get a chicken or something from the cargo, you know, and go offer that as a bribe to some of the Aunties to sniff around the daughtersThe young fellas would sniff around all the daughters, you know, so there was, you know, a very close-knit community, intermarriages all over the place.\" \n          In Queensland, contact between Indigenous and Chinese people was especially widespread across the northern regions of the state, where there was a demand for rural labour, the allure of the gold rush, maritime trade, agricultural endeavours, and a steady stream of folk from the nearby Northern Territory.  Chinese residents outnumbered White Australians by as much as seven to one during the late nineteenth century, as a large concentration of predominantly Chinese men was created in a region remote from the southern administrative centre and seat of government in Brisbane (Jones 56,59,69,72; Ling 19,21-22; Long 29).\n\tChallenge\n          White dominion, however, was threatened by the growing alliances between Indigene and Chinese migrant.  Indigenous-Chinese contact challenged the settler-colonised binary that had underpinned racial discourse to date, and White authorites sought to counter this threat through legislation.\n          In Queensland, the \"Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897\" rendered it illegal for Chinese men to cohabit with Aboriginal women, and forbade the employment of Indigenous people by Chinese (Evans et al. 310-11; May 293).  Ganter (18) states that in the northern Burketown region, the association of resident Aborigines with local Chinese gardeners \"was often a sufficient expression of immorality to warrant removal\" to Mornington Island mission for the Aborigines involved.\n          The 1897 Act had conferred regional Protectors with peremptory powers over the lives of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders living in their jurisdiction (Blake, \"A dumping ground\" 1).  The Protector had the authority to forcibly remove any Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person if he deemed it to be in his or her, or the local Indigenous or non-Indigenous communitys, best interest (Blake, \"A dumping ground\" 51, \"Deported\" 52-55, Guthrie 7).  \n          This authority constituted an arbitrary and absolute mechanism of control over the lives of Queensland Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders: \"the threat of removal...was a salutary reminder of the necessity to respect the codes of behaviour and norms of the dominant white societythe technique par excellence for maintaining and extending European hegemony\" (Blake, \"A dumping ground\" 68, 83).\n          The behavioural codes and norms of  White society precluded Aboriginal contact with the Chinese; a separation constantly enforced with recourse to the act.  Up to 1929, Queensland State Government removal records regularly cite reasons such as \"in the habit of frequenting Chinese dens\", \"acting as spies for Chinese\", \"living an immoral life harboured by a Chinaman\", \"hang round Chinese farms and gardens\", \"frequents Chinese habitations\", \"frequenting Chinese quarters for opium and prostitution\", and \"assisting blacks to obtain drugs from Chinese\" to vindicate a removal order (Queensland State Archives A/64785, A/69523).  \n          A gamut of vices, ranging from espionage, immorality, and substance abuse to drug trafficking, thus became the official pretence for separation of the subjugated groups.  Anti-miscegenationist sentiment, too, saw the removal of Chinese-Aboriginal children (Ganter 13; May 210).  In 1901 the Queensland Police Commissioner held that in regard to cohabitation between Chinese and Aborigines, \"offspring resulting from such intercourse areby no means a desirable addition to the population\" (May 210).\n\tFear and Loss\n          White dominion was to ultimately reassert its position at the hub of normative racial discourse, with little space available for Indigenous reflection on Chinese connections:\n          \"Dad never spoke about nothingWere all born with all this long hair and Asian look about us, all of us in the family, and were trying to figure where it came from. We all look at each other and think theres got to be some thing thereI dont know why he never spoke of it or told us about it. I couldnt question that either, cause I did ask my Grandmother but I suppose youre to be seen and not heard in some thingsI probablyll have questions on my lips for the rest of my life until I find out.\"\n          \"We didnt sort of consciously grow up hearing a lot about anything Chinese, really. Its just that we all sort of had some aspect of the looklike really dark blue-black hair,slanty eyes and a couple of the family are very sort of smallThe stories were always censored and you only got little bits and piecesLike him being Chinese, well, I think that also you just didnt mentionWe didntgrow up hearing a lot about anything Chinese.\"\n          Removal brought about disconnection and loss:\n\"Im only just finding it lately, the things that I didnt know about, you know.  Even me [Chinese] Granddad, I didnt know his name until this year, really![The mission staff] told em forget about your tribe, your language, everything.  Think about Jesus.\"\n          The historical backdrop presented above, in concert with the voices of contemporary descendants of Indigenous and Chinese unions, demonstrate how White authorities employed removal legislation to counter the challenge presented by Indigenous-Chinese contacts.  For the members of these communities, who had come together under a climate of shared subjugation, this reassertion of White dominion came at great cost. \n\n\n",

But before I go into that, I want you to know that I find myself experiencing a strange and wonderful kind of peace. Hell, \n          I’ve lived 70 years already — done exactly what I wanted to do with my life. All worthwhile dreams have come true. Made my living since 1968 as a \"Performance Poet\" — Billie Barbara and I have been together for 47 years — growing closer with each passing day. We have four great kids, five neat and nifty grandchildren. All things considered, I’ve been truly blessed and whether my departure date is next year or 15 years from now I’m determined not to wreck my life by doing a lousy job with my death. LIKE HAROLD / LIKE HOWARD \n        like Harold \n          I don’t want to blow my death \n          I don’t want to see a lifetime \n          of pluck and courage \n          rubbed out by five weeks \n          of whiny fractious behavior \n          granted Harold’s was a scary way to go \n          from diagnosis to last breath \n          the cancer moving fast \n          but five weeks of bitching and moaning \n          was more than enough \n          to erase every trace of a man \n          I have wanted to emulate \n          his wife sending word \n          that even she \n          can’t remember what he was like \n          before his undignified departure \n          no — \n          I don’t want to go like Harold \n        like Howard \n          let me come swimming up \n          out of the deepening coma \n          face serene as if seen \n          through undisturbed water \n          breaking the surface \n          to eagerly take the hand \n          of bedside well wishers \n          unexpected behavior I must admit \n          as Howard has always been \n          a world class hypochondriac \n          second only to me \n          the two of us able to sit for hours \n          discussing \n          the subtle shade of a mole \n          turning each other on with long \n          drawn out organ recitals \n        in the end \n          one would have thought \n          such a legendary \n          self centered soul would cower \n          and fold up completely like Harold \n          but no — \n          when my time comes \n          let me go sweetly like Howard \n        *** April 7, 1999 \n        The treatment was decided upon. Next Monday, the good Doctor is going to pit my apricots. From here on the Sultan can rest easy when Masten hangs with his harem. Prognosis good. No more testosterone - no more growth. \n        Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m not looking forward to giving up the family jewels. I must say that over the years they’ve done me proud and to be totally honest I don’t think Billie Barbara will be all that disappointed either. I’m told that Viagra will help in this area., However, I’m also told that the drug is very expensive. Something like twelve bucks a pop. But hell, Billie Barbara and I can afford twenty four dollars a year.. \n        Some thoughts the morning of— \n        Yesterday I did a program for the Unitarian Society of Livermore. About 60 people. I had a bet with the fellow who introduced me, that at least 7 out of the 60 would come up after the reading (which would include my recent prostate musings) and share a personal war story about prostate cancer. I was right. Exactly 7 approached with an encouraging tale about themselves, a husband, a brother, a son. I was told to prepare myself for hot flashes and water retention. To which Billie Barbara said \"Join the club!\" \n        I ended the presentation with one of those inspirational poetic moments. A hot flash, if you will. \"It just occurred to me,\" I said, \" I’m going to get rich selling a bumper sticker I just thought of — REAL MEN DON’T NEED BALLS  A couple of days after the event \n        The Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula is referred to as CHOMP, and the afternoon of April 12th I must say this august institution certainly lived up to it’s name. \n        The waiting room in the Out Patient Wing is an event unto itself. Patients huddled together with friends and family, everyone speaking in hushed voices. The doomed keeping a wary eye on the ominous swinging doors, where a big tough looking nurse appeared from time to time shouting: NEXT! Actually the woman was quite sweet and mild mannered, enunciating each patient’s name in a calm friendly manner. But waiting to have done to me what was going to be done to me - the chilling word \"NEXT!\" is what I heard and \"Out Patient Wing\" certainly seemed a misnomer to me. Wasn’t the \"Out-Patient Wing\" where you went to have splinters removed? Of course I knew better, because in the pre-op interview the young interviewer, upon reading \"Bilateral Orchiectomy\" winced visibly, exclaiming under her breath \"Bummer!\" I recently came across this haiku — bilateral orchiectomy \n  the sound a patient makes \n  when he learns what it is \n        Our daughter April lives in New York and couldn’t join the Waiting Room rooting section so as her stand in \n            she sent her best friend Molly Williams. Now, Molly works as a veterinarian in a local animal shelter and a \n            when I told her my operation was supposed to take no more than half an hour, she laughed: \"Heck Ric, I’ll do \n            it in five minutes and not even use gloves.\" \n        NEXT! My turn to be led through those swinging doors, pitifully looking back over my shoulder. Wife, \n          family and friends, bravely giving me the thumbs up. Things blur and run together after that. I do remember \n          telling the nurse who was prepping me that I was afraid of being put to sleep. \"Not to worry\" she said, I’d \n          have a chance to express these fears to the anesthetist before the operation would begin. And as promised the \n          man did drop by to assure me that I would get a little something to ease my anxiety before he put me under. \n          When the moment finally arrived, he said that I might feel a slight prick as he gave me the relaxant. Of course, \n          that is the last thing I remember - the prick! Obviously, I‘d been suckered in by the mask man’s modus \n          operandi. \n        On the other side of this I surface to begin the waiting. WAITING for the catheter to be removed — for the \n          incision to heal — WAITING to see if the pain subsides and I can loose the cane — WAITING to learn if my \n          PSA will respond to treatment. Waiting—waiting—waiting—and I’ve never been a cheerful waiter. \n        *** May 7, 1999 \n        The doctor tells me I must keep taking Casodex— one a day at eleven dollars a cap - for the rest of my life. And no more doctor freebees. No wonder the listed side effect of this pricey medication is depression. But the recent funk I’ve fallen into is much deeper than dollars and cents. In the past I’ve had my share of operations and illnesses and always during the recuperation I could look forward to being my old self again. But not this time .... Not this time. \n        Funny bumper stickers can only hold reality at bay for a short while. And anyway Billie had me remove the \n          homemade REAL MEN DON’T NEED BALLS bumper sticker from the back of our car — She didn’t like the \n          dirty looks she got while driving around town alone. \n        ***  Eight months later \n        BILATERAL ORCHECTOMY \n            never could \n            look up words in the dictionary \n        in a high school assignment \n          writing an autobiography \n          I described my self as a unique person \n          scribbled in the margin \n          the teachers correction fairly chortled \n        \"unique\" not \"eunuch\" \n          how could he have known \n          that one day I would actually become \n          a misspelling \n        backed against the wall \n          by advanced prostate cancer \n          I chose the operation \n          over the enormous ongoing \n          expense of chemical castration \n        \"No big deal.\" I thought at the time \n          what’s the difference \n          they both add up to the same thing \n        but in the movies these days \n          during the hot gratuitous sex scene \n          I yawn…bored... \n          wishing they’d quit dicking around \n          and get on with the plot \n          and on TV the buxom cuties \n          that titillate around the products \n          certainly arn’t selling me anything \n          I realize now that \n          although it would probably kill them \n          the guys who went chemical \n          still have an option \n          I don’t \n        philosophically I’m the same person \n          but biologically \n          I ‘m like the picture puzzle \n          our family traditionally puts together \n          over the holidays \n          the French impressionist rendition \n          of a flower shop interior \n          in all it’s bright colorful confusion \n        this season I didn’t work the puzzle \n          quite as enthusiastically... \n          and for good reason \n          this year I know pieces are missing \n          where the orchids used to be \n        \"So?\" says I to myself \n        \"You’re still here to smell the roses.\" \n        ***  January 13, 2000 \n        Real bad news! At the third routine follow-up appointment. My urologist informs me that my PSA has started rising again. The orchectomy and Casodex are no longer keeping the cancer in remission. In the vernacular, I have become \"hormone refractory\" and there was nothing more he, as a urologist could do for me. An appointment with a local oncologist was arranged and another bone scan scheduled. The \"T\" word having finally been said the ostrich pulled his head from the sand and began looking around. Knowing what I know now, I’m still annoyed at my urologist for not telling me when I was first diagnosed to either join a support group and radically change my diet or find another urologist.

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n           Prometheus, chained to a rock, having his liver pecked out by a great bird only for the organ to grow back again each night so that the torture may be repeated afresh the next day must be the quintessential image of masculinity in crisis. This paper will consider Promethean myth and the issues it raises regarding 'creation' including: the role of creator, the relationship between creator and created, the usurping of maternal (creative) power by patriarchy and, not least, the offering of an experimental model in which masculine identity can be recreated. I argue that Promethean myth raises significant issues relating to anxieties associated with notions of masculinity and gender, which are subsequently transposed in Shelley's modernist recasting of the myth, Frankenstein. I then consider 'Promethean' science fiction film, as an area particularly concerned with re-creation, in terms of construction of the self, gender and masculinity. \n          Prometheus &amp; Creation\n          Prometheus (whose name means 'forethought') was able to foresee the future and is credited with creating man from mud/clay. As Man was inferior to other creations and unprotected, Prometheus allowed Man to walk upright [1] like the Gods. He also stole from them the gift of fire, to give to Man, and tricked the Gods into allowing Man to keep the best parts of sacrifices (giving the Gods offal, bones and fat). Thus Prometheus is regarded as the father and creator of Mankind, and as Man's benefactor and protector; whose love of Man (or love of trickery and his own cleverness) leads him to deceive the Gods. Prometheus's brother, Epimetheus (whose name means 'afterthought'), was commissioned to make all the other creations and Prometheus was to overlook his work when it was done. Due to Epimetheus's short-sightedness there were no gifts left (such as fur etc.) to bestow upon Man – the nobler animal which Prometheus was entrusted to make. Prometheus, a Titan, and illegitimate son of Iapetus and the water nymph Clymene (Kirkpatrick, 1991), helped fight against the Titans the side of Zeus, helping Zeus seize the throne. More than simple indication of a rebellious spirit, his illegitimate status (albeit as opposed to an incestuous one – Iapetus was married to his sister Themis) raises the important issues of both legitimacy and filial loyalty, so recurrent within accounts of creation (of man, and human artifice). \n          Some hold that Prometheus is punished for his deceptions i.e. over fire and the sacrifices, thus he is punished as much for his brother's failings as much as for his own ingenuity and initiative. Others maintain he is punished for refusing to tell Zeus which of Zeus's sons would overthrow him, protecting Zeus' half mortal son and his mortal mother. Zeus's father and grandfather suffered castration and usurpment at the hands of their offspring – for both Zeus and Prometheus (pro)creation is perilous. Prometheus's punishment here is for withholding a secret which accords power. In possessing knowledge (power) which could have secured his release, Prometheus is often viewed as emblematic of endurance, suffering and resistance and parental martyrdom. \n          Prometheus, as mentioned previously, was chained to a rock where a great bird came and tore at his liver [2], the liver growing back overnight for the torture to be repeated afresh the following day. Heracles, a half mortal son of Zeus, slays the bird and frees Prometheus, thus Man repays his debt by liberation of his benefactor, or, in other accounts, he is required to take Prometheus's place, and thus liberating his creator and resulting in his own enslavement. Both versions clearly show the strength of bond between Prometheus and his creation but the latter account goes further in suggesting that Man and Maker are interchangeable. \n          Also linked to Promethean myth is the creation of the first woman, Pandora. Constructed (by Jupiter at Zeus's command) on one hand as Man's punishment for Prometheus's tricks, and on the other as a gift to Man from the Gods. Her opening of 'the box', either releasing all mans ills, plagues and woes, or letting all benevolent gifts but hope escape, is seen as disastrous from either perspective. However what is emphasised is that the creation of Woman is secondary to the creation of Man. Therefore Prometheus is not the creator of humankind but of mankind. The issue of gender is an important aspect of Promethean narrative, which I discuss in the next section. \n          Gender Issues\n          Promethean myths raise a number of pertinent issues relating to gender and sexuality. Firstly they suggest that both Man and Woman are constructed [3], and that they are constructed as distinct entities, regarding Woman as inferior to Man. Secondly creative power is posited firmly with the masculine (by virtue of the male sex of both Prometheus and Jupiter), negating maternal and asserting patriarchal power. Thirdly Nature, which is associated with the feminine, is surpassed in that whilst Man is made from the earth (mud/clay) it is Prometheus who creates him (Mother Earth providing only the most basic raw materials for production); and Nature is overcome as Man is made independent of climate through the gift of fire. \n          Tensions arise in that Prometheus's fate is also linked to childbirth in so far as that which is internal is painfully rendered external (strongly raising connotations of the abject – which threatens identity boundaries). The intense connection between creation and childbirth indicates that the appropriation of power is of a power resting not with the gods, but with women. \n          The ability to see the future is seen as both frightening and reassuring. Aeschylus uses this to explain Prometheus's tolerance of his fate: he knew he had to endure pain but he knew he would be released, and thus was resigned to his suffering. As the bearer of the bleeding wound Prometheus is feminised, his punishment represents a rite of passage through which he may earn the status 'Father of Man' and reassert and define his masculine identity, hence a masochistic desire to suffer is also suggested. \n          Confrontations with the abject, the threat posed to identity, and Lacanian notions of desire in relation to the other, are subjects which problematise the myth's assertion of masculine power. I will now consider how the Promethean myth is recast in terms of modernity in the story of Frankenstein and the issues regarding male power this raises. \n          Frankenstein - A Modern Prometheus\n          Consistent with the Enlightenment spirit of renewal and reconstruction, the novel Frankenstein emerges in 1818, re-casting Promethean myth in terms of science, and placing the scientist (i.e. man) as creator. Frankenstein in both warning against assuming the power of God and placing man as creator, simultaneously expresses the hopes and fears of the transition from theocratic belief to rationality. \n          One of the strategies Frankenstein gives us through its narrative use of science and technology is a social critique and interrogation of scientific discourse made explicit through its alignment with gender discourse. In appropriating reproductive power without women, it enacts an appropriation of maternity by patriarchy. In aligning the use of this power by patriarchy with the power of the gods, it attempts to deify and justify use of this power whilst rendering women powerless and indeed superfluous. Yet as it offers the patriarchal constructs of science and technology as devoid of social responsibility, resulting in monstrous productions, it also facilitates a critique of patriarchy (Cranny Francis, 1990, p220). \n          The creature, often called 'Frankenstein' rather than 'Frankenstein's monster', is not the only 'abomination to God'. Victor Frankenstein is portrayed as a 'spoilt brat of a child', whose overindulgence results in his fantasy of omnipotent power over life itself, and leads to neglect of, and lack of care towards, his creation. Indeed he may be regarded as the true 'monster' of the piece, as he is all too clearly lacking Prometheus's vision and pastoral care [4]. \"Neither evil nor inhuman, [the creature] comes to seem little more than morally uninformed, poorly 'put together' by a human creator who has ill served both his creation and his fellow humans.\" (Telotte, 1995, p. 76). However, the model of the natural – and naturally free – man emerges in the novel from an implied pattern of subjection which demonstrates that the power the man-made constructs of science and technology give us come at great cost: \"[Power] is only made possible by what [Mary Shelley] saw as a pointedly modern devaluation of the self: by affirming that the human is, at base, just a put together thing, with no transcendent origin or purpose and bound to a half vital existence at best by material conditions of its begetting.\"(ibid.) \n          Frankenstein's power expressed through his overcoming of Nature, harnessing of technology and desire to subject the human body to his will, exhibits the modern world's mastery over the self. However it also requires the devaluation of self so that the body is regarded as subject, thus leading to our own subjection. \n          For Telotte (1995, p37), one reflection of our Promethean heritage is that as everything comes to seem machine-like and constructed, the human too finally emerges as a kind of marvellous fiction, or perhaps just another empty invention. Access to full creative potential permits entry \"into a true 'no man's land'…. a wonderland...where any wonder we might conceive, or any wondrous way we might conceive of the self, might be fashioned\". \n          Certainly the modernist recasting of Promethean myth embodies that train of thought which is most consciously aiming to discover the nature of man through (re)creating him. It offers patriarchal power as a power over the self (independent of the gods); a critique of the father; and the fantasy of (re)construction of the self at the cost of deconstruction of the body which, finally, leads to the subjection of the self. \n          The Promethean model, I maintain, serves to illuminate and further our understanding of the endurance, popularity and allure of fantasies of creation, which can be so readily found in cinematic history, and especially within the science fiction genre. This genre stands out as a medium both well suited to, and enamoured with, Promethean reworkings [5]. As religion (of which Greek mythology is a part) and science both attempt to explain the world and make it knowable they offer the reassurance, satisfaction and the illusion of security and control, whilst tantalising with notions of possible futures. Promethean science fiction film realises the visual nature of these possible futures providing us, in its future visions, with glimpses of alternative ways of seeing and being. \n          Promethean Science Fiction Film\n          Science fiction, can be seen as a 'body genre' delineated not by excess of sex, blood or emotion but by excess of control over the body as index of identity (Cook, 1999, p.193). Science fiction films can be seen to fall broadly into three categories: space flight, alien invaders and futuristic societies (Hayward, 1996, p.305). Within these, Telotte argues (Replications, 1995), most important are the images of \"human artifice\", which form a metaphor for our own human selves, and have come to dominate the contemporary science fiction film (1995, p11). \n          The science fiction film contains a structural tension that constantly rephrases central issues about the self and constructedness. Paradoxically whilst the science fiction genre profits from visions of a technological future it also displays technophobia – the promises of these fictions represent dangerous illusions with radical and subversive potential, suggesting that nature and the self may be 'reconstructable' rather than stable and unchanging. Whilst some films return us safely to a comforting stable humanity, others embrace and affirm the subversive possibilities advocating an evolution or rebirth of the human. Regardless of their conservative (The Iron Giant, 1999, Planet of the Apes, 1968) or subversive tendencies (Metropolis 1926, Blade Runner 1982, Terminator 1984), they offer the opportunity to explore \"a space of desire\" (Telotte, p. 153, 1990) a place where the self can experience a kind of otherness and possibilities exceed the experience of our normal being (The Stepford Wives 1974, The Fly 1986, Gattaca 1997 [6]). \n          What I would argue is central to the definition of a Promethean sub-genre of science fiction is the conscious depiction and understanding of the (hu)man subject or artifice as technological or scientific construction rather than natural. Often, as in Promethean myth, there is a mirroring between creator and creation, constructor and constructed, which serves to bind them despite their differences, and may often override them. Power in this genre is revealed as masculine power over the feminine, namely reproductive power; as such tensions in male identity arise and may be interrogated. \n          Promethean (film) texts have at their centre issues of what it is to be human, and within this, what it is to be a man. There is a focus on hegemonic masculinity within these texts, which serves as a measure of masculinity. Furthermore these texts are most emphatically concerned with the construction of masculinity and with masculine power. The notion of creation raises questions of paternity, motherhood, parenting, and identification with the father, although the ways in which these issues are portrayed or explored may be quite diverse. As a creation of man, rather than of 'woman', the subjects created are almost invariably 'other' to their creators, whilst often embodying the fantasies, desires and repressed fears of their makers. That otherness and difference form central organising principles in these texts is undisputable, however there also can be seen to exist a bond between creator and created which is worthy of exploration, as the progeny of man retains a close likeness (though not always physically) to its maker [7]. \n          Particularly in the Promethean strand of science fiction film we encounter the abject, posing a threat to fragile identity constructions (recalling the plight of Prometheus on his rock and his feminised position). I also maintained that 'lack' formed part of the Promethean heritage. Not only are the desires of the creators often lacking in Promethean care and vision, but their creations are revealed as in some way lacking, falling short of their creator's desire and indeed their own [8]. \n          From the very beginnings of film we see the desire to realise (see) Promethean power accorded to man and to behold his creations. The mad scientists of film such as Frankenstein (1910), Homunculus (1916), Alraune (1918), Orlacs Hande (1925) and Metropolis (1926) and Frankenstein (1931) all point to the body as source of subjection and resistance. Whilst metal robots may be made servile, \"the flesh by its very nature always rebels\" (Telotte, 1995, p. 77). Thus whilst they form a metaphor for the way the modern self is subjugated, they also suggest resistance to that subjugation, pointing to \"a tension between body and mind, humanity and its scientific attainments, the self and a cultural subjection\" (ibid.). \n          The films of the 1980's and 90's, such as Blade Runner (1982), Robocop (1987) Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1994), point towards \"the human not as ever more artificial but the artificial as ever more human\" (Telotte, 1995, p.22). However, these cyborg bodies are also gendered bodies providing metaphors for the contemporary anxieties about 'masculinities'. Just as the tale of Prometheus is problematic in that there exist many variations of the myth [9], with varying accounts capable of producing a range of readings, concepts of 'masculinity' are neither stable nor uniform, and are subject to recasting and reconstruction. Likewise in Promethean science fiction film masculine identities are multiple, fragmented and dynamic. These films do not simply recreate masculinities in the sense that they mirror extant anxieties but recreate in the sense that they 'play' with these anxieties, possibilities of otherness and permeate boundaries. We may see this 'play' as liberating, in that it offers possible ways of being and understanding difference, or conservative, reinstating hegemonic masculinity by asserting old hierarchies. \n          As versions of the myth are reconstructed what new types of creator/creature will emerge? What will they say about our understanding and experiences of \"masculinities\"? What new possibilities and identities may we envision? Perhaps the most significant aspect of our Promethean heritage is that, as Prometheus is chained to his rock and tortured, through the perpetual regeneration of his liver, almost as if to counterweight or ballast the image of masculinity in crisis, comes the 'reassuring' notion that whatever the strains cracks or injuries the patriarchal image endures: 'we can rebuild him' [10]. We not only can but will, for in doing so we are also reconstructing ourselves. \n          \n          Footnote\n          \n\n              According to Bulfinch (web) he gave him an upright stature so he could look to the Heavens and gaze on the stars. Linking to Science Fiction narratives of space exploration etc.\n            \n            \n               (Encyclopedia Mythica – [web]) -The liver was once regarded as the primary organ of our being (the heart being our contemporary equivalent) where passions and pain and were felt. \n            \n            \n                            Both physically constructed and sociologically, with woman as inferior lesser being and implying gender determinism. \n            \n            \n              This is further articulated to effect in the James Whale film (Frankenstein, 1931), where 'Henry' Frankenstein's creation is regarded as his 'first born' and notions of lineage predominate, ultimately implying he will now pursue more natural methods of (pro)creation. \n            \n            \n              Frankenstein is seen by some as the first cyborg novel in its linking of technology and creation and also often cited as the first science fiction film (although there were others). \n            \n            \n              For example in Andrew Niccol's Gattaca (1997), the creation of man occurs through conscious construction of the self, acknowledging that we are all constructed and acknowledging that masculinity must be reconstructed if it is to be validated. Patriarchy has worked to mythologise our relationship to (mother) nature, so that the human becomes distinct from the manufactured. What is perhaps the most vital aspect of the character Vincent in Gattaca is his acknowledgement that the body must be altered, restructured, reshaped and defined in order to pass from insignificance to significance in terms of hegemonic masculine identity. It is therefore through a reappraisal of the external that the internal gains validity. \n            \n            \n              See Foucault on resemblance and similitude (in The Gendered Cyborg, 2000). \n            \n            \n              See Scott Bukatman on Blade Runner in Kuhn, 1990. \n            \n            \n              The tale of Prometheus had long existed in oral traditions and folklore before Hesiod wrote of it in Theogeny and Works and Days, and Aeschylus, elaborated on Hesiod, when he wrote Prometheus Bound (460B.C). \n            \n            \n              Catchphrase used in the 1970's popular TV series The Six Million Dollar Man in relation to Steve Austin the 'bionic' character of the title. \n            \n          \nReferences\n          \nBernink, M. &amp; Cook, P.

    "abstract": "\n      \n\n         Kylie Minogue, her interviewer tells us in the October 2000 issue of Sky Magazine, is a \"fatalist\": meaning she \"believe[s] everything happens for a reason\" (Minogue \"Kylie\" 20). And what kind of reason would that be? Well, the Australian singer gives us a few clues in her interview of the previous month with Attitude, which she liberally peppers with references to her personal beliefs (Minogue \"Special K\" 43-46). When asked why she shouldn't be on top all the time, she explains: \"It's yin and yang. It's all in the balance.\" A Taoist – or at any rate Chinese – perspective then? Yet, when asked whether it's important to be a good person, she responds: \"Do unto others.\" That's St. Matthew, therefore Biblical, therefore probably Christian. But hang on. When asked about karma, she replies: \"Karma is my religion.\" That would be Hindu, or at least Buddhist, wouldn't it? Still she goes on … \"I have guilt if anything isn't right.\" Now, far be it from us to perpetuate religious stereotypes, but that does sound rather more like a Western church than either Hinduism or Buddhism. So what gives?\n        Clearly there have always been religious references made by Western pop stars, the majority of them, unsurprisingly, Christian, given that this has traditionally been the major Western religion. So there's not much new about the Christian references of Tina Arena or Céline Dion, or the thankyous to God offered up by Britney Spears or Destiny's Child. There's also little that's new in references to non-Christian religions – who can forget the Beatles' flirtation with Hinduism back in the 1960s, Tina Turner's conversion to Buddhism or Cat Stevens' to Islam in the 1970s, or the Tibetan Freedom concerts of the mid- to late nineties organised by the Beastie Boys' Adam Yauch, himself a Buddhist convert?\n        What is rather new about this phenomenon in Western pop music, above and beyond its scale, is the faintly dizzying admixture of religions to be found in the songs or words of a single artist or group, of which Kylie's interviews are a paradigmatic but hardly isolated example. The phenomenon is also evident in the title track from Affirmation, the 1999 album by Kylie's compatriots, Savage Garden, whose worldview extends from karma to a non-evangelised/ing God. In the USA, it's there in the Buddhist and Christian references which meet in Tina Turner, the Christian and neo-pagan imagery of Cyndi Lauper's recent work, and the Christian iconography which runs into buddhas on Australian beaches on REM's 1998 album Up. Of course, Madonna's album of the same year, Ray of Light, coasts on this cresting trend, its lyrics laced with terms such as angels, \"aum\", churches, earth [personified as female], Fate, Gospel, heaven, karma, prophet, \"shanti\", and sins; nor are such concerns entirely abandoned on her 2000 album Music.\n        In the UK, Robbie Williams' 1998 smash album I've Been Expecting You contains, in immediate succession, tracks entitled \"Grace\", \"Jesus in a Camper Van\", \"Heaven from Here\" … and then \"Karma Killer\". Scottish-born Annie Lennox's journey through Hare Krishna and Buddhism does not stop her continuing in the Eurythmics' pattern of the eighties and littering her words with Christian imagery, both in her nineties solo work and the songs written in collaboration with Dave Stewart for the Eurythmics' 1999 reunion. In 2000, just a year after her ordination in the Latin Tridentine Church, Irish singer Sinéad O'Connor releases Faith and Courage, with its overtones of Wicca and paganism in general, passing nods to Islam and Judaism, a mention of Rasta and part-dedication to Rastafarians, and considerable Christian content, including a rendition of the \"Kyrié Eléison\". Even U2, amongst their sometimes esoteric Christian references, find room to cross grace with karma on their 2000 album All That You Can't Leave Behind.\n        In Germany, Marius Müller-Westernhagen's controversial single \"Jesus\" from his 1998 chart-topping album Radio Maria, named after a Catholic Italian radio station, sees him in countless interviews elaborating on themes such as God as universal energy, the importance of prayer, the (unnamed but implicit) idea of karma and his interest in Buddhism. Over a long career, the eccentric Nina Hagen lurches through Christianity, Hinduism, Hare Krishna, and on towards her 2000 album Return of the Mother, where these influences are mixed with a strong Wiccan element. In France, Mylène Farmer's early gothic references to Catholicism and mystical overtones lead towards her \"Méfie-toi\" (\"Be Careful\"), from the 1999 album Innamoramento, with its references to God, the Virgin, Buddha and karma. In Italy, Gianna Nannini goes looking for the soul in her 1998 \"Peccato originale\" (\"Original sin\"), while on the same album, Cuore (Heart), invoking the Hindu gods Shiva and Brahma in her song \"Centomila\" (\"One Hundred Thousand\").\n        \"The world is craving spirituality so much right now\", Carlos Santana tells us in 1995. \"If they could sell it at McDonald's, it would be there. But it's not something you can get like that. You can only wake up to it, and music is the best alarm\" (qtd. in Obstfeld &amp; Fitzgerald 166). It seems we're dealing here with quite a significant development occurring under the auspices of postmodernism – that catch-all term for the current mood and trends in Western culture, one of whose most conspicuous manifestations is generally considered to be a pick 'n' mix attitude towards artefacts from cultures near and distant, past, present and future. This rather controversial cultural eclecticism is often flatly equated with the superficiality and commercialism of a generation with no historical or critical perspective, no interest in obtaining one, and an obsession with shopping for lifestyle accessories. Are pop's religious references, in fact, simply signifieds untied from signifiers, symbols emptied of meaning but amusing to play with? When Annie Lennox talks of doing a \"Zen hit\" (Lennox &amp; Stewart n.pag.), or Daniel Jones describes himself and Savage Garden partner Darren Hayes as being like \"Yin and Yang\" (Hayes &amp; Jones n.pag.), are they merely borrowing trendy figures of speech with no reflection on what lies – or should lie – or used to lie behind them? When Madonna samples mondial religions on Ray of Light, is she just exploiting the commercial potential inherent in this Shiva-meets-Chanel spectacle? Is there, anywhere in the entire (un)holy hotchpotch, something more profound at work? To answer this question, we'll need to take a closer look at the trends within the mixture.\n        \n          There isn't any answer in religion\n            Don't believe one who says there is\n            But… The voices are heard\n            Of all who cry\n          \n        The first clear underlying pattern is evident in these words, taken from Sinéad O'Connor's \"Petit Poulet\" on her 1997 Gospel Oak EP, where she attacks religion, but simultaneously undermines her own attack in declaring that the voices \"[o]f all who cry\" will be heard. This is the same singer who, in 1992, tears up a picture of the Pope on \"Saturday Night Live\", but who is ordained in 1999, and fills her 2000 album Faith and Courage with religious references. Such a stance can only make sense if we assume that she is assailing, in general, the organised and dogmatised version(s) of religion expounded by many churches - as well as, in particular, certain goings-on within the Catholic Church - but not religion or the God-concept in and of themselves. Similarly, in 1987, U2's Bono states his belief that \"man has ruined God\" (qtd. in Obstfeld &amp; Fitzgerald 174) – but U2 fans will know that religious, particularly Christian, allusions have far from disappeared from the band's lyrics. When Stevie Wonder admits in 1995 to being \"skeptical of churches\" (ibid. 175), or Savage Garden's Darren Hayes sings in \"Affirmation\" that he \"believe[s] that God does not endorse TV evangelists\", they are giving expression to pop's typical cynicism with regard to organised religion in the West – whether in its traditional or modern/evangelical forms. Religion, it seems, needs less organisation and more personalisation. Thus Madonna points out that she does not \"have to visit God in a specific area\" and \"like[s] Him to be everywhere\" (ibid.), while Icelandic singer Björk speaks for many when she comments: \"Well, I think no two people have the same religion, and a lot of people would call that being un-religious [sic]. But I'm actually very religious\" (n.pag.).\n        Secondly, there is a commonly-expressed sentiment that all faiths should be viewed as equally valid. Turning again to Sinéad O'Connor, we hear her sing on \"What Doesn't Belong to Me\" from Faith and Courage: \"I'm Irish, I'm English, I'm Moslem, I'm Jewish, / I'm a girl, I'm a boy\". Annie Lennox, her earlier involvement with Hare Krishna and later interest in Tibetan Buddhism notwithstanding, states categorically in 1992: \"I've never been a follower of any one religion\" (Lennox n.pag.), while Nina Hagen puts it this way: \"the words and religious group one is involved with doesn't [sic] matter\" (Hagen n.pag.). Whatever the concessions made by the Second Vatican Council or advanced by pluralist movements in Christian theology, such ideological tolerance still draws strong censure from certain conventional religious sources – Christian included – though not from all.\n        This brings us to the third and perhaps most crucial pattern. Not surprisingly, it is to our own Christian heritage that singers turn most often for ideas and images. When it comes to cross-cultural borrowings, however, this much is clear: equal all faiths may be, but equally mentioned they are not. Common appropriations include terms such as karma (Robbie Williams' 1998 \"Karma Killer\", Mylène Farmer's 1999 \"Méfie-toi\", U2's 2000 \"Grace\") and yin and yang (see the above-quoted Kylie and Savage Garden interviews), concepts like reincarnation (Tina Tuner's 1999/2000 \"Whatever You Need\") and non-attachment (Madonna's 1998 \"To Have and Not to Hold\"), and practices such as yoga (from Madonna through to Sting) and even tantrism (Sting, again). Significantly, all of these are drawn from the Eastern faiths, notably Hinduism, Buddhism and Taoism, though they also bear a strong relation to ideas found in various neo-pagan religions such as Wicca, as well as in many mystical traditions.\n        Eastern religions, neo-paganism, mysticism: these are of course the chief sources of inspiration for the so-called New Age, which constitutes an ill-defined, shape-shifting conglomeration of beliefs standing outside the mainstream Middle Eastern/Western monotheistic religious pantheon. As traditional organised religion comes under attack, opening up the possibility of a personal spirituality where we can pick and choose, and as we simultaneously seek to redress the imbalance of religious understanding by extending tolerance to other faiths, it is unsurprising that we are looking for alternatives to the typical dogmatism of Christianity, Islam and even Judaism, to what German singer Westernhagen sees as the \"punishing God\" of the West (\"Rock-Star\" n.pag.). Instead, we find ourselves drawn to those distant faiths whose principles seem, suddenly, to have so much to offer us, including a path out of the self-imposed narrow-mindedness with which, all too often, the major Western religions seem to have become overlaid.\n        Despite certain differences, the Eastern faiths and their New Age Western counterparts typically speak of a life force grounding all the particular manifestations we see about us, a balance between male and female principles, and a reverence for nature, while avoiding hierarchies, dogma, and evangelism, and respecting the equal legitimacy of all religions. The last of these points has already been mentioned as a central issue in pop spirituality, and it is not difficult to see that the others dovetail with contemporary Western cultural ideals and concerns: defending human rights, promoting freedom, equality and tolerance, establishing international peace, and protecting the environment. However limited our understanding of Eastern religions may be, however convenient that may prove, and however questionable some of our cultural ideals might seem, whether because of their naïveté or their implicit imperialism, the message is coming through loud and clear in the world of pop: we are all part of one world, and we'd better work together. Madonna expresses it this way in \"Impressive Instant\" on her 2000 album, Music:\n        \n          Cosmic systems intertwine\n            Astral bodies drip like wine\n            All of nature ebbs and flows\n            Comets shoot across the sky\n            Can't explain the reasons why\n            This is how creation goes\n          \n        Her words echo what others have said. In \"Jag är gud\" (\"I am god\") from her 1991 En blekt blondins hjärta (A Bleached Blonde's Heart), the Swedish Eva Dahlgren sings: \"varje själ / är en del / jag är / jag är gud\" (\"every soul / is a part / I am / I am god\"); in a 1995 interview Sting observes: \"The Godhead, or whatever you want to call it - it's better not to give it a name, is encoded in our being\" (n.pag.); while Westernhagen remarks in 1998: \"I believe in God as universal energy. God is omnipresent. Everyone can be Jesus. And in everyone there is divine energy. I am convinced that every action on the part of an individual influences the whole universe\" (\"Jesus\" n.pag.; my transl.).\n        In short, as Janet Jackson puts it in \"Special\" from her 1997 The Velvet Rope: \"You have to learn to water your spiritual garden\". Secularism is on its way out – perhaps playing the material girl or getting sorted for E's &amp; wizz wasn't enough after all – and religion, it seems, is on its way back in. Naturally, there is no denying that pop is also variously about entertainment, relaxation, rebellion, vanity or commercialism, and that it can, from time to time and place to place, descend into hatred and bigotry. Moreover, pop singers are as guilty as everyone else of, at least some of the time, choosing words carelessly, perhaps merely picking up on something that is in the air. But by and large, pop is a good barometer of wider society, whose trends it, in turn, influences and reinforces: in other words, that something in the air really is in the air.\n        Then again, it's all very well for pop stars to dish up a liberal religious smorgasbord, assuring us that \"All is Full of Love\" (Björk) or praising the \"Circle of Life\" (Elton John), but what purpose does this fulfil? Do we really need to hear this? Is it going to change anything? We've long known, thanks to John Lennon, that you can imagine a liberal agenda, supporting human rights or peace initiatives, without religion – so where does religion fit in?\n        It has been suggested that the emphasis of religion is gradually changing, moving away from the traditional Western focus on transcendence, the soul and the afterlife. Derrida has claimed that religion is equally, or even more importantly, about hospitality, about human beings experiencing and acting out of a sense of the communal responsibility of each to all others. This is a view of God as, essentially, the idealised sum of humanity's humanity. And Derrida is not alone in giving voice to such musings. The Dalai Lama has implied that the key to spirituality in our time is \"a sense of universal responsibility\" (n.pag.), while Vaclav Havel has described transcendence as \"a hand reached out to those close to us, to foreigners, to the human community, to all living creatures, to nature, to the universe\" (n.pag.).\n        It may well be that those who are attempting to verbalise a liberal agenda and clothe it in expressive metaphors are discovering that there are - and have always been - many useful tools among the global religions, and many sources of inspiration among the tolerant, pluralistic faiths of the East. John Lennon's imaginings aside, then, let us briefly revisit the world of pop. Nina Hagen's 1986 message \"Love your world\", from \"World Now\", a plea for peace repeated in varying forms throughout her career, finds this formulation in 2000 on the title track of Return of the Mother: \"My revelation is a revolution / Establish justice for all in my world\". In 1997, Sinéad points out in \"4 My Love\" from her Gospel Oak EP: \"God's children deserve to / sleep safe in the night now love\", while in the same year, in \"Alarm Call\" from Homogenic, Björk speaks of her desire to \"free the human race from suffering\" with the help of music and goes on: \"I'm no fucking Buddhist but this is enlightenment\". In 1999, the Artist Formerly Known as Prince tells an interviewer that \"either we can get in here now and fix [our problems] and do the best we can to help God fix [them], or we can... [y]ou know, punch the clock in\" (4). So, then, instead of encouraging the punching in of clocks, here is pop being used as a clarion-call to the faith-full.\n        Yet pop - think Band Aid, Live Aid and Net Aid - is not just about words. When, in the 2000 song \"Peace on Earth\", Bono sings \"Heaven on Earth / We need it now\" or when, in \"Grace\", he begs for grace to be allowed to cancel out karma, he is already playing his part in fronting the Drop the Debt campaign for Jubilee 2000, while U2 supports organisations such as Amnesty International, Greenpeace and War Child. It is no coincidence that the Eurythmics choose to entitle their 1999 comeback album Peace, or give one of its tracks a name with a strong Biblical allusion, \"Power to the Meek\": not only has Annie Lennox been a prominent supporter of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan cause, but she and Dave Stewart have divided the proceeds of their album and accompanying world tour between Amnesty International and Greenpeace. Religion, it appears, can offer more than hackneyed rhymes: it can form a convenient metaphorical basis for solidarity and unity for those who are, so to speak, prepared to put their money - and time and effort - where their mouths are.\n        Annie Lennox tells an interviewer in 1992: \"I hate to disappoint you, but I don't have any answers, I'm afraid. I've only written about the questions.\" (n.pag). If a cursory glance at contemporary Western pop tells us anything, it is that religion, in its broadest and most encompassing sense, while not necessarily offering all the important answers, is at any rate no longer seen to lie beyond the parameters of the important questions. This is, perhaps, the crux of today's increasing trend towards religious eclecticism. When Buddha meets Christ, or karma intersects with grace, or the Earth Goddess bumps into Shiva, those who've engineered these encounters are - moving beyond secularism but also beyond devotion to any one religion - asking questions, seeking a path forward, and hoping that at the points of intersection, new possibilities, new answers - and perhaps even new questions - will be found.\n          \n        References\n        \n              Björk. \"Björk FAQ.\" [Compiled by Lunargirl.] Björk - The Ultimate Intimate. 1999. 26 Jan. 2001. &lt;http://bjork.intimate.org/quotes/&gt;.\n\n            Dalai Lama. \"The Nobel [Peace] Lecture.\" [Speech delivered on 11.12.89.] His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet.

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n       \n                     The importance and power of the biomedical approach to health and illness cannot be under-estimated. It has underpinned Western understandings of medical science and technology; it has informed health systems and the training of medical personnel; and arguably it has become articulated in patients' experience of illness and treatment. The roots of this model are traced to the valorization of rational thought in the Enlightenment which, according to Lupton, was accompanied by the increasing professionalisation of medicine through university training of doctors and control over their licences to practice. Further, she argues the discovery of bacterial causes of scourges like tuberculosis, cholera and typhoid in the nineteenth century further increased the power and status of the profession to the extent that excellence in medicine became more closely associated with rigorous scientific knowledge than empathic bedside manner (84). The emerging doctrine of specific aetiology that evolved into biomedicine had replaced the older philosophical understanding of health as a state of equilibrium and disease as a lack of harmony between people and their environment (Dubos, 5-6; Morgan, Calnan and Manning 15). The patient's interpretation of illness and symptoms became reconfigured by the doctor as an identifiable disease state that can be investigated and (usually) treated, pharmacologically or surgically. \n          Engel acknowledged the power of the biomedical model but labelled it reductionistic and dualistic. He said that it reduced illness to chemistry and physics and separated bodies from minds while conceptualising bodies as machines (131). Biochemical or biophysical abnormality becomes the criterion for diagnosis of the disease and the treatment of illness. The authoritative, objective, and scientific approach to medicine that constructs illness as not more than, but also no less than, a biochemical/physical effect of disease, in turn, constructs medical care as interventionist, scientific and empirical, but above all as the privileged domain of the physician. The same approach that defines the role of the physician ascribes a complementary but dependent role for the patient. The ill, after all, are expected to seek and then undergo treatment. \n          Within such a paradigm, Parsons proposed an influential and much quoted set of institutionalised social expectations associated with the \"sick role\" to distinguish people who are ill from those who are well. Briefly, according to his theory, the sick person has some social privileges but also some social obligations: exemption from other normal social roles depending on the nature and seriousness of the illness; not responsible for the illness; should be motivated to get well; and should seek and co-operate with the treatment offered (436-37). Parsons' functionalism with its assumption of a homogeneous social structure and value system has attracted considerable criticism. At the very least, he did not differentiate between different medical conditions and their social and cultural implications. But, that said, his \"sick role\" or modified versions of it remains tied up with the biomedical framework of its context. \n          Meanings of Illness or Minds, Emotions and Social Processes\n          Ideas about illness (and wellness for that matter) are culturally dependent. Illness as the opposite of wellness, as non-health, is an impaired sense of well-being and in that sense at least, requires some self-diagnosis before treatment is sought. Individuals make judgements about their health against prevailing implicit standards of what it is to feel well (Eisenberg and Kleinman 13). As the cultural norms of illness change over time, what it means to be sick and what the \"sick role\" entails changes too (Christopoulos 93). The discursive label of illness, especially if the disease has specific moral connotations surrounding it, can have considerable consequences for the patient and their social identity to the extent that the \"clinical label becomes a master status, one that swamps all other identities and compresses the identity of the person into a narrow and constricting mould\" (George and Davis, 266) and circumscribes their sick role. \n          Morris sees biomedicine as cultural discourse, specifically as a modernist narrative which is being challenged increasingly by \"powerful alternative narratives that view human illness not as the malfunction of a biophysical mechanism but as the unique experience of a meaning-making and embodied cultural being\" (7). Arthur Frank, Thomas Couser, Anne Hawkins and others have demonstrated how control of current understandings of illness is indeed moving away from medical practitioners and towards the patients themselves as they challenge the restriction and passivity of their sick role. The work of these researchers charts changing representations of illness as patients who choose to publish their narratives attempt to find meaning in their experience of illness. The narratives these people tell are often at odds with the biomedical accounts of their illness, or at least they are telling a different type of story - one that involves their reaction to and their experience of serious illness rather than just its onset, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. These stories are sometimes triumphal accounts of overcoming illness, designed to inspire others in similar situations; sometimes dark, emotional accounts of overwhelming adversity and suffering. In providing such introspections of the meaning of illness for the patient's life (and even anticipations of death too), these texts re-negotiate the sick role. They are empowering accounts because they disrupt the sense of the sick role as a passive and silent state (Frank 3). \n          The stories can be found in full length autobiographical accounts of encounters with serious illness like those discussed by Frank, Couser, and also Hawkins, but they are evident across a range of the mass media as well. Women's magazines are a particularly rich source where illness experiences of celebrities and ordinary folk are mixed in with other gossip, scandal, features and advice (Bonner and McKay 2000). Reality television shows (for example, those set in hospitals) also occasionally feature patients' experiences and their quest for meaning for their illness. While the internet offers unprecedented access to detailed medical information, dedicated sites also provide spaces for patients to tell their stories and chat rooms give the opportunity for patient-patient access and interaction in the absence of doctors. These electronic \"virtual\" communities provide new interactive forums for those with chronic conditions to discuss their fears, their needs and their activities (Patsos; Hardey). The texts produced by these media constitute a different version of the sick role and augment the meanings of illness by providing alternative or at least parallel resources to conventional medical interaction for those who are ill, their carers or those with vicarious interest. \n          As Foucault demonstrated, medical knowledge, its associated \"clinical gaze\" and the representation of illness always need to be seen in its socio-historical context. The understanding of this \"provides a perspective which is able to show, as does the cross-cultural perspective offered by anthropology, that the conventions of western biomedicine are no more 'scientific' or 'objective' than medical systems in other cultures or in other times\" (Lupton 15). This type of approach does not necessarily call into question the medical definitions of disease, but points out the limitations of biomedicine without due attention to more cultural approaches. In that sense, the proliferation of patients' stories should be seen as a reaction to (rather than a rejection of) biomedicine and its modernist perspective that situates illness more in the professional domain of the doctor than in the experiential domain of the patient. Indeed, as Morris notes, \"modernist biomedicine with its dualistic and reductive language of disease mechanisms now co-exists uneasily with a new concern (irreducible to mechanisms) for the role played in illness by minds, emotions, and social processes\" (7). \n          \n          References\n          \nBonner, F., &amp; S.McKay. \"Challenges, Determination and Triumphs: Inspirational Discourse in Women's Magazine Health Stories.\" Continuum: Journal of Media and Cultural Studies 14.2 (2000): 133-144.\n            Christopoulos, Katerina. \"The Sick Role in Literature and Society.\" Journal of the American Medical Association 285.1 (3 January 2001): 93.\n            Couser, G.

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n           In the 1980's, I was privileged to attend the profession ceremony of my sister into the Catholic Sisters of St. Joseph (SSJ). She entered the convent in the fall after her high school graduation and, ten years later, had decided that she was ready to make her final vows and commit her life to the work of God on earth and to this particular apostolic community. Though I was happy that my sister was following her calling in life, I worried that she was committing herself to an unnecessarily harsh life, ruled by the long-standing patriarchy of the Catholic Church. I didn't have much faith that the Church, in its tradition and dogma, could accommodate my sister's spirit of activism and desire to bring about social justice. However, this ceremony, designed and enacted by the SSJ, changed my mind about the possibilities. They demonstrated how \"sisterhood\" and life in community would position my sister to affect change in the community and allow her to participate in the creation of a kinder, more inclusive version of the Catholic religion. \n          The profession ceremony and the accompanying mass, though they reflected the new directions in the Church, were unlike any other Catholic ceremonies that I had ever experienced. In a break from the usual service, the Sisters performed the majority of the activities of the mass. A priest (male, of course) was present only to carry out the consecration of the host for communion services and to give the blessing. The taking of such freedom in the mass by the Sisters was something that was unheard of in earlier days in the Church. In the Catholicism that I knew, the strictly ordered rituals of the mass were to be enacted by the priest and observed by the congregation. The enactment of mass also served as a subliminal vehicle for hierarchically ordering the congregation: from God to priests, to nuns, and finally to the people. \n          The positioning of priests and nuns and their respective roles in the church has been an ongoing struggle for nuns since Vatican II, a series of councils created in 1962 by Pope John XXIII to update the workings and interactions of the Church (http://www.rcchurch/vatican2/). Religious orders were given much more autonomy over their lives and lifestyles, but little had changed in regard to the hierarchy. In 1979 when the Pope visited the U.S., women religious urged him to allow greater recognition and participation for nuns. Theresa Kane, president of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious (LCWR) asked the Pope on behalf of all nuns to \"respond by providing the possibility of women as persons being included in all ministries of the church\" (Kane, in McNamara, 1996, p.663). Their request went unheeded. Even now, with the turn of a new century, Catholic women religious are still denied the privilege of becoming priests or moving into positions of power within the Church. It has been a great disappointment for many nuns, but they have persevered and created new ways of operating. They changed into contemporary dress, moved beyond just teaching and nursing positions and took up social activism in earnest (Rogers, 1996). They have been bolstered by their desire to make a difference in the church and society, and are determined to find alternative ways to have their voices heard in their work of serving the people. \n          My sister's commitment ceremony also broke from Catholic tradition and reflected the new directions of the SSJ. She based her personal statement of commitment on the Shakertown Pledge, making a connection to another monastic community, the Shakers, who live simply in the service of God and community (http://www.nypl.org). Among others, she made promises of becoming a world citizen, leading an ecologically sound life, living a life of creative simplicity, sharing of her personal wealth with the poor, renewing herself through prayer, meditation, and study, and responsibly participating in a community of faith. This personal statement was followed by her formal commitment to the Sisters of St. Joseph. To the President of the SSJ, (no longer a Mother Superior), my sister vowed to unite her life to the Community, bring the Gospel to the people and seek union of neighbor with neighbor through commitments to poverty, celibacy and obedience. She received a plain gold wedding band, not as a \"bride of Christ\", but as a symbol of her commitment to God, the community of the SSJ, and the world community. \n          In their simplicity and sincerity, the vows touched my heart. My sister had moved from our nuclear family into a new family of the SSJ and the world. Her work and the world in which she moved would certainly be different than the one we had envisioned throughout our childhood together. According to Schneiders (2000), it is much more difficult today to \"locate\" and \"situate\" women religious. Unlike nuns of the earlier part of the century, my sister would not be secluded in a convent, away from people and identifiable only by a flowing black habit and service in an insular community. The world was open to her to find her ministry. In these times, many religious orders find and create their own ministries, like a \"bricolage\", pieceworking solutions to individually fit the myriad of life situations. Schneiders (2000, p. xxvii) describes the phenomenon in this way: \"The unity of the final product and its utility result not from a preordained plan correctly followed but from the inner directedness of the one creating.\" More than likely, the possibility of continually being involved in creative change was the lure of the SSJ for my sister. For the SSJ, the ever-changing, creative nature of their work allows them the freedom to work in places where ministries are most needed. \n          The Sisters of St. Joseph use their marginalized position in the Church and society as a position for change. At the profession ceremony, the Sisters had found an alternative way to reach the people and serve their congregation. They knowingly pushed the limits of tradition in the church as they expanded their participation in the ceremony and the mass. Then and in the present time, the SSJ, like bell hooks, choose to live on the margins of society for a reason; the margins are \"a site one stays in, clings to even, because it nourishes one's capacity to react. It offers to one the possibility of a radical perspective from which to see and create, to imagine alternative-new worlds (1990, pp. 149-50).\" At the ceremony, members of the SSJ made statements of ongoing commitment to service and their ministries. They spoke in support of poor people, disabled people, those labeled as criminals, and for all those who were not getting their fair share of life. \n          The SSJ profoundly believe in God \"who is the origin of all that is\", and they seek \"the union of ourselves and all people with God and with one another in and through Christ Jesus\" (1987, Constitution of the Sisters of St. Joseph, p. 3; http://www.nd.edu/~csjus/home.html). For the SSJ, this charism means becoming prophets of the Church. Like their founding order, the Sisters of St. Joseph of Le Puy, France in the seventeenth century, they continually seek out those people and organizations that are in need and create solutions with them. Once programs are established and integrated into the community, they move on to the next area of need. Similarly, they see their formation as Sisters of St. Joseph as a \"lifelong process\" (SSJ Constitution, p. 18). \n          After the seriousness of the vows and statements, the profession ceremony became a celebration. Happiness and energy filled the chapel as people smiled widely and enthusiastically joined in the singing of hymns. The final song, an old Black spiritual, \"Oh, Happy Day\", nearly brought the house down. It was the most emotional group expression I had ever seen in a Catholic service. A special experience had been co-created and shared by all of us, even the many long-time traditional Catholics who all responded enthusiastically. With the staid protocol of the mass was cast aside, the spirit of the people took over. Pearce and Cronen (1980) would propose that we, the nuns and laity, in our conjoint action, had reached a moment of liberation; we were able \n            to create a new way of being in the Catholic Church. \n          In their work, the SSJ accept and circumvent the worldly struggles they face with the Catholic Church by acting in a spirit of connection with the people and the community. In their ongoing ministries, the SSJ give witness to their \"love of God and neighbor by living simply and working for a more just society\" (SSJ Constitution, p. 12). They often struggle with the most difficult of situations and work with the most unfortunate members of society. With their love of God and service, they encourage community members to work with them to change not only the daily conditions of life, but also, the way the Church and others in the community understand and accept all people. The Catholic religion in this form is reachable; the Creator, positioned as God, works through and is simultaneously created in the actions and words of the people. In a circular fashion, God is connected with people, and people are connected neighbor to neighbor, as they connect with the spirit and word of God. In this way, the SSJ continually work toward and create their goal \"that all may be one.\" \n          At the profession ceremony, the people took this gift of spirit with them and, hopefully, were inspired to begin connecting in new ways with the people and chosen God/spirit of their own lives. When my sister first entered the convent, I used to wonder why nuns thanked each other after sharing a religious service. After participating in the profession ceremony, I knew. Thank you, Teresa. \n        \n      \n    ",

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n          \n            Lovecraft applies the term \"Outsider\" to this thing or entity, the Thing, which arrives and passes at the edge, which is linear yet multiple, \"teeming, seething, swelling, foaming, spreading like an infectious disease, this nameless horror.\"\n              Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, \n          A Thousand Plateaus (1987, 245) \n          \n          In the opening sequence to John Carpenter's The Thing (Universal Pictures, 1982), a lone husky flees a Norwegian gunman across the Antarctic tundra. The dog is resuced by an American scientific team and the gunman is killed, leaving no explanation for the hunt. Later, when the dog is caged along with the American husky pack, it mutates violently, attacking the other dogs and members of the expedition. It becomes apparent that what the Americans have taken into their isolated community is an alien lifeform capable of adopting the form of creatures it kills, and the team have no way of knowing who has been replicated/replaced already. \n          Given that Carpenter unashamedly borrows images and dialogue from Howard Hawks in so many of his other films, it is ironic that this film should self-consciously avoid borrowing from Hawks's The Thing From Another World (RKO, 1951 [Dir: Christian Nyby]), of which it is ostensibly a remake. Hawks's Arctic Cold War story is replaced by an Antarctic horror tale-the two films are literally poles apart. The obvious key to this difference is that Rob Bottin's special effects wizardry enables Carpenter (through Bill Lancaster's screenplay) to adhere more closely to the plot of John W. Campbell's 1938 novella (\"Who Goes There?\") about a shape-shifting menace generating paranoia among inhabitants of a small community. \n          Hawks's film (screenplay by Charles Lederer) also hinges on a sense of paranoia, but its source is unequivocal: Hawks's alien is little more than a blood-sucking vegetable from space. Paranoia in Carpenter's film has something to do with the fear of being killed, but is also as much a matter of not knowing what form the enemy is taking at any point in time. Of course, the special effects do not contribute to this uncertainty-the paranoia is at its most intense when things appear to be normal. Yet this intensity is fed in the first instance by knowing the excesses of which \"the thing\" is capable when forced to reveal itself. \n          The irony of this remake not being made in the image of its original is compounded by the fact that Carpenter's film was panned by critics and failed badly at the box office on its release in 1982-by contrast, the 1951 version is widely considered to be a classic, credited with starting the alien SF film boom of the 1950s. More recently, Carpenter's film has acquired something of a cult status. Indeed, a 1999 poll by British Total Film magazine rated The Thing as the eleventh scariest film of all time. Yet clearly the \"gore factor\" which gives to such a film its cult status was a contributing factor in its initial failure, although I think it is necessary to be sure of what we mean when we say this. The timing of the release of The Thing is generally thought to have been a major factor, based on the assumption that a filmgoing public still enamoured with Spielberg's E.T. was always going to be unreceptive to Carpenter's shapeshifting horror. What may be even more pertinent was that Carpenter's horror was released onto the big screen about the time that this same filmgoing public was coming to terms with a new \"horror\": the advent of AIDS. \n          I recently read a commentary on the resurgence of interest in The Thing, in which the author claims that Carpenter's film functioned in 1982 as a cold war metaphor after the manner of the 1951 original, and that it is the potential AIDS resonances in the film-in as much as \"the only way to detect alien infection is a 'blood test'\"-which strike a chord with newer audiences. To my way of thinking, Bryant Frazer's review for Deep Focus provides a more appropriate assessment of the immediate context for The Thing when he categorises it \"as part of a movement in genre film that dealt with biological horror\" along with films like Ridley Scott's Alien and David Cronenberg's Scanners and Videodrome. As Frazer observes, these films provide \"unsettling visions of anxiety over the physical nature of our bodies, and of the possibility that our essential natures may be changed by alien entities, by pollutants and disease\". \n          Yet Carpenter's film sits uneasily alongside other biohorror films, perhaps because it is such an extreme product of this movement. Scott's virtually indestructible xenomorph literally burst (through John Hurt's chest) onto cinema screens to terrorise audiences by its capacity to turn human beings into expendable commodities (mere links on the food chain or hosts along the creature's parasitic life cycle). Yet this alien's capacity for the spectacular kill is dwarfed by Carpenter's outrageous shapeshifter, sprouting tentacles, serpentine heads, razor-sharp teeth, and other amorphous extensions from what would seem to be normal bodies. \n          Mainstream cinema audiences may have loved Spielberg's tubby, telecommunicating extraterrestrial enough to shun Carpenter's killer, but it may be that even fans of Scott's space monster might have failed to share in the spirit of Carpenter's knowing wink at excess-recall the response of Windows (Thomas Waites) when a severed head sprouts legs and scuttles away: \"You've got to be fucking kidding.\" The irony is that, in spite of its obvious excesses, Carpenter's alien is still closer to home than Scott's: the latter occupies the human body by infestation, the former by infection. Frazer makes explicit the particular resonance of this difference in the biohorror film: \"The Thing can be read as a parable of the self-destructive 'witch-hunt' mentality, or of the ravages that an insidious killer like AIDS (just blossoming as The Thing was being shot) can wreak on the survivors, as well as those infected.\" \n          The point to be made here is that the excesses of Carpenter's film may not, in and of themselves, be sufficient to explain its capacity to unnerve its potential audience at the time of its release. In 1982, the syndrome formerly identified as GRID (Gay-Related Immune Deficiency) was renamed AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) as it was discovered that the agent, \"possibly a virus that could be spread through blood,\" could affect people other than just gay men: the first recipient by blood transfusion was identified in the United States as were the first affected infants (Avert: AIDS History). \n          Perhaps unwittingly, Carpenter's film mirrors the spread of discourses about the AIDS syndrome, as much as its monster mirrors the virus itself. The fact that the protagonists in the film are all men living in isolation provides a none too subtle reference to the gay male community to which it was initially thought that GRID could be solely attributed. In the film, as in society, the potential for the menace to spread beyond this immediate community is identified with the knowledge that it spreads through blood, a knowledge that translates into moral panic. When Copper (Richard A. Dysart) discovers through a computer simulation-closely resembling a simulation called \"life,\" which I remember playing in the 1980s-that \"the thing\" could consume the human race within days, he determines to stop the spread, and when Copper dies, Blair (Wilfrid Grimley) responds even more violently by trying to cut the team off from its external contacts and supplies. \n          Thus, what the film reflects back to its audience is a recognition that the spread of panic associated with AIDS is every bit as insidious as the spread of the virus associated with the same syndrome. This panic operates by isolating and targeting the victims as though they are the infection themselves, potential killers. Initially, this could be done at group levels-for example, the gay male community at first, then drug users, and so on-yet it ultimately proceeds by reducing the limits of the abject, until all that is left is to isolate the individual in each instance. To have been infected is in itself enough to be identified as having the characteristics of any number of the social evils associated with the spread of the virus, but it is nevertheless enough also to be characterised as a threat of infection to the rest of the human race. In this sense, the victim becomes the virus. \n          The reader may now sense the relevance of the reference to Deleuze and Guattari with which I framed this essay at the outset. The epigraph is taken from \"1730: Becoming-Intense, Becoming-Animal, Becoming-Imperceptible . . .\" (A Thousand Plateaus, 1987, 232-309), an essay that remains the duo's most sustained elaboration of the processes of \"becoming.\" Borrowing the concept for my purposes here, it can be said that The Thing represents in spectacular form the process of victim becoming virus via mechanisms of social isolation: alienation is literalised in the becoming-alien of members of an already isolated community. \n          Central to an understanding of becoming as a process is the relationship between single and multiple phenomena; \"between the pack and the loner; between mass contagion and preferential alliance; between pure multiplicity and the exceptional individual\" (244). In The Thing, we may recall, the first inclination we have that something is amiss is that a lone husky (nominally a pack animal) is fleeing a crazed gunman. Deleuze and Guattari enable the concept of the pack to fade into the process of contagion. When the isolated animal is restored to a pack existence, contagion is immediately literalised in the film: it first seems to act as though it is sick, and then we are introduced to the spectacle of this shapeshifter in extremis, spreading itself out into the pack, and then into the community. \n          From this early point in the film, we can no longer be in any doubt that becoming-alien through the mechanism of contagion has nothing to do with the coming into reality of a higher order of being, or of the realisation of potential states, etcetera. Commenting on becoming, Catherine Malabou points out that the Deleuzo-Guattarian understanding is a removal of the concept from \"the Hegelian definition of an intermediate state between being and nothingness,\" as it is \"not a hesitation between the abyssal vertigo of absence of form and the security of a particular incarnation\" (\"Who's Afraid,\" 1996, 125). For it is precisely at the moment that the animal is ushered towards its apparent destiny at the border of the pack that it lashes out against the security of the pack existence. \n          Instead, The Thing offers a representation of the imposition of the molecular onto the incarnate. For this reason, I consider the film to be a neat container for what remains one of Deleuze and Guattari's more elusive concepts. It demonstrates that \"becoming\" includes processes at every level from the microbial to the communal, leading us to conclude that the spread of the contagion is inseparable from the panic that consumes the community: they are precisely one and the same process of becoming-alien. For a film to visually represent this relation, of course, what must be rendered visible are the intensities that characterise all becomings, hence the visual excesses to which it goes. \n          It is to these intensities, more so than just the \"gore factor\" alone, that I think audiences react when they view The Thing, cognisant of the spectre of AIDS. The shapeshifter's metamorphoses are not merely excessive, they are intense, which is to say that they are tenuous (and yet tenable) threads in the process of becoming-alien, which we have seen cuts across the molecular and the communal to unite the social with the physiological. Clifford M. Skoog observes that Deleuze's use of biological terminology with reference to social phenomena and their effects is not strictly referential, nor is it metaphorical: \"His work in any case powerfully evokes the kinds of processes we observe in life at its cellular and molecular levels, and is especially provocative concerning the extent to which we might look at language and social life as incorporating a 're-incarnation' of life's most elemental processes\" (Thinking's Legacy and the Evolution of Experience, 1998). \n          Carpenter's film, I suggest, evokes much the same connection between discursive and social realities and the elemental stuff of which we are made, all of which is fleeting. In reflecting back to us the social context for the \"witch-hunt\" mentality, or by literalising the process by which the victim becomes the contagion in the eyes of the witch-hunters, The Thing also provides a stark reminder of the physical limits by which we are bound. Held in the grip of contagion, as our bodies succumb at the cellular level to infection, do we somehow cease to be ourselves? Yet the question is not one of physical essences, as our \"selves\" are defined as much in the social extensions of the body, in the eye of the beholder, as it were, a Deleuzian point brought home to the audience with intensity by The Thing. Becoming, in this sense, is an unbecoming thing, for it is the very opposite of belonging. It turns away from well-being, from being well, or perhaps from being per se. Do we therefore turn away from becoming? Or, as the resurgence in interest in The Thing in the last few years might prompt us to ask, have we begun at last to look back at the unbecoming things from which we have averted our gaze for so long.\n          \n          References\n          \nDeleuze, Gilles &amp; Félix Guattari.

A fitting designation, he thought for the paternal man-god of an insignificant water planet-- a god beset on one hand by the most ordinary of human emotions and on the other serving as the crux of impenetrable mysteries. By any measure though, this Yahweh was a small figure indeed compared to deities of higher cardinality such as the ineffably beautiful Aleph Three god of the aboreals of Ka'a Ntg whose very name can only be approximated by a metaphorical conjunction of the galactagrams for \"starwheel\", \"phoenix\", and \"beyond all attributes\". \n          For countless millennia the graceful metallocrete arch of Brother Clothren's Order of Remembrance has lifted its motto in archaic Fa'an into the dazzling night sky of Kletha. Etched on crystal lithium, its sinuous script reads, \"Choose as gods might choose, those few things to be honored with perpetual remembrance.\" \n          The surprising proof of Meinong's Conjecture in ages past had established the existence of non-intersecting realms of deities as irrefutable fact - deities wrought into existence solely by the collective belief and adoration of the worshipful races. \n          Although Brother Clothrens's ancient order originally strove to record the detailed history of each such race, such aspirations proved too daunting owing to their unexpected large numbers. As a result, an early Abbot -- the stately Haa'tan - reluctantly issued a Standing Order limiting historical accounts to the quintessence of each race -- namely, a detailed account of its gods. In this, the Abbott was surely right, thought Brother Clothren recalling one of Haa'tan's more popular quotes, \"Tell me about your gods and I will reveal the inmost secrets of your heart\". Nevertheless, even Brother Clothren in his chosen vocation of Archeotheist, sometimes murmured at preserving such a minuscule part of the vast and glorious history of vanished races while consigning the large measure of their past to certain oblivion. Nevertheless, like other members of his ancient Order, each night the meek and obedient Brother Clothren dreamed the eventless white dream of the pure. \n          For the account of the Terrene god a final page still remained. Brother Clothren continued keying in text, \"...that such a simple contingency could spell the demise of a deity of his cardinality was not only inconceivable to his devotees but also beyond the ken of the very deity who would himself succumb as its victim...\" \n          Brother Clothren paused for a moment contemplating the deep mystery of divine existences then continued,. . .\"On April 7, 1984 (by local solar reckoning) in Estill Fork, Alabama, a solitary sparrow alighted erratically on a redbud tree in Otis Farnborough's side yard.

The sparrow had flown south from Tennessee into the mountain fastness of the upper Paint Rock Valley in North Alabama where it had contracted aviomycosis and was terminally ill. There on Otis Farnborough's redbud tree its long journey ended as its eyes glazed over, its body spasmed, and then, releasing its grip, the dead bird toppled headlong into a clutch of startled hens. At that precise moment, the ceaseless purview of the ever-watchful Yahweh was exceeded and he became zero in all his parts signifying his total extinction.\" \n        \n      \n    ",

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n           Men in crisis\n          Confused by society's mixed messages about what's expected of them as boys, and later as men, many feel a sadness and disconnection they cannot even name. (Pollack 1)\n          The recent 'crisis in masculinity' has been punctuated by a plethora of material devoted to reclaiming men's 'lost' power within a society. Triggered by the recognition that their roles within our society are changing, this emerging cannon often fails to recognise men as part of a social continuum that subjectifies individuals within discursive frameworks. Rather it mourns this process as the emasculation of male identity within our culture. However, this self-help rhetoric masks a wider project of renegotiating men's power within our society. David Buchbinder for example, calls for an interrogation of \"how men and various masculinities are represented\" (7). As a consequence, male subjectivities are being called into question. There is now examination of the manner in which \"power is differentiated so that particular styles of masculinity become ascendant…in certain situations\" (Haywood and Mac an Ghaill 52). In this way, male power is being problematised on many fronts. \n          The desire to shore-up male power in the face of various 'threats' has called for a corporeal manifestation of masculine dominance. Men's bodies have been redefined through contemporary attention to physical sculpting and molding. This reanimation of the Superman ethic of embodiment is part of the hegemonic maintenance of masculine power in our culture. At the times of the greatest threat to male competence and control within society - social, political and economic restructuring, war and recovery - the body has been at the frontier of reasserting male power. \n          This paper traces performances of superhero masculinity across men's bodies. As central 'creators' of their world, superheroes embody a mythology in masculine identity that shapes men as social and natural determinists within a society. In attempting to replicate this role, men are subjected to a rupture in the social fabric whereby their bodies move through a series of discursive frameworks in a contradictory tapestry that activates a 'crisis' within masculine identity. This paper seeks to open the seam between masculinity and power to examine how masculine legitimacy is negotiated on embodied surfaces. This trajectory is constantly stretched to its limits where men's bodies are in a persistent state of rebuilding. \n          Henry Rollins forms part of the frayed edges of superhero identity. Simultaneously validating and undermining this mentality, Rollins creates a nexus of contradictory ideologies. Embracing a \"rock-hard male body\" (Robinson 11) in a powerfully built embodied reality, and at the same time deconstructing it, Rollins takes issue with men in their mythological role as centres of social reality and their power to create and control it. Rollins forms an identity that is shaped within discursive practices rather than the director of them. In tracing this performance through the \"Liar\" music video that features Rollins in the Superman role, this paper demonstrates the convoluted masculinity embraced by Rollins and the movement of Superman across his body. Between superheroes, war and bodybuilding, the aim is to trace how men are positioned as unproblematic agents of power, change and creation within the embodied myths of our culture. \n          Bodies of knowledge\n          Men's bodies have changed. While they have been the 'normal' against which women's bodies have been defined, this sense of normality has altered (Cranny-Francis 8). Foucault has consistently demonstrated how bodies are created and inscribed through cultural processes whereby discourses determine the shape and nature of embodied realities. Even though men are often centralised in these knowledge systems, it does not mean that they are immune to their influence. Men are insistently defined through metaphors of the mind. The proper man is a controlled man. In bodybuilding this relationship is activated in the repetitive and disciplined action of tensing and relaxing muscle. Defined as, \"the toning and accentuating of muscles by the repeated action of flexing and releasing…particularly through the use of weights\" (Carden-Coyne n.pag), it reifies a controlled mind restraining and shaping the physical form. \n          During the Enlightenment thrust toward scientific rationalism, Descartes positioned an uncomplicated division between the mind and the body. Men spent their time purifying their souls and using bodies \"as a spiritual vessel, a Christian container of morality and purity\" (Carden-Coyne n.pag). They were shells that required discipline so the mind was not led astray. The mind was the controlling agent that subdued a disobedient embodiment. The extent to which this was achieved was the measure of the legitimacy and competence of a man. The currency of this corporeal state resonates most potently today through the phallus. \n          As an extension of the phallus, the surface of the male body is a crucial site for the demonstration of embodied control. For the phallus is not very closely related to the possession of a penis as David Buchbinder argues when he suggests, \"the phallus as a symbol, however, is not to be identified with an actual penis, because no actual penis could ever really measure up to the imagined sexual potency and social or magical power of the phallus\" (49). \n          Indeed, men's penises are \"flaccid most of the time\" (Buchbinder 48). They are fragile and soft. They rarely meet the 'supernatural' prowess of the phallus. Phallic power is related to the capacity to occupy the space of symbolic power effectively - to be embodied in a competent masculinity. Bodybuilding demonstrates a mastery over the self that articulates this discipline. The capacity to mobilise this control is linked to wider social power in which men are supposed to be privileged agents of creation and control in the political and economic spheres of life. \n          Henry Rollins mobilises a mythos of masculine embodied control and corporeal hardness in his embrace of Superman. He is the epitome of phallic power and Rollins uses this character as a metonym to articulate the contradictions between the ideologies circulating through culture and the reality of lived experience. While Rollins mobilises a superhero musculature, the surfacing of his self masks a vulnerable masculine subjectivity that is embedded within distinct social frameworks. He uses the ideologies surrounding superheroes to create a dialogue between the reality of everyday life and the discourses that frame those experiences. \n          Superheroes are resourceful, disciplined and righteous. They are sites of strength, moral virtue, creation and control. They often have super-powers, super-human strength, agility or speed that enables them to exist apart from regular humans. They occupy spaces removed from everyday life. However, their separateness from these realities is contrary to real men's experiences. Like the phallus, there is a gulf between the superhero ideology that men are supposed to embody and the reality of lived experience. Nevertheless there remains a constant struggle to build and rebuild the male body to the pinnacle of (super)masculine prowess. \n          Superman is framed within the mind/body binary quite clearly. The control he exercises over his body reifies his calm and disciplined mind. His powerful physique, \"represents in vividly graphic detail the masculinity, the confidence, the power that personifies the ideal of phallic masculinity\" (Brown n.pag). His control extends across his self and out into the world. Rollins embraces this control through his own self-empowering rhetoric that litters his lyrics, spoken word and concert performances. He also most clearly embodies the Superman ideology through a life-long attention to bodybuilding. \n          Introduced to weightlifting as a teenager, Rollins incorporates the Superman ideology into his subjectivity. He has been referred to as the \"tattooed, muscled Ubermensch of serious rawk\" (geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Palms/4396/hrf.htm). He works his muscles to rebuild his identity after a disaffiliated, Ritalin-addicted childhood spent bouncing between divorced parents. The processes of disciplining his body and empowering the self are made clear through his relationship to his body and to the weights. Rollins believes in extending himself to his limits and beyond. Bodybuilding is the mattering map Rollins uses to construct a sense of self. He uses it to define who he is and to build his self-esteem. For example,\"time away from the Iron makes my mind and body degenerate. I turn on myself and wallow in thick depression that makes me unable to function. The body shuts my mind down. The Iron is the best anti-depressant I have ever found. No better way to fight weakness than with strength. Fight degeneration with generation\" (Rollins 257). \n          In his embrace of the embodied power of Superman and the building mechanisms of weightlifting he is able to repair and regenerate his sense of self. He is able to transform himself into something new and different, thereby exercising power as an agent of change. This ethic of rebuilding hails an earlier time when control over the body needed to reestablish the coherent corporeality of damaged men within a culture. World War One redefined popular consciousness of men's bodies as the mechanisation of warfare ripped limbs from torsos and severed the relationship between a disciplined mind and the controlled body. \n          Rebuilding battered bodies\n          The first widespread conflict to use guns, shells and tanks produced the first evidence of neurasthenia, or shell shock (Carden-Coyne n.pag). Faith in evolution and human improvement was shaken to its core with the appearance of physically and emotionally broken masculinity. Men's bodies were dismembered and disabled - their minds were tortured. As a result Carden-Coyne argues,\n          \n            [t]he first world war significantly undermined confidence in the male instinct, by demonstrating that the primitive energies of the male body (virility, physical strength and aggression) were no match for modern technological warfare.\n          \n          A process of healing was needed to rebuild a masculinity of control and strength in these men. Faith in progress needed to be renegotiated and the damaged minds and bodies of men mended. Bodybuilding was seen as the most complete demonstration of embodied control. It required discipline and strength and so required the mind to order the body. Bodybuilding was embraced after World War One to repair the fissures in war-ravaged masculinity. It served, \"to shape corporeal borders…against the sense of decay and uncertainty that permeated the 'air' of modernity\" (Carden-Coyne n.pag). The strong body created a strong mind and bodybuilding in the post-war period also helped to more popularly render images of heroes. War heroes could be more easily framed in musculature. In popular culture, heroes shifted from aristocratic figures such as the Scarlet Pimpernel, to more everyday men. By 1938 the emergence of Superman comics positioned the ordinary-like man as superhero (Bridwell 6). The hard body had the capacity to make the ordinary man exceptional. Indeed, the superheroes of the twentieth century like \"Tarzan, Conan, James Bond\" (Connell 6) all depict a resilience and similar competence over all aspects of their lives. However as men's authority has been increasingly challenged within our society, embodied strength has increased in Superman to mirror the changes in the lives of these men. \n          Postmodern paychecks\n          World War Two also tore men's bodies apart. However with this war, the machine was reinscribed as saving rather than taking lives on the battlefield (Fussell 3). The development of the atomic bomb was attributed to, and celebrated as, man's ability to create and conquer anything (Easlea 90). By 1950 Superman comics depicted the man of steel withstanding a nuclear blast thereby validating the superiority and resilience of white, western masculinity and embodied hardness over the weak Others (Bridwell 10). Nevertheless World War Two chewed through men's bodies at an imperceptible rate. Despite the rhetoric of heroism and technological superiority, the reality of everyday battle was broken bodies. The ideology of the superhero served to mask the realities of this war. Despite the damage to the corporeal form, the heroic mythology of masculine identity served to reify a coherent embodiment and a clear mind. The mobilisation of this masculine myth masked the erosion of legitimate male power within culture. This resonates into the postwar period where a whole series of structural changes to the social landscape have radically redefined our social reality. \n          The mechanisms men have used to define themselves have decayed. The rising empowerment of women, gay men and black men have problematised the centrality of white, heterosexual men in our culture (Faludi 40). They are no longer able to easily occupy a stable, silent centre in our society. As a result, there has been an attempt to reclaim the body and reclaim the competency that serves to define men as masculine. The rising interest in men's health and physical fitness on the whole, has lead to a reanimation of the superman figure. Men's bodies are getting harder and larger. \n          Part animal, part machine\n          Henry Rollins embraces the contradictions in heroic masculinity. He demonstrates an embodied control that is regimented through an incorporation of Nietzschean will. In this way he embodies the relationship between the superhero and contemporary masculinity. However, Rollins' Superman is not an Ubermensch (Nietzsche 230). He performs a problematic masculinity. As a result, Rollins deconstructs the masculine hierarchy by subverting, not only his own performance of masculinity, but all such performances. \n          The \"Liar\" music video by The Rollins Band features Rollins in the Superman role. In this clip he interrogates different levels of truth and reality. For him, neither Clark Kent nor Superman is a valid model on which to base effective performances of masculinity. Neither of these men are heroes, rather they are simulations. The version of Superman that Rollins constructs is authoritative and totalitarian. He depicts a corrupt figure and flawed leader who is not in control and is struggling to meet the demands of his role. This performance of Superman deconstructs the myth of the male hero. For Rollins, this hero does not exist - or if he does - he is a \"Liar\". Henry Rollins both embodies and deconstructs the superhero identity. He forms a nexus around which contradictory ideologies in masculinity collide and are reworked into a radically subversive critique of the relationship between men and superheroes. For Rollins the superhero mentality masks the complicated ideologies men must negotiate everyday in which they are subjectified within contradictory discursive frameworks that demand multifarious performances. Rollins strips back the layers of masculine power to reveal the ways in which men are embedded within social structures that reflect and affect their reality. In this self-reflexive critique he performs Superman in playful, resistive ways. This Superman does not exist apart from everyday life, but is entrenched within its frameworks that can only produce flawed performances of a social ideal. For Rollins a superhero embodiment cannot wipe away the discourses that encircle men within our culture but is rather a reflection of the extent to which men are embedded within them. \n          In negotiating the difficulties in masculinity, Henry Rollins deprioritises men's roles as super-human agents of control, creation and change within a society. He calls into question the validity of masculine power and reifies the contradictions in manhood. He hails an ultimately resilient and empowered dominant masculinity within a deconstructive rhetoric. He is mobilising a moment within our culture where men must redefine who they are. This redefinition must be less concerned with how men can reclaim the power they are currently mourning in the 'crisis of masculinity'. If we are to make lasting change within a Cultural Studies framework then it cannot end, but only begin, with the articulation of a diversity of voices. Deep, structural change can only be made if we examine how a powerful position is able to occupy an unproblematised node of commonsense. Men need to redefine who they are, their bodies, their minds and their performances to position a masculinity that is not separate from society, but that can exist coherently within it. \n          \n          References\n          \nBridwell, Nathan. \"Introduction.\" Superman from the Thirties to the Seventies.

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n       \n                    An elderly man of my acquaintance once told me that there was nothing much to recommend living beyond 90. Things have changed over the past two decades, however. These days all he'd need is a touch of Viagra, an attitude reorientation, a little bit of manifesting and he'd be feeling as fit as, as, well … as a man in his 60s. Had he been around now, as a knowledgeable nonagenarian, he need not have mourned the passing of the years. Instead, he could have concentrated on becoming daily younger. As Second Youth so blithely trumpets: \"In your youth, your mind, body and spirit are capable of great recuperative powers but, as you get older, you believe that those powers diminish. Not true! As long as you have a will -- and a method -- to improve your life, you will find the power to make it happen.\" Lacking the method? Look no longer… \n          Books entitled RealAge: Are You as Young as You Can Be? (Roizen 1999) appear at the top of the New York Times best seller list, arguing that some 70-year olds can have the health profile of average 44-year olds within three years of making the right choices. (www.RealAge.com) This is the book's manifesto:\n          \n          The whole point of RealAge is to promote old age. Healthy, vibrant and young old age. RealAge shows you how you can live at eighty with all the energy and vigor of a fifty-five year old, how you can be the ninety year old who still lives on your own, travels and forcefully expresses feisty opinions -- the person who leaves the 'kids' marveling, 'How does she do it?' Having respect for old age means wanting to end the suffering that so often goes along with it. No one wants to be bedridden, afflicted with heart disease, or undergoing cancer treatment. Everyone wants to be able to do all the things he or she has always done and more.

The hypothesis put forward by Russell, by Wetzstein (1999) and by others, is that this is an 'age and stage' issue. It represents a new generational perspective reflective of the mindset and the life experience of the post mid-1940s 'baby boomer'.\n          Boomers refuse to see 40 as middle aged (Wetzstein 1999), and would perish the thought that the Rolling Stones would ever retire. They define 50s as ‘Second youth’. (Gabriel &amp; Molli 1995) They continue to participate in adventure and encounter holidays and subscribe to complementary health care regimes and new age approaches to daily life. They sign up for www.lovinguniversity.net and marvel at how much younger 43-yr old founder Susan Bradley looks on her website than in a recent Who Weekly (2001, p. 71). This baby boomer refusal to age has manifested itself widely in general and specialist consumer magazines, in broadcast TV and radio shows concentrating on good health and super-fitness, and in other elements of popular culture. Even given the hype, however, this new perspective might have long-term beneficial health/medical effects. The aging of the boomer generation may not be accurately predictable from the data collected from other generations with other mindsets. The back cover of Second Youth proclaims: \"Desperate and aging far too fast she staked everything on discovering a natural source of Young Women's Hormones. Now, her triumph gives you thirty extra years of Second Youth. Age moved backwards for this woman. Just as it can -- this very month -- for you\". (Gabriel &amp; Molli 1995, back cover) Did someone mention snake oil? Or Bluebeard? \n          Coupled with an optimism that allows them to forecast health and happiness into double-digit decades, however, boomers have a demonstrable suspicion of conventional medical ‘authority’ and a willingness to do their own research on health topics of interest. According to Mycek (1999) \"In 1998, the [US] bill for homeopathic remedies (chiropractic and massage therapy, vitamins, yoga, herbal remedies, hypnosis, acupuncture) exceeded the total gross domestic product of all [US] hospitals put together.\" For boomers, a greater emphasis on health is not going to mean more of the same health care products, delivered in the same way. It is going to mean doing things differently. But is this a healthy way for us to look at aging and (shall we mention the word) death? Is our desire/burning commitment to remain indefinitely young and healthy in some way 'sick'? \n          It is eminently reasonable to hypothesise -- as many people approaching their 'middle years' do -- that baby boomers are aiming to reinvent the aging process. (Dychtwald, 1999) The past quarter century has seen the burgeoning growth of preventative/health promotion and complementary health promoting services including nutritionists, naturopaths, chiropractors, rebalancers, meditation teachers, physiotherapists, counsellors and life coaches. The oldest members of the richest, best informed, most numerous generation in history are turning 55. The boomers (born from 1946--1960) can't put off for any longer the fact that -- chronologically -- they are approaching middle age. But what does this mean to a generation with many members who would rather be dead than old? Does the denial of chronological age, and the espousal of 'physiological age' (the premise upon which the RealAge philosophy and empire is built) represent a sick fantasy to avoid accepting our mortality? \n          Baby boomers are a specific, much researched, sociocultural phenomenon. Their aim is to move beyond actuarial projections to re-write expectations of aging. From the self-help movement to the success of the potency drug Viagra, there is ample evidence that boomers have plans and expectations for their own aging processes that differ radically from those adopted by their parents. People born into the prosperity and plenty of the early post-WWII years often police their health attitudes and behaviours in proactive ways. These patterns are likely to impact upon their health profiles in the future and to influence the creation of services tailored to meet different hopes, fears and expectations. Who says Cher can't look young forever? \n          Most health care planning is based on actuarial data that examines past events and extrapolates from these events into the future. However, this is not likely to result in a valid prediction of the health and aging patterns of the boomer generation. Graham May is a futurologist. He suggests that (May 2000), in anticipating the future, we are attempting either to foresee it, to manage it, or to create it. The philosophical distinctions between these perspectives provide different rationales for those who wish to influence the future. Attempts to foresee, or predict, the future – for example by extrapolating trends – presuppose that in some very particular ways the future already exists and/or is closely related to the forces evident in the present and the past. Managing the present with the future in mind accepts that present actions and decisions influence the future, and suggests that the future does not exist and is capable of being influenced by our current choices. The creation of the future – through techniques such as ‘creative visioning’ – works on the basis that once situations that do not exist have been imagined they can be brought into existence. These three approaches, separately and in parallel, offer ways of negotiating the uncertainty and essential unpredictability of the future, and of longevity and fitness. The longevity and second youth approach combines the idea of managing the future and envisioning it: 'the manifestation' approach. \n          Baby boomers have already created a different future for our society. They are credited with re-writing the institutions of marriage (via de factos, divorce, blended families, single parents, older pregnancies); marketing (psychodemographics rather than age, sex, socioeconomic status); religion (the decline of the Church and the rise of new age philosophies, faith healing, angels on demand); education (just-in-time learning, lifelong learning); work practices -- and health. The boomers are also rewriting what aging means for them, and to them. Using popular culture starting points, such as Second Youth and RealAge, it seems that a major boomer project of the next twenty years is working to defy/turn back the aging clock. This project is invested with the hopes, fears, dreams and expectations of millions of citizens in western societies. Boomers are practical, however, as well as ‘just in time’ and they know that a belief that they can do it is half the battle. \n          Let's assume that although many boomers are already fitter and healthier than any generation before them at their age, others may be intending to ‘make a break’ for fitness as an early priority of their retirement. Boomers may also expect their retirement years to be years of health and plenty, and they seem to indicate that they're prepared actively to work with these goals in mind. However, not all will be successful in beating their biology. How do boomers expect to manage their own chronic ailments in the future: arthritis, failing hearing and sight, late onset diabetes, heart disease, incontinence, dementia etc? Will the stem cell implants solve all foreseeable problems? \n          Excluding alternative and complementary medical strategies, the health care industry is one of the biggest sectors of the economy representing 8% GDP (and rising). As indicated by its growing place in popular culture, health is also a hobby, pastime and pleasure – and the contemporary obsession with health is … sick. Although the social advantage to be conferred by living as healthily as possible, and as well as possible, is self-evident, it may require a level of selfishness and self-absorption unparalleled in human history. \n          More to the point, however, this approach to getting older brings problems of its own. Firstly, it is built on a fear of aging, and a wish to deny the aging process which may become more desperate as the years (and they will) take their toll. Far from increasing the pleasure and satisfaction of 'a good age' this dynamic, operating over the decades, is as likely to build frustration, depression and a sense of powerlessness. As a (breast) cancer patient once told me: 'It's bad enough having cancer without everyone else thinking it's my fault for not having a positive enough attitude!' Aging is going to happen -- will we go with the flow - or end up like King Canute, with wet feet, trying to turn back the tide? \n          Secondly, this perspective is counter-productive in fetishising a numerical age. When we're so focused on chronological age, biological age and the celebrating of our first, second and third 'year younger' parties (with fruit and water, please) we're not coming to terms with what's real for us in our ecological niche. Humanity is comprised of sentient, vertebrate, mammals. Far better to know our life cycle, and plan our lives to fit within it, than to pretend it can be revered. Much better to accept that we can be a very fit seventy year old (or a very unfit seventy year old) than to persuade ourselves that 'That's just my chronology, my real age is 44.' I'm sure we'll all be able to tell the difference… If anyone seriously believed the hype of living 26 years younger, you'd have to feel more than sorry for them. You'd have to suspect that maybe, even if they were blissfully unaware of it, they're a little bit sick. \n          I gather that there's a Centre for Positive Aging recently started up in Perth: that's something altogether healthier\n          \n          References\n          \nCassel, C. and Vallasi, G.

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n          Invested capital demands growth. Growth is possible through the expansion of markets or through finding new products to sell, that is, by creating new markets. Thus, we have seen, over the last one hundred years, the commodification of more and more aspects of human life. However, what superficially looks like an ever increasing array of different products turns out to be, in essence, the commodification of just one human need, that is, the need for identity. Awareness of mind engenders the 'I/me' split. The 'I' is a knower, the 'me' is the known. The stuff that the 'me' is made of is discursive in nature. Stories are therefore the industrial engines of the identity economy and they are deployed all around us in print, in media, at work. As well they are encoded into material artifacts or into the social practices which are enacted via our access to identity services (be it travel, media, or latte). \n          Most of us now work in the identity economy and indeed work out our identity in the process of helping others commodify theirs. Consider the following advertisement for Compaq computers. \"A whole new Compaq what's in it for me and me and me and me and me and me... a lot. We're here to help you get the most out of computing, whether you use one PC or run a vast global enterprise network\". Current deflation aside, the Internet may turn out to be the ultimate domain for commodification of human identity. Not only is any desire available to be vicariously satisfied at any time of the day (thus extending the market in time) but the domain of desire is global in its reach, thus rendering possible the vicarious experience of omniscience also. As the recent add for the Iridium network proclaimed, \"Welcome to your new office, it measures 510,228,030 square kilometers\" omniscience in a packet. \n          The contributors to this issue of M/C dissect the work of identity in various ways. Common identities, shared by people within the same subcultures or national societies as such, are strengthened and maintained to a significant degree through shared, collective memories, as Patricia Leavy notes in her article which opens this issue and such \"mass remembering\" is \"unconscious work necessary for the maintenance of social memory\", she writes. Such collective memories are perpetuated largely through the media, and expanding on this thought Lelia Green explores the argument that consumption is indeed important work in a capitalist society. In our feature article for this issue, \"The Work of Consumption Why Aren't We Paid?\", she describes identity construction as \"a major consumer project using raw materials provided by the mass media\", but one which remains considered a voluntary activity. \n          Marxian approaches to 'work' practically appear by themselves in dealing with such ideas. Warwick Mules aims to \"open out Marx a little\" by investigating the changed nature of the worker in early twenty-first century capitalism. The increasing interest in shares and stocks is only one sign of the fact that the surplus value produced during work is now often incorporated into the labour force itself; workers invest in their own lives and in the process become 'dividualised', motivated by a desire to become their future selves. Work time and free time blur in this pursuit. Frederick Wasser's article examines this point further by problematising the division between work and free leisure, especially in the light of convergent new media technologies which are used for both in equal measure. In the process, does the quality of our leisure time suffer as the opportunity, perhaps the reminder, to do some more work remains ever-present? \n          And, in this dividualised, self-motivated workforce, what about those who value leisure over work? Andrew Butler uses the films of Kevin Smith to examine the effects of being a 'slacker' on one's own masculine identity. Characters in Clerks, Mallrats and Chasing Amy appear to find it hard to escape from capitalist ideology, from the societal imperative to work: \"the man without work is cast adrift, still in search of an identity\". This is hardly a surprise, given the history of work ethics described in Sharon Beder's contribution to this issue beyond the protestant emphasis on work as a religious calling there rose a secular work ethic encouraging \"ambition, hard work, self-reliance, and self-discipline\" in the nineteenth century which Beder traces through a study of selected self-help texts and children's books of the time. \n          And such work ethics continue to exist today, albeit in modified forms which link to the latest theories in business communication and cognitive psychology. Beyond the hokey new-age exercises which have been thrust upon workforces in the last decades, staff motivation does constitute a crucial factor in commercial success and effectiveness, and so, as Caroline Hatcher writes in her article, \"emotion, and passion, as heightened emotion, have come to play a newly understood role in our work lives\". Passions of a different kind, however, are evident in Jennifer Ellis-Newman's study which closes this issue. Investigating gender disparities in Australian universities, she found \"subtle processes that continue to operate in some higher education institutions to prevent women from reaching their full potential\" as academics, because of their perceived identity as women first, and academics second. \n          This article shows that older problems do not vanish magically as we turn our attention towards new ones. How can these women help others their students establish and commodify their identity if their own identity as workers is thus continually undermined? In addition to this problem, the articles in this issue of M/C also question the nature of worker identity itself, and indeed the very nature of work and leisure at the beginning of this new century. Is there any bit of identity not engaged via the consumption of work and the work of consumption? As Gary Cross has extensively documented, the march of the work-and-spend ethic has been victorious over other community-oriented uses of leisure time for the last two centuries. Any account of commodification via the new media that ignores this tendency should take into account Cross's arguments that clearly document that \"the task of creating conditions for personal and social expressions relatively unmediated by goods is hard work even if all insist that it should also be play\" (112). \n          \n          References\n          \nCross, Gary.

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n          It would be fair to say that in our day to day negotiation between the personal and the public, we encounter and process cultural, material and symbolic products in all strata and sections of society. In our homes and in our workplaces, we appear to manage multiple senses of timekeeping and contrasting time-frames with fluid unconscious dexterity. In our forms of entertainment and relaxation, from print to television to cinema or from html to Mp3s to DivX, we juxtapose like and unlike metaphors/images/products/ text in a post-Frankensteinian assemblage of innovated cultural meaning – for example, The Phantom Menace and Austin Powers are commentaries on our visual eclecticism, from mixing mythological elements from feudal times in a space opera to our nostalgic enjoyment of presenting the old sixties' \"style\" as renewed, millennium-way;Napster is a logical extension of file-sharing which reflects a globalising trend towards the distribution of all content worldwide while meeting the specific requirements of individual taste (that is, the do-it-yourself musical cdrom drawn from thousands of international mp3 libraries).\n        Likewise, in our trade of human utterances and syntax, multiple meanings become attached to words and sentences simultaneously in a variegated exploitation of interpretative dissonance. Oxymora abound and debates over interpretation form the contents of a great number of publications or the motivation behind short-circuiting dominant meanings. For example, in the oxymoron play with language, there exist useful combinations of opposite terms like \"Original Copy\", \"Pretty Ugly\", \"Genuine Imitation\", or \"Microsoft Works\" which have a commonsense use in daily exchanges. Or, in dialogues on the power behind mutual intelligibility, a term like 'sex', which means one thing in gender discussions, can be used in other contexts or moments to indicate the erotic. Through such language manoeuvres in the fields of meaning-application and interpretation, persons are accepted or discriminated where power differentials are predicated on difference of understanding. Where interpretative practices differ, or where intelligibility is definitely not mutual, misunderstandings and resistance breed. In this way, in our millennium of revealing society's mixture of meaning, the instrumentalities of master narratives are being unmasked in voicing these moments (and rules) of misunderstanding and resistance.\n        What was once predominantly treated as a text or object -- sometimes exhaustively studied in isolation from various social and historical contexts, other times as cultural products facilitated by processes of production and consumption -- is now examined within or alongside different contexts and meanings. It is more contemporaneously sensitive towards our wonderfully elaborate and diverse mix of interpretative practices to situate cultural products and interpretative orders in relation to other social practices, political structures of dominance and exploitation, and cultural hierarchies like race, class, gender and cyber. The implication of this approach is that the meanings of material and symbolic products are no longer stable nor replicated in identical fashion within cultural dna. Society instead is transmitted from generation to generation with mutations, and unlike cultural artefacts conjoin in new births of meaning. The mix gene, it would appear, is widely dispersed in intricate and novel ways.\n        The articles in this publication by M/C serve to illustrate the significance of ‘mix’ for reshaping cultural products, social ideas, even learning pedagogies, in ways that dramatically affect how we perceive and interpret the world. The interpretations of ‘mix’ by contributors were diverse, as expected by the broad uses of the word ‘mix’. Popular culture, however, remained a dominant aspect of culture for analysis, and this is reflected in the mix of articles we have chosen. These articles demonstrate that the fine lines separating genres can be smudged and shaded, and that meaning can be created from blending and swirling rather than only through linearity.\n        Our feature article, \"Digital Transformations: The Media is the Mix\" by Lori Landay talks about the digital media and its hybrid form and content. This article thinks through \"how digital narrative emerges from the mix of interactivity and nonlinearity\" – this makes for a non-traditional narrative in both its structure and the way meaning is derived from it. The recombinations draw the spectator into the mix, where the mix is the content.\n        Owen’s Chapman’s \"Mixing with Records\" follows Landay’s article in the sense that the linear format of the vinyl record, both in its constitution and the way it is played and listened to, is disrupted by the dj practice of \"mixing\" to create a new audio product. This new sound is created by the interaction of the dj and the choices of sounds, and how these sounds are put together in a new ‘mix’.\n        Toby Daspit’s \"The Noisy Mix of Hip Hop Pedagogies\" responds to a familiar parental request — \"Turn down that damned noise!!!\" — in an engaging examination of educational experiences, epochal shifts and the wider implications of incorporating hip-hop aesthetics and recombinant textuality into schooling pedagogies. Daspit’s discussion over a fundamental reorientation to educational pedagogies is a timely piece which resonates well within the ‘mix’ imperative.\n        The mixes evident through narrative are also investigated by Jody Mason, though her article on Bharati Mukherjee’s Wife looks more at thematic mixes within an individual literary character’s life, rather than mixes of meaning, structure and format. Mason’s article looks at the mix of cultures and the impact of that mix upon a female character. It seems, through an analysis of Wife, that different components and subject positions don’t always mix well, if indeed at all.\n        Cutting up narrative, and cutting up sound, mixing it up and creating something new. These two distinct media are twisted together in Jeff Rice’s article, \"They Put Me in the Mix: William S Burroughs, DJs, and the New Cultural Studies\". The article itself cuts and pastes three key cultural events to prepare an argument that questions the methods of cultural studies regarding new media practices. \n        Mark Pegrum takes a theological perspective on ‘mix’ in \"Pop goes the spiritual\", and interrogates society’s increasing trend towards religious eclecticism via an assortment of contemporary examples of religious references made by Western pop stars. Pegrum introduces us to this relatively new phenomenon by looking at the dizzying admixture of religions to be found in the songs and words of artists and groups worldwide.\n        Todd Holden analyses the intriguing semiotic processes within Japanese advertising in \"Resignification and Cultural Re/Production in Japanese Television Commercials\". Advertising in Japan is characterized less and less by attention to product. Instead, the endless stream of Greek myths, Hollywood movies, political references, pop music, scientists and novelists comprise a major corner of audio-visual space. Holden examines the place of Japanese commercials as cultural historian, entertainer, social commentator or hawker.\n        Collectively, these articles demonstrate how dynamic meaning is intimately linked to the idea of 'mix' and is concerned with questions of meaning and value, of culture and philosophy. To rework a tired cliché, no meaning is an island to itself but is an integral part of a shifting, fluid, and unusual combination of cultural, material and symbolic products in various ‘mixes’.\n        \n        \n      \n    ",

    "abstract": "\n      \n\n        Cut\n         In 1964, William S. Burroughs' Nova Express is published. Part of the trilogy of books Burroughs wrote in the early 1960s (The Soft Cell and The Ticket That Exploded are the other two), Nova Express explores the problems that technology creates in the information age; and the ways in which language and thought have come under the influence of mass media. The book begins with a broad declaration against consumerism and corporate control: \n        \n          Listen all you boards syndicates and governments of the earth. And you powers behind what filth deals consummated in what lavatory to take what is not yours. To sell the ground from unborn feet forever -\n            \"For God's sake don't let that Coca-Cola thing out -\" (Nova Express 3)\n          \n        Rather than opt for conventional narrative as a means of uncovering the problems ideology brings with media-driven mass consumption, in the early '60s, Burroughs develops a method of writing he calls \"the cut-up\". The cut-up method entails taking a page of writing (a newspaper, a poem, a novel, an advertisement, a speech) and cutting it down the middle twice so that four sections remain. One then rearranges the sections in random order to create a new page. Variations of the four section cut are permissible and can lead to further juxtapositions. The purpose of the cut-up is to disclose ideological positions within media, to recontextualise the language of media often taken for granted as natural and not as a socially and economically constructed act. \n        Information has become addictive, Burroughs says, invoking the junkie as a metaphor for mass consumption. Its addictive state leads to hallucinations, distortions of what is real and what is illusion; what do we need to live, and what do we buy for mere consumption. \n        \n          The scanning pattern we accept as \"reality\" has been imposed by the controlling power on this planet, a power primarily oriented towards total control - In order to retain control they have moved to monopolize and deactivate the hallucinogen drugs by effecting noxious alternations on a molecular level. (Nova Express 53)\n          \n        The cut-up provides a means to combat the \"junky\" in us all by revealing the powers of technology. In the end, the cut-up leads to a collagist practice of juxtaposition. As Burroughs and collaborator Byron Gysin explained in a later work, \n        \n          The cut-up method brings to writers the collage, which has been used by painters for fifty years. And used by the moving and still camera. In fact all street shots from movie or still cameras are by the unpredictable factors of passersby and juxtaposition cut-ups (Burroughs and Gysin 29).\n          \n        Through its structure, Nova Express is a lesson in making cut-ups, a demonstration of how power might be undermined in the digital age. \n        Paste\n         In 1964, the Center for Contemporary Cultural Studies at Birmingham began. Influenced by Raymond Williams' 1958 Culture and Society, the Birmingham School legitimized the reading of popular culture as a means to uncovering dominant ideologies and power structures within institutional systems. In particular, the center proposed structuring scholasticism so that the study of media texts would allow for the questioning of social and political practices. The Birmingham school advised that curriculae supplement their agendas with \n        \n          the question of class; the complex relationships between power, which is an easier term to establish in the discourses of culture than exploitation, and exploitation; the question of a general theory which could, in a critical way, connect together in a critical reflection different domains of life, politics, and theory, theory and practice, economic, political ideological questions, and so on; the notion of critical knowledge itself and the production of critical knowledge as a practice. (Hall 279)\n          \n        One of the Birmingham School's first works was Stuart Hall and Paddy Whannel's Popular Arts, which searched out ways to teach media. In particular, Hall and Whannel viewed popular culture as a place to teach the power of ideology.\n        \n          There is, in fact, a growing recognition that the media of mass communication play such a significant role in society, and especially in the lives of young people, that the school must embrace the study of their organization, content, and impact. But there is little agreement about how such studies should be carried out. Just what shall be studied? With what precise purpose? In what relationship to the established subjects? Ultimately the answer will depend upon our attitude towards these media, our social thinking about the kind of society in which they wield their influence and, in particular, our response to the things the media offer - individual films, television programmes, popular songs, etc. (Hall and Whannel 21)\n          \n        Today, the Birmingham School is recognised as the beginning of contemporary cultural studies. It answers Hall and Whannel by using texts from popular culture to uncover the semiotic cultural codes that make up popular discourse. These methods shed light on how supposedly naturally constructed messages contain deeper meanings and purposes. \n        Mix\n         In 1964, DJ Alan Freed was convicted of tax evasion as a result of his involvement in the payola record business scandal of 1962. Considered one of the first rock and roll DJs, Freed is often credited for breaking ‘50s racial barriers by playing African-American music on the airwaves and hosting largely attended African-American dances and concerts. Even though Freed didn't invent the phrase \"rock and roll,\" he credited himself with the term's introduction into music vocabulary, a myth-making act with far reaching implications. As critic Nick Tosch writes: \"Though he was certainly not the first who had done so; he was only the most influential of those who had - Freed [had] rinsed the Dixie Peach from its image, rendering it more agreeable to the palate of a greater public\" (Tosch 9). In the same year of Freed's conviction, another legendary DJ, Murray the K, found fame again by following the Beatles around on their 1964 North American tour. Murray the K had been popular in the late '50s for \"his wild stammering of syllables, fragments of words, black slang, and meaningless, rhythmical burbling\" to make transitions between songs (Poschardt 75). Mass copying of Murray the K's DJ stylings led to his redundancy. When New Journalist Tom Wolfe rediscovered the DJ tagging along with the Beatles, he became intrigued, describing him as \"the original hysterical disk jockey\":\n        \n          Murray the K doesn't operate on Aristotelian logic. He operates on symbolic logic. He builds up an atmosphere of breathless jollification, comic hysteria, and turns it up to a pitch so high it can hypnotize kids and keep them frozen. (Wolfe 34)\n          \n        While Freed introduced African-American culture to mainstream music, Murray the K's DJing worked from a symbolic logic of appropriation: sampled sounds, bits and pieces of eccentric outtakes used as vehicles to move from song to song. Both Freed and Murray the K, however, conceived the idea of the DJ as more than a spinner of records. They envisioned the DJ as a form of media, a myth maker, a composer of ideas through sounds and politics. In a sense, they saw their work as disseminating social commentary on '60s racial politics and ideology, working from a fairly new innovation: the rock and roll record. \n        Their DJ work became the model for contemporary hip hop artists. Instead of considering isolated train whistles or glass crashing (the technique of Murray the K) as sources for sampling, contemporary DJs and digital samplers cut and paste fragments from the history of popular music in order to compose new works, compositions which function as vehicles of cultural critique. Groups like Public Enemy and The Roots utilise their record collections to make political statements on drug usage, economic problems within the African-American community, and racism. For Tricia Rose, these artists are the cultural studies writers of the digital age. \"Rappers are constantly taking dominant discursive fragments and throwing them into relief, destabilizing hegemonic discourses and attempting to legitimate counterhegemonic interpretations.\" (Rose 102) \n        Remix\n         The juxtaposition of these three events in 1964 marks an interesting place to consider the potential for new media and cultural studies. Such a juxtaposition answers the calls of Lawrence Grossberg, Cary Nelson, and Paula Treichler in their introduction to Cultural Studies, a collection of essays from the 1970s and 1980s. The editors suggest that cultural studies can be thought of, in some ways, as a collagist practice.\n        \n          The methodology of cultural studies provides an equally uneasy marker, for cultural studies in fact has no distinct methodology, no unique statistical, ethnomethodological, or textual analysis to call its own. Its methodology, ambiguous from the beginning, could best be seen as a bricolage. (2)\n          \n        For these editors, \"Cultural studies needs to remain open to unexpected, unimagined, even uninvited possibilities\" (3). To consider cultural studies from the perspective of 1964 is to evoke the unexpected, the unimagined, and the uninvited. It is to resituate the demands of cultural study within the context of new media - the legacy of Burroughs' cut-up reborn in the digital sampler. In response to the editors of Cultural Studies, I propose the practice of temporal juxtaposition as a way of critical writing. My initial juxtaposition of 1964 asserts that to teach such a practice, one must teach cutting and mixing. \n        The Break\n         The break, as a DJ method, is \"any short captured sound whatsoever\" (Eshun 14). The break motivates digital sampling; it provides the points from which samplers appropriate past works into their own: \"Break beats are points of rupture in their former contexts, points at which the thematic elements of a musical piece are suspended and the underlying rhythms brought center stage. In the early stages of rap, these break beats formed the core of rap DJs' mixing strategies\" (Rose 73-74). Breaks are determined by how DJs produce cuts in previously recorded music. \"The cut is a command, a technical and conceptual operation which cuts the lines of association\" (Eshun 16). For William Burroughs, cuts create shock in readers; they are tools for destroying ideology. \"Once machine lines are cut, the enemy is helpless\" (Ticket That Exploded 111). In Nova Express, Burroughs issues the command, \"Cut word lines\" (62). And in Naked Lunch, the cut provides a set of reading instructions, a way for readers to uncover Burroughs' own ideological positions.\n        \n          You can cut into Naked Lunch at any intersection point . . . I have written many prefaces. . . Naked Lunch is a blueprint, a How-To Book. (Naked Lunch 224\n          \n        For Roland Barthes, a major influence on the founding of the Birmingham School, the How-To functioned as a place for cultural critique. Barthes felt that semiotic analysis could break ideological positions constructed in popular culture. Barthes used the How-To as one example of what he called mythologies, items of popular culture assumed to be natural but latent with ideological meanings. He treated the how-to tourist guide (how to enjoy yourself on vacation) as one such place for further analysis.\n        \n          The good natured image of \"the writer on holiday\" is therefore no more than one of these cunning mystifications which the Establishment practices the better to enslave its writers. \n            (Barthes 30)\n          \n        Mythologies has inspired contemporary cultural studies. Dick Hebdige states that through Barthes' work, \"It was hoped that the invisible temporary seam between language, experience and reality could be located and prised open through a semiotic analysis\" (Hebdige 10). My juxtapositions of 1964, however, tell me that the How-To for cultural studies is cutting and pasting, not hermeneutical or semiotic analysis (i.e. What does this mean? What do these codes reveal?), which have long been cultural studies' focus. 1964 updates cultural studies practices by reinventing its methods of inquiry. 1964 forces academic study to ask: How would a contemporary cultural critic cut into cultural texts and paste selections into a new media work? \n        The Sample\n         Cuts and breaks become samples, authorial chosen selections. My sample comes from Walter Benjamin, an early DJ of media culture who discovered in 19th century Paris a source for a new compositional practice. Benjamin's unfinished Arcades project proposed that the task of the writer in the age of mechanical reproduction is to become a collector. \"The collector was the true inhabitant of the interior\" (Benjamin 168). Benjamin felt that the \"poets find their refuse on the street\" (79) preempting William Gibson's now often cited remark, \"the street finds its own use for things\" (Gibson 186) and modern DJs who build record collections by rummaging bargain street sales. I find in Benjamin's work a place to sample, a break for cutting into Burroughs' nova method. \"The basic nova mechanism is very simple: Always create as many insoluble conflicts as possible and always aggravate existing conflict - This is done by dumping life forms with incompatible conditions of existence on the same planet\" (Nova Express 53). Like Burroughs, Benjamin expressed interest in the ideological conflicts created through juxtaposition. His collections of the Parisian Arcades led to a cultural history different from that of the Frankfurt School. The Arcades' juxtapositions of consumer goods and artifacts opposed the Frankfurt School's understandings of Marxism and methods of critique. The conflict I create is that of incorporating the concerns of cultural studies into media study as an alternative practice. This practice is a system of sampling, cutting, breaking, and pasting. What might initially seem incompatible to cultural studies, I propose as a method of critique. My initial juxtaposition of 1964 becomes the first step towards doing so: I critique current cultural studies' methods of semiotic and hermeneutical analysis by way of the cut and mix I create.\n        This Benjamin sample is pasted onto the Networked Writing Environment (NWE) at the University of Florida where I teach media classes in one of several computer networked classrooms. Working from a sampled Benjamin and the juxtaposition of the previously described temporal events of 1964, I see a place to rethink new media and cultural studies. The NWE's graphical user interface completes the cut. Our Unix operating system uses X Windows for desktop display. The metaphor of the X, the slash, the cut, becomes a place to rethink what cultural studies admits to be a cut-up, or a non-unified practice (as stated by Grossberg et al). The X also recalls the crossroads, the iconic marker of the place of decision. Standing at the crossroads, I envision the blues song of the same name, which in 1964 was cut from its Robert Johnson origins and remixed as a new recording by the Yardbirds. This decision shifts the focus of media study to cultural collections, their juxtapositions, and the alternative understandings that surface. The tools of technology (like those we use in the NWE: the Web, MOO, and e-mail) cut the structural dominance of critique and encourage us to make new pedagogical decisions, like juxtaposing a William Burroughs novel with the founding of the Birmingham School with the rise of the DJ. Putting these practices into the mix, we redefine cultural critique. 1964, then, is the place where cultural mixing begins.\n          \n        References\n        \nBarthes, Roland. Mythologies.

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n            Introduction\n          It used to be the case that for the mass of workers, work was something that was done in order to get by. A working class was simply the sum total of all those workers and their dependents whose wages paid for the necessities of life, providing the bare minimum for family reproduction, to secure a place and a lineage within the social order. However, work has now become something else. Work has become the privileged sign of a new kind of class, whose existence is guaranteed not so much by work, but by the very fact of holding a job. Society no longer divides itself between a ruling elite and a subordinated working class, but between a job-holding, job-aspiring class, and those excluded from holding a job; those unable, by virtue of age, infirmity, education, gender, race or demographics, to participate in the rewards of work. Today, these rewards are not only a regular salary and job satisfaction (the traditional consolations of the working class), but also a certain capacity to plan ahead, to gain control of one's destiny through saving and investment, and to enjoy the pleasures of consumption through the fulfilment of self-images. \n          What has happened to transform the worker from a subsistence labourer to an affluent consumer? In what way has the old working class now become part of the consumer society, once the privileged domain of the rich? And what effects has this transformation had on capitalism and its desire for profit? These questions take on an immediacy when we consider that, in the recent Federal election held in Australia (November 11, 2001), voters in the traditional working class areas of western Sydney deserted the Labour Party (the party of the worker) and instead voted Liberal/conservative (the party of capital and small business). The fibro worker cottage valleys of Parramatta are apparently no more, replaced by the gentrified mansions of an aspiring worker formation, in pursuit of the wealth and independence once the privilege of the educated bourgeoisie. \n          In this brief essay, I will outline an understanding of work in terms of its changing relation to capital. My aim is to show how the terrain of work has shifted so that it no longer operates in strict subordination to capital, and has instead become an investment in capital. The worker no longer works to subsist, but does so as an investment in the future. My argument is situated in the rich theoretical field set out by Karl Marx in his critique of capitalism, which described the labour/capital relation in terms of a repressive, extractive force (the power of capital over labour) and which has since been redefined by various poststructuralist theorists including Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze (Anti-Oedipus) in terms of the forces of productive desire. What follows then, is not a Marxist reading of work, but a reading of the way Marx sets forth work in relation to capital, and how this can be re-read through poststructuralism, in terms of the transformation of work from subordination to capital, to investment in capital; from work as the consequence of repression, to work as the fulfilment of desire. \n          The Discipline of Work\n          In his major work Capital Marx sets out a theory of labour in which the task of the worker is to produce surplus value: \n          \n            \"Capitalist production is not merely the production of commodities, it is, by its very essence, the production of surplus-value. The worker produces not for himself, but for capital. It is no longer sufficient, therefore, for him simply to produce. He must produce surplus-value.\" (644)\n          \nFor Marx, surplus-value is generated when commodities are sold in the market for a price greater than the price paid to the worker for producing it: \"this increment or excess over the original value I call surplus-value\" (251). In order to create surplus value, the time spent by the worker in making a commodity must be strictly controlled, so that the worker produces more than required to fulfil his subsistence needs: \". . . since it is just this excess labour that supplies [the capitalist] with the surplus value\" (1011). In other words, capital production is created through a separation between labour and capital: \"a division between the product of labour and labour itself, between the objective conditions of labour and the subjective labour-power, was . . . the real foundation and the starting point of the process of capital production\" (716). As Michael Ryan has argued, this separation was forced , through an allegiance between capital and the state, to guarantee the conditions for capital renewal by controlling the payment of labour in the form of a wage (84). Marx's analysis of industrialised capital in Capital thus outlines the way in which human labour is transformed into a form of surplus value, by the forced extraction of labour time: \"the capitalist forces the worker where possible to exceed the normal rate of intensity [of work] and he forces him as best he can to extend the process of labour beyond the time necessary to replace the amount laid out in wages\" (987). \n          For Marx, capitalism is not a voluntary system; workers are not free to enter into and out of their relation with capital, since capital itself cannot survive without the constant supply of labour from which to extract surplus value. Needs and wants can only be satisfied within the labour/capital relation which homogenises labour into exchange value in terms of a wage, pegged to subsistence levels: \"the capital earmarked for wages . . . belongs to the worker as soon as it has assumed its true shape of the means of subsistence destined to be consumed by him\" (984). The \"true shape\" of wages, and hence the single, univocal truth of the wage labourer, is that he is condemned to subsistence consumption, because his capacity to share in the surplus value extracted from his own labour is circumscribed by the alliance between capital and the state, where wages are fixed and controlled according to wage market regulations. \n          Marx's account of the labour/capital relation is imposing in its description of the dilemma of labour under the power of capital. Capitalism appears as a thermodynamic system fuelled by labour power, where, in order to make the system homogeneous, to produce exchange value, resistance is reduced: \n          \n            \"Because it is capital, the automatic mechanism is endowed, in the person of the capitalist, with consciousness and a will. As capital, therefore, it is animated by the drive to reduce to a minimum the resistance offered by man, that obstinate yet elastic natural barrier.\" (527)\n            \n          \nIn the capitalist system resistance takes the form of a living residue within the system itself, acting as an \"elastic natural barrier\" to the extractive force of capital. Marx names this living residue \"man\". In offering resistance, that is, in being subjected to the force of capital, the figure of man persists as the incommensurable presence of a resistive force composed by a refusal to assimilate. (Lyotard 102) \n          This ambivalent position (the place of many truths) which places man within/outside capital, is not fully recognised by Marx at this stage of his analysis. It suggests the presence of an immanent force, coming from the outside, yet already present in the figure of man (man as \"offering\" resistance). This force, the counter-force operating through man as the residue of labour, is necessarily active in its effects on the system. That is to say, resistance in the system is not resistance to the system, but the resistance which carries the system elsewhere, to another place, to another time. Unlike the force of capital which works on labour to preserve the system, the resistive force figured in man works its way through the system, transforming it as it goes, with the elusive power to refuse. \n          The separation of labour and capital necessary to create the conditions for capitalism to flourish is achieved by the action of a force operating on labour. This force manifests itself in the strict surveillance of work, through supervisory practices: \"the capitalist's ability to supervise and enforce discipline is vital\" (Marx 986). Marx's formulation of supervision here and elsewhere, assumes a direct power relation between the supervisor and the supervised: a coercive power in the form of 'the person of the capitalist, with consciousness and a will'. Surplus value can only be extracted at the maximum rate when workers are entirely subjected to physical surveillance. \n          As Foucault has shown, surveillance practices in the nineteenth century involved a panoptic principle as a form of surveillance: \n          \n            \"Power has its principle not so much in a person as in a certain concerted distribution of bodies, surfaces, lights, gazes; an arrangement whose internal mechanisms produce the relation in which individuals get caught up.\" (202)\n            \n          \nPower is not power over, but a productive power involving the commingling of forces, in which the resistive force of the body does not oppose, but complies with an authoritative force: \"there is not a single moment of life from which one cannot extract forces, providing one knows how to differentiate it and combine it with others\" (165). This commingling of dominant and resistive forces is distributive and proliferating, allowing the spread of institutions across social terrains, producing both \"docile\" and \"delinquent\" bodies at the same time: \"this production of delinquency and its investment by the penal apparatus ...\" (285, emphasis added). Foucault allows us to think through the dilemma posed by Marx, where labour appears entirely subject to the power of capital, reducing the worker to subsistence levels of existence. Indeed, Foucault's work allows us to see the figure of man, briefly adumbrated in quote from Marx above as \"that obstinate yet elastic natural barrier\", but refigured as an active, investing, transformative force, operating within the capitalist system, yet sending it on its way to somewhere else. \n          In Foucauldian terms, self-surveillance takes on a normative function during the nineteenth century, producing a set of disciplinary values around the concepts of duty and respectability (Childers 409). These values were not only imposed from above, through education and the state, but enacted and maintained by the workers themselves, through the myriad threads of social conformity operating in daily life, whereby people made themselves suitable to each other for membership of the imagined community of disciplined worker-citizens. In this case, the wellbeing of workers gravitated to self-awareness and self-improvement, seen for instance in the magazines circulating at the time addressed to a worker readership (e.g. The Penny Magazine published in Britain from 1832-1845; see Sinnema 15). Instead of the satisfaction of needs in subsistence consumption, the worker was possessed by a desire for self-improvement, taking place in his spare time which was in turn, consolidated into the ego-ideal of the bourgeois self as the perfected model of civilised, educated man. Here desire takes the form of a repression (Freud 355), where the resistive force of the worker is channelled into maintaining the separation between labour and capital, and where the worker is encouraged to become a little bourgeois himself. The desire for self-improvement by the worker did not lead to a shift into the capitalist classes, but was satisfied in coming to know one's place, in being satisfied with fulfilling one's duty and in living a respectable life; that is in being individuated with respect to the social domain. \n          \n           \n          Figure 1 - \"The British Beehive\", George Cruickshank's image of the hierarchy of labour in Victorian England (1840, modified 1867). Each profession is assigned an individualised place in the social order.\n          A time must come however, in the accumulation of surplus-value, in the vast accelerating machine of capitalism, when the separation between labour and capital begins to dissolve. This point is reached when the residue left by capital in extracting surplus value is sufficient for the worker to begin consuming for its own sake, to engage in \"unproductive expenditure\" (Bataille 117) where desire is released as an active force. At this point, workers begin to abandon the repressive disciplines of duty and respectability, and turn instead to the control mechanisms of self-transformation or the \"inventing of a self as if from scratch\" (Massumi 18). \n          In advanced capitalism, where the accrued wealth has concentrated not only profit but wages as well (a rise in the \"standard of living\"), workers cease to behave as subordinated to the system, and through their increased spending power re-enter the system as property owners, shareholders, superannuants and debtees with the capacity to access money held in banks and other financial institutions. As investment guru Peter Drucker has pointed out, the accumulated wealth of worker-owned superannuation or \"pension\" funds, is the most significant driving force of global capital today (Drucker 76-8). In the superannuation fund, workers' labour is not fully expended in the production of surplus value, but re-enters the system as investment on the workers' behalf, indirectly fuelling their capacity to fulfil desires through a rapidly accelerating circulation of money. As a consequence, new consumer industries begin to emerge based on the management of investment, where money becomes a product, subject to consumer choice. The lifestyles of the old capitalist class, itself a simulacra of aristocracy which it replaced, are now reproduced by the new worker-capitalist, but in ersatz forms, proliferating as the sign of wealth and abundance (copies of palatial homes replace real palaces, look-alike Rolex watches become available at cheap prices, medium priced family sedans take on the look and feel of expensive imports, and so forth). \n          Unable to extract the surplus value necessary to feed this new desire for money from its own workforce (which has, in effect, become the main consumer of wealth), capital moves 'offshore' in search of a new labour pool, and repeats what it did to the labour pools in the older social formations in its relentless quest to maximise surplus value. \n          Work and Control\n          We are now witnessing a second kind of labour taking shape out of the deformations of the disciplinary society, where surplus value is not extracted, but incorporated into the labour force itself (Mules). This takes place when the separation between labour and capital dissolves, releasing quantities of \"reserve time\" (the time set aside from work in order to consume), which then becomes part of the capitalising process itself. In this case workers become \n          \n            \"investors in their own lives (conceived of as capital) concerned with obtaining a profitable behaviour through information (conceived of as a production factor) sold to them.\" (Alliez and Feher 347).\n            \n          \nGilles Deleuze has identified this shift in terms of what he calls a \"control society\" where the individuation of workers guaranteed by the disciplinary society gives way to a cybernetic modulation of \"dividuals\" or cypher values regulated according to a code (180). \n          For dividualised workers, the resource incorporated into capital is their own lived time, no longer divided between work and leisure, but entirely \"consummated\" in capital (Alliez and Fehrer 350). A dividualised worker will thus work in order to produce leisure, and conversely enjoy leisure as a form of work. Here we have what appears to be a complete breakdown of the separation of labour and capital instigated by the disciplinary society; a sweeping away of the grounds on which labour once stood as a mass of individuals, conscious of their rivalry with capital over the spoils of surplus value. Here we have a situation where labour itself has become a form of capital (not just a commodity exchangeable on the market), incorporated into the temporalised body of the worker, contributing to the extraction of its own surplus value. \n          Under the disciplinary society, the body of the worker became subject to panoptic surveillance, where \"time and motion\" studies enabled a more efficient control of work through the application of mathematical models. In the control society there is no need for this kind of panoptic control, since the embodiment of the panoptic principle, anticipated by Foucault and responsible for the individuation of the subject in disciplinary societies, has itself become a resource for extracting surplus value. In effect, dividualised workers survey themselves, not as a form of self-discipline, but as an investment for capitalisation. Dividuals are not motivated by guilt, conscience, duty or devotion to one's self, but by a transubjective desire for the other, the figure of a self projected into the future, and realised through their own bodily becoming. Unlike individuals who watch themselves as an already constituted self in the shadow of a super-ego, dividuals watch themselves in the image of a becoming-other. \n          We might like to think of dividuals as self-correctors operating in teams and groups (franchises) whose \"in-ness\" as in-dividuals, is derived not from self-reflection, but from directiveness. Directiveness is the disposition of a habitus to find its way within programs designed to maximise performance across a territory. Following Gregory Bateson, we might say that directiveness is the pathway forged between a map and its territory (Bateson 454). A billiard ball sitting on a billiard table needs to be struck in such a way to simultaneously reduce the risk of a rival scoring from it, and maximise the score available, for instance by potting it into a pocket. The actual trajectory of the ball is governed by a logic of \"restraint\" (399) which sets up a number of virtual pathways, all but one of which is eliminated when the map (the rules and strategies of the game) is applied to the territory of the billiard table. If surveillance was the modus operandi of the old form of capitalism which required a strict control over labour, then directiveness is the new force of capital which wants to eliminate work in the older sense of the word, and replace it with the self-managed flow of capitalising labour. \n          Marx's labour theory of value has led us, via a detour through Foucault and Deleuze, to the edge of the labour/capital divide, where the figure of man reappears, not as a worker subject to capital, but in some kind of partnership with it. This seems to spell the end of the old form of work, which required a strict delineation between labour and capital, where workers became rivals with capital for a share in surplus value. In the new formation of work, workers are themselves little capitalists, whose labour time is produced through their own investments back into the system. Yet, the worker is also subject to the extraction of her labour time in the necessity to submit to capital through the wage relation. This creates a reflexive snarl, embedded in the worker's own self-image, where work appears as leisure and leisure appears as work, causing labour to drift over capital and vice versa, for capital to drift over labour. This drifting, mobile relation between labour and capital cannot be secured through appeals to older forms of worker awareness (duty, responsibility, attentiveness, self-surveillance) since this would require a repression of the desire for self-transformation, and hence a fatal dampening of the dynamics of the market (anathema to the spirit of capitalism). Rather it can only be directed through control mechanisms involving a kind of forced partnership between capital and labour, where both parties recognise their mutual destinies in being \"thrown\" into the system. In the end, work remains subsumed under capital, but not in its alienated, disciplinary state. Rather work has become a form of capital itself, one's investment in the future, and hence as valuable now as it was before. It's just a little more difficult to see how it can be protected as a 'right' of the worker, since workers are themselves investors of their own labour, and not right-bearing individuals whose position in society has been fixed by the separation of labour from capital. \n          \n          References\n          \nAlliez, Eric and Michel Feher. \"The Luster of Capital.\" Zone1/2 (1987): 314-359.\n            Bataille, Georges.

But the answer to the riddle is quite simple: they all made appearances in Japanese television commercials in 1999. 1\n        Of course, these actors, actresses, writers, politicians, athletes, television and cartoon characters, paintings, and world events, weren't all conjured to stand by themselves. Most often they were juxtaposed with Japanese actors, inserted into Japanese settings, or brought into contact with products for sale. In a large number of cases they were not only intermingled, but mutated. Most importantly, though, the appropriation, alteration and blending generally had less to do with commercial than cultural communication. For, in Japan, where advertising as a genre is increasingly characterized by diminishing attention to product,2 ads now tend to adopt the role of cultural historian as much as that of commodity hawker; they more frequently now serve as social commentator rather than simply popular entertainer. And the insertion of such exo-cultural elements into ad text assists the performance of these new-age functions.\n        Indeed, the endless stream of Greek myths, Hollywood movies, historical events, popular songs, scientists, athletes and novelists now embedded in audio-visual space constitutes a phenomenon. Such content is part and parcel of an on-going process of cultural enfolding in which elements from beyond the spatial, temporal and/or ideational bounds of contemporary Japan are loaded into 15 second commercial communication for immediate, local consumption. It is my contention that this mode of discourse amounts to a strategy for interpreting contemporary experience. Importantly, it is neither a passive nor benign form. As this paper seeks to show, such cultural enfolding has important consequences and far-reaching implications for Japanese society.\n        The intentional intermingling of previously unrelated symbolic content from alien spatio-temporal contexts is a communication act I call \"resignification\".\n        Resignification Explained\n        As its name implies, resignification is a semiotic process—meaning that it involves the creation of meaning from signs. However, resignification is a particular kind of semiosis: one where new sign elements (signifiers, signifieds, signs, significations) are lifted from their original contexts and inserted into other semiotic sequences, though not always (indeed seldom) in the position they occupied in their prior incarnation.\n          \n                  Two aspects are most salient about resignification: first, strung together in unrelenting sequence, such recycling amounts to a phenomenon of sociological import. Most especially, because, procedurally, resignification both reflects and assists cultural mutation.\n        Restated, the repeated insertion into ad text of exo-spatial, exo-temporal cultural images and ideas is so pervasive in Japan today that it must qualify as a major mode of communication—a way in which one of the major institutions in contemporary Japanese society (advertising) chooses to interpret and process human experience. Further, because two kinds of cases can be found—those in which resignification seeks to reflect prevailing social reality, and those in which it appears to redefine it--we can here aver that resignification is socially re/productive.\n        In other work, 3 I have detailed the technical dimensions of resignification—the seven ways inductive treatment of Japanese ads has suggested that resignification is effected. In the space that remains here I would like to focus on exposition: introducing a number of examples of resignification in Japanese advertising today. From that empirical base I will draw some inferences about the nature of Japanese society, then close by speculating about the possible cultural consequences of this phenomenon.\n        Evidence of Resignification: 10 Recent Examples \n        \n\n            An ad for an icy-spray features Leslie Nielson, star of the \"Naked Gun\" film series. Here though, Nielson plays a marshal in the wild west, rather than a modern day, big city detective. Nonetheless, Nielson imports his cinematic persona as a bumbling, dim-witted defender of justice into the ad. His sheriff is a burlesque, sexist and socially inappropriate hero. Thus, as three villains seek to bait him by restraining an attractive barmaid, Neilson calmly strolls over and shoots the cool spray into the helpless woman's cleavage. Predictable for this genre, the damsel offers up an orgasmic coo of pleasure.\n          \n          \n            A pert, blond-haired woman coiffed and clothed in the style of an American homemaker, circa 1970, stands in the driveway outside her sprawling suburban home. All at once she drops into a crouch and extends her arms toward her Honda compact. Jets of pixie dust emanate from her fingertips. Cut to a close-up of her behind the wheel. She wiggles her nose and wriggles her ears and suddenly babies in strollers and spotted dogs begin to talk. For the pop-culturally literate, these are references to products from Hollywood's recent past: television's \"Bewitched\", cinema's \"Look Who Talking\", \"Look Who's Talking, Too\" and \"101 Dalmatians\".\n          \n          \n            A mustachioed man clad in early-twentieth century attire strikes a thoughtful pose. Cut from the table upon which his elbow rests to an exterior, where he is now contemplating a luxury car. A lined paper with the Japanese script \"sore kare\" (\"and then\") flashes on the screen. At this juncture in a second version a cat scampers beneath the car and the man stoops to coax it out. Both paper and cat are references—signifiers from deep cultural text—employed to assist ad readers in decoding the man's identity. He is Soseki Natsume, arguably Japan's most esteemed novelist. We know this not only from the opening pose—which comes from a famous photograph—but also from the cues \"And Then…\" and \"I am a Cat\", two of his published titles.\n          \n          \n            A mid-twenties, shaggy-haired, waif-like man slurps instant ramen alongside: (a) former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev as he delivers his 1985 \"perestroika\" speech to the Politburo; (b) home-run king Sadaharu Oh, as he swats his world record-breaking 756th home run; and (c) a group of revelers atop the Berlin Wall during its festive destruction. In the most recent version---through the wonders of robotics and tape wizardry—the young man exchanges his cup of broth for Elvis Presley's guitar. Like Woody Allen's Zelig, or Winston Groom's \"Forrest Gump\", this CupNoodles campaign amends history by inserting a fictional protagonist into actual events.\n          \n          \n            To promote its system of integrated photocopying, Canon emphasizes the ability to print realistic, high quality computer-generated and Fax-transmitted images. As proof they offer a medium-tight shot of a Japanese model with bare shoulders and unadorned hair. A background is etched in, followed by a quick flash of light. Suddenly the model is transformed into the likeness of the Mona Lisa. Cut back to the original, bare shouldered shot, again a flash of light, and the woman is transformed into a famous Japanese portrait. Finally, as the commercial comes to a close, the model is shown on glossy paper, unspooling from the copier. She is reclining in a costume and pose identical to that in Goya's \"The Maja Clothed\".\n          \n          \n            The car named \"Rosso\" (\"red\" in Italian, \"aka\" in Japanese) and the model, Umemiya Anna, are displayed with the anchored script: \"Anna Aka Rosso\". Anna is tinted red from head to toe. Red, of course, being the universal signifier for passion and desire. 4 Not a trivial point, as the sight of the red Anna is enough to cause the blood of a male on-looker to boil. Steam gushes from his ears—a geyser which proves of sufficient force to propel Anna's skirt skyward. During the course of the windy interlude, Anna struggles to restrain the hem of her rising garment. The situation, as well as her gesture, is an unmistakable imitation of Marilyn Monroe's turn on the subway grate in \"The Seven Year Itch\". 5\n          \n          \n            In an ad for hair replacement, a man is assaulted by gale-force winds. He ends up being blown down the dusty street on his back, tossed like a rag doll until he manages to latch onto a tree. Clearly, the situation helps convey that this company's product works, but why is it an exemplar of resignification? Close scrutiny of these comparative photos suggests that the images from the ad (lower right) are painstaking reproductions of a sequence from a Buster Keaton movie (upper left). These are not merely images inspired by, nor even modeled after an earlier cultural product (as in the Anna-Monroe case above); these are frame for frame reproductions with a Japanese actor standing in for Keaton.\n          \n          \n            In 1998, after years of trying, Japan's national soccer team finally qualified for the World Cup. The goal that booked their passage was dramatically struck in overtime by a substitute player. Okano, the scruffy, shaggy-haired striker, became a national hero, his triumphant moment replayed endlessly on Japanese television and rehashed in the press. Shortly thereafter, Acom, a money-lending institution, appropriated the final sequence—the lunging goalie, the rebound trickling off his hands, the sliding striker, Okano's disbelieving run toward his frenzied teammates—as the next installment in its long-running ad campaign. Because Acom's series was set in outer space, the World Cup was refashioned as a qualifier for the \"Galaxy Cup\", and the striker was a green alien (rather than a Japanese hippy). However, just as with the Keaton ad, in every other particular the key images were painstakingly reproduced, then inscribed with new significatory value when set into the new ideational context.\n          \n          \n            A fleet of VWs rolls onto a dock. The camera pans skyward where the American space shuttle idles. Inside mission control a television is tuned to a public celebration. The camera zooms in on the screen--in time to capture a red Golf pulling to a halt outside the gates of an enormous cathedral. Walking down the long red carpet toward the car are a bride and groom. Cut to a close-up of the couple: Princess Diana holding a bouquet, grinning broadly, on the arm of Prince Charles in formal military dress. The VW stops in front of the pair and they appear to get in. The car darts off, zig-zagging around a line of protestors. Cut to a chaotic scene, soon recognizable as the frenzied destruction of the Berlin Wall. 6 As a section of the wall is yanked from its moorings, a group of fast-moving revelers stream forward to command the previously blockaded square. The red Golf zips in front of the celebrants and quickly enters what was formerly East Germany. Cut to written text (in Japanese), situated above the \"VW Golf\" logo. \"The revolution is not over\" it intones.\n          \n          \n            3 salarymen sit in a smoky bar after a long day of work. One man, wiping his hands and face with a moist towelette, rants: 'All this talk about globalization, etcetera… but Japan is made a fool of by the world… Once and for all we have to speak out gatsun.' 7\n          \n        \n\n\n          He pushes his glasses atop his head. 'If it were me, I would say it!' He wipes his face vigorously with the towelette. 'I'd say it, gatsun.' Superimposed over his image is his personal data in white letters: 'Itoh Masayuki, 37 years, corporate man.' The frame fades to black and white, freezes. Action resumes with Itoh throwing his towel down in disgust and declaring: 'Because I'm that type!\n          \n        \n\n          Cut to an extreme close-up of the towelette—now lying on someone's knee. As the camera pans back, we find the knee belongs to Bill Clinton—or, at least, an actor of amazing likeness. He is seated opposite Itoh-san in a room that looks very much like the Oval Office. Surrounding the two are translators, advisors and secret service agents. The presidential look-alike flicks the towel off his leg with disdain and says in Clinton's distinctive drawl: \"So! I'd like to hear your honest opinions…'' To the swell of mariachi music Itoh gulps hard, stares vacantly at the President, and tries to muster that suddenly elusive \"gatsun\".\n        \n        \n        Analysis: Making Sense of the Pell-mell Mix\n        As conceived by Barthes 8 the project of semiology was to observe signs within the social setting and, by fitting them into \"chains of signification\", reveal the underlying nature of society. Signification, though, is only the final step in a long procession, and along the way it is relatively easy for the analyst to become waylaid by the arcana of signs--which color is a signifier, which past movie scene a signified, which compendium of events a signification. It is challenging and oft-times fun, but inordinate attention to these mechanics threatens to derail the larger objective: understanding advertising in cultural context; seeing resignification as a process that has meanings and implications in the larger social world.\n        Attention to this latter aim leads us in two distinct directions. The first is denotative: the surface meaning of resignification. Here the concern is with the place or function of the phenomenon within society, as well as its uses and tangible impacts. The second thread is connotative: centering on the deeper, significatory meaning of resignification. The repetitious appropriation of cultural text from other spaces, times, ideational systems and media and its robust inclusion in the focal, contemporary (in this case, Japanese) television context, has much to tell us about the development of society.\n        Denotation: Resignification as Socio-Cultural Phenomenon\n        \n         Barthes model of signification is two-tiered. It holds that the first sign serves as the basis for a signification relative to that sign, but that it also serves as the first component in a second, more deeply-ensconced sign sequence. In this way an ad/sign tells the analyst not only about the datum immediately in front of her, but also about the existence of a deeper, societal-wide process. This process, In turn, either accounts for (i.e. re/produces) or else is given impetus to (i.e. is re/produced) by the ad/sign/signification being observed. By joining the resulting significations of this second chain with numerous significations of similar ilk, the ontology of the larger society from which the sign originates can come into focus. In a word, the second order sign helps elucidate society.\n        In this way, we can see that references in Japanese ads to Hollywood movies, Japanese cartoon characters, Greek myths, sports' stars (American, European and, increasingly, Japanese), popular songs, and television and stage scenarios, are not simply singular, isolated instances of cultural reference. They are more than simple evidence of cultural reproduction. For, when joined, they serve as a comment on the nature of contemporary Japanese society: a society of pell-mell combination, of promiscuous, incessant mix.\n        But what, specifically, do references to Samantha Stevens of American TV's \"Bewitched\", Princess Diana's wedding to Prince Charles, the Beatle's \"Abbey Road\", the fall of the Berlin Wall, and a gesture by Marilyn Monroe, (etcetera, etcetera, etcetera…) tell us?\n        Standing back and looking at these signs as a related set of significations, it tells us, most obviously, about the import of foreign content in Japanese ads. As obvious as this may be, it is not a trivial observation. In other countries—for instance Malaysia and the United States—foreign content in ads can be decidedly scant.9 Both of these countries are quite insular in their commercial world views. Their mediations are aimed at reproducing indigenous culture. By extension, and consequently, the warehouse of exogenous images and ideas can be quite empty. Contrast this with Japan's ad world: the people, places and practices from outside contemporary Japan are incredibly rich and wide-ranging. Certainly, this world is fuller when compared to its own communication environment from only a few years back; back when Japan was a physically isolated, ideationally exclusionary country.\n        \n         \n        Such significations do more than merely mix, though. They inform viewers that history—selective though it may be--is important; that elites and high achievers—stars of film, television, recording studio, court and turf, and political office—are important; that media, itself, is important. The recurrent appearance of resignified signs tells Japanese that theirs is a society in large part attuned to and driven by media and its many products.\n        Under conditions of resignification, Japanese ads also tell recipients of the importance of indigenous myths, of past cultural practices and beliefs. Thus, kappa make periodic appearances, as do kimono, enka, sumo, geisha, the Edo era, samurai, and a strict ordering based on manners, age, and gender.\n         \n         \n        At the same time, cultural products from the west are just as pervasive and salient: above all movies, television programs, and pop music from the '60s and '70s. 10 Increasingly, ads introduce \"alien\" ideas—practices and beliefs once perceived as antithetical to the context. For instance, current ads depict such antipodal acts as:\n        \na young woman spreading her arms wide on a jetty and screaming to the ocean in English: \"I wish I were a bird\";\n          a father doting on his family with the superscript beseeching: \"find time for the family\";\n          college kids hanging out in an internet cafe with the advisory: \"make time for yourself\";\n          popular stars driving the back roads of America telling one another \"the truth is out there\";\n          an endless parade of kisses, clutches and fondles between aggressive young heterosexual couples.\n        \nFor a society that was insular for hundreds of years and still retains a considerable isolationist mentality--due to language, geography, psychology, rituals, beliefs and political history—the new mix of exo-cultural content with everyday Japanese life is far from a trivial development.\n        First-Order Connotation: Semiotic Literacy and the Ad Audience\n        Even more important than content, though, is what that content communicates about the audience: about their intellectual capacity, their likes, interests and practices. For, this constant emphasis on resignification underscores a presumption about audience competence. Ads chock full of exogenous signs demand a fairly high level of semiotic literacy. Without that literacy, the signifiers would be undecodable; the signifieds formed would stray far from advertiser intention. And, if that were the case, the ads would amount to nothing more than glossy in-jokes; incredibly expensive productions which, save for their possible entertainment value, would stand as hollow enterprises whose primary meanings would be lost on their recipients. 11\n        But for audience members with a baseline level of semiotic literacy, who are also reading (i.e. actively processing) advertising text, the proximate effect of resignification is to add to what Berger and Luckmann have called societal members' \"stock of knowledge\".12 The consequence of the pell-mell explosion of signs within Japan's simulation/strip-universe is that the viewer's symbolic universe 13 has expanded beyond measure. Suddenly Greek gods, Hollywood icons, current Japanese singers, international sports stars, foreign politicians and key historical events are woven into a singular ideational cloth. These signs are often mixed and matched—either within individual ads or in contiguous context. For instance, in the case of intra-ad melding, renowned Japanese cinematic tough guy, Takakura Ken lies on a tatami mat dressed in Japanese yutaka, the drone of a street matsuri outside his window. He guzzles Kirin beer to the backing of the theme from \"A Chorus Line\". In the case of inter-ad mixing, Ken's ad may be followed by one for instant noodles in which the famous—though ancient and by now quite obscure--Japanese myth \"Sayuuki\" is refashioned for a contemporary audience.\n        The significance of resignification, then, is this: the advertising public is brought into continual encounter with signs that have been lifted out of one spatio/temporal/ideational context and/or appropriated from other media forms. The constant communication of this content has the ability to stimulate users, possessive of a high level of semiotic literacy, to \"see\" their ideational universe in an array of differing, but specifiable, ways. Above all, ad readers are prodded to perceive their world as more global, trans-historical, synthetic, poly-ideational, and multi-cultural. This, by virtue of the fact that a considerable number of the signs the viewer now encounters emanate from spaces, epochs and media forms beyond the local/present mediation. In essence, under the repetitive pulse of advertising, strong pressures are exerted on Japanese ad readers to develop a more extensive world literature. The result is an accruing library, chock full of (generally popular) cultural, exo-contextual text. 14\n        Conclusion: Resignification and MediaCulture\n        I have reserved second-order connotation—the question of societal ontology--for the close. Japan's current configuration could be called \"MediaCulture\"---a \"total environment\" in which an enormous portion of the socio-cultural, political-economic, historico-mythic content under-girding society circulates through media. 15 Through a confluence of media forms, such ideational content serves to frame, inform, prod, guide--even influence—human organization and behavior.\n        In MediaCulture, advertising is, at once, a great communicator of cultural content, as well as one of the greatest consolidators of the sectors its content refers to. With its energy, sheer speed, licentious blending of forms and collision of ideas, advertising compels sectoral union—for instance, the economic with the cultural, the cultural with the political, the economic with the political. This may not always lead to felicitous results.\n        Thus, for instance, in the Bill Clinton ad, described earlier, the line between polity and economy becomes easily blurred. There is a product for sale, but the ad text downplays the drink and, instead, highlights the debate between a typical sarariman and an American president. Putting aside the question of whether a meeting between those of differing linguistic, occupational, status and national ranks could be possible, 16 the advertisement set up commercialized discourse under the auspices of the political.\n        Similarly, consider the following ad for the orange drink, Nachan. In this offering the ad audience watches a twenty-something woman supping the beverage for sale as she watches a television drama broadcast in her floating (i.e. simulation/strip) world. Her drama, also called Nachan, features a heroine strikingly similar to the star of an actual television drama—the renowned story on NHK called Nonchan. In the real-world serial, Nonchan is a courageous woman living in posbellum Japan who must go out into the world of work, provide for her family and keep their fraying unity intact. The protagonist in the floating world scene (who also happens to be known in real life as Na-chan!) stares raptly at her TV screen as the Nachan on TV takes a strong moral stand in front of her family and co-workers. To the saccharine swell of violins signaling the end of today's installment, the ad's protagonist (Na-chan) utters: \"how strong that Nachan is!\" She punctuates her commentary by quickly quaffing her canned drink (Nachan). The commercial closes by panning back from her apartment window. From a vantage point across the street the ad audience spies into the young woman's spare, television-centered existence.\n        At one level it may all just be a pleasure--a thrill, a joke, a tease for the memory--as some popular culture studies have characterized \"the popular\". 17 At another level, though, by assisting in the development of simulation/strips that play on pre-existing cultural themes, yet also work to combine and consolidate our perception and experience of actual societal sectors, resignification serves as a powerful re/productive force. In its licentious blending of the cultural, economic, the moral and social, resignification trivializes--even debases--the values at the heart of at least one (if not all) of the engaged sectors. The original cultural text (for instance, U.S./Japan relations or Nonchan) is co-opted and rendered more obscure by the commercial text (cranky sarariman, noble Nachan). But even more egregiously, \"reality\" is refashioned in a form that makes current existence (the real-world salaried worker's grueling existence; the spare, media-centered existence of Nachan's fan) seem more palatable.\n        This is certainly the case in the Clinton ad. The sarariman suddenly gets his say, his chance to cease being a mere economic drone. As for the Nachan offering, it is more the case that wrapping the \"real fiction\" within the \"fictitious fiction\" possesses the potential of: (a) reifying the virtuous heroine of the former as well as all she signifies (i.e. her travail, the original production's nationalist message); or else (b) devaluing women's struggle (which was a major message of Nonchan) by associating it with the product for sale.\n        Whatever the case, examples of sectoral absorption in advertising are extensive under conditions of MediaCulture. And, as the following panel implies, often such absorption is the result of resignification.\n         \n        The brilliant provacateur, Baudrillard, once averred: \"today we are experiencing… the absorption of all virtual modes of communication into that of advertising\". 18 However, in witnessing the extensive use of cultural enfolding in Japanese advertising, one might fairly begin to wonder whether we aren't on the road toward the absorption of advertising into the communication mode of resignification. \n          \n        Notes \n          1. Sprinkled throughout the text is visual documentation of what I am calling \"resignification\". From literally hundreds of images, sounds and situations employing exo-cultural signifiers, I have selected the following which, it is hoped, provide some sense of the contemporary resignification-rich milieu in Japanese television. These include:\n        Panel 1 (left to right): Salvadore Dali’s The Persistence of Memory in an ad for NTT Data; Mikael Gorbachev announcing his Perestroika policy in a Nissin CupNoodle ad; The Addams Family driving through Edo era Japan in an ad for Honda Odyssey.\n        Panel 2: (left): ad for Victoria (English black tea); (right): The Beatles’ Abbey Road album cover.\n        Panel 3: (left): ad for Canon Copiers; (right): Goya’s The Maja Clothed.\n        Panel 4: (left): ad for Rosso cars; (right): Marilyn Monroe in The Seven Year Itch.\n        Panel 5 (left to right): American cowboys in an ad for Japanese cell phones; a Japanese mythical river creature (\"kappa\") in an ad for Kincho’s anti-mosquito vapor; Tiger Woods fronting Niagara Falls in an ad for canned coffee.\n        Panel 6 (left to right): Japan Railways; Lawson convenience stores; National Homebuilders.\n        Panel 7 (left to right): Japan Racing Association (JRA) placing the English word \"Dream\" at the center of an ad whose text encourages the marginalized in society to follow their desires (in this case exemplified by betting on ponies); Suntory Wine employing kohaku (the decades-long, immensely popular, New Year’s Eve songfest that pits star-studded \"white\" versus \"red\" teams) as a motif for selling their line of wines (and introducing a famous transvestite for the role of rosé); Nissan Motors naming a car \"Liberty\", then crafting an ad that demonstrates how the vehicle can free men and women to better conduct their daily (albeit, gendered) chores.\n        2. A trend (or stage) I call \"product least advertising\". Owing to the fact that this \"cultural frame\" consistently circumvents narrative and ideational unity I have (however reluctantly) labeled this stage \"postmodern\". On cultural frames see W. S. Leiss, et. al., Social Communication in Advertising: Persons, Products and Images of Well-being, New York: Routledge, (1990). For a detailed analysis of the postmodern stage in Japanese advertising, see T.J.M. Holden, \"Reading Malaysian and Japanese Television Commercials: post-modernism, semiotic literacy and political-economic development\", in Proceedings of the International Conference on Japanese Studies: Japan-Southeast Asia Relations, Singapore: National University of Singapore (2000).\n        3. For those with Microsoft Explorer, the Powerpoint presentation detailing the theory and technics of resignification can be viewed on my home page, http://www.langc.tohoku.ac.jp/~holden/Presentations/Presentations-top.htm.\n        4. Regarding red as signifier, see G. Branston and R. Stafford, The Media Student’s Book , London: Routledge, (1996): p.7. As for its extensive use in advertising, see my work on color universals (\"The Color of Meaning: The Significance of Black and White in Television commercials,\" Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Vol.3, No.2 (1997):125-146) and culture-specific color conventions (\"The Color of Difference: Critiquing Cultural Convergence via Television Advertising,\" Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Vol.5, No.1 (1999):15-36).\n        5. Anna’s demur dip of the knees and one-handed repulse of the current is not identical to Monroe’s. So, too, Anna’s tight red mini stands in stark contrast to Monroe’s flowing white gown. As signifiers, then, the clothes and poses differ. This, though, is only in degree-and not enough to expunge one of the signifieds that the Japanese ad conjures. Certainly, though, Monroe’s act carries different meaning than Anna’s: the former's being volitional, the latter's unwitting and, in many ways, victim of the male’s sexist gaze. Despite the differences, though, one by-product of Anna’s struggle is the signified: \"Monroe on subway grate\".\n        6. As a sign the Berlin Wall and its fall are quite popular in advertising. Besides the two ads mentioned in this paper, a third last year, for Sony Wega (television), produced in England, also features a shot of the Wall falling-along with images of President Kennedy in Dallas just prior to his assassination, the American moon walk, the World Cup and Nelson Mandela delivering a speech as President of South Africa. As an aside, the appearance of such exo-cultural text in a British ad provides credence to the idea that resignification is not merely a phenomenon present in Japanese advertising, but is also extant in ads in other cultural contexts.\n        7. \"Gatsun\" is the word Japanese use to describe the sound made by a mallet striking a tree. It is applied to situations involving a forceful impact.\n        8. Barthes, R. Mythologies, (A. Lavers, trans.), New York: The Noonday Press, (1972 [1957]).\n        9. For a sustained demonstration of this point-and its implications for the maintenance of political power in Malaysia-see T. Holden, \"The Malaysian Dilemma: Advertising's Catalytic and Cataclysmic Role in Social Development,\" Media, Culture and Society (2001).\n        10. Among the many western songs backing ads in 1999-2000 were: The Beatle's \"All You Need is Love\" , \"Give Peace a Chance\" and \"Ob-la-di-ob-la-da\"; Yes' \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\"; the Platter's \"Only You\"; The Carpenter’s \"We’ve Only Just Begun\"; and Queen’s \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". The list is as long as it is ever accreting.\n        More significant is the question why. One subscribing to Mannheim’s sociology of knowledge would almost certainly assert that this confluence is attributable to the age cohort crafting commercial communication today. As a \"generation\" their uniform use of musical signs from the 1960s and ‘70s stands as a powerful potential influence over cultural re/production, the cultural knowledge that will linger in society, and the demands for response that will challenge future generations. On this point see K. Mannheim, Ideology and Utopia: an introduction to the sociology of knowledge, (L. Wirth and E. Shils, trans.), New York: Harcourt, Brace Jovanovich (1936).\n        11. There is, though, something to the \"ads as entertainments\" argument. I, myself, have argued that this is one of the central features in contemporary Japanese advertising--a feature that helps separate them from their western brethren. Entertainment (as the major objective of the ad) is one of seven elements that constitutes the \"post-modern approach\" to ads. For a detailed discussion of this and the four stages preceding this stage of advertising communication, see my \"Reading Malaysian and Japanese Television Commercials: Postmodernism, Semiotic Literacy and Political-Economic Development,\" ibid.\n        12. P.L. Berger and T. Luckmann. The Social Construction of Reality: a treatise on the sociology of knowledge. Garden City, New York: Anchor Books, [1966].\n        13. On ads as \"strips\" see Goffman, Gender Advertisements, New York: Harper and Row, (1976). This idea of contrived and substituted \"reality\" anticipates Baudrillard’s more sophisticated (and more widely-applied) concept, \"simulation\". (See J. Baudrillard, Simulacra and Simulation, (S.F. Glaser, trans.), Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, (1994[1981]).\n        14. It is not accidental that these words are reminiscent of those penned by Marx and Engels in The Communist Manifesto. Recall that during their early discussion of capitalism’s inherent logic, they wrote of the \"batter(ing) down (of) all Chinese Walls\": the demise of \"national and local one-sidedness\" and, in its place, the rise of a \"world literature\". With resignification as a major communication mode employed by contemporary advertising (itself, a servant of capitalism), this globalizing effect is no less true today than it was back in 1872 (and likely much more so).\n        15. My conception of MediaCulture shares much in common with Kellner’s, though his was constructed with reference to America and attended less to advertising. At the same time, Japan’s MediaCulture features greater integration between media and amongst the societal sectors than the American condition described by Kellner. Japan’s MediaCulture is also contingent on the extensive operation of the \"cultural industries\"-in particular pop music , organized sport, television and advertising-to circulate societal values and practices. See D. Kellner, Media Culture: cultural studies, identity and politics between the modern and the postmodern. London and New York: Routledge (1995).\n        16. During the period that this particular Boss spot aired, President Clinton happened to visit Japan. He also happened to convene a \"town-hall\" style meeting with everyday Japanese citizens. The event was sponsored by a commercial TV station and in promoting the event, a news anchor (who was scheduled to host the meeting) implored Japanese citizens to send in their most \"gatsun\" questions and opinions-a reference, of course, to the Boss ad. After the event-which was roundly hailed as a smashing success--citizens and press, alike, came away saying \"if only our politicians were that accessible and straight-forward!\"; \"if only we had more such opportunities to dialogue with our leaders…\" Not unlike the Itoh scenario depicted in the Boss ad.\n        17. See, for instance, this view as articulated by J. Fiske in Understanding Popular Culture, London and New York: Routledge, (1989).\n        18. Baudrillard, ibid., p.87.\n      \n      \n    \n",

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n           Creators do not just 'create' or 'act' -- they are privileged agents, points of origin, sources of innovation and transformation. Within religious systems, creators can exist in an extra-discursive real beyond nature and culture, functioning as the origin of the word and being. They can be supernatural, existing outside nature to influence earthly events via strange powers. They can also be 'supra' natural -- above nature -- capable of acts that both break and establish laws to which the created are subject. Yet, these types of creators only seem to exist through the cultural economies which allow their representation. Their roles and personas can differ with the production, combination and utilisation of selected characterisations: in other words, creators are created. \n           As these texts explore, the idea of creator is a site of textual contestation, where creations must be authenticated not only by their authors but by their believers. These fictive acts and others like them, explored to great narrative detail in 'The Fall of Every Sparrow', contribute to the way we collectively construe and construct the idea of creators. Yet the notion of 'creating' used here can also be understood as a process of transformation and, in this sense, it is argued that creators 'act', that they produce and position the object of their creation as a social process or discrete detail to which people respond accordingly. It is in such an environment that society can claim to collectively worship the 'works of the great masters' and yet not draw evidence of an artist's signature from an almighty creator written in the living world. And though it might remain unclear or at least debatable whether these 'masters' truly perceived themselves as such, it is clear that from time to time society requires its citizens to legitimise such positioning through culturally accepted activities and institutions: for example, gala musical performances, poetry and prose readings, publications and book launches, art galleries and festivals, etc. \n           Our feature article, A Remarkable Disappearing Act: immanence and the creation of modern things by Warwick Mules, considers modern creation not as a phenomenon of the gifted artistic individual, but as present in the mediated spaces of the everyday. Drawing upon the theories of Latour and Deleuze and Guattari, he argues that the mode of desire of contemporary consumer culture is \"the ghost of a certain kind of immanence which has haunted modernity and its projects from the very beginning.\" Mules traces this immanence to Descartes' creation of the modern ego on the paradoxical basis that an autonomous subject is conceivable only on the grounds that it partakes in something outside of itself (in Descartes' case, God). Mules views the commodity as an exemplary modern object which binds consumers into particular fields of immanence (the relations of consumer formations) in their acts of consumer self-creation. \n           William J Wilson's fictional work, The Fall of Every Sparrow, recounts the last entry made by one Brother Clothren, an archeotheist whose main duty is to 'mark the fall of every sparrow'. This is an engaging and original piece, exploring concepts of deities 'wrought into existence solely by the collective belief and adoration of the worshipful races' and reflecting upon our own constructions of gods through irony in its evocative play on the contemporary death of the Terrene god Yahweh: 'Tell me about your gods', writes Wilson, 'and I will reveal the inmost secrets of you heart'. This is a piece that defies one reading – it's philosophical penetration demands additional readings. \n           In The Documentary Photographer as Creator Maria Mitropoulos investigates the tension between creation and the representation of events in the field of documentary photography. She traces longstanding debates in the field between those who emphasise the faithful recording of events, and those who—regarding the technological manipulation of images as a legitimate means of enhancing their impact—emphasise the expressive potentials of the medium. By tackling these issues she argues for the reinstatement of the referent (or the semiotic trace of it) as an object of critical inquiry. In her own conclusions she attempts to avoid the impasse between naïve realism and thoroughgoing constructionism, acknowledging instead how documentary photography may contribute to the becoming of reality. \n           Bev Curran analyses two novels—Le désert mauve by Nicole Brossard and The English Patient, by Michael Ondaatje— which exemplify \"how a translator may flaunt her creativity, and allow the cultural position of the translator vis à vis language, history, or gender to be critically exposed by the text itself.\" In Portrait of the Translator as Artist, she proceeds from a deconstruction of a received cultural opposition between the author and the translator, in which the activity of former is viewed as creative and that of the latter as derivative. She suggests that translation in the broader sense of an openness to textuality is a creative process which acknowledges influence, positionality and contradictory currents. It allows the creative subject to be transformed in and by versions of reality as a result of giving up the pretence to creative autonomy. \n           In That All May Be One: Co-creating God, community and religion within the Catholic sisters of St. Joseph, Patricia Foley explores the relationship between goals of self and the goals of religious institutions in the pursuit of social justice. In a personal and touching work about her sister's lure towards a religious organisation providing the opportunity to be 'involved in creative change', Foley considers the 'creation of new possibilities in the expression of faith'. Extending her argument beyond her concerns with her sister, Foley asks perhaps for a reconsideration of the overall location and situation of 'women religious' within and without the community. Foley suggests that contemporary forms of ministry for women can be diverse and empowering in application, which acknowledge more an individual's sense of creative autonomy than following the traditional image of a nun secluded within convent walls, unable to effect a difference. Marginalised positions, Foley argues, can become effective locations for change in rather creative ways. \n           Leanne McRae examines the relationship between crises of masculinity and bodybuilding in Rollins, representation and reality: Lifting the weight of masculinity. She argues that \"The desire to shore-up male power in the face of various 'threats' has called for a corporeal manifestation of masculine dominance.\" Part of this involves the performance of \"superhero\" myths across the body in order emphasise the supposed ability of men to create themselves and society. The article ends with a consideration of how rock star/bodybuilder Henry Rollins occupies, but plays with superhero roles, simultaneously embracing and deconstructing associated myths. \n           Finally, in an extended work, Juliette Crooks concludes this publication by interrogating the traditional depiction of Prometheus being tortured night upon night as perhaps the 'quintessential image of masculinity in crisis'. With a view to contextualising the relationship between creator and created, Crooks examines 'the usurping of maternal (creative) power by patriarchy' and the various experimental models in which masculine identity might be recreated in the contemporary age. \n           In closing, it can be argued that on the interpersonal, metaphorical, iconic or philosophical status of 'creators', cultural history shows their continual design. The articles in this issue deal with modern concepts of creation, from politics of self and creative autonomy, to the emerging linguistic foreplay between different forms of media and expression. The Romantics invented the author in the form of the creative artist-come-genius who is the originator of unique artistic impulses conceived in accordance with his/her own laws. Such creators seem peculiarly contemporary and it would be fair to argue that the idea of self-creation has stood behind many modern liberal concepts of agency. Yet it has also become the target of critique with the rise of constructionism, which emphasises the agency of language and society in determining subjectivity. And when such agency is debated, we can at least, according to some existentialists and liberals, count on the ability of the authentic individual to have the power to create him or her self. But as this publication aims to demonstrate, not all creators are created equally but are subject to the needs and desires of their worshippers. \n        \n      \n    ",

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n          The South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) commenced in 1996, providing high hopes to those concerned with change and redress. By many it was seen as the first stage in the reconciliation process. Former General Secretary of the South African Council of Churches, Reverend Frank Chikane, himself a victim of attempted murder when poisoned with nerve gas, likened the role of the TRC in the disclosure and forgiveness process to the confessional, and suggested that \"there can be no absolution without confession.\" However, Methodist bishop and long-time apartheid activist Peter Storey cautioned that \"One of our problems is that were trying to find a legal framework for what is essentially a spiritual and psychological process.\"\n\n          \"The Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act, No 34 of 1995\" states that \"amnesty shall be granted in respect of acts, omissions and offences associated with political objectives committed in the course of the conflicts of the past\", on the basis of full disclosure. The hearings are over, the committees nearing completion, and on 29 October 1998, the Final Report of the TRC was handed to President Nelson Mandela. Now we have five neatly bound volumes, but how much has changed in the lives of those who have suffered gross human rights violations at the hands of the perpetrators?\n\n          Some want retribution and will not rest until those who have tortured, abducted or murdered their loved ones or themselves have been tried and convicted. Others just want to bury their loved ones, along with \"this shameful chapter of our history.\" Decisions on who will be granted amnesty linger since the hearings closed.\n\n          Gillian Slovo, daughter of the late South African Communist Party leader, Joe Slovo, and his wife Ruth First, is one of those who is unwilling to let things rest. Her mother was killed by a letter bomb allegedly intended for Joe Slovo in 1982. She comments on the amnesty hearing of her mothers killer, former student spy Craig Williamson: \"We remembered the incredulity on the faces of the members of the committee when [Williamson] told the committee how he had looked at the intercepted envelope and seen the address, the postal mark and the logo, but not the name of the addressee.\" The Slovo family has now filed an application in the Cape High Court to set aside the amnesty accorded Williamson, whose testimony seemed contradictory, and not to meet the requirements of full disclosure. \n\n          And what of reparations to the victims of these human rights violations? An initial payment of R30 million rand (approximately $US 3, 844, 000) was made. People who were part of the urgent interim reparations payment received in the region of R2000 rands (approximately $US 250). In the case of those who have lost a loved one, says Duma Khumalo, a founding member of the Khulumani (Speak Out!) Support Group, and himself granted a stay of execution just 15 hours before he was to be hanged for a crime he did not commit, this has the effect of  \"the victims selling their dead.\"\n\n          The government now wrangles over whether further payments will be made, urging business to engage in reparations payments, with business declining to do so on the grounds that it is the role of the state. In the meantime, the suffering of victims seems to have become something of a political football.\n\n          Where does this leave us on the issue of forgiveness? There are two equally important parts to the issue of sorry: I am sorry, and I hear that you are sorry, and I forgive you.\n\n          Many South Africans feel that insult has been added to injury, because an assumption seems to have been made by some perpetrators that, having apologised, they must naturally be forgiven. This is at worst arrogant, and at best naïve. As anyone who has been through any kind of act of betrayal can attest, the healing process and forgiveness, take time. As Clarissa Pinkola Estes wrote in Women Who Run With the Wolves, forgiveness is not \"a singular act to be completed in one sitting\", but has \"many layers, many seasons.\"\n\n          For many the concept of re-conciliation is inappropriate, as this suggests a restoration of positive relations that existed in the past. However, for all but the youngest generation of South Africans, division and/or discrimination is all that theyve known. To some, conciliation seems more appropriate.\n\n          Others see reconciliation as a personal process and journey of coming to terms with a painful history, and reconciling only within oneself.\n\n          Still others have abandoned the idea of reconciliation and aim instead for resolution. As Gavin Harrison says, \"Sometimes things are also resolved when a situation is clearly comprehended, when all personal work relating to the situation is done, and you realise that, for whatever reason, full reconciliation is just not possible right now.\"\n\n          The mainstream media has become noticeably quiet in recent months on the issue of reparations. It would seem that after extensive coverage of the hearings, and then of the tensions between government and the TRC, they too have become burnt out. \n\n          What has captured their attention, however, and the attention of the public at large, is the controversial Declaration of Commitment by White South Africans, initiated by apartheid activist Carl Niehaus and others. Sociology lecturer at the University of the Witwatersrand, Eddie Webster observes ironically that \"it seems as if the signatories are largely drawn (with the puzzling exception of the South African rugby team) from prominent anti-apartheid figures.\" Quite absent from the signatories is the \"white leader who will say, We had an evil system with awful consequences. Please forgive us\" for whom Bishop Tutu had wished in his Forward to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Final Report. The absence of such a leader, says Tutu now, remains his biggest regret. (It should also be noted that a number of black South Africans chose to sign the declaration in support of the initiative.)\n\n          Possibly the best we can hope for are more people like Wilhelm Verwoerd, grandson of the architect of apartheid, Hendrik Verwoerd, whose openness about his own painful personal revolution can provide us with inspiration. Verwoerd reminds us that: \"As a beneficiary [of apartheid] I thus tend to take for granted my good education, my ownership of a house in town and my access to a family holiday home near the beach, my inheritance from parents, my relatively high income and low risk of unemployment. While individual effort and skill must be acknowledged, it is important to unmask a false, overconfident sense of entitlement, to help white South Africans see how much of what we have is built on unfair, systematic privileging.\"  Perhaps he can symbolise for us that hope lies not in the New South Africa, but in the new generation of South Africans, committed to change, and not waiting for government or big business to do it for us.\n\n          There are ever-increasing television documentaries about ordinary South Africans, black and white, \"who never made a proclamation or held an office, but were handed a place [in South Africa] and are quietly making a life out of it\" (Dietz). Such people seem often the strangest of bedfellows, stumbling around in the dark together and finding creative solutions to apparently insurmountable problems. Not politicians or academics, just ordinary people, with the ability to say I am sorry, I will try to make amends. Equally important is the ability to say, I recognise that you are sorry, and I will give you another chance. This, not the 1994 first democratic election, is the real miracle of South Africa.\n\n          \n          References\n\nCentre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation and Khulumani Support Group. \"Submission to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission: Survivors Perceptions of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and Suggestions for the Final Report.\" 1998. http://www.csvr.org.za/papers/papkhul.htm Downloaded 22 January 2001. \n\nChikane, Frank. \"The Role of Truth Commissions in the Process of Reconciliation in South Africa.\" Seminar presented at the Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation, 1 June 1994.\n\nCronin, Jeremy. \"Sorry Can Help, But on Its Own Its Not Enough.\" Mail and Guardian 12 January (2001). http://www.sn.apc.org/wmail/issues/010112/OTHER50.html Downloaded 22 January 2001.\n\nDaniels, Glenda. \"Superspys Pardon Challenged.\" Mail and Guardian 15 December (2000).http://www.mg.co.za/mg/za/archive/2000dec/features/15dec-craig.html  Downloaded 22 January 2001.\n\n\"Declaration of Commitment by White South Africans.\" http://www.homeforall.org.za/ENG/declarationENG.htm Downloaded 22 January 2001.\n\nDietz, Steven. \"Lonely Planet: Preface.\" Dramatists Play Service, 1994. http://sunsite.wits.ac.za/holistic/loneplan.htm Downloaded 22 January 2001.\n\nEstes, Clarissa Pinkola.

    "abstract": "\n      \n        \n           Creators and Creation\n          Creation is a troubling word today, because it suggests an impossible act, indeed a miracle: the formation of something out of nothing. Today we no longer believe in miracles, yet we see all around us myriad acts which we routinely define as creative. Here, I am not referring to the artistic performances and works of gifted individuals, which have their own genealogy of creativity in the lineages of Western art. Rather, I am referring to the small, personal events that we see within the mediated spaces of the everyday (on the television screen, in magazines and newspapers) where lives are suddenly changed for the better through the consumption of products designed to fulfil our personal desires. \n          In this paper, I want to explore the implications of thinking about everyday creativity as a modern cultural form. I want to suggest that not only is such an impossible possibility possible, but that its meaning has been at the centre of the desire to name, to gain status from, and to market the products of modern industrialisation. Furthermore I want to suggest that beyond any question of marketing rhetoric, we need to attend to this desire as the ghost of a certain kind of immanence which has haunted modernity and its projects from the very beginning, linking the great thoughts of modern philosophy with the lowliest products of modern life. \n          Immanence, Purity and the Cogito\n          In Descartes' famous Discourse on Method, the author-narrator (let's call him Descartes) recounts how he came about the idea of the thinking self or cogito, as the foundation of worldly knowledge: \n          \n            And so because sometimes our senses deceive us, I made up my mind to suppose that they always did. . . . I resolved to pretend that everything that had ever entered my mind was as false as the figments of my dreams. But then as I strove to think of everything false, I realized that, in the very act of thinking everything false, I was aware of myself as something real. (60-61)\n          \n \n          These well known lines are, of course, the beginnings of a remarkable philosophical enterprise, reaching forward to Husserl and beyond, in which the external world is bracketed, all the better to know it in the name of reason. Through an act of pretence (\"I resolved to pretend\"), Descartes disavows the external world as the source of certain knowledge, and, turning to the only thing left: the thought of himself—\"I was aware of myself as something real\"—makes his famous declaration, \"I think therefore I am\". \n           But what precisely characterises this thinking being, destined to become the cogito of all modernity? Is it purely this act of self-reflection?:\n          \n            Then, from reflecting on the fact that I had doubts, and that consequently my existence was not wholly perfect, it occurred to me to enquire how I learned to think of something more perfect than myself, and it became evident to me that it must be through some nature which was in fact more perfect. (62) \n              \n          \nDescartes has another thought that \"occurred to me\" almost at the same moment that he becomes aware of his own thinking self. This second thought makes him aware that the cogito is not complete, requiring yet a further thought, that of a perfection drawn from something \"more perfect than myself\". The creation of the cogito does not occur, as we might have first surmised, within its own space of self-reflection, but becomes lodged within what might be called, following Deleuze and Guattari, a \"plane of immanence\" coming from the outside: \"The plane of immanence is . . . an outside more distant than any external world because it is an inside deeper than any internal world: it is immanence\" (59). Here we are left with a puzzling question: what of this immanence that made him aware of his own imperfection at the very moment of the cogito's inception? Can this immanence be explained away by Descartes' appeal to God as a state of perfection? Or is it the very material upon which the cogito is brought into existence, shaping it towards perfection? We are forced to admit that, irrespective of the source of this perfection, the cogito requires something from the outside which, paradoxically, is already on the inside, in order to create itself as a pure form. \n          Following the contours of Descartes' own writing, we cannot account for modernity purely in terms of self-reflection, if, in the very act of its self-creation, the modern subject is shot through with immanence that comes from the outside. Rather what we must do is describe the various forms this immanence takes. Although there is no necessary link between immanence and perfection (that is, one does not logically depend on the other as its necessary cause) their articulation nevertheless produces something (the cogito for instance). Furthermore, this something is always characterised as a creation. \n          In its modern form, creation is a form of immanence within materiality—a virtualisation of material actuality, that produces idealised states, such as God, freedom, reason, uniqueness, originality, love and perfection. As Bruno Latour has argued, the \"modern critical stance\" creates unique, pure objects, by purging the material \"networks\" from which they are formed, of their impurities (11-12). Immanence is characterised by a process of sifting and purification which brings modern objects into existence: \"the plane of immanence . . . acts like a sieve\" (Deleuze and Guattari 42). The nation, the state, the family, the autonomous subject, and the work of art—all of these are modern when their 'material' is purged of impurities by an immanence that 'comes from the outside' yet is somehow intrinsic to the material itself. As Zygmunt Bauman points out, the modern nation exists by virtue of a capacity to convert strangers into citizens; by purging itself of impurities inhabiting it from within but coming from the outside (63). The modern work of art is created by purging itself of the vulgarities and impurities of everyday life (Berman 30); by reducing its contingent and coincidental elements to a geometrical, punctual or serialised form. The modern nuclear family is created by converting the community-based connections between relatives and friends into a single, internally consistent self-reproducing organism. All of these examples require us to think of creativity as an act which brings something new into existence from within a material base that must be purged and disavowed, but which, simultaneously, must also be retained as its point of departure that it never really leaves. \n          Immanence should not be equated with essence, if by essence we mean a substratum of materiality inherent in things; a quality or quiddity to which all things can be reduced. Rather, immanence is the process whereby things appear as they are to others, thereby forming themselves into 'objects' with certain identifiable characteristics. Immanence draws the 'I' and the 'we' into relations of subjectivity to the objects thus produced. Immanence is not in things; it is the thing's condition of objectivity in a material, spatial and temporal sense; its 'becoming object' before it can be 'perceived' by a subject. As Merleau-Ponty has beautifully argued, seeing as a bodily effect necessarily comes before perception as an inner ownership (Merleau-Ponty 3-14). Since immanence always comes from elsewhere, no intensive scrutiny of the object in itself will bring it to light. But since immanence is already inside the object from the moment of its inception, no amount of examination of its contextual conditions—the social, cultural, economic, institutional and authorial conditions under which the object was created—will bring us any closer to it. Rather, immanence can only be 'seen' (if this is the right word) in terms of the objects it creates. \n          We should stop seeking immanence as a characteristic of objects considered in themselves, and rather see it in terms of a virtual field or plane, in which objects appear, positioned in a transversally related way. This field does not exist transcendentally to the objects, like some overarching principle of order, but as a radically exteriorised stratum of 'immaterial materiality' with a specific image-content, capable of linking objects together as a series of creations, all with the stamp of their own originality, individuality and uniqueness, yet all bound together by a common set of image relations (Deleuze 34-35). If, as Foucault argues, modern objects emerge in a \"field of exteriority\"—a complex web of discursive interrelations, with contingent rather than necessary connections to one another (Foucault 45)—then it should be possible to map the connections between these objects in terms of the \"schema of correspondence\" (74) detected in the multiplicities thrown up by the regularities of modern production and consumption. \n          Commodities and Created Objects\n          We can extend the idea of creation to include not only aesthetic acts and their objects, but also the commodity-products of modern industrialisation. Let's begin by plunging straight into the archive, where we might find traces of these small modern miracles. An illustrated advertisement for 'Hudson's Extract of Soap' appeared in the Illustrated Sydney News, on Saturday February 22nd, 1888. The illustration shows a young woman with a washing basket under her arm, standing beside a sign posted to a wall, which reads 'Remarkable Disappearance of all Dirt from Everything by using Hudson's Extract of Soap' (see Figure 1). The woman has her head turned towards the poster, as if reading it. Beneath these words, is another set of words offering a reward: 'Reward !!! Purity, Health, Perfection, Satisfaction. By its regular daily use'. Here we are confronted with a remarkable proposition: soap does not make things clean, rather it makes dirt disappear. Soap purifies things by making their impurities disappear. The claim made applies to 'everything', drawing attention to a desire for a certain state of perfection, exemplified by the pure body, cleansed of dirt and filth. The pure exists in potentia as a perfect state of being, realised by the purgation of impurities. \n           \n          \n            Fig 1: Hudson's Soap. Illustrated Sydney News, on Saturday February 22nd, 1888 \n          Here we might be tempted to trace the motivation of this advertisement to a concern in the nineteenth century for a morally purged, purified body, regulated according to bourgeois values of health, respectability and decorum. As Catherine Gallagher has pointed out, the body in the nineteenth century was at the centre of a sick society requiring \"constant flushing, draining, and excising of various deleterious elements\" (Gallagher 90). But this is only half the story. The advertisement offers a certain image of purity; an image which exceeds the immediate rhetorical force associated with selling a product, one which cannot be simply reduced to its contexts of use.\n          The image of perfection in the Hudson's soap advertisement belongs to a network of images spread across a far-flung field; a network in which we can 'see' perfection as a material immanence embodied in things. In modernity, commodities are created objects par excellence, which, in their very ordinariness, bear with them an immanence, binding consumers together into consumer formations. Each act of consumption is not simply driven by necessity and need, but by a desire for self-transformation, embodied in the commodity itself. Indeed, self-transformation becomes one of the main creative processes in what Marshal Berman has identified as the \"third\" phase of modernity, where, paraphrasing Nietzsche, \"modern mankind found itself in the midst of a great absence and emptiness of values and yet, at the same time, a remarkable abundance of possibilities\" (Berman 21). \n          Commodification shifts human desire away from the thought of the other as a transcendental reality remote from the senses, and onto a future oriented material plane, in which the self is capable of becoming an other in a tangible, specific way (Massumi 35 ff.). By the end of the nineteenth century, commodities had become associated with scenarios of self-transformation embedded in human desire, which then began to shape the needs of society itself. \n          Consumer formations are not autonomous realms; they are transversally located within and across social strata. This is because commodities bear with them an immanence which always exceeds their context of production and consumption, spreading across vast cultural terrains. An individual consumer is thus subject to two forces: the force of production that positions her within the social strata as a member of a class or social grouping, and the force of consumption that draws her away from, or indeed, further into a social positioning. While the consumption of commodities remained bound to ideologies relating to the formation of class in terms of a bourgeois moral order, as it was in Britain, America and Europe throughout the nineteenth century, then the discontinuity between social strata and cultural formation was felt in terms of the possibility of self-transformation by moving up a class. In the nineteenth century, working class families flocked to the new photographic studios to have their portraits taken, emulating the frozen moral rectitude of the ideal bourgeois type, or scrimped and saved to purchase parlour pianos and other such cultural paraphernalia, thereby signalling a certain kind of leisured freedom from the grind of work (Sekula 8). \n          But when the desire for self-transformation starts to outstrip the ideological closure of class; that is, when the 'reality' of commodities starts to overwhelm the social reality of those who make them, then desire itself takes on an autonomy, which can then be attached to multiple images of the other, expressed in imaginary scenarios of escape, freedom, success and hyper-experience. This kind of free-floating desire has now become a major trigger for transformations in consumer formations, linked to visual technologies where images behave like quasi-autonomous beings. The emergence of these images can be traced back at least to the mid-nineteenth century where products of industrialisation were transformed into commodities freely available as spectacles within the public spaces of exhibitions and in mass advertising in the press, for instance in the Great Exhibition of 1851 held at London's Crystal Palace (Richards 28 ff.) Here we see the beginnings of a new kind of object-image dislocated from the utility of the product, with its own exchange value and logic of dispersal. \n          Bataille's notion of symbolic exchange can help explain the logic of dispersal inherent in commodities. For Bataille, capitalism involves both production utility and sumptuary expenditure, where the latter is not simply a calculated version of the former (Bataille 120 ff.) Sumptuary expenditure is a discharge of an excess, and not a drawing in of demand to match the needs of supply. Consumption thus has a certain 'uncontrolled' element embedded in it, which always moves beyond the machinations of market logic. Under these conditions, the commodity image always exceeds production and use, taking on a life of its own, charged with desire. In the late nineteenth century, the convergence of photography and cartes-de-visites released a certain scopophilic desire in the form of postcard pornography, which eventually migrated to the modern forms of advertising and public visual imagery that we see today. According to Suren Lalvani, the \"onset of scopophilia\" in modern society is directly attributable to the convergence of photographic technology and erotic display in the nineteenth century (Lalvani). \n          In modern consumer cultures, desire does not lag behind need, but enters into the cycle of production and consumption from the outside, where it becomes its driving force. In this way, modern consumer cultures transform themselves by ecstasis (literally, by standing outside oneself) when the body becomes virtualised into its other. Here, the desire for self-transformation embodied in the act of consumption intertwines with, and eventually redefines, the social positioning of the subject. Indeed the 'laws' of capital and labour where each person or family group is assigned a place and regime of duties, are constantly undone and redefined by the superfluity of consumption, gradually gathering pace throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. \n          These tremendous changes operating throughout all capitalist consumer cultures for some time, do not occur in a calculated way, as if controlled by the forces of production alone. Rather, they occur through myriad acts of self-transformation, operating transversally, linking consumer to consumer within what I have defined earlier as a field of immanence. Here, the laws of supply and demand are inadequate to predict the logic of this operation; they only describe the effects of consumption after desire has been spent. Or, to put this another way, they misread desire as need, thereby transcribing the primary force of consumption into a secondary component of the production/labour cycle. \n          This error is made by Humphrey McQueen in his recent book The Essence of Capitalism: the origins of our future (2001). In chapter 8, McQueen examines the logic of the consumer market through a critique of the marketeer's own notion of desire, embodied in the \"sovereign consumer\", making rational choices. Here desire is reduced back to a question of calculated demand, situated within the production/consumption cycle. McQueen leaves himself no room to manoeuvre outside this cycle; there is no way to see beyond the capitalist cycle of supply/demand which accelerates across ever-increasing horizons. To avoid this error, desire needs to be seen as immanent to the production/consumption cycle; as produced by it, yet superfluous to its operations. We need therefore to situate ourselves not on the side of production, but in the superfluity of consumption in order to recognise the transformational triggers that characterise modern consumer cultures, and their effects on the social order. \n          In order to understand the creative impulse in modernity today, we need to come to grips with the mystery of consumption, where the thing consumed operates on the consumer in both a material and an immaterial way. This mystification of the commodity was, of course, well noted by Marx:\n            A commodity is . . . a mysterious thing, simply because in it the social character of men's labour appears to them as an objective character stamped upon the product of that labour; because the relation of the producers to the sum total of their own labour is presented to them as a social relation, existing not between themselves, but between the products of their labour. (Marx 43, my emphasis) \n          When commodities take on such a powerful force that their very presence starts to drive and shape the social relations that have given rise to them; that is, when desire replaces need as the shaping force of societies, then we are obliged to redefine the commodity and its relation to the subject. Under these conditions, the mystery of the commodity is no longer something to be dispelled in order to retrieve the real relation between labour and capital, but becomes the means whereby \"men's labour\" is actually shaped and formed as a specific mode of production. \n          Eric Alliez and Michel Feher (1987) point out that in capitalism \"the subjection framework which defines the wage relation has penetrated society to such an extent that we can now speak not only of the formal subsumption of labor by capital but of the actual or 'real' subsumption by capital of society as a whole\" (345). In post-Fordist economic contexts, individuals' relation to capital is no longer based on subjection but incorporation: \"space is subsumed under a time entirely permeated by capital. In so doing, they [neo-Fordist strategies] also instigate a regime in which individuals are less subject to than incorporated by capital\" (346). In societies dominated by the subjection of workers to capital, the commodity's exchange value is linked strongly to the classed position of the worker, consolidating his interests within the shadow of a bourgeois moral order. But where the worker is incorporated into capital, his 'real' social relations go with him, making it difficult to see how they can be separated from the commodities he produces and which he also consumes at leisure: \"If the capitalist relation has colonized all of the geographical and social space, it has no inside into which to integrate things. It has become an unbounded space—in other words, a space coextensive with its own inside and outside. It has become a field of immanence\" (Massumi 18). It therefore makes little sense to initiate critiques of the capital relation by overthrowing the means of subjection. Instead, what is required is a way through the 'incorporation' of the individual into the capitalist system, an appropriation of the means of consumption in order to invent new kinds of selfhood. Or at the very least, to expose the process of self-formation to its own means of consumption. \n          What we need to do, then, is to undertake a description of the various ways in which desire is produced within consumer cultures as a form of self-creation. As we have seen, in modernity, self-creation occurs when human materiality is rendered immaterial through a process purification. Borrowing from Deleuze and Guattari, I have characterised this process in terms of immanence: a force coming from the outside, but which is already inside the material itself. In the necessary absence of any prime mover or deity, pure immanence becomes the primary field in which material is rendered into its various and specific modern forms. Immanence is not a transcendental power operating over things, but that which is the very motor of modernity; its specific way of appearing to itself, and of relating to itself in its various guises and manifestations. Through a careful mapping of the network of commodity images spread through far-flung fields, cutting through specific contexts of production and consumption, we can see creation at work in one of its specific modern forms. Immanence, and the power of creation it makes possible, can be found in all modern things, even soap powder! \n          \n          References\n          \nAlliez, Eric and Michel Feher. \"The Luster of Capital.\" Zone 1(2) 1987: 314-359.\n            Bauman, Zygmunt.

We consider the problem of information glut, the quality of public discourse, the question of privacy and technological alienation. Concerning the basic attitudes, we discuss the aesthetic, the moral and the religious views, considered in the context of the present life-space pervaded and shaped by information technology. The paper concludes with a discussion of the possible consequences of global homogenization and of the cultural ahistoricity that are being created by the massive use of information technology. Among the positive aspects of this new 'global culture of the present' we point out the possible increase of global human solidarity; among the negative ones, we point out the flattening and shrinking of the space of human experience, which this uniform culture of the present imposes.",

    "abstract": "Drawing upon insights from Deibert's (1997) reconstituted medium theory and critical geopolitics literature, this article examines Slovenia'sefforts at crafting an image of itself via the Internet for specific strategic goals such as EU and NATO accession, the promotion of tourism and the attraction of foreign direct investment. Through an examination of both the material and discursive practices undertaken by the Slovenian government, we demonstrate the difficulty inherent in challenging tropes that hegemonic powers disseminate through various media in order to craft the geopolitical world they operate in. Slovenia's websites represent an important form of resistance to hegemonic visions of space, visions that have excluded Slovenia's accession to certain power structures. The government uses the Internet to construct a discourse refuting assertions of unreadiness to accede to these institutions, a form of online lobbying that attempts to redraw the image of Slovenia in the minds of a global public. We conclude this examination not by making grand pronouncements about the efficacy of these efforts, but by demonstrating that these images are part and parcel of the efforts to disassociate Slovenia from the negative connotations of the Balkan moniker.The fact that these efforts incorporate the Internet, when linked to material practices and policies, raises questions about the possibilities of such resistance via new communication technologies.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the gender matrix of time, arguing for cross-disciplinary consideration of political economy, globalization and technology to achieve a detailed understanding of gendered hierarchies of time and the ways in which public/private identifications of social space and time have variously constructed and maintained them. It is argued that women are alienated from their own time, which is identified as most legitimately allocated to the service of others both in the home and at work. The inter-relationship of technologies and gendered identities is explored in relation to public/private divisions and the political-economic and scientific-technological knowledge processes that contribute to upholding them. ICTs reflect these historically established gendered patterns, but international projects such as 'Women on the Net' also demonstrate the capacities of these technologies for disrupting the gender matrix of time through their use by women for women.",

    "abstract": "The paper examines and critiques some of the libertarian rhetoric surrounding the 'virtual community'. In so doing, it argues that cyberlibertarians have misunderstood what community is by placing too much emphasis on a disembodied individual. Although it remains influential, cyberlibertarian rhetoric is a far cry from the everyday practices that are being constructed and reproduced via the Internet. By drawing attention to such practices, the paper attempts to bring to the fore the sociality of cyberspace interactions and redefine the virtual community in line with Maffesoli's concept of 'neo-tribe'. The Internet is thus thought to open up a new space where human 'will to live' is expressed in a social and embodied fashion (Maffesoli 1996).",

    "abstract": "The excessive media attention in and economic hopes placed on the Internet mean that measures of its size and distribution have been undertaken more often with an eye to business plans than to methodological rigour.This paper examines one disinterested source of Internet statistics, the Internet Domain Survey, to provide accurate measures of Internet size and distribution. Methodological issues in utilizing this survey are discussed to ensure the significance of findings is understood and to identify key methodological problems in a new field of research. Two particular problems are identified; the need to define user per computer host ratios and to identify the national origin of computers with international domain names. Statistics are presented from the five Internet Domain Surveys from January 1998 to January 2000 in the following categories: overall size, regional distribution, human development and economic distribution, linguistic distribution and user numbers. The conclusion is reached that even as the Internet is growing in all regions world-wide it remains concentrated in the highly developed nations. Some consideration of the implications of this for wider debates around the Internet is given.",

    "abstract": "The provision of community e-gateways (community-based facilities providing public access to computers and the Internet) has been seen as a way to address the 'digital divide', particularly for people from deprived neighbourhoods. In the UK, policy and practitioner literature has stressed that for these centres to be successful they need to have strong social connections and be able to provide opportunities for interactive learning and content creation. Through a detailed analysis of one community e-gateway, which formed part of a wider study of public access provision, this article analyses the strengths and weaknesses of this advice drawing on broader sociological literature relating to social networks, network mapping and communities of practice. It concludes that greater attention needs to be paid to the significance of weak ties, two-way boundary spanning and the resource requirements of social networks for the policy objectives to be fully achieved.",

    "abstract": "Community informatics provides new ways of approaching old problems of community development and enhancing civic society. Building on a theoretical analysis, this article discusses research in the area of the efforts of community networks in the USA to achieve outcomes in these two areas using the tools of community telecommunications and networking. The analysis matches the theoretical arguments for how community building and civic society are achieved against the practice of community networks trying to implement the new communications technologies. The analysis shows that achieving these goals is difficult for community information networks and that a full understanding of the nature of community information infrastructures could likely be very helpful in this task.",

    "abstract": "A generation ago, there was a major debate about the social and ethical implications of artificial intelligence (AI). Interest in that debate waned from the late 1980s. However, both patterns of public risk perception and new technological developments suggest that it is time to re-open that debate. The important issues about AI arise in connection with the prospect of robotic and digital agent systems taking socially significant decisions autonomously. Now that this is possible, the key concerns are now about which decisions should be and which should not be delegated to machines, issues of regulation in the broad sense covering everything from consumer information through codes of professional ethics for designers to statutory controls, issues of design responsibility and problems of liability.",

    "title": "EXTERNAL AIDS FOR SOCIAL MEMORY",
    "abstract": "Collective or social memories are not just a way for accumulating and preserving but also for sharing and developing knowledge. Indeed, as knowledge is made explicit and elaborated by a community, it enriches the local culture and the current practices, becoming a basis for communication and learning. This paper addresses the concept of 'social memory' in a specific 'community of practice': teachers and students of primary schools. The work is developed within HIPS1 (Hyper Interaction within Physical Space), a three-year (1997-2000) research project funded by the European Commission within the I 3 (I-Cube) Programme. HIPS is a hand-held location-aware tourist guide that delivers information related to the surrounding space mainly reacting to the physical movements of visitors (Benelli et al . 1999). The guide is designed to minimize the boundary between the physical space and the related information through a number of situated and contextual-aware interaction mechanisms. In the paper we present a specific application of HIPS as tool to support the creation of a social memory. First, we illustrate the theoretical framework, the cultural psychology (Vygotsky 1978), which we adopted to design the tool as an external aid for social memory. Afterwards we describe the user study and the design process that resulted in the development of an early prototype. The conclusions are a reflection about the use of new technology to open new learning opportunities for students.",

    "title": "INFORMATION-CENTRED DESIGN: A methodology for designing virtual meeting DESIGN environments",
    "abstract": "Development of single-user computer applications has often been based on user-centred or task-centred design methodologies, with some success. These methodologies are also useful for guiding the development of multi-user CSCW applications whenever the basic characteristics of the users, or the type of tasks for which the system is being designed are identifiable. The effectiveness of these methodologies as a basis for the design of virtual meeting environments for supporting community-based activities, on the other hand, is rather limited. This is mainly due to the fact that for such systems it is not generally possible to identify the user or task requirements, as these vary considerably from one community to another, or even within the same community over a period of time. New methodologies need to be devised, or existing methodologies have to be modified, to direct the development of virtual environments for which the characteristics of the users or their activities are not known in advance. This paper introduces the concept of information-centred design. Information-centred design, though not fully devised yet, focuses on the identification of the type of information, as well as the way it is collected and utilized by the users of a virtual meeting environment. This pool of information, which plays an important role in facilitating interaction and communication between the members of a community, could be defined as their communal memory.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses three issues: the potential trade-offs of democracy and liberty that the Internet may produce, the connection between real life and cyberspace, and the consequences for the conceptual apparatus of political science. It is argued that the Internet and real worlds are entwined, and thus classic political trade-offs remain pertinent. Important normative issues are addressed. It is established that the Internet is a nearly-neutral medium, so it is important how its development and effects are controlled. It is argued that a privately-controlled Internet would have negative implications for citizenship, political democracy and liberty.However, it is shown that existing Internet politics is significantly democratic, and if the 'net was used within a system similar to existing arrangements, i.e. with checks and balances, then one could optimistically foresee enhanced democracy. In this relatively unexplored but rapidly changing area of political life, this paper serves as a simple warning - public good, private bad - and justifies this in terms of the potential trade-offs of political citizenship versus market consumerism.",

The first article briefly presented a neo-Durkheimian understanding of the social fears projected onto AI, before arguing that the common and enduring myth of an AI takeover arising from the autonomous decision-making capability of AI systems, most recently resurrected by Professor Kevin Warwick, is misplaced. That article went on to argue that, nevertheless, some genuine and practical issues in the accountability of AI systems that must be addressed. This second article, drawing further on the neo-Durkheimian theory, sets out a more detailed understanding of what it is for a system to be autonomous enough in its decision making to blur the boundary between tool and agent. The importance of this is that this blurring of categories is often the basis, the first article argued, of social fears.",

He is also Emeritus Professor of the University of Maryland, where he served as Professor of Journalism from 1983 to 1995. Numerous publications have emerged from his long-term research interest in media roles in politics, including The Crisis of Public Communication (with Michael Gurevitch, published in 1995). More recent essays have focused on the implications of new media developments for the organization and study of political communications (e.g. ‘The Third Age of Political Communication’, with Dennis Kavanagh, 1999, and ‘Rethinking the Study of Political Communication’, with Michael Gurevitch, 2000).",

    "title": "The Internet and Democratic Discourse: Exploring The Prospects of Online Deliberative Forums Extending the Public Sphere",
    "abstract": "Three prominent 'camps' have emerged within Internet democracy rhetoric and practice, each drawing upon different models of democracy: communitarian, liberal individualist and deliberative. Much interest has been shown in the former two camps by researchers and policy makers. This paper turns to an examination of the possible realization of the third camp's vision - that the public sphere of rational-critical discourse will be extended through cyberspace. This paper's method is to compare existing online discourse with a set of requirements of the public sphere developed from the work of Jürgen Habermas. Previous research of cyber-interactions reveals a number of factors limiting the expansion of the public sphere online. Toexplore how these limitations may be overcome, the paper examines an online democracy project that explicitly attempts to foster deliberation. It is shown how this initiative has been able to successfully surmount many of the impediments identified in less structured online deliberations, but that it has, along with similar projects, failed to gain a representative sample of the population and is increasingly marginalized by commercial sites, virtual communities of common interest, and liberal individualist political practices. The paper concludes that the expansion of the public sphere through the Internet requires not only developing deliberative spaces but also attracting participation from citizens who have been socialized within a commercialized and individualized culture hostile towards public deliberation.",

    "abstract": "Electronic networking can support strategic re-positioning within organizations seeking to respond effectively to deep shifts in the social, economic and political regimes in which they operate today. Evidence, though, from our large-scale survey of core UK voluntary organizations suggests that voluntary organizations do not always seek to exploit this capability. Instead, our survey indicates that voluntary organizations are exploiting information and communication technologies (ICTs) in conventional ways to enhance administrative and operational efficiency and effectiveness. There is little evidence of more strategic applications supporting reconfiguration of the organization internally, redefinition of relationships across organizational networks or the extension of business scope. Further research based upon in-depth case studies demonstrated that social conditions are active in shaping the uptake and application of information and communication technologies within voluntary organizations. Within volunteer-intensive settings in particular,founding philosophies and the deeply rooted values that accompany these can have a profound effect. Ultimately,the technologically supported transformations, which occur within the organizations that we examine here, emerge from the inter-play between historically institutionalized values, strategic objectives and technological capability.",

    "title": "INFORMATIONAL INTIMACY AND FUTURISTIC FLU: LOVE AND CONFUSION IN THE MATRIX",
    "abstract": "Cyberpunk's influence upon our understanding of the information revolution is indicated by the fact that its seminal novel, Neuromancer (Gibson 1984), is accredited with the coining of the now widespread non-fictional concept of cyberspace. Beyond providing this resonant concept, however,some of the genre's more recent work known as biopunk is shown to provide fresh insights into the cultural experience of a society increasingly transformed, not only by the extent of technological change in a new informational age, but also its unprecedented pace. This paper reviews cyberpunk to demonstrate the vivid ways in which it uses its fictional licence to catalogue and articulate imaginatively a profoundly ambivalent aspect of contemporary culture in the age of information. We find ourselves interacting more and more closely and rapidly with information, yet at the same time, we feel increasingly run down by the effort demanded of such close and rapid interaction: hence the title-phrases, informational intimacy and futuristic flu. Numerous examples are provided of cyberpunk'szeitgeist-capturing qualities in the face of a profound and rapid information-induced paradigm shift. A mismatch is shown to exist between the conceptual categories we have at our disposal and the qualitatively new scenarios created by the latest information technologies. This paper argues, however, that assuming one maintains a healthy sense of its various deliberate ironies, cyberpunk's fictional exaggerations are seen as potentially instructive elements for a society striving to avoid a bout of techno-influenza.",

    "title": "CYBER-UTOPIA AND THE MYTH OF PARADISE: USING JACQUES ELLUL'S WORK ON PROPAGANDA TO ANALYSE INFORMATION SOCIETY RHETORIC",
    "abstract": "Whereas Jacques Ellul's work on the role of myth in propaganda about the technological society has been largely overlooked, it presents an effective means to analyse the ways in which the information society is symbolically constructed. The French thinker'sexamination of mid-twentieth-century propaganda has much relevance in studying current rhetoric about the 'information revolution', 'global information infrastructure' and 'knowledge-based society'. Not only did he prove prophetic in his description of the increasing intensification of technique in various aspects of life, but also his work offers significant insight into the ways the integrally capitalist vision of 'global information society' is being publicized around the world. The promotion of new media on a transnational scale by government, industry and media can be usefully studied within a myth-based framework. Unlike other writers on myth and communication Ellul underlined the religious roots of myth, therefore drawing attention to the ancient origins of contemporary notions. He suggested that ideology in itself was not able to mobilize individuals, but was dependent on the psychological/spiritual force of myth to move people to action. Propagandists use networks of various myths, which operate interactively with each other to reinforce prevailing ideologies. This article uses a set of technological myths identified by Ellul (science, history, nation, work, happiness, youth and the hero) to show how they can be used in developing a framework to analyse and challenge current propaganda about information society. Such applications of the French sociologist's work on myth, propaganda and technological society will encourage the broadening of scholarly activity beyond the strictly positivist confines of dominant social science.",

    "abstract": "This article argues that the new interactive media have a 'vulnerable potential' to enhance public communications and enrich democracy, which can be realized only through appropriate policy support and imaginative institution building. After outlining the main shortcomings of the prevailing political communication system, certain elements of redemptive potential, inherent in distinctive features of the Internet, are identified. The policy implications of this analysis are then drawn for the public-service obligations of mainstream media, to ensure open access to new media platforms, and to create a 'civic commons' in cyberspace.",

    "abstract": "What is it about Academe these days? I can remember the halcyon times between 1965 and 1975 when college students challenged hierarchical values and many professors not only agreed with the theory and practices of the critique, but tried mightily to imagine new democratic ways of doing things. Sit-ins led to new courses, new methods of grading, and experimental infra-colleges that levelled the discourse between students, professors, administrators and various and sundry corporate and governmental visitors to campuses from Honolulu, to Berkeley, to New York City, to Paris, to Tokyo. Being a professor then was an engrossing and exciting experience. Imagination, innovation and optimism about the future were the order of the day. If one visits similar campuses today, there is such a vastly different atmosphere that it not only seems like a different eon, but a different planet. Aside from a few activistic dissidents and longhairs among the students, the vast bulk of them are careerist – at best. Many have one-nanosecond attention spans or are battle fatigued from working full time. Worse yet, there is the faculty, now divided between those who are active researchers (most of which is funded by corporate, foundation or governmental interests and which often have invisible strings attached) and those who are primarily teaching drones (three or four courses a semester with lots of non-tenured adjuncts doing a lion’s share of the classroom instruction).",

    "title": "WEB PAGES, AUTHORS AND AUDIENCES: The meaning of a mouse click",
    "abstract": "One popular framework for analysing web pages has been to think of them as identity performances on the part of the author. This framework opens up possibilities for analysis of the ways in which identity performances are composed. The personal web pages to which this perspective is most immediately applicable, are, however, now only a small proportion of the overall amount of information available on the World Wide Web. It would be possible, by extension, to analyse institutional web pages as performances of the institutional identity. It is the contention of this paper that to do so is to miss out on some important aspects of web page design: namely that the production of a web page involves understandings not only of the audience for the page but also of the capacities of the technology. In addition, web page production has to become a socially meaningful act for the individual web page developer and the institution concerned. It is, therefore, argued that the analysis of web pages can usefully learn from media studies and the sociology of technology in this respect. An interview-based study of the developers of web pages for the service departments of a UK university is described. The ideas of audience which the authors use are far from homogeneous: they include an institutional offline audience for the page, a pre-existing imagined audience, developers themselves as audience, and the technology of the browser as a stand-in audience. The audience and the capacities of the technology are developed in context through the practices of designers.",

    "title": "A New Game In Town: Competitive higher education",
    "abstract": "Research universities in the USA are complex, expensive organizations that perform multiple interrelated tasks and serve numerous constituencies. The value structure that has evolved for these universities is one that creates very high barriers to entry for new players and numerous impediments to rapid change. Consequently, real competitive pressures on universities have been minimal. However, new types of for-profit and non-profit organizations are beginning to provide competition in targeted segments of higher education. The arrival of Internet-mediated distance learning will greatly increase both market penetration by these new organizations and competition between traditional institutions of higher learning. Because this new competition targets only selected activities of the research university, it risks to destabilize their organization and structure. Ways in which this destabilization might occur are analysed and possible responses are discussed.",

    "abstract": "This article analyses the use and production of health information on the Internet. The paper will show that users of health services have also become significant providers of health information and advice. This analysis is based on two studies. The first involved a qualitative study of households that used home computers to find health information on the Internet. The second piece of research involved the examination of home pages that contained accounts of ill health and an e-mailed questionnaire to home page authors. Drawing upon this research the consumption of health information is examined and related to how users make discussions about their health. This is followed by an analysis of the provision of health information on home pages. It is shown that these include web sites that provide simple accounts of an individual illness as well as sites that advocate a particular approach to health or offer services and products. The interweaving of personal experience with advice is considered and linked to debates about the quality of health information on the Internet and the reconfiguration of 'expertise'.",

    "abstract": "Drawing on the work of Raymond Williams, this paper examines avatar culture through the interplay of emergent and residual forces. A dual process is at work in the formation of cultural identities in which the enabling conditions of virtual worlds are understood alongside and in relation to pre-existing off-line phenomenon. Avatar culture confirms structure for participants, especially in relation to gender and sexuality, whilst at the same time providing a reflexive space to break with pre-existing features of social identity. Virtual environments are thus microcosms of a grounded cultural materiality that is simultaneously improvised on and transformed. With regard to the distinctive aspects of avatar culture the paper focuses on issues of narrative, representation, censorship and power relations and their formation within virtual worlds. It discusses how virtual worlds incrementally acquire a peculiar power and meaning in the lives of participants. The paper discusses the flows of social interaction in virtual environments and how intermittence best describes how users participate and withdraw from different encounters. Avatar culture binds people together temporarily and loosely and then frees them up to relocate themselves elsewhere. In this context, virtual environments might be regarded as putting structure and power into movement. The ethnographic approach adopted helps peel back the residue of social structure to reveal a virtual agency with its emerging shells of avatar-derived affiliations, tensions and conflicts.",

    "title": "Change Agency and Women's Learning New Practices in Community Informatics",
    "abstract": "How can community informatics initiatives be sustained? This paper argues that, in the fast moving area of ICT and on the constantly shifting ground of community-sector practice, sustainability depends upon adaptability. We develop the concept of 'learning communities' – as developed by a women's ICT project – to meet the need for democratic, inclusive and on-going innovation in women's organizations and the wider community/voluntary sector. Reflecting on the Women Connect project, we conceptualize 'learning communities' as dialogic and 'playful' spaces within which members can draw creatively on their differences while constructing shared knowledge. This approach, it is argued, can lead towards a new way of conceptualizing knowledge, new approaches to learning, and new practice for community-based and women's organizations in relation to the use of ICT. The paper starts by describing the Women Connect project, and then introduces the idea of learning 'in community'. We analyse issues relating to the use of the term 'community' in relevant discourses, arguing for an approach which emphasizes agency in our use of this term – the 'doing' of community within a context of shared projects, obligations and goals. Weaddress some difficulties involved in working across social differences, while arguing that these differences – which may make the practice of community uncomfortable – can also facilitate their emergence in the new form of 'learning communities'. Drawing on Gloria Anzaldúa's concept of 'the Borderlands', Nira Yuval-Davis's concept of 'transversal politics' and Maria Lugone'sconcept of 'world-travelling', we analyse community-sector processes of innovation and change agency, as they have found expression within Women Connect. We conclude by arguing that the current, outcome-driven, model for funding voluntary sector organizations acts to actively inhibit the development of learning communities – and the sustainable innovatory practice they can produce.",

    "abstract": "In spite of remarkable advances in science and technology, humankind is beset with a number of serious problems. These are not just problems that 'won't go away'; they are problems that are worsening considerably. These problems include the growing gap between rich and poor, between those who have too much and those who have too little, as well as a broad range of environmental issues that may have major consequences but, at the same time, are little understood. This essay explores the idea of 'civic intelligence'. What projects, perspectives, policy and technology might humankind develop that would help us collectively address these problems? This essay discusses six aspects of 'civic intelligence' (orientation, organization, engagement, intelligence, products and projects, and resources) as well as ways to make cultivating our 'civic intelligence' a practical - non-utopian - enterprise.",

    "abstract": "The need for those working in a variety of settings to interact effectively with technical experts has grown dramatically in recent years as computers have become essential to the performance of an increasing broad range of professional work. This article presents a case of this sort of interprofessional interaction, exploring the process and outcomes of collaboration between technical professionals and educators working to bring Internet access to an urban public school district. Drawing on field note and interview data, the case reported here illustrates how differences in institutional routines and professional values can generate differing agendas, contrasting assumptions, and contrasting expectations concerning project products and outcomes among collaborators from different professional worlds. In the case we describe, these differences affected such central matters as the types and usefulness of technical resources to which users had access as well as users' confidence in the technology. The case also illustrates how aspects of this interprofessional conflict were addressed through an organizational change. The kinds of issues that arose in this project are likely to occur in a variety of professional settings; therefore, examination of this case provides insight into a variety of issues and dynamics that should be considered when embarking upon or analyzing any interprofessional collaborative effort, and particularly one that involves technical professionals.",

    "title": "The Victorian Information Society: Surveillance, Bureaucracy, and Public Librarianship in 19th-Century Britain",
    "abstract": "Contrary to the \"retro\" image often awarded them, and despite their continuing enthusiasm and responsibility for the organization of printed materials, librarians are upbeat about the prospects of an information society driven primarily by electronic technologies, but in which libraries can play an important part. Public librarians detect a natural correlation between the historic democratic mission of their institution and the increased accessibility made possible by digitalized sources. The library community's acceptance of the information society idea as a \"given\" social phenomenon supports discourses that play down historical continuities and herald the dawn of a new age. Such discourses ignore or reject historical evidence that points to the existence of past information societies, revolutions, and infrastructures defined, in part, by the operation of indirect surveillance, constituted by the bureaucratic information systems of modernity. Victorian Britain serves as a good example of an early information society, to which public libraries, themselves micro-information societies, contributed significantly. The role played by public librarians in the Victorian information society, illustrated in this article by evidence drawn from the contemporary library press, is seen in their preoccupation with the surveillance and ordering of knowledge; their adoption for library operations of the businesslike, bureaucratic procedures described recently by business historians; and their panoptic tracking of users and their activities.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the category of \"Woman\" within the metastructure of a system of knowledge organization. We trace the subject scheme used to list books about women in a standard bibliographic guide over the first three-quarters of the twentieth century.Building on the feminist critique of subject representation, our analysis documents how the category was continually constructed over time, providing evidence of multiplication, isolation, and confusion in the process. The outcome is a framework that fails to capture the complex nature of knowledge about women and conceals relationships to the larger body of knowledge. The case of this legacy system exemplifies problems associated with representing the complexity and integration of knowledge and provides a basis for considering the potential residual impacts of current information organization and navigation systems.",

    "abstract": "Electronic data interchange (EDI) provides means for interorganizational communication, creates network externalities, requires an advanced information technology (IT) infrastructure, and relies on standards. In the diffusion of such innovations, institutional involvement is imperative. Such institutions contain governmental agencies, national and global standardization organizations, local government, and nonprofit private organizations like industry associations. The last type of organizations we call intermediating institutions. They intermediate or coordinate (\"inscribe\") the activities of a group of would-be adopters. Unfortunately, little is known of how these organizations shape the EDI diffusion trajectory. In this article we examine one specific type of intermediating organizations?industry associations?and how they advanced the EDI diffusion process in the grocery sectors of Hong Kong, Denmark and Finland. We identify six institutional measures, placed into a matrix formed by the mode of involvement (influence vs. regulation) and the type of diffusion force (supply push vs. demand pull), that can be mobilized to further the EDI diffusion. Industry associations were found to be active users of all these measures to varying degrees. Their role was critical especially in knowledge building, knowledge deployment, and standard setting. Furthermore, institutional involvement varied due to policy and cultural contingencies and power dependencies.",

    "title": "The Social Shaping of Technology",
    "abstract": "If you’re reading this journal, you should read this book. Donald MacKenzie and Judith Wajcman do a brilliant job of framing the current intellectual space where sociotechnical issues are being debated. This, their second edition, comes 15 years after the  rst and re ects expanded attention to the roles of information and communication technologies (ICT), feminist theory, and the breadth of research regarding the intersections of technologies and people. The writing is lively, the material is timely, and the conceptual and empirical issues are central to the collective interests of those who read The Information Society. I’m not aware of similar general anthologies on the social shaping of technology (though Bijker’s 1995 book has some overlap). Within the broad community of scholars studying the roles of ICT, Kling’s (1996) anthology, Dutton’s (1999) book, and Coakes, Willis, and Lloyd-Jones’s (2000) edited volume link nicely to the material in this second edition. MacKenzie and Wajcman’s collection reminds me that our work is part of a broader dialogue on the social shaping of technology, one that is being carried across several other research domains. Seeing the literature that I know tied to examples of the social shaping of different technologies provides me an important new perspective on the role, place, and worth of research into ICT. The book’s 30 chapters are grouped into four sections: general issues, technology of production, reproductive technology, and military technology. Beyond the useful collection of articles in the  rst section, I don’t  nd these overlygeneralized groupings to be of much use. However, I found the book’s overview and the summaries at the start of each section to be excellent syntheses of the research issues that frame the social shaping of technology. Two chapters in the  rst section help make clear the emphasis on shaping instead of impact. Thomas Hughes’s chapter on Edison’s efforts to make an electrical distribution system is the  rst of these. Beyond the captivating view of history presented, this excerpt provides insight into Hughes’s theory of technological systems. This theory highlights the relationship between context, components and collections of technologies , the importance of reverse salients, and the social setting in which all this occurs. Hughes’s conceptualization of technological systems is very useful to contemporary scholars of ICT-based networks, some of Hughes’s principles  nd their way into actor–network theory, and we would be wise to revisit this work. The second chapter that helps me best understand the shaping (versus impact) of technology perspective is Ronald Kline’s and Trevor Pinch’s overview of the social construction of technology (SCOT)approach. In this chapter they both outline SCOT and respond to recent criticisms about the meaning of relevant social group and interpretive  exibility. Of the many  ne chapters in the other three sections of the book, four seem most relevant for ICT researchers. Both Paul Ceruzzi’s chapter on inventing personal computing and Linda Abbate’s chapter on packet switching networks provide vivid depictions of the social milieu in which computing takes place. Fleck’s chapter on implementing manufacturing resource planning (MRP) systems predates and also frames most of the  ndings arising from current work on enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementations. Fourth, and for me the most illuminating , is Anne-Jorunn Berg’s dissection of the technology- rst design  aws embodied in the of “house-of-the-future” concept homes. Her analysis illustrates the context of design and showcases how naive models of use can become embedded into large-scale artifacts. Certainly the theories and concepts contained in this book can inform and help shape research into ICT. However, there is very little material included in this edition",

    "abstract": "Market liberalization has been embraced by developing countries around the world since the 1980s, in the hope of achieving economic growth and development through participation in an increasingly interconnected global economy. Developing countries who once feared economic dependency on the industrialized world now fear being left out of the dynamic process of economic globalization . A key question after a decade or more of liberalization experiments is whether the expected bene ts are being realized, and at what cost. The information technology (IT) industry is an especially good industry sector to study this question. It is one of the most global of industry sectors, particularly since the ascendance of the personal computer, whose horizontal industry structure has replaced the vertically integrated structure of the mainframe computer industry (Grove, 1996).While the mainframe industry was more nationally oriented, the personal computer (PC) industry has been organized around a global production network, with particular countries—mostly in East Asia—specializing in activities such as PC assembly and production of components and peripherals (Wong, 1995; Ernst, 1994; Borrus, 1997; Dedrick & Kraemer, 1998). Motivated in part by the success of these countries, newcomers such as China, India, Mexico, and several eastern European states have liberalized their computer sectors in hopes of joining the global production network and gaining access to technology and capital. The emergence of the Internet has created new pressures for liberalization. The Internet represents a global",

    "abstract": "In evaluating government actions, accountability fora depend on public records. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) can−depending on how they are used−positively or negatively affect the availability of records for accountability. Dominant trends in the effect of ICTs on records management are (1) the mixing of \"on the record\" and \"off the record\" communication, (2) the shift of control over information to the individual, (3) the focus on present rather than on historic information, (4) the interlinking of information managed by several organizations, and (5) the integration of procedures into computer systems. These trends indicate that the introduction of ICTs challenges the existing balance between organizational values (e.g., formality and informality, central control and individual autonomy). Electronic records management is therefore about finding an organizational design that balances values to fit the organization's accountability situation.",

    "abstract": "This article critically assesses the policy orientation, social impacts, and linkages of telecommunications in the United States within a government deregulated policy environment and an increasingly globalized economy. Deregulation has been driven by both ideological and technological demands, stemming from several political and economic transformations in the world economy, the collapse of state socialism in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and greater oligopolistic competition among transnational corporations. An expanded infrastructure of new digital information and communications technology (ICT) is the foundation of a worldwide political economic regime of accumulation. ICT increases command and control capabilities of large corporations, together with the mobility and liquidity of capital, making it essential to the restructuring of the world economy, the new international division of labor, and the creation of global \"information city\" networks. At the same time, government deregulation and rapid technological change are associated with a number of spatial, economic, and social dualisms.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to identify factors that have led to the emergence of information activities in the global labor force. An analysis of the predominant theoretical perspectives on the development of the information society indicates that a comparison of the development of the information work force in countries that have experienced industrialization under different socioeconomic systems is needed. Finland and Poland are selected as the representatives of a market economy and a centrally planned economy. The results indicate that the information work forces of Finland and Poland have experienced similar patterns of growth over the time period examined. However, the distribution of the work force across different economic sectors differs by socioeconomic system. It is concluded that factors relating to industrialization have played the primary role in the emergence of the information work force and that this emergence may take multiple paths in developing.",

    "title": "Rough Justice: A Statistical Assessment of ICANN's Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy",
    "abstract": "Long-standing conflict between domain name registrants and trademark holders prompted the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to create a global, mandatory arbitration procedure known as the Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP). The UDRP has been used in 2166 cases involving 3938 domain names as of 1 November 2000. The policy gives the initiator of a complaint, generally a trademark holder, the right to choose which ICANN-accredited dispute resolution service provider (RSP) will handle the case. During the preparation of the UDRP,some feared that complainant selection would lead to \"forum shopping\" that might bias the results. This article performs a statistical assessment of the forum-shopping thesis and finds support for it. There are statistically significant differences in the various RSPs' propensity to take away names from defendants; there are also major differences in the number of cases brought to each RSP. RSPs who take away names have the larger share of cases. The study examines other variables that might explain differences in market share, such as price, the plaintiff's nationality, or the time taken to decide a case. It finds that nationality and time also are correlated with market share. The study concludes that shopping for a favorable outcome is an important factor in the UDRP.",

    "title": "Progress in Communication Sciences, Volume XV: Advances in Telecommunications",
    "abstract": "The latest volume in the Progress in Communication Sciences series is a welcome reminder that telephone technology—the backbone of the contemporary new media infrastructure—deserves far more attention in media research.1 In the introduction, editors Harmeet Sawhney and George Barnett lay out the ambitious goal of creating a sequel to Ithiel Pool’s seminal 1977 collection, The Social Impact of the Telephone, which has been the best work to date on the social uses and cultural context of the telephone. Chapters in the present volume are meant to overcome what the editors argue has been an overemphasis in telecommunications research on telephone regulation and pricing. The editors aim for a balance among macro-scale studies of national and international systems and institutions (such as legal systems, markets or international regimes and treaties), and micro-scale studies of telephone uses and behavior. Several chapters are particularly useful overviews of the research to date. Robert LaRose’s comprehensive and very readable account of research on personal telephone use and the chapter by the late Robert Hopper on studies of telephone conversation should both be required readings in any course on the social aspects of information and communication technologies. Harmeet Sawhney’s chapter is a theoretical discussion of sociotechnical infrastructure as embodied in telephone systems. Aharon Kellerman’s contribution, which is largely an updated synopsis of his book Telecommunications and Geography (Wiley, 1993), introduces the invaluable perspective of human geography to analyzing the spatial reach of telephone systems. This volume raises an interesting question, that is, why telecommunications generally and telephony particularly continue to be relatively neglected objects of social research, especially within the discipline of communication. Put differently, why aren’t we studying and teaching the telephone? The question is particularly puzzling given today’s popular fascination with all aspects of new media, and the inclusion of the term telecommunications in the names of a growing number of communication programs in the United States and abroad. One answer may be that telephone systems, with their uses and cultural signi cance, do not neatly  t the production–consumption framework of most traditional research on media institutions and systems. Indeed, the relatively larger body of work on telephone economics, markets, and regulation (very ably represented here in chapters by Ruby Dholakia, Robin Mansell and Edward Steinmueller, Jorge Schement, and Steven Wildman) focuses mainly on the telephone as a service to be produced and consumed, rather than as a context for complex social interactions or in terms of the meanings attributed to the telephone in everyday life and interpersonal relations. Despite recent claims to the contrary, media research still often conceals a linear model of communication at its core that is not always appropriate for studying social networks. And telecommunications surely resembles the contingent, complex topography of social networks more closely than it does the conventional model of channels piping messages to wide audiences. It is unsurprising, therefore, that a number of leading telecommunications researchers— including George Barnett and James Danowski, who have chapters in the present volume—are specialists in social network analysis. Overall, this volume is an important and wide-ranging addition to the unfortunately small library of social research in telecommunications. It may in fact help us to teach the telephone, and it deserves a wide audience.",

    "title": "The Governance of Cyberspace: Politics, Technology and Global Restructuring",
    "abstract": "This interesting volume is the end result of a small conference held at the University of Teesside in April 1995. It contains a combination of essays using social scienti c and literary analysis to “advance the debate about the governance of cyberspace” (p. xii). The introductory essay by the editor of the volume, Brian Loader, de nes cyberspace as “a computer-generated public domain which has no territorial boundaries or physical attributes and is in perpetual use.” While the current form that cyberspace takes is roughly coterminous with the Internet, it need not be so in the future. The key question is how this thing is to be governed. Loader identi es a number of perspectives on what cyberspace is and how it should be governed. He identi es the cyber-libertarians as an important group who oppose any government intervention in cyberspace. An in uential member of this group is John Perry Barlow, former lyricist for the Grateful Dead and now a rancher in Wyoming. Barlow was one of the founders of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). The editor contrasts cyber-libertarians and other cyberenthusiasts with authors like William Gibson, of the science  ction genre called “cyberpunk,” and political philosophers like Jean Baudrillard who stress the dangers of the illusion of reality created by computer technology. The addition of yet another layer of intermediation augments the already extensive alienation of humans from nature and from each other. The nightmare scenario is a future in which no one interacts face to face anymore but pretends to do so while actually sitting in a room hooked up to fancy equipment. While there is no speci c political program associated with this line of thought, nevertheless its warnings about the dangers of new forms of criminal and antisocial behavior are echoed in essays in this volume on policing crime and regulating hate speech on the Internet by Klaus Lenk, Charles Raab, Dorothy Denning, Puay Tang, and Michael Whine. The  ip side of the coin is the rise of virtual communities and the ability of widely geographically dispersed people to organize social movements at very low cost. The Internet is democratic in one very important respect: It reduces transaction and communications costs for everyone who has access to it. In this respect, it is an important facilitating factor in the current tendency toward economic globalization . The editor discusses the parallels between the ideas of postmodernis t theorists and those of observers and commentators on the growth of networks—parallels that are also explored in essays by David Lyon, Simon Baddeley, and Paul Frisson. Postmodernist theorists like JeanFrancois Lyotard have argued that postmodernism can be characterized as the replacement of “grand narratives” with “little narratives” and with a new stress on subjectivity and the need for multiple voices in public discourse. According to postmodernists , these replacements are desirable given the 20th century’s genocidal experiences resulting from the clash of the grand narratives of fascism, communism, and liberalism. The authors in this volume agree with this point of view generally and argue that the Internet reinforces preexisting tendencies in this direction. I am not a fan of this sort of work, but the chapters that deal with this subject in this volume are short, readable, and generally well done. Another topic explored in this volume is that of democracy and the “digital divide”—growing inequalitie s associated with unequal access to the Internet. Dave Carter deals with this in his essay and illustrates his arguments with a case study of experiments in teledemocracy in the city of Manchester in England. The  nal essay in the volume by Michael Whine focuses on the use of the Internet by right wing and neo-fascist groups. It is a very informative essay containing a number",

    "abstract": "Information technology is often seen by decision makers as a progressive measure for promoting public-sector financial accountability. One of the key assumptions is that electronic access to information increases transparency and thus, automatically, accountability. This linkage is overly simplified. There is potential conflict between the objectives of providing efficient access on the one hand and supporting accountability on the other.In Sub-Saharan Africa, financial functions were among the first to be automated. More recently, information technology is being used to control and decentralize financial systems. The improvement in financial accountability has yet to materialize. Evidence of this includes instances where corruption and thefts of state assets have gone unchecked. Many efforts to strengthen financial controls fail because the fundamental structures needed to underpin them are often overlooked; this includes record keeping.",

In Turkey, efforts to privatize Tu¨rk Telekom and liberalize the telecommunications regime have not yet been successful. At the same time, the Internet has experienced dramatic growth. While the experience of Turkey illustrates that formal liberalization of basic telecommunications services is not a necessary condition for the growth of a dynamic Internet services provision market, the relationship between the Internet service providers and the provider of basic telecommunications services remains a critical one. Tu¨rk Telekom and policymakers have permitted the creation of a de facto liberal market for Internet services, have supported the creation of Internet infrastructure, and have established a rather level playing field for Internet service providers.",

    "abstract": "A computer-mediated group is a complex entity whose members exchange many types of information via multiple means of communication in pursuit of goals specific to their environment. Over time, they coordinate technical features of media with locally enacted use to achieve a viable working arrangement. To explore this complex interaction, a case study is presented of the social networks of interactions and media use among members of a class of computer-supported distance learners. Results show how group structures associated with project teams dominated who communicated with whom, about what, and via which media over the term, and how media came to occupy their own communication niches: Webboard for diffuse class-wide communication; Internet Relay Chat more to named others but still for general communication across the class; and e-mail primarily for intrateam communication. Face-to-face interaction, occurring only during a short on-campus session, appears to have had a catalytic effect on social and emotional exchanges. Results suggest the need to structure exchanges to balance class-wide sharing of ideas with subgroup interactions that facilitate project completion, and to provide media that support these two modes of interaction.",

    "abstract": "Record-keeping practices are a central means by which organizations demonstrate accountability. These practices, though, are socially constructed and owe as much to organizational or professional cultural and ethical norms as to laws or procedural manuals. This article discusses accountability as a social construction situated in a specific spatial, temporal, and social setting; specifically, it details a qualitative study of radiological reading rooms. This research focuses on the preparation of one form of documentary evidence, the radiological report. Major findings include the need to think about accountability in the plural. Multiple accountabilities exist in both record-keeping processes and the records themselves. Sustaining and balancing these accountabilities can be difficult and can lead to compromises. Furthermore, accountabilities are the result of an iterative process between the individual and organizational levels that is required to make accountability robust and make it work.",

This article analyses the impact of liberalization on IT equipment production, diffusion, employment, and foreign trade. There were both benefits and setbacks, depending on the aspect analyzed. Users benefited from greater access to imported equipment, which could eventually contribute to productivity growth in the overall economy.On the negative side, there was a loss of local linkages with internal sources of components, technology, and employment. The article concludes that the future of the Brazilian IT industry does not seem to be in commodity hardware production. Rather, it lies in design- and engineering-intensive applications. Such \"production close to use\" can spur domestic use as well as create business opportunities for domestically owned companies in markets not dominated by foreign multinationals.",

    "abstract": "Using population census data since 1921, this article traces changes in employment and occupational structure in Singapore in the past 80 years. This is a follow-up to an earlier paper by Kuo and Chen (1987) that reported the nascent formation of the information society in Singapore till the 1980s. It also makes an assessment of the role of proactive government policies in directing industrial restructuring and occupational changes in this city-state. It is found that the long-term growing trend in information-related occupations has been in tandem and supportive of industrial changes in Singapore. One more wave of growth of information producers (and certainly, innovators) and information distributors is expected in the next couple of decades. The momentum has started, and competition from regional countries similarly aspiring to be information and knowledge economies will quicken the pace. The government has initiated fundamental changes in the educational system to meet the challenges of the knowledge-based economy. The small city-state has also long adopted an adaptive philosophy to be responsive to the ever-changing environment, either in technology or in regional politics. Based on the trend analysis, it is expected that the emergent information society will graduate into full status when Singapore attains a developed country status in the forthcoming decades.",

    "title": "Singapore's Dilemma: Control versus Autonomy in IT-Led Development",
    "abstract": "A frequently debated question is whether technology molds society or is molded by it. From the  rst perspective, known as a determinist view of technology (Ebersole, 1995), the Internet carries with it certain types of values, organization, and social structure that will inevitably impact society. From the second perspective, known as an instrumental view of technology (see discussion in Feenberg, 1991), technologies such as the Internet are “pure instrumentality” (Feenberg, 1991, p. 5), indifferent to the ends to which they are employed. This is closely connected to the issue of potential political impact of the Internet. A determinist perspective might predict that introduction of the Internet (with its means of decentered communication)would inevitably democratize government. In contrast, an instrumental perspective suggests that state authorities can wield the Internet to their own purposes, even using it to increase centralized control. The most extensive empirical study of computerization and political control was carried out by Danziger, Dutton, Kling, and Kraemer (1982), whose analysis of data from some 500 U.S. cities and counties indicated that computerization tended to reinforce the power and in uence of those already in authority. However, such research has not yet been replicated internationally, nor has similar research been conducted on the impact of introducing the Internet. One important test case for understanding the relationship of information and communication technologies and democratization is Singapore. This city-state stands out internationally in two regards. First, the country’s leaders exert a level of social and political control that is unique among wealthy nations. And second, those same leaders are engaged in one of the most far-reaching attempts to infuse information technology in society and make their",

Our study is informed by Giddens’s recent theoretical developments on globalizing ine uences at the institutional level and their interconnectedness to new trust systems and self-identity at the individual level. We examine how some elements of our case analysis are illuminated by Giddens’s theoretical concepts, and also highlight some potential areas for further theoretical development. In particular, our case suggests that there are ongoing processes of stability as well as ree exivity,andwealsodeveloptheconceptoftrustsystemstosupport interactions with new groups of people. Finally, our analysis notes some limitations of Giddens’s ideas, especially the somewhat homogeneous form of his theory in suggesting the nature of social transformations in current times.

    "abstract": " This commentary attempts to build up a narrative about Latin American cultural studies from a particular point of view which sees the mass media as a fragment within the broad scope proposed by the project of cultural studies. The main focus is to identify the emergence of this field, its position in relation to other academic disciplines, and its objects of study, mainly the reception studies. Although there are features of Latin American cultural studies that are unique to this region, the author concludes that the present situation reveals that Latin American cultural studies is tied to the broad current movement of this field of study.

    "abstract": " The use of e-zines by women writers is a developing medium. Thirty-nine e-zine authors were interviewed by email (structured questions and free discussion) to explore their motivations, opinions and experiences of publishing on-line. The interviews yielded information on a number of themes: communication; construction of identity; the e-zine as a political space. The e-zine authors considered that, despite the prejudices that exist on the web, they were making a difference by forming networks of likeminded individuals to discuss and evaluate personal and political issues. It also became clear from the interviews that the Internet neither marginalizes nor liberates traditionally under-represented groups, such as women, but is an accurate reflection of society and the outside world.

    "abstract": " The football (soccer) game between Argentina and England during the France '98 World Cup is analysed as a form of media event in which the sports encounter is the source of and high-profile focus for the media's mobilization of narratives of the nation, and reaffirmation of popular mythologies of the national. The legacy of previous Argentina-England encounters is discussed in the light of the persistence of foundation myths concerning the style and impact of the respective national versions of soccer, and the contemporary media's coverage of those myths. The media responses, primarily in press and television, to the 1998 encounter are reviewed and compared in both the Argentinian and the English settings. This comparative analysis is situated, in conclusion, within analytical debates concerning the geo-political nature of persisting sporting stereotypes, and methodological issues concerning the relationship between contextual historical analysis and textual interpretation.

    "abstract": " Telling stories and/or anecdotes is a normal part of everyday life and communication in Ghana. Consequently, using anecdotes narrated by participants in research on people's attitude towards the environment and the role of the media in encouraging environmental awareness, this article argues that anecdotes can be used as epistemological tools which can inform ways of knowing and doing communication research in Ghana. In particular, it is noted that telling stories or anecdotes has important implications for those telling them, other participants in the discussion, in the case of focus groups, and also the communication researcher. The ultimate value lies in the fact that through documenting and analysing anecdotes, the accumulated experiences of people can serve as evidence that can inform and positively influence policy-makers. In the context of media studies, it will also enrich the literature on the relationship between media, public opinion and environmental issues. ",

    "abstract": " This article addresses the depiction of regional and local identity in terms of France and Europe, in the March 1999 weekday evening news transmissions of FR3 Aquitaine and M6 Bordeaux in Aquitaine, France. It begins with a discussion of current debates surrounding different forms of territorial identity. This is followed by an overview of televisual policy at a national and regional level. The ensuing analysis of the March 1999 programmes demonstrates that, despite the different aims, agendas, target audience and ownership of the two Aquitaine-based channels, the dominant form of regionalism is based upon a sense of opposition to unsympathetic and overly centralized national and European policy. This `oppositional regionalism', stronger in the state-owned FR3 Aquitaine regional news than in the privately owned M6 Bordeaux local bulletins, supersedes even `neo-regionalism', which is based upon a sense of a shared economic future.

I argue that, for the most part, radio does not offer a diverse range of images of disability and that too many programmes continue to treat the issue in highly partial terms, using an outmoded lexicon of disablist images and language. Areas of contention include: characterization and genre range in fictional programming; language and authority in fact-based shows; and structure, agency and employment in the industry more generally. Crucially, though, issues of (o)mission were just as important as those of (co)mission, where disability in radio is less a blot and more of a creater on the landscape of radio broadcasting. ",

    "abstract": " The research literature indicates five recurrent frames in news reporting: conflict, human interest, economic consequences, morality and responsibility. Our central research question is: how does news reporting on asylum seekers in four Dutch regional newspapers reflect these frames? The latter are published in places where the inhabitants' reactions to the establishing of an asylum seekers' centre in their neighbourhoods varied from positive to negative. We expect this difference in attitude to be reflected in the reporting. On the one hand we assume that wherever people adopt a more negative attitude, the regional media will emphasize the conflict and the economic consequences. On the other hand we suspect that a positive attitude on behalf of the inhabitants will lead to a more human and moralistic accent in the reporting. Notwithstanding some differences, the human interest frame is most strongly evident in all the newspapers, with the attitude of the population making very little difference. ",

In particular, the analysis will concentrate on the policy in this regard of Flemish public service television. Our hypothesis is that the (cultural elite within) Flemish PSB - and particularly television - tried for a long time to contribute to the recognition and development of Flemish identity and culture by offering a uniform Felmish culture. An analysis of Flemish public television between 1953 and 1960 is used to illustrate this. ",

    "abstract": " For decades television policy makers around the world have recognized the influence television exerts on its audience, particularly youth. In response, nations have devised broadcast policies to attempt to control the medium. Each nation has carefully designed domestic children's television policies by assessing and balancing fundamental ideological, political and economic factors. As television evolves into an integrated global medium, regional and international declarations and resolutions are being proposed. The author explores whether these proposed universal guidelines represent a convergence of domestic children's television policies or merely normative strategies. Children's television policies in Australia, Canada and the United States are compared to test this convergence hypothesis. These policies are then plotted on a matrix that represents regulatory evolution through time and across political and economic lines. This matrix illustrates graphically the trends in children's television policies as well as areas of convergence and divergence among these nations. ",

    "title": "The reform of public service broadcasting in Italy",
    "abstract": " This article provides an overview to a series of reforms undertaken at RAI (Radiotelevisione Italiana), the Italian public service broadcasting company, since July 1993. The reform process began as a direct result of the collapse of the Christian Democrat party and its coalition partners after 45 years of continuous government and was initiated by the centre-left `Technocrat' government led by the former governor of the Bank of Italy, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi (April 1993 to May 1994); it was also continued by the centre-right Berlusconi government (May 1994 to December 1994), by the centre-left Dini government (January 1995 to April 1996) and the centre-left Prodi government (April 1996 to October 1998). The research focuses on the impact of the reform process on the functioning of public service broadcasting in Italy. It identifies four areas of RAI's operations which merit special attention: the system of political occupation, the so-called lottizzazione; the internal network system; the devolution of Raitre (RAI's third channel); and the RAI and Fininvest-Mediaset duopoly. The final section assesses the potential impact of the 1997 Broadcasting Act, which spells a further period of reform for RAI. ",

    "abstract": " In this article we describe and analyze the emerging audio piracy (MP3) subculture on the Internet. We present the first sociological analysis of this system - a `virtual community' that is revolutionizing the production of popular music. We seek to explain not only the internal social structure of the MP3 community, but also strive to understand how the entire global network of musical distribution and production may be affected by its activity. Particular attention is paid to the role structure that operates within the audio piracy subculture, issues of status and power, the division of labor, as well as questions of social conflict and resolution. The conclusion offers some speculations concerning the impact of MP3 technology on the trajectory of popular music. ",

    "title": "`Taking our personal lives seriously': intimacy, continuity and memory in the television drama serial",
    "abstract": " This article argues against the generally agreed assumption that the demise of the single play heralded the decline in the standards of television drama generally. In contrast, it suggests that the rise of the television serial actually indicates the coming of age of TV drama. Unlike the `teleplay' that originally arose out of a strong theatrical tradition, the serial or `mini-series' better utilizes the generic aesthetics of television and the fundamental dynamics of its audience's viewing habits. In particular, it will demonstrate how the episodic nature of the drama serial successfully mimics and harnesses the many complex, multi-layered levels of both the series and soap opera, while retaining and redefining the finite narrative arch of the single play. This makes the serial a particularly suitable form for the portrayal of large historical narratives, especially those that, by necessity, cover a large area both in terms of space and time. Paying close attention to serials such as Roots (1977), Holocaust (1978) and Heimat (1984), the article suggests that the serial form has become an ideal vehicle through which the intimate dynamics of Alltagsgeschichte (`the history of the everyday') can be dramatized and gradually developed. The article concludes that, with its ability to portray and investigate questions of power and politics on both a macro/social and micro/personal level, the television drama serial offers a complex generic form which can now compete successfully with the comparatively restricted and single text dynamics of both the theatre and cinema.

    "abstract": " This article investigates the process by which media audiences become media publics in an analysis of Franklin D. Roosevelt's (FDR) fireside chats. Data for this analysis includes 380 randomly selected letters written in reaction to the first ten chats delivered by FDR during his first term of office. I show that FDR borrowed the `for-anyone-as-someone' structure of broadcasting to address listeners as particular individuals and as members of a mass public. In response, listeners adopted this structure to speak for themselves and for a mass public. In this manner, listeners associated themselves with a larger collectivity, but on the basis of collective rather than personal feelings. These feelings inspired bouts of sociability - serial conversations with family, friends, neighbors, and strangers - that look very much like an instance of collective reflexivity. Thus I conclude that the mass public which formed around FDR's fireside chats represents an instance in which a media audience transformed itself into a media public. ",

    "abstract": " One of the most important and visible elements of South Africa's transition to democracy has been the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). Without mass media - particularly broadcast media - the TRC's much-heralded process of providing a public platform for victims of gross violations of human rights and forging a new national history would have been severely limited. This article teases out the relationship between mass media and the TRC, focusing primarily but not exclusively on broadcast media. It draws on two analytical frameworks from the field of media studies: Dayan and Katz's Media Events (1992) and Hayman and Tomaselli's `Broadcasting Technology as an Ideological Terrain' (1987). Particular attention is paid to the TRC's institutional hearings on the media. These explorations help us to better conceptualize how and why mass media have played such a unique and crucial role in South Africa, both under apartheid and throughout the TRC process. ",

    "abstract": "This article explores how, in an era of increased globalization with respect to investment, trade and `flows' of certain goods and services, nation-states and cultural factors still play an important, if somewhat changing, role in relation to the development of content for new multimedia platforms. This article critically engages with the `global march of technology' thesis as it applies to the field of multimedia `content' applications. We define this multimedia applications field as both an emerging new media industry and a new cultural form which (like the mature media) offers a potential public space for the negotiation of cultural values and forms of identity. We are mainly concerned with the application of multimedia technologies for the production of cultural products aimed at final users in the home and the implications of current globalization trends for diversity of content and local cultures. The article also addresses aspects of national and EU public policies related to the support of the digital `content' industry. To explore these concerns, this article draws upon a detailed case study conducted over a period of two years in the Irish branch of a multinational software company. One team in this branch was involved in the localization of different forms of on-line information developed for the American market but reedited for different European markets.",

    "abstract": " Drawing on a study of stories written and told by 10- to 12-year-old children, this article discusses the meaning of `imaginative response', suggesting several senses in which imagination may be engaged by a stimulus. Based on illustrations from the data of the study, it goes on to examine, in the light of previous relevant media research, ways in which television and videos may be considered either to stimulate or to stifle the imaginative processes and products of story-making. Possible reasons are discussed for the study having found little evidence that children transform ideas taken from television and videos when composing stories; it is suggested that the nature of the image on the screen is equivalent neither to actual experience nor to the visualized image, and may play a different role in the creative process. The article concludes by positing the notion that the ubiquity and ease of access to television and videos perhaps robs today's children of the need to pursue their own thoughts and devise their own occupations, distracting them from inner processes and constantly demanding responses to external agendas, and suggests that this may have implications for the development of imaginative capacity.

    "abstract": " David Morley has argued that the `preferred reading' (encoding/decoding) model developed by Stuart Hall at the beginning of the 1970s, while needing amendment in various respects, still offers a promising alternative to a conception of media texts as equally open to any kinds of interpretation. In this article, I accept Morley's challenge to develop further the preferred reading model with a case study in which 55 people interpret two editorials on alcohol policy. I approach the reception from the viewpoint of identity construction and propose that the preferred reading can be understood as a positioning of the audience in terms of the categories and story lines.

    "abstract": " In the light of increasing concern today about the uncertain future of British television, this article investigates the effectiveness of the public inquiry as a means of broadcasting reform. In particular, it focuses on the 1977 Annan Committee on the Future of Broadcasting and assesses the extent to which the committee was a victory for those who wished to open up broadcasting structures. Pressure for a full-scale review of British broadcasting had been building up since the late 1960s and the case for broadcasting democratization was, by 1974, clearly identified with the left. The article examines both the contributions made by those on the left of the Labour Party to the committee together with the motivations of the Labour government in agreeing to an inquiry, and suggests that the final report was a model example of a compromise between different visions of broadcasting.

In the early 1990s, the approaches in the two older companies, BBC and Radio Denmark, were diametrically opposite. In the independent/commercial companies, the approaches vary across the continuum between the two poles characterizing Radio Denmark and the BBC. ",

    "abstract": " This article is concerned with how ethnic harmony, national identity and political ideology are delivered, then disrupted by advertising, consumption and a globalizing world. Working with a sample of over 250 television commercials culled from the (then) three commercial networks in Malaysia in 1997, I show how ads are used by government as an intentional tool to manage the multiethnic, stratified social relations that comprise Malaysian society. This, in turn, produces three dilemmas. (1) potentially greater racial segmentation where the government was seeking to eliminate it entirely; (2) in part, because the nation is being united under the traditions and beliefs of only one (the dominant) ethnic group; (3) an attempt to repudiate the very exo-cultural system which is serving to remediate these perceived dysfunctions. In a concluding section the author introduces the concept of `semiotic literacy' to argue that ideological domination by the Malaysian government is possible given the relatively low level of symbolic fluency held by the consumers of television advertising. However, such control will be increasingly difficult to maintain as the audience becomes more symbolically fluent, in part because of the increasing number of signs entering the context from an increasing number of external sources.

While citizens' efforts to reform Korean broadcasting are still in their infancy, we can identify dynamic developments of, and future potential for, media reforms. This article examines the broadcasting audience movements in Korea for the past two decades by addressing a nation-wide campaign for a television reception fee boycott in the 1980s, and a collective boycott of television watching and institutional reform campaigns in the 1990s. Through the exploration of the background, the characteristics and the influence of these audience campaigns, this essay attempts to show that notwithstanding political constraints and business filters, television audiences in Korea have endeavoured to produce an open, audience-friendly and publicly accountable broadcasting system.

    "abstract": " Newspapers, like all forms of communication, play an unusually important rôle in Canadian society. Correspondingly, newspaper journalism is a respected occupation. This, taken together with the commitment to equal opportunities embodied in the country's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, might suggest that women face fewer barriers to advancement in Canadian newspapers than elsewhere. Drawing on interviews with women working for newspapers in Greater Toronto and in Montréal, and discussions with academic observers, the article suggests that, until the early 1990s, this optimism about an evolutionary movement into positions of real organizational power was reasonably well-founded. It goes on to argue, however, that the rapid change in the commercial environment brought about by the launch of the National Post in 1998 illustrates how quickly attitudinal and cultural change can be stalled, or even reversed, by changes in management priorities triggered by a threat to profits.

This article discusses one live event - the total solar eclipse in August 1999 - for which this `complex connectivity' at the heart of the event was to prove deeply problematic. In the case of the eclipse, what was at stake was not a set of different but related occurrences but rather the same occurrence - the singular and liminal moment of totality - as it occurred and re-occurred in different places. Caught up in a set of contradictory imperatives - to produce the moment, to deliver to the viewer a sense of `being there' but also to deliver the everywhere of the occasion - television mislaid the event.

So far, however, media researchers have done little to investigate the motives and experiences of those who lend their lives to such programmes.

This article presents evidence from a study of participants in Reisesjekken, a Norwegian dating game modelled upon the British ITV programme Blind Date. The analysis is based on interviews with 40 participants and five producers. The main questions are: Why do people want to participate in a television dating game? What are the main sources of conflict between participants and production staff? And, what do the participants get out of it in the long run? ",

    "abstract": " This article analyzes the role of television in rural life, and the influence it has had on various social, economic and political processes that have been revolutionizing the landscape of village India in recent years. Data from ethnographic fieldwork in two remote villages in the mountains of Western Maharashtra (Danawli and Raj Puri) are presented in the context of development and social change. In particular, the article establishes the framework and rationale for an ethnographic approach to the research. It discusses the unique characteristics of television that make it an important agent of cultural change. Furthermore, the article analyzes various social processes that include consumerism, urban modeling, restructuring of human relationships, linguistic hegemony, migration and the emergence of an information underclass. Some villagers see these processes as positive, yet others view them as negative developments. The article concludes with a discussion of social change at both the structural as well as psychological levels and argues that the village audience is an active and vibrant participant in the use of media, which has ramifications for `development' both at the village level and beyond.

    "abstract": " Too often study of communicative and cultural processes makes `gratuitous assumptions' about media and collective identities like national identity. This article is a critical engagement with Michael Billig's notion of `banal nationalism', a rare analysis of everyday media rhetoric and nationalism. It does this through a survey of daily newspapers sold in Scotland. Newspapers are plotted according to an index of semantic assumptions they make about where the spatial centre of national communication lies. The newspapers surveyed cluster into three broad national types, ranging from an indigenous Scottish press, Scottish editions of English-based papers, `tabloid interlopers' and the English-based broadsheets. The article argues that Billig's emphasis on the `big state' nationalism of the USA and the UK restricts the analytical scope of `banal nationalism' when studying newspaper rhetoric in a `stateless nation' like Scotland.

    "abstract": " This article examines the theories of the press that circulated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, relating them to their economic, political and intellectual contexts. It argues that elite discussions of the press often stood in for discussions of the changing relationship between the elite and popular classes. In the mid-19th century, and ideal of the press as an `educational' agency predominated; the press should involve readers in a public discussion that contributed to self-government. As the electorate and reading public expanded, this ideal began to decline and give way to an ideal of the press as `representing' the people. In this formulation, the ordinary reader was not credited with rational thinking, and instead of involving readers in a public discussion, this theory proposed that newspapers should speak for the readers.

    "abstract": " A substantial share of the photographs that are used in advertisements, product packaging, corporate marketing and website design are supplied by the stock photography business. Nevertheless, this global, billion-dollar industry, dominated by a handful of transnational corporations, remains largely invisible to consumers and has been almost totally neglected by cultural analysts. This article attempts to redress that neglect and lift the veil on a powerful force in contemporary visual culture. First it places stock photography in social and historical context, examining the consolidation of the business in its modern form in the 1970s and 1980s and setting out its core practices and discourses in the broader context of commercial culture and advertising. Next it employs the key industry terms `success' and `meaning' to offer an integrated analysis of stock photography both as a system of cultural production and as a mode of representation. ",

    "abstract": " The article argues that the private media in Africa are contributing in significant ways towards democratic governance and accountability on the part of state officials. However, in spite of the remarkable progress made in media proliferation and diversity over the last few years, there still remain troubling concerns. Political space for the unfettered operation of the media continues to be non-existent in many so-called `democratic' countries. It is also contended that the private media themselves cannot be exculpated from the damage that is being done to the fourth estate of the realm as a legitimate and formidable force in the efforts towards democratic progress and consolidation. There has to be some introspection and change in the private media's patterns of operation, if they are not to self-destruct. An informed and responsible citizenry is important for the operation of free media, thereby making it imperative that the media incorporate the hitherto peripheralized elements of society into the democratic discourse.

    "abstract": " The national unity crisis in Canada deepened during the 1990s; it became increasingly likely that the French-speaking province of Quebec might separate from the rest of the country. This article examines how press coverage of Céline Dion, the popular francophone singer from Quebec, has intersected with the national unity debate. After providing some background on the debate and Dion, the article explores the linkages between them in Canada's English-language press. The analysis suggests the existence of a pro-unity frame in coverage of Dion. It also identifies how news stories about Dion have been shaped by binary oppositions, quoting practices and other journalistic techniques. The article concludes by noting some similarities and differences between coverage of political events in the national unity debate (such as referendums or constitutional accords) and coverage of Dion which is associated with the debate.

    "abstract": " Deregulation and ownership concentration have been accompanied by increased rationalization of programming strategies in commercial music radio in many industrial nations. However, understanding of the impact of these trends on music programming is incomplete because little research has examined music radio's `culture of production'. This article addresses this deficit by exploring the knowledge frameworks that radio programmers draw on to transform records into music programming. Interviews with music programmers working at radio stations in the USA reveal fundamental variation in how culture production is managed in this industry. I account for this variation by distinguishing four programming philosophies that guide and legitimate programmers' choice of programming strategies. Finally, I describe the integration of these philosophies into programmers' knowledge frameworks by considering their impact on music programming, and the structural factors that accommodate and constrain each philosophy.

    "abstract": " This article looks at arguments framing civil society debates and questions the usefulness of civil society models in understanding how media policy is made and implemented in China. The key argument is that viewing the state-society relationship in China through a Western optic obviates the distinctive differences between the autonomous civil society of liberal democracies and Chinese social relations. This does not mean that civil society is a redundant concept. It can be usefully applied to describe economically driven political and social change in China. However, its capacity to explain how cultural and media policy is formulated is limited. ",

Hundreds of experimental works are being created as artists struggle to understand the computer as a new medium for art, which in turn is fueling the establishment of dozens of ’new media’ departments, institutes, festivals, museums and web sites to serve and showcase the work. As I navigate this wildly diverse, sometimes confusing landscape of computer-based art, I find myself searching for works that truly take advantage of the capabilities that, from my experience as a designer and programmer of interactive virtual characters, I know the computer can offer.",

    "abstract": " The intellectual history suggests that desire for intelligence augmentation underlies the idea of virtual reality (VR). The assumption underlying this teleological thrust towards intelligence augmentation is that intellectual advances are made by improving and facilitating human thinking and problem solving. This was thought possible only if computers were integrated effectively into the whole ecology of thought by virtue of a human-computer partnership, or symbiosis. VR media are seen as augmenting intelligence by more direct, intuitive channelling of information through the senses to establish a more direct interface, or experience with knowledge. The history of the idea of virtuality shows that policy, personnel choice and placement, and research and development aimed to implement this vision for VR. Related work led to the internet as focus was placed on networked, cooperative interaction - computers and people working together to augment human intelligence. ",

As engineers and scientists explore how to digitise the world around us, the classical constraints of design, ruled so long by the physics of space, time, and material, are starting to crumble. Documents can be laid down in one place, automatically cloned, and a copy picked up in another. Meetings scheduled for 9am to l0am can be joined by latecomers at noon, who then participate in a captured form of the event and are ’edited into’ the past. People on the West coast of the USA can participate, in a telepresent way, with their colleagues on the East coast, and hold a meeting against a virtual backdrop, such as a production line in their Taiwanese factory. Walls can seem to dematerialise, remote objects can be touched virtually, reshaped, passed through one another. Technology is moving inexorably so that being in",

    "abstract": " This study presents a history of videotex and online services as seen through predictions and forecasts made at different stages. It presents the primarily optimistic expectations for what was then a 'new technology' created by merging the television, telephone, and the computer. In the USA, videotex is often perceived as a major market failure that should have been easy to foresee. However, success was constrained by the centralised-services architecture and applications of the time, and by undue belief in the revolutionary potential of the technology. A decentralised approach, both in technology and in applications, enabled the success of the World Wide Web - and proved many early predictors to be prescient about applications that would be popular on an interactive network.

Nardi and O’Day call for more ’interaction’ through flourishing information ecologies and a more holistic approach to technology. This study focuses on how this is often embodied in highly packed metaphors such as ’tools’, ’texts’ and ’systems’. The use of tools for example implies the notion of being ’useful’ and ’in control’ and like all metaphors they channel and limit our thinking. To avoid degenerating into abstractions they focus on a number of case studies to illustrate their ideas and arguments",

Cosmodolphins is a recent addition to this emerging field, a field that takes on increasing significance each time we hear of a new cloning technique, a new computer device, a new weapons system. Feminists have much to say about such scientific and technological developments and the gendered logics that underpin them. In Cosmodolphins Bryld and Lykke use the cyborg as a metaphor to think with, more specifically as a matrix in which to imagine and chart a set of critical relations between the unlikely bedfellows of the dolphin, the horoscope and the spaceship. Their book is a detailed study of how discourses of the sacred and the technological overlap and intersect within and across these three tropes. They use these ’extraterrestrial’ categories, these positions of estrangement, to expose a fundamental ambivalence within",

    "abstract": "possible to see how the various perspectives and experiences, in this book, connect up. Initially we have a Giddens-inspired account of the phenomenology of modernity, in which Moores wants to emphasise the importance of mediated experience (especially broadcasting). Then, from media studies, we have an account of how broadcasting established itself as a domestic medium, constructing a national popular culture; which is subject to some re-negotiation within the complex, multi-media dynamics of contemporary households. Alongside and supporting this, global and multi-cultural patterns of cultural influence are used as resources for the construction of new forms of identity, finding their expression, in part, in new forms of media consumption. Moores’ final point is that all this has profound consequences for the particularities of social interaction, where the convergence of old and new media is transforming everyday life.",

    "abstract": "From rather tentative beginnings seven years ago, the World Wide Web has assumed enormous importance to journalism: as an Australian journalism school faculty member observed recently, being online is now seen almost everywhere as ’sexy and modern’.’ The World Wide Web in particular has become an everyday part of most newsrooms.’ Moreover, five years ago no more than 8 per cent of people in the USA went online once a week or more for news: by comparison, in 2000 over 56 per cent of American internet users said they logged on to ’read news’.3 Not only in Australia and the US but also in the UK, these factors, and relatively high salary levels, have made the web an attractive place to practise journalism.’ While some fall-out resulted from the dot-com crisis in 2000, the numbers of online journalists remained large, and new web ventures continued to offer employment opportunities for more.5 What were previously exclusively singleor bimedia organisations have broadened their activities to include text, audio, video, graphics and design elements in multi-functional information, entertainment and/or retail sites which hope to win over not just audiences but advertisers from more traditional media outlets.~ 6",

For this reason this research took us inside the homes of nine families (with and without children and teenagers), in a natural, everyday-life context of uses of communication technologies. We looked closely at the cumulating effects of household technologies in a contextualist-interactionist theoretical perspective and concentrated on analysing the synergy between three families of technology: telephone, television and the computer-internet.

    "abstract": "In July 1896, the day after seeing the Lumi6res’ cinematograph for the first time, the Russian writer Maxim Gorky tried to articulate a disquiet stirred in him by the moving images he had seen projected on the screen. A normal street scene of daily life in Paris had been captured by a camera, and presented at Aumont’s Cafe at the Nizhni-Novgorod fair. In an allusion to the mythic underworld, he dubbed these images ’the Kingdom of Shadows’, a place populated by flitting, ashen and noiseless Parisians:",

    "abstract": " Debate over the ethics of MP3 file sharing has overshadowed intellectual inquiry into the reasons why music has been such a sought after commodity for downloading. This paper proposes a Deleuze/Guattarian inspired conceptualisation of affect to ascertain the drive behind the phenomenon we call the 'MP3 revolution'. The claim is that music has been responsible for the internet's transition from static to dynamic medium as the affective allure of the MP3 codec solicits territorial production through reception. Ritual, rhythms and refrains order our way through the chaos of the web and this paper proposes that MP3 offers temporal potentialities and existential 'becoming' that provide new affective dimensions to the previously static nature of the web. With such a proliferation of writing on MP3 and peer-to-peer networking, this article is concerned with why music is worth downloading and finally, how capital has sought to commodify this territory that MP3 users created.

    "abstract": "The work Exchange Fields was commissioned by the exhibition Vision Ruhr, held in Dortmund, Germany, in 2000. The work was a collaboration between the Dutch dancer/choreographer Regina Van Berkel, myself and the programmer Gideon May. The central question dealt with the generation of a new kind of interface how might an embodied experience of interface be layered into the content of an interactive media/dance comprised of video, text, a sculptural installation and music? Exchange Fields sought to develop a novel interface strategy by eliciting culturally determined environmental ’behaviour in relation to objects’ as a grammar of gesture that could be used as input to the reacting system. The physical interface system functioned as an embodied intuition. The work sought to tap into prelinguistic environmental knowledge related to the use of particular varieties of objects. A series of furniture/sculptures were developed. Each furniture/sculpture was designed with a unique implied ’suggestion’ of how the body might be positioned in relation to that",

Guided by actor-network theory and diffusion of innovation theory, this paper concludes that innovations are influenced by needs and effects of the age, the power of the printed word and the evolutionary process of diffusion are inevitable aspects of adoption and diffusion of new technologies, and 'lead users' and dominant technological designs shape media technologies.

    "abstract": "With media convergence, new forms of media use have emerged: userscan enhance a media encounter by controlling the streams of informationand have the ability to interact with not only the media itself, but also thecontent provider and other users. Technical developments have alsoresulted in affordable off-the-shelf production equipment. Today it isprobably easier to set up a worldwide accessible radio station on theinternet than it is to get employment in a traditional radio station. Hencecontrol over media production is diverging and new, sometimes lesstraditional, content providers are entering the media industries. However,research on media convergence has mostly addressed stationary settings.But with the growing phenomenon of mobile information technology(IT), it is becoming increasingly important to consider mobility as adimension of media convergence and mobile media as a new researchfield.",

    "abstract": " On the 12 December 2000, the British government presented its Communications White Paper A New Future for Communications. This document, which sets out the government's plans for a communications act, was jointly produced by the Departments of Trade and Industry (DTI) and Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and was published after the protracted period of consultation which followed the 1998 Green Paper entitled Regulating Communications: Approaching Convergence in the Information Age. Within the White Paper, the government envisaged that its recommendations should ensure that the UK would become home to the most dynamic and competitive marketplace in the world. Simultaneously, it suggested that these industrial objectives could be reconciled with social goals such as ensuring citizens and consumer rights to a universal access of diverse, high quality services and materials.1 ",

    "abstract": "The internet is often portrayed somewhat paradoxically as both integral to the development of contemporary society and yet out of direct human control. A bio-evolutionary element frequently accompanies such techno-determinist rhetoric: the social transformation associated with the internet is a natural process and a force of human progress. In this autonomous-evolutionary understanding, debate about the role of the internet in society is largely irrelevant. Governments, industries, organisations, and citizens are simply advised to connect up to and keep up with the rapidly changing techno-sphere. Failing to adopt and adapt to the internet’s evolution will mean falling behind, or being left completely out of, the unfolding information society. Internet research and academic commentary sometimes resembles this techno-determinist rhetoric. Cyberspace is believed to bring about such radical changes to social relations that any previously useful concepts and under-standings are rendered obsolete. New tools of analysis and ways of thinking are needed. These will be revealed, so the argument goes, by the phenomena itself, rather than by way of the rational-critical processes of social investigation developed from investigations of offline life.

Furthermore, Traces does not consist of a 'world' which is 'navigated'; instead, the movement of the user through the space leaves volumetric and spatial-acoustic residues of user movement that slowly decay. This project was motivated by a desire to explore and critique four central issues in contemporary human-computer interface (HCI): (a) embodied interaction with computational systems; (b) rapid and transparent learning of interfaces by untrained users (the autopedagogic interface); (c) immersive bodily interaction with software agents, (d) extension and elaboration of the general conception of 'interactivity' itself. To explore these issues, we built an infrared (IR) multi-camera machine vision system that constructs a volumetric model of the whole of the user's body in real time. We have also developed custom thee-dimensional vision tools, graphical techniques and a range of techniques for generating and managing semi-autonomous agents in immersive environments. ",

    "abstract": " The digital divide represents an important social problem accompanying the diffusion of the internet in the USA, and in other nations. Theoretically, the digital divide is closely related to conceptualisations, and the considerable past research, on the knowledge gap hypothesis. The digital divide is the gap that exists between individuals advantaged by the internet and those individuals relatively disadvantaged by the internet. Here we synthesise available findings about socio-economic and other characteristics of individuals who are users and non-users of the internet, explore data about whether the digital divide is widening, and discuss strategies for bridging the digital divide. We suggest that the access-divide, which has received the most attention to date, may eventually be replaced by a learning- divide, a content-divide, and by other types of divides through which the internet will continue to advantage certain individuals, and disadvantage others.

Based on a visual record of New Delhi and textual analysis of advertisements in a mass circulated Indian newspaper and magazine, it suggests that there is a need to rethink the discourse of digital celebration and euphoria that has accompanied the internet in the developing world, especially India. It argues that the themes emergent in the advertising of internet firms provide for a vision of the future of the internet which reifies issues of linguistic hegemony, technological solutions, a consumerist (rather than a citizenry) culture, and reiteration of the traditional discourses of masculinity and class. It suggests that we think about the future of internet technology in the developing world as intimately connected with issues of global capitalism and cultural hegemony in place of a focus on objects of technological innovation or individual innovators of technology.

We argue that business restructuring literature rewrites three central problematics of cybertheory: it establishes the virtual organisation, it rewrites employees as cyborgs, and constructs corporate culture as a cybernetic system. Business writers claim to offer the ideal technological and social forms central to the emergence of cyberculture. But they rewrite its central figures in support of a neoliberal governance project, reproducing technological determinism and global capitalist ideology. ",

    "abstract": "This investigation is intended to bring to light some reasons for connecting the notion of artificial life to certain kinds of interpretation of transcendental philosophy. Since the conception of a machine has undergone an apparently decisive alteration in the post-Newtonian world it will be part of the burden of this piece to suggest that the possibility of the evolutionary development of life beyond the organic is itself a product of new thought about the relation between the organic and the processes of interpretation and understanding that we have summarized under the heading “mind”. The ultimate point of the piece will be to suggest both that the underlying conceptual approaches to artificial life have serious deficiencies and to indicate that the development of which they are a part nonetheless has an essential relationship to futurity",

But, are these differences actually changing the role and function of price in the firm's marketing program? Are they possibly changing options for pricing, and perhaps even, the very notion of perceived value? Or in fact, does the new set of Internet pricing mechanisms merely require marketers to do what good marketers have always done, and that is to build customer-perceived value and use price to recapture it? The only difference may be that now, we can do it even better because we have better tools.",

    "abstract": "The coverage of the disaster in the U.S. on and subsequent to 11 September 2001, on various information channels throughout the world, was extensive. Written, spoken and visual material was produced and broadcast at unprecedented speed by sources ranging from authoritative journalistic channels, to official political spokespersons, to 'unofficial' sources and private persons posting comment on the Web via new Web-based news services, discussion and e-mail lists. The differing speed of response on the Web by the media industry, political and government channels reflected their organizational characteristics and the differing flexibility of reactions to extreme events. This paper traces a timeline of different aspects of news coverage during the week immediately following the disaster, and then over subsequent, more reflective, weeks. The material is used to show how a single dramatic event happening locally reverberates globally, and the impact of the developing global information infrastructure (GII) on these phenomena, geographically, temporally, and sectorally.",

    "abstract": "Technically, it is conceivable that banks (or even non-banks) that are based in offshore centres can issue e-money and distribute it via the Internet all over the world. Therefore, many economists see offshore e-money issuers as a severe threat to the ability of central banks to conduct monetary policy. In this paper, it is argued that offshore issuers will denominate their e-money products in terms of existing currencies. Therefore they will be affected by monetary policy measures in the same way as onshore banks.",

    "abstract": "Most analyses of culture and technology have been fascinated, even transfixed, by all the wonderful things that can be created and shared using digital tools. Rarely have these cultural analyses explored the issue of how such technological tools are going to impact how individuals interact and organize around cultural content that is fluid and contested. This is particularly problematic for schools as technological tools allow students to reject, share and contest the fixed content that has historically been disseminated through a narrow range of books and pedagogical strategies. This paper seeks to develop a theoretical model of culture that can account for change in what was, and still is, considered by many social scientists to be impermeable structural boundaries. By conceptualizing technology as a symbolic tool, it is hoped that the model of culture developed in this paper can begin to explain how social relations in institutions such as schools can change in a manner that will upset existing hierarchical social relations.",

    "abstract": "A whole literature has grown up around the apparently intractable hostility between innovation and bureaucracy, between those who create and those who control. Smart and speedy start-ups blindside mature companies with their inventiveness then grow up into mature companies and are outsmarted in their turn. The only way for innovation to survive in mature companies is to isolate the creators from the managers in protected enclaves. If this is true, it means that it is virtually impossible for sustained innovation to be built into the everyday operation of mature companies; it can only ever be an intermittent aberration.",

These institutions are key pillars of the public sphere of communications, the realm of civil society independent of government and commercial forces that provides citizens the tools to become full participants in republican self-government. This paper identifies four attributes of the digital divide -- literacy, access, content and training -- and discusses the role of libraries and museums in cultivating each of these capacities. The central thrust of the paper is that there are comprehensive solutions to bridge the divide (in the realization of these four elements) where the technological component is necessary but not sufficient to move the truly disadvantaged into the mainstream of American life.",

    "abstract": "Interest has arisen recently in assessing the impact of recent alterations in intellectual property law upon the structure and conduct of scientific research. This paper starts from the perspective of the literature of science studies, and suggests that earlier simplistic appeals to economic analysis and the sanctity of authorial intentions are badly flawed in both theoretical and empirical dimensions. We propose an alternative based upon a taxonomy of the types of authors envisioned in various regimes of intellectual property. From this perspective, two recent and semi-independent trends - namely, profound revision of copyright and patent in the direction away from earlier constructions of the author and towards greater downstream control, and the push to re-engineer universities towards greater commercial orientation - are leading to a fundamental contradiction in the available role models for contemporary scientists. Bluntly, the more science is commercialized under the new regime, the more previous research practices and protocols are threatened. The paper closes with three classes of examples to illustrate this claim: legal moves to suppress criticism and debate; restrictions on database access; and, the transformation of scientific journals into infomercial outlets.",

    "title": "The electronic Starry Plough: The Enationalism of the Irish Republican Socialist Movement (IRSM)",
    "abstract": "This paper takes the case of the Irish Republican Socialist Movement (IRSM) as the point of departure to discuss how insurgent political movement use Web communications. From mirror sites in Ireland and North America, IRSM supporters regularly use Web technology to relay the group message to a global audience at http://www.irsm.org/irsm.html. The resulting direct media contact gives the IRSM unprecedented access to global civil society. By referring to the IRSM Web site, the types of messages transmitted, the forms of transmission (text, video, audio, e-mail or other), and target audiences (national, global, political elites, media), this paper outlines some of the issues and challenges posed by Web-based anti-government media. The Internet and the Web do not constitute a threat to state power as some analysts suggest but at the same time they significantly alter political communication. The IRSM is a case of \"enationalism\", that is, the representation of a place as home to a specific group of people. Unlike traditional nationalism, enationalism is not tied to physical space or territory, but to representation of a network of relations based on a common language, historical experience, religion and/or culture. It is about both memory and future projection of a place as the home for a given group. In this light, new media will likely co-exist with other forms of political communication for some time.",

    "abstract": "This article addresses three fundamental ways in which the Internet could help in the move towards a more environmentally sustainable world. The Internet can improve our capability to understand the science of environmental degradation and communicate that knowledge to public and private decision makers. It can also improve environmental policy by increasing international equity and participation in the policy development processes. Finally, it can help decrease resource waste and associated pollution by improving the efficiency economic activity. The exploitation of these fundamental opportunities is not predestined however, and will require an ongoing elaboration of the Internet's role in global environmental sustainability.",

    "abstract": "This paper provides an overview of the positive and negative effects of new mass media introductions on the magazine publishing industry from an historical perspective. Since the early 1900s, the trends of new media both displacing magazines as well as spurring magazine sales and introductions are evident through the introduction of feature films, sound recordings, radio, television, computers, and the World Wide Web. New media have a tendency to both displace magazines, but also cause increasing specialization. The overriding goal of this paper is to provide a perspective for magazine publishers and scholars as they address the increasing penetration of the World Wide Web.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the latest of paradigms - the Virtual Network(ed) Organisation - and whether geographically dispersed knowledge workers can virtually collaborate for a project under no central planning. Co-ordination, management and the role of knowledge arise as the central areas of focus. The Linux Project and its development model are selected as a case of analysis and the critical success factors of this organisational design are identified. The study proceeds to the formulation of a framework that can be applied to all kinds of virtual decentralised work and concludes that value creation is maximized when there is intense interaction and uninhibited sharing of information between the organisation and the surrounding community. Therefore, the potential success or failure of this organisational paradigm depends on the degree of dedication and involvement by the surrounding community.",

It argues that the act of driving Internet traffic to an Internet server is an act of distribution and that costs associated with it are actually software production and distribution costs. It suggests a generalized model, the Internet distribution chain, using which the variable and marginal cost of production and distribution can be revealed. Using this model the paper will show that marginal costs associated with the production and distribution of software actually resemble those of traditional products.",

Findings include: (1) business queries often include more search terms, are less modified, lead to fewer Web pages viewed, and include less advanced search features, than non-business queries; (2) company or product queries were the most common form of business query; and, (3) Ask Jeeves business queries in question form were largely limited to the format \"Where can I buy ...\" or the request \"I want to buy ...\". The study provides insights into the beginnings of e-commerce Web searching.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the author reviews the history and application of copyright and concludes that, although promoted as being in the interests of authors, it is designed in such a way as to be primarily a right which benefits distributors and publishers. The author identifies a number of difficulties faced by distributors and publishers in enforcing their rights in an age where the various sources of \"friction\" which once limited infringement are being constantly reduced. In particular, in the emerging frictionless world the typical targets of the holder of a copyright monopoly (distributors pirating for profit) are being overtaken by a new breed of target (individuals with a cost reduction motive) and it is uneconomical for a holder of a copyright monopoly to pursue this new breed. The author argues that recent extensions to copyright monopolies add little to the illegality of the infringing acts nor any stigma to the performance of those acts. Instead, they exacerbate one of the main causes of infringement - consumer cynicism as to the benefits to society of the copyright monopoly. The author argues further that, rather than driving further cynicism through more expansive rhetoric relating to rights, holders of a copyright monopoly should instead seek to mollify consumer sentiment and encourage compliance by emphasizing a rhetoric of responsibility in the exercise of those rights. The author proposes three possible principles of responsibility that copyright monopoly holders might evaluate and endorse.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade a lot has been said about the possibilities of the Internet enhancing the public sphere. The two-way, decentralized communications within cyberspace are seen as offering the basis by which to facilitate rational-critical discourse and hence develop public opinion that can hold state power accountable. However, this potential has largely gone unrealized. Instead, cyber-interaction is dominated by commercial activity, private conversation, and individualized forms of politics. In this paper I investigate how the present Internet may be used to more fully facilitate the public sphere. To do this I evaluate Minnesota E-Democracy, an Internet-based initiative that attempts to develop online public discourse. Drawing upon a model of the public sphere developed from Jurgen Habermas' work, I show how the initiative structures discourse to overcome many of the problems that presently limit democratic deliberation online. While some significant limitations do remain, I conclude that Minnesota E-Democracy provides a basis from which online deliberative initiatives can, given adequate resourcing and further research, extend the public sphere through the Internet.",

В то же время, если смотреть исторически, связь сама по себе оказывается более материальным понятием, чем содержание. Даже в Интернете содержание не настолько важно, насколько оно претендует (если это не послание e-mail, содержащее зловредный вирус-убийцу). Главенство связи над содержимым объясняет феномен, который сбил с толку исследователей беспроводных систем: почему с энтузиазмом была воспринята SMS-технология (Short Message System) и весьма прохладно принят протокол WAP (Wireless Application Protocol)? Основываясь на статистических данных, показывающих уровень использования сотовых телефонов, автор показывает, что вводимые 3G-системы также будут первоначально использоваться для речевого общения, а не для доступа в Интернет. В статье подчеркивается мысль, что гигантские суммы, выделяемые на поддержку содержания (контента) расходуются не по назначению.",

    "abstract": "Our goal in this paper was to analyze \"send-this-story-to-a-friend\" data. Encouraging consumers to send stories to friends is an application of viral marketing which envisions message dissemination through customer-to-customer communication rather than firm-to-customer communication. It makes sense for a publisher to include this feature since individuals are more likely to accept the recommendations of their friends and this may increase theit probability of reading the story by making it more salient. We collected publicly available data from ESPN.com over an 11-day period. Using this data, our findings are: first, the number of times stories are sent out represent a miniscule proportion of visits to the site; second, if the top story is very influential, it may increase the total visits to the site and there may be spillover effect; third, there is an interesting weekend effect with a drop in the number of stories sent out; and, finally we observe an interesting floor effect when we analyze the ratio of the top and bottom stories.",

    "title": "Giving away music to make money: Independent musicians on the Internet",
    "abstract": "No one has felt the impact of music on the Internet more than the independent musician. The recording industry has dominated the production and distribution of music for many years. The big six recording labels are making a push to incorporate the Internet into their distribution process. Standing in their way is the issue of security.\n It seems that music files on the Internet, no matter how secure they may seem, are susceptible to tampering. This will force a shift in distribution away from selling music on the Internet in compact disc or MP3 file form and towards artists creating communities of shared interest that provide music to their audiences for free. New revenue sources will be created using streaming audio and video technology in a pay-per-view format, among others. This will drive the demand to see an artist in concert and increase the revenue that is generated from live performances.\n This paper will address the current state of the industry and the battle between the Internet world and record companies. Next, various plans will be discussed that create and distribute music on the Internet. Finally, I propose a comprehensive strategic plan for successful Internet commerce by independent artists that will be based on artists giving away all of their music for free via the Internet.",

    "abstract": "Publishing in the Arab world still is in its development stage. Many journals discontinue publication because of financial pressures, while those that asynchronously function are almost totally dependent on institutional (academic) funds. Other barriers as editorial hegemony, national and political instability, and institutional discouragement that hinder researchers and writers to submit or even try to publish work in indigenous Arab journals. Scholarly output is generally tied to the epistemological perspective of the researcher-writer; this in itself has been the major milestone to the lack and absent electronic journals in the Arab world. Electronic publishing has not appealed to the scholarly community in the Arab and Middle Eastern society and remains to be in dormant state. Scholars need to understand the World Wide Web and recognize the revolutionary elements of electronic journals as pacifiers to the hegemony of traditional publishing.",

Bibliographic control in the field of homiletics has a long history in America and extends beyond cataloging monographs to encompass abstracting and indexing services as well as Web sites in the larger electronic world. Specifically, work done at the American Theological Library Association (ATLA) is discussed in this paper, and the ATLA Religion Database is evaluated. The debate between using controlled vocabulary versus natural language and keyword searching is also presented. Unmet needs among homiletics bibliographers are listed, and reasons for the lack of interest in bibliographic control among preachers while preparing sermons are considered.",

    "abstract": "Providing navigational aids to assist users in finding information in hypertext systems has been an ongoing research problem for well over a decade. Despite this, the incorporation of navigational aids into Web search tools has been slow. While search engines have become very efficient in producing high quality rankings, support for the navigational process is still far from satisfactory. To deal with this shortcoming of search tools, we have developed a site specific search and navigation engine that incorporates several recommended navigational aids into its novel user interface, based on the concept of a user trail. Herein, we report on a usability study whose aim was to ascertain whether adding semi-automated navigational aids to a search tool improves users' experience when \"surfing\" the Web. The results we obtained from the study revealed that users of the navigation engine performed better in solving the question set posed than users of a conventional search engine. Moreover, users of the navigation engine provided more accurate answers in less time and with less clicks. Our results indicate that adding navigational aids to search tools will enhance Web usability and take us a step further towards resolving the problem of \"getting lost in hyperspace\".",

In order to fulfill that function the public library must be immune to the imposition of any particular orthodoxy of belief. The public librarian, functioning as a professional, is fully equipped to determine the policies and practices that will ensure that function. The public library patron must be unencumbered by apprehension when approaching a librarian for assistance in research.\n Through an investigation of U.S. Supreme Court decisions that may determine the legality of the recent Children's Internet Protection Act, this paper investigates the strengths and weaknesses of the position of the public library in executing its historical charge to present viewpoint free materials to enhance the independent investigations of any user of any public library.",

Implicit in this is a very complex and problematic agenda that re-establishes the book as a digital cultural artifact within a context of intellectual property rights management enforced by hardware and software systems. With the convergence of different types of content into a common digital bit-stream, developments in industries such as music are establishing precedents that may define our view of digital books. At the same time we find scholars exploring the ways in which the digital medium can enhance the traditional communication functions of the printed work, moving far beyond literal translations of the pages of printed books into the digital world. This paper examines competing visions for the future of the book in the digital environment, with particular attention to questions about the social implications of controls over intellectual property, such as continuity of cultural memory.",

    "abstract": "Three National Leadership Grants (NLG) (http://www.imls.gov/grants/library/lib_nlgl.asp) from the Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS) provide the foundation for the Find-It! Illinois Program (http://finditillinois.org) at the Illinois State Library (ISL):\n\n Grant One: \"Exporting Washington State's GILS\" (October 1998-September 1999)\n Grant Two: \"Find-It! Illinois\" (October 1999-September 2001)\n Grant Three: \"Metadata Tools for State Collaboration\" (October 1999-September 2001)\n Based on the successful Government Information Locator Service (GILS) program at the Washington State Library (WSL) (http://find-it.state.wa.us/compass), the ISL began a GILS program of its own in the fall of 1999. State-level GILS projects around the country, based at state libraries and some state archives, are distilled from the federal GILS model (http://www.gils.net/). State GILS programs provide a resource discovery methodology for electronic state government information. Each program includes components for access, organization, design, standard metadata creation, state agency Webmaster education and training, and interface development. Essentially, the state libraries and archives involved in these projects act as clearinghouses for and gateways to electronic state government information.\n Grant One, awarded to the WSL, provided the ISL and three other state libraries, (Oregon, New Hampshire, and Arizona), with the model framework for starting a GILS program. Grant Two, awarded to the ISL, provided development dollars for the fledgling ISL program Find-It! Illinois. Grant Three, awarded to the WSL and contracted in part to the ISL, provides funding for the enhancement of metadata interoperability and the application of a consortial subject tree.\n In Illinois, providing access to electronic state government content is manifest not only in the establishment of the ISL GILS program, but also in the creation of the other databases that comprise the Find-It! Illinois portal. Interoperability among these Find-It! virtual libraries will be enhanced by the application of a single controlled vocabulary for subject searching, called the \"Jessica Tree.\" Additionally, work is underway to establish the Jessica Tree as the standard list for state GILS programs with the goal of promoting interstate interoperable subject searching.",

    "abstract": "In the present paper, I explore how the Internet has affected the flow of information between in and outside Myanmar (Burma). I show that there is a strong difference between the way information was presented before and after the introduction of the World Wide Web.\n Within the last century, the country has been marked by political instability (Eliot, 1997; Freedom House, 2000). Particularly since its separation from British colonial rule in 1948, Burma has witnessed significant political change, violence and unrest. Since the early 1960s, Burma has essentially been an isolated state, with closed borders and a military government. However, the fall of the Berlin wall and the end of the Cold War seem to suggest that isolationism is growing less common worldwide. Importantly, meteoric advances in communications have also paralleled the fall of isolationism.\n In my study, I examine two political events in Myanmar connected to student uprisings, in the hope of documenting how the Internet - as an easily researched symbol of modern communications - may be affecting the political strategies of one of the last isolated states.",

The main hypothesis is that Napster is an imagined network community. The first section of the paper gives a theoretical background to the problems addressed: the notions of community and network, the concepts of imagined and network community, as well as the debate on virtual communities are discussed there. Pundits such as Ferdinand Tonnies, Emile Durkheim, Benedict Anderson, Barry Wellman, Morris Janowitz, Robert Putnam and others are consulted. The third part of this paper consist firstly of an analysis of the Napster software that aims at demonstrating the structure for the actors to interact within, and secondly addresses 12 variables that have been distinguished as descriptive of an imagined and network community. In conclusion several implications from the research are drawn.",

    "abstract": "Economically, privacy can be understood as a problem of social cost, where the actions of one agent (e.g., a mailing list broker) impart a negative externality on another agent (e.g., an end consumer). Problems in social cost can be understood by modeling the liabilities, transaction costs and property rights assigned to various economic agents within the system, and can be resolved by reallocating property rights and liability to different agents as needed to achieve economic equilibrium. This article examines how advances in high speed networking and data storage have radically reduced the costs to businesses of collecting, storing, manipulating and exchanging large amounts of personally identifying information on consumers, and the policy implications that these cost reductions have on property rights over personal information. A complementary economic and legal system that recognizes individual property rights over personal information is suggested as a way in which to greatly accelerate the adoption of electronic commerce and to extract inefficiencies from the already existing marketplace for personal information.",

    "abstract": "Netwar is an emerging mode of conflict in which the protagonists - ranging from terrorist and criminal organizations on the dark side, to militant social activists on the bright side - use network forms of organization, doctrine, strategy, and technology attuned to the information age. The practice of netwar is well ahead of theory, as both civil and uncivil society actors are increasingly engaging in this new way of fighting. We suggest how the theory of netwar may be improved by drawing on academic perspectives on networks, especially those about organizational network analysis. As for practice, strategists and policymakers in Washington and elsewhere have begun to discern the dark side of the network phenomenon - especially in the wake of the \"attack on America\" perpetrated apparently by Osama bin Laden's terror network. But they still have much work to do to begin harnessing the bright side, by formulating strategies that will enable state and civil-society actors to work together better. This paper is largely drawn (with updates added) from Chapter 10 of our forthcoming book, Networks and Netwars: The Future of Terror, Crime, and Militancy (RAND, 2001), which will also be available online soon at www.rand.org/publications/MR/MR1382/.",

The need for this distributed organization to respond as a unified whole to a rapidly changing environ«ment required it to confront the uncertainties and contingencies introduced by invisibility, distance, and fragmentation of information. In order to transcend the boundaries of time and space, the company coupled new technologies with new ways of organizing work. Groupware and remote meeting technologies provided a common virtual workscape. In this paper, we focus on issues generated by the integration of remote meeting technologies into local work practices.

This paper explains why this trend undermines cultural arguments about \"hacker ethics\" and \"post-scarcity\" gift economies. It suggests that classical economic theory offers a more succinct explanation for the peculiar international distribution of open source development: hacking rises and falls inversely to its opportunity cost. This finding throws doubt on the Schumpeterian assumption that the efficiency of industrial systems can be measured without reference to the social institutions that bind them.",

    "abstract": "The Internet provides new ways for citizens to access information about the community, which has often been difficult to obtain in the past. To gain a better understanding of how public libraries and their partner organizations are poised to provide such community information (CI) in the next decade we have conducted a major study of the provision of CI and its use. Funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) \"Help-Seeking in an Electronic World: The Impact of Electronic Access to Community Information on Citizens' Information Behavior and Public Libraries\" (www.si.umich.edu/helpseek) is a multi-stage research project consisting of a two-stage national survey of the provision of CI in the digital age and case studies of public library community networking partnerships, which were designed to provide in-depth knowledge of community networking approaches. We identified a wide range of impacts of digital CI services and systems on citizens, organizations, and communities. The examples we discuss are indicative of the ways that CI librarians and those who are building community networks contribute to the social fabric of their communities. In this article we present 1) an introduction to public library involvement in CI provision; 2) examples of digital best practices and community networking activities; 3) a discussion of benefits of networked CI and community networks from the perspective of users; and, 4) implications for evaluation since current tools cannot determine the impact of digital CI initiatives.",

    "abstract": "The addition of the Web to the range of technologies which humans have used to mediate between themselves and the world has contributed to problems as well as advantages in the area of school education. Historical antecedents in areas such as writing, printing and industrialisation provide a context in which mediated experiences can be examined. In the 21st century, the availability of online education increases the possibility that virtual experience will be substituted for reality. There are also concerns that there will be a blurring of appearance and reality, and that cultural imperialism will continue to spread by use of the Web. Together with the observation that computer-mediation via the Web tends to reframe the central role of the teacher in the educational process, these factors are considered in terms of the need to establish future guidelines to reduce the adverse impact of the Web on school education.",

The drive to develop a winning formula for commercial online education has fostered some unusual partnerships. This paper provides a broad overview of some models of online education that have been developed by commercial and academic institutions. It examines some of the rhetorical strategies that have been used to talk about online education by commercial groups, and discusses some of the hopes and fears that have been associated with online instruction by academics, administrators, and businesspeople. The paper outlines some of the main players and positions involved in debates about online education, and suggests some strategies that academic groups ought to explore. In particular, the author argues that academics need something an open source movement for academic resources, akin to the Free Software Foundation. This 'Free Courseware Foundation' would give teachers greater control of their resources, and better enable them to share materials with other teachers and with the public.",

    "abstract": "In their article \"The Street Performer Protocol and Digital Copyrights\" (Kelsey and Schneier, 1999) suggest that copyright will become increasingly difficult to enforce. They propose a general mechanism for funding digital public works, the \"Street Performer Protocol\" in which authors produce their work only after they receive enough contributions to make it worth their while. In this article, I sketch out a proposal for the creation of a software completion bond market. I think such a market would be a practical implementation of the \"Street Performer Protocol\" for the funding of open source software. I first describe how such a bond market might work, and why I think the open source community needs a bond market. Then I examine the underlying economics of open source software. Finally, I review some of the existing and potential alternatives to a software completion bond market. [1].",

    "abstract": "The Internet and specifically its graphic interface the World Wide Web is reaching a level of saturation and widespread adoption throughout the world. Specifically for journalism practiced online - in the discipline of computer-assisted reporting (CAR) and a specific kind of journalism: online journalism - we can now identify and theorize about the impacts the global system of networked computers has had on journalism. This paper signals four particular journalisms online as these have emerged in the 'first generation' of newsmedia on the World Wide Web (1993-2001), discusses the key characteristics - cf. hypertextuality, interactivity, multimediality - which determine the 'added value' of these journalisms, and provides three specific strategies journalists may use to further enhance the potential of journalism online: annotative reporting, open source journalism and hyperadaptive news sites.",

    "title": "Reaching across the divide: The challenges of using the Internet to bridge disparities in access to information",
    "abstract": "Over the past few years, the Internet has rapidly become part of the daily lives of most people in the first world. This trend in easy access to unlimited information resources for first world users mirrors the growing 'central-peripheral divide' in the developing world: the concentration of wealth in the major urban centres and the increasing marginalisation of people in the peri-urban and rural areas. The result of both trends is that the majority of the world's population, particularly on the African continent, has limited access to most information resources.\n The Internet provides the opportunity to reach a broader cross-section of the virtual community of all those concerned with the issues of violence, crime, reconciliation, human rights and transformation, whilst at the same time, the challenge of resisting the (re)marginalisation and exclusion of grassroots constituencies who have limited skills and access to these resources.\n The Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation (CSVR) is a multi-disciplinary South African non-governmental organisation. Drawing on the experience of making the CSVR's 13 years of research available online, this paper traces the balancing act that has been required in reaching across the divide, and details some of the design challenges that have presented themselves. It explores the phenomenon of \"graceful degradation\", and examines some of the challenges facing NGOs using this exciting new medium.",

Further input was obtained through meetings with Teacher Advisors, e-mail responses, and statistics regarding the use of the site. This input is being used to plan training workshops and online tutorials to expose teachers to potential uses of primary research material in the classroom and to encourage them to create their own lesson plans. Ongoing feedback from teachers will assure that Connecticut History Online continues to meet their needs in training students to build observation, analysis and critical thinking skills while preparing for the Connecticut Mastery Test and the Connecticut Academic Performance Test.",

In this paper, we attempt to answer this important question by examining the antecedents to customer confidence in e-tailers, using secondary data. Our findings indicate that the ease of use of a site, the level of online shopping resources, and the presence of a trusted third party seal all positively impact the level of customer confidence. Interestingly, online relationship services did not have an impact on consumer confidence. Larger firms may have a small edge. We also find that there are no large differences in the results across different product categories.",

    "abstract": "While browsing the Web is a widespread everyday activity there is a shortage of detailed understanding of how users organise their Web usage. In this paper we present results from a qualitative in-depth interview study of how users browse the Web and combine browsing with their other activities. The data are used to explore three particular problems which users have with browsing the Web. Firstly, users have problems managing their favourites, and in particular accessing their favourites through a hierarchical menu. Second, users have problems with combining information across different Web sites - what we call the \"meta-task\" problem. Third, users have concerns with security and privacy, although these concerns seem to change as users become more experienced with shopping on the Web. We discuss three concepts which address these problems: \"home page favourites\", \"Web clipping\" and the \"Web card\". These concepts are attempts at incremental improvements to the Web without affecting the Web's essential simplicity.",

    "title": "Policy bridges for the digital divide: Assessing the landscape and gauging the dimensions",
    "abstract": "Early evidence of economic and social change related to the diffusion of a number of information and communication technologies (ICTs) suggests that public sector actors face significant opportunities, as well as some unexpected barriers while \"paving the information highway\". These technologies have generated significant changes in the nature, and operation of communication and delivery of services by the private sector increasing the impetus to accelerate adoption of these technologies in the public sector. While the advantages of accessing these services is well accepted, the benefits of the use of these technologies has been observed to occur in a distressingly uneven or patchy manner. This variation, which for the sake of simplicity has been described by extending the information superhighway metaphor as \"gaps\" or \"divides\" in the development of the \"highway\". This paper suggests that a disservice is done in reducing the apparent inequities in the diffusion of the technologies to a simple socioeconomic concern. Rather than a one-dimensional \"digital divide,\" more accurately there is a policy problem related to the use and deployments of ICTs with multiple geographic, social, economic and organizational components.\n Further, ICTs present policymakers with an array of complex issues that extend beyond purely internal technological concerns. Rather than answering the question of how should public sector functions respond to the changes made possible by diffusion of ICTs, a more critical step seems to be to accurately gauge the nature of the issue rather than jump in and lay \"digital pavement\". This paper explores ramifications of the deployment of these technologies and suggests dimensions of the problem that merit further assessment.",

Specific search facility and content will be added to help users with different levels of domain knowledge identify species based on the augmentation of professionally developed taxonomic treatments or species descriptions. This is a novel use of taxonomic descriptions.

Departing from conventional notions of political activity which downplay the participatory opportunities inherent in communication media, the authors argue that since 1992 new media formats have made accessible to citizens a political system that had become highly orchestrated, professionalized and exclusionary. A typology of active, passive and inactive political involvement is presented to accurately distinguish civic involvement from political disengagement and to categorize the types of empowerment and rewards - both material and symbolic - that different modes of civic activity afford. Even if only symbolically empowering, civic engagement through new media serves as an important legitimizing mechanism of mass democracy. ",

    "title": "What's the Point of Using Computers?",
    "abstract": " Despite the column inches and policy statements dedicated to arguing that young people need to use computers, very little is known about the reasons why young people themselves might value and acquire computer expertise. Drawing on a survey of 855 children and 16 detailed case studies of children's use of computers at home this article explores the influence of software design, family discourses, peer group culture and gender identity on children's perception of the potential uses and benefits of ICT expertise. The article goes on to argue that young people value and acquire computer expertise primarily in order to achieve practical objectives and in relation to the construction of (gendered) peer group identities. Given these findings the article questions the continued emphasis in educational policy on the acquisition of decontextualized information and communications technology (ICT) `skills' within a rationale of future relevance to the workplace.

    "abstract": " Through the analysis of Walkman use I propose a reevaluation of the significance of the auditory in everyday experience. I argue that the role of sound has been largely ignored in the literature on media and everyday life resulting in systematic distortions of the meanings attached to much everyday behaviour. Sound as opposed to vision becomes the site of investigation of everyday life in this article. In focusing thus, I draw upon a range of neglected texts in order to provide a dialectical account of auditory and technologically mediated experience that avoids reductive and dichotomous categories of explanation. I propose a new evaluation of the relational nature of auditory experience whereby users manage their cognition, interpersonal behaviour and social space. The Walkman is perceived as a tool whereby users manage space, time and the boundaries around the self. ",

    "abstract": " In broad strokes this article adumbrates some issues in Filipino virtual communities and social interactions mediated by information technology (IT). Problems and prospects are explored with the optic of the barangay, a social unit that evolved from the pre-Spanish `boat community' ( barangay) to its present dominant geo-political form. While IT tends to be instrumental in Western hegemonic encroachment into the Filipino lifeworld, some of its libertarian potentials are gaining ground in emerging cyber-barangays which require new `focal things and practices'. The emerging Filipino communities mediated by IT are spheres of localization amid globalization and questions of nationhood. The article also proposes to `Filipinize' IT - that is, to creatively and critically appropriate IT into practices congenial to Filipino culture. ",

    "abstract": " This article explores the father-son-computer triangle in an attempt to shed light on the role of the machine in the articulation of male identity in particular, and family relationships in general. The article outlines a framework for the investigation of families and domestic communication technologies, arguing that the study of identity construction through the medium must be accompanied by a study of the relationships around the medium; and that men and boys need to be (re)incorporated into the work on the human-machine problematic. Drawing on an analysis of the discourse of three families that were observed and interviewed in the course of one year, the article proposes that the notion of computer expertise and the sense of dependence are key for the construction of fatherhood and masculinity vis a vis the home computer, and points to the metaphor of immigrants' language acquisition, which was offered by one of the fathers, as capturing the complexity of contemporary paternal emasculation.

    "abstract": " Music plays an important, and sometimes overlooked part in the transformation of communication and distribution channels. With a global market volume exceeding US$40 billion, music is not only one of the primary entertainment goods in its own right. Since music is easily personalized and transmitted, it also permeates many other services across cultural borders, anticipating social and economic trends. This article presents one of the first detailed empirical studies on the impact of internet technologies on a specific industry. Drawing on more than 100 interviews conducted between 1996 and 2000 with multinational and independent music companies in 10 markets, strategies of the major players, current business models, future scenarios and regulatory responses to the online distribution of music files are identified and evaluated. The data suggest that changes in the music industry will indeed be far-reaching, but disintermediation is not the likely outcome. ",

    "abstract": " This article describes an action-research pilot project to provide opportunities for the remote Kelabit community in the Malaysian state of Sarawak, on the island of Borneo, to use information and communication technologies (ICTs) for sustainable human development. The project aims to establish a telecentre as a place for the community to use ICTs. Although many in the community have heard about computers, they have not seen or used them. In Phase 1 of this project, a team of University Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS) researchers were involved in the collection of base-line data to provide a socio-economic profile of the community, to establish existing patterns of communication and computer awareness and finally to determine the current attitudes towards computers in Bario's secondary school (SMK Bario). Findings indicate that due to Bario's relative isolation, community members cited their relatives to be the main source of information and face-to-face communication as the major channel of communication, and that a majority of school teachers had a positive attitude towards using ICTs. Recommendations for future directions in promoting the utilization of ICTs to lead to the establishment of a telecentre are discussed. ",

    "abstract": " Results from a random sample of 576 college students show that relaxation, entertainment and fashion are instrumental motives for ICQ (`I seek you') use while inclusion, affection, sociability and escape are the intrinsic motives. Students who are heavy users of ICQ are motivated by affection and sociability whilst light users are motivated by fashion. Use of emails and ownership of cellular phones seem to be significant predictors of ICQ use. Students who spend longer time on ICQ sessions also play online games more often for entertainment, live in dormitories, have a lower household income, and do not subscribe to any ISP service at home. Female ICQ users tend to chat longer and more frequently for reasons of sociability while males spend less time on each session for entertainment and relaxation. The findings suggest that ICQ is a technology that facilitates social relations and is a major source of entertainment for college students. ",

    "abstract": " Electronic democracy rhetoric has proliferated with the growth of the internet as a popular communications medium. This rhetoric is largely dominated by liberal individualist assumptions. Communitarianism has provided a resource for an alternative vision of electronic democracy. A third model, deliberative democracy, has recently been employed by electronic democrats who want to move beyond the individualism/communitarianism opposition. In this article, I outline each of these visions, describing the democratic assumptions and electronic democracy practices that each embraces. In particular, I explore the ways in which each vision sees the internet as aiding its cause. I conclude by pointing to the relative lack of research into the possibility of the deliberative position being realized through cyberspace. I suggest that a more regorous analysis of the intersection between the internet and deliberative democracy would not only be sociologically fruitful but may provide interesting possibilities for enhancing contemporary democratic forms.

Our goal was to examine how non-professional users interpret, `domesticate' (Silverstone, 1994) and creatively appropriate (Feenberg, 1999) the internet in order to integrate it into the relevance structures and activities of their everyday lives. We identify new cultural practices emerging on this basis and reflect on what these practices mean for the social shaping of the internet as a communication medium. The methods of data collection included ethnographic interviews, and `tours' of the home and computer space of 30 domestic users of the internet in different socio-biographical situations. ",

    "abstract": " This article examines the process of expressing oneself in cyberspace through the metaphor of `voice', by drawing a similarity between the process of speaking and the presentation of the self in cyberspace. The metaphor of voice allows the examination of expressions in cyberspace in a dialogic manner and demonstrates a unique voice that can be produced with the technology of cyberspace. This is a voice that is heteroglossic and hyperconnected, and in the case of the marginalized, this voice has the potential of producing a call that the dominant has a moral obligation to acknowledge. Consequently, the metaphor of voice in cyberspace problematizes the relation between the marginal and the dominant by initiating a crisis of acknowledgment on the part of the dominant. Ultimately, this approach allows for the re-examination and re-invention of the notion of cyber communities and their role in the public sphere. These issues are developed by using Indian diasporic websites as evidence to support the arguments. ",

It is both a theoretical elaboration of the concepts of interactivity and interactive television and a presentation of a survey among 74 American, Asian and European corporate experts of ITV. First, operational definitions of the concepts of interactivity and interactive television are presented as scholarly images of ITV. Then the main results of a questionnaire investigating corporate expert images of ITV are presented. These images are assessed by the investigators to be rather weak and imprecise. Still, the experts concerned are desperately seeking a suitable and concrete business model of ITV, as a kind of Holy Grail. Experts from the world of television production and internet production appear to have different images of interactivity, applications of ITV and the future of television. Finally, the authors present the main components of business models of ITV and the future prospects of this medium.",

    "abstract": " After reviewing the emergence of online newspapers, we offer observations based on historical and design analyses of major US sites, supplemented top-down by innovators in the Americas and Europe and bottom-up by sites serving one locality in Massachusetts. Despite losing typical print elements, the late modern designs emphasize text, with minimal multimedia content, especially on local sites. Instead of giving outlet to news handicraft, corporate and promotional models abound. The web flattens hierarchies, exposes content sources, and deforms journalistic authority by disarticulating the audience. Historical parallels include 19th-century flows of design innovation from advertising into news and of informational tasks from reporting into photojournalism. Newspapers can coexist with the internet while surrendering some tasks, such as archiving factual background, becoming instead more analytical advocates. ",

    "abstract": " The term `telemedicine' refers to health care and health education transmitted over large distances via computer with interactive audio and video capabilities. Over the past decade, telemedicine has been widely hailed as a means of administering health care to rural areas where doctors are scarce. Most research on the subject emphasizes technological, regulatory, and utilitarian aspects of telemedicine. This study, however, develops a cultural studies perspective in order to examine how social relationships are negotiated with regard to telemedicine in a particular context. The contextual focus is South Dakota - a state where telemedicine has rapidly developed in response to an ongoing crisis in health care access. An overview of economic and health care conditions in South Dakota is followed by examinations of network structures through which telemedicine operates in the state and an analysis of how telemedicine is rhetorically constructed in the state's leading newspaper. Concluding sections discuss the hegemonic nature of telemedicine in South Dakota and raise questions about telemedicine in other contexts. ",

    "abstract": " In post-Communist Russia, when talking about new communications technology, one has to ask what is `new' and what is `old'. Already in the Communist era increasing availability of new communications technology (for example fax machines and email) amplified cheap `small' technology as an alternative to `big' and expensive technology controlled by the state. New communications technology, at the crossroads of mass and interpersonal communication, was harder for authorities to control and intensified the process whereby communication has escaped from political control. The introduction of new communications technology has been slow in post-Communist Russia in comparison to western countries because it is constrained by established state structures. The article concludes that although new communications technology provides new opportunities for individuals, old technology and structures set boundaries to the growth of the new. ",

    "abstract": " The diffusion of the internet in Germany was accompanied by strong attention from the traditional mass media who considered the new medium extensively in their coverage. Their media framing of the internet is analyzed following the four dimensions of framing identified in earlier research on media issues. Central to this process are the argumentation patterns used in this research which were defined with regard to a qualitative analysis of the multimedia discourse. Results of a quantitative content analysis of German news magazine coverage (1995-8) indicate that these media had a strong tendency towards a favorable assessment of the internet. The euphoric and economically optimistic argumentation patterns were most important, and outcomes of the development were evaluated as supporting the emancipation of the individual. However, this particular way of framing the internet issue is only partly reflected in the perceptions of users. ",

    "abstract": " In the United States and Australia, men and women use the internet in nearly equal measure, whereas in Japan, India and China, men continue to dominate internet use. This article focuses on gender differences in the use of the internet at home as seen from women's perspectives and draws particularly on open-ended interviews in 1999 with 30 middle-income Anglo-Celtic women with internet access in urban and rural areas of Australia. The study found that women generally use the internet as a tool for activities, rather than as play or a technology to be mastered. This partially explains why women farmers use the internet more extensively than their farmer husbands. When women become comfortable with technology - as with the telephone or the PC on a farm - women see it as a tool rather than a technology. Women's continued discomfort with technology thus remains at the centre of the social construct of gender and technology. ",

    "abstract": " Design and dispersion of new socio-technological configurations are studied by many varying sorts of scientific disciplines, ranging from communication studies to technology studies. In this article, the configuration and appropriation of new socio-technical constituencies are studied and subsequently interpreted in terms of a rather novel concept: social learning. On top of what is known about appropriation and configuration processes, social learning adds another point of view, elaborated from a perspective known as the social shaping of technology. It takes Beck and Giddens' reflexive modernization as starting point, and uses this to elaborate social learning into two dominant modes: the mode of experimentation and the mode of control. The Digital City of Amsterdam is used as exemplar to demonstrate configuration and appropriation processes and how these can be interpreted as elements of the mode of experimentation. ",

Recent studies of new media use are used to illustrate how ICTs might contribute to social differentiation. ",

    "abstract": " This article attempts to illustrate how African learners orient themselves towards information in a pre-computerized learning environment. The critical objective of the article is to show that the disempowering elements in learning might again be replicated in computer-mediated learning or communication. The article illustrates that young African learners are situationally and not critically empowered by information as presented in its current form by institutions of learning. We assume that the African learner's accommodation to the context and the forms of information transfer inhibits an authentic development of ways of learning and critical knowledge construction. The interaction with and orientation to the current contexts, which mediate and present information, might not be an empowering experience. The article hopes to contribute to the formulation of program design for computer-mediated communication. It conceptualizes a learning environment with a new culture, one based on the learning elements of social constructivist theory and the communal principles of Gemeinschaft [community] in a postmodern era. It is also intended to suggest to learning program designers how to facilitate conscientization and the empowerment of the African learners in their interaction with information. ",

    "title": "Herbert Schiller",
    "abstract": "I first encountered Herbert Schiller’s work in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and I recall being struck by how alone he was among people writing for both an academic and a wider public in the United States. It impressed me that in spite of all the utopian rhetoric about how, for example, cable television, the internet of that era, was going to create a wired democracy, Schiller stood practically by himself to write with confidence about how old and new media were expanding the American empire. Moreover, amid all the government and business hoopla about the liberating power of communication satellites, in 1969, he again stood almost alone, this time to write carefully and intelligently about how the Kennedy and Johnson administrations and their friends at AT&T, RCA, and ITT beat down the opposition to create Comsat and Intelsat and ensure early American dominance of satellite technology. It was not easy to be a lone voice asking critical questions about new technologies and businesses enthusiastically supported by both old and new organs of communication. Although he had supporters on the left, few of them cared much about the mass media, considering it too soft and ephemeral for serious neo-Marxist analysis. Undeterred by the lack of interest on the left and with the help of people such as Dallas Smythe and George Gerbner, Schiller worked to fill this blind spot by describing what amounted to a military-industrial-communication complex. Although he is given some credit for courageously addressing the political issues surrounding new media, Schiller is not recognized enough for the conceptual work it took to understand back in 1969 just how business and government were turning both the electromagnetic spectrum and the geosynchronous satellite orbit into commodities not unlike oil, gas, or soybeans. Nor is he recognized enough for the theoretical work it took in 1973, just as Daniel Bell’s The Coming of a Post-Industrial Society was appearing, to write in The Mind Managers about how information was fast becoming a leading commercial commodity.",

    "abstract": "Israel lost its protracted war in south Lebanon after 22 years of brutal occupation, from Israel’s “Operation Litani” in March 1978 to its withdrawal in May 2000 (Israel continues to occupy the Shebaá farms, which Hizballah vows to liberate). Of course, it is largely the success of the resistance movement’s armed struggle in south Lebanon, led by Hizballah, that inflicted cumulative loses on a scale so critical as to lead to Israeli withdrawal. Yet in the final months of occupation, south Lebanon was brought to world attention following a series of remarkable events played out in the international media. The media images displayed around the world of Birzeit University students pelting the French prime minister Lionel Jospin with stones (26 February 2000) in retaliation for calling Hizballah “terrorists” and the students’ chants announcing more than solidarity (“from Birzeit to south Lebanon, one people who will not die!”) were followed by declarations in Lebanon and around the Arab world that “we are all Hizballah,” including that of Yousef Chahine (the famous Egyptian filmmaker), who announced in print his fervent support for Hizballah, save ideology. The lionizing of Hizballah in the Arab world also emanates from the movement’s success, particularly since the late 1980s, in developing its profile as a Lebanese and Arab nationalist movement, with a Mao-esque social policy and program for social justice, and as a movement bent on political intervention and participation (in party politics). This has been achieved through increasingly sophisticated and compelling uses of the new media and information technologies. What is new and striking is Hizballah’s innovative uses of new media in adapting and inventing rhetorics, that is, images and video to address conflicting constituencies both local and international. Hizballah’s multimedia spread includes al-Ahd newspaper as well as al-Manar television station",

    "abstract": "On its surface, Prime Suspect concerns the hardships and difficulties a woman officer faces in the traditionally masculine world of the London Metropolitan Police Force. Like its television predecessors—Police Woman (ITV 1975-1979), The Gentle Touch (ITV, 1980-1984), Juliet Bravo (BBC 19801985), and Cagney and Lacey (BBC 1982-1988)—its female detective encounters institutional and personal discrimination in her day-to-day duties; forced to fight both criminals and entrenched male chauvinism in her pursuit of justice and equality. Written by Lynda La Plante and directed by Christopher Menaul, the first Prime Suspect miniseries (consisting of two 2-hour episodes shown on consecutive evenings) was made by Granada Television and originally broadcast in Britain on the 7th and 8th of April 1991. Renowned for its high production values, it continued and developed many aspects of the original police genre while also breaking new ground in its graphic use of realism and its close attention to squalor, violence, and police practice. Beginning her career as an actress, La Plante’s big hit as a writer first came with Widows (Thames TV 1983), a successful British television series about a group of women who turn their hands to bank robbery. Prime Suspect similarly inverted a traditionally masculine story, placing a woman at the head of a homicide team in pursuit of a sadistic serial killer. As part of",

    "abstract": "and equally interiorized (e.g., the darkness of the movie theater, the dream-like nature of identification with screen images, the centering or decentering of a viewer’s imaginary relation to screen space). One contradiction surrounding television criticism therefore concerned how to bring criticism’s conception of space to bear on a potentially more mobile relation of the viewer to the television set, on the broadcasted nature of television that brought signals into homes, and on the increasingly pervasive presence of the video monitor in and outside domiciles. Of course, true critics could simply ignore these features, continuing instead to talk about television as only what appeared on the screen and as if the viewer were always engaged with the TV set—as if every home were the eternally mythic suburban home, as if the TV room were a kind of camera obscura, as if some TV critics weren’t capable of reading, listening to music, and watching television all in the same place. And while reading and movie watching certainly were a part of the reorganization of an environment outside the home or the movie theater, criticism seemed unconcerned with that issue. 12. One of the most vivid examples of this tendency in film studies has been that of Bordwell, Thompson, and Staiger (1985). 13. While Harvey generalized the material modalities of aesthetic (“cultural”) mediation, reading in the aesthetics of space what economic theory already explains, Jameson (1991) generalized the economic tendencies of post-Fordism to ground his claims about a postmodern aesthetic/culture. Both saw culture as being determined primarily by economic developments. In certain respects, postmodernist criticism (including that which informs “critical geography”) placed television at the center of postmodernity: television as the metaphor/example par excellence of late-twentieth-century culture, of simulation, and as agent of a global occupation by American pop culture. On one hand, television was implicated in the breakup of rationalism as the organizing principle of culture, subject formation, and space in modernity, and on the other hand, television was the abstract embodiment of an equally abstract concept of social totalization: the networked society. Although treatments of postmodernism that have emphasized the interconnectedness of media and their subjects (or the connection of media to other virtual sites collectively comprising a networked society) have offered a way of thinking about the environmental features of television, in ways not common in earlier criticism, they nonetheless have generalized that environment—seeing a postmodernist aesthetic or “the cultural logic of late capitalism” everywhere or in highly essentialized forms. For instance, it is one thing to suggest that television is a technology that relies on shopping malls to maintain structures of power, and it is another to imply that television = shopping malls = a postmodern environment. 226 Television & New Media / August 2001",

    "abstract": "Charlotte Brunsdon (1998) proposed a reading of recent crime fiction on British television that drew attention to the parallels between real-life concerns around policing and law and order and the generic “tropes” of fictional texts. “I am suggesting that this genre, in its many variants, works over and worries at the anxieties and exclusions of contemporary citizenship, of being British and living here, now” (Brunsdon 1998, 225). Brunsdon’s (1998) argument attempts to formulate a connection between fictional texts and the wider concerns of a media-literate public. The relationship between popular entertainment genres and the culture in which they are produced are too often eschewed in favor of either narrow analyses of texts or sociological investigation of the audience as if watching television offered no pleasures that were not wedded to a kind of social engineering. The analysis of television crime drama in the context of wider debates that encompass contemporary social and political issues seems to me to be a more useful starting point. However as Brunsdon (1998, 224) herself points out, we must be wary of constructing a hypothesis that offers “too simple a correspondence between crime and unrest on the streets, and crime on television.” I agree with this statement, and yet an approach that broadly interprets the generic productivity of television crime drama as mere evidence of the zeitgeist cannot do full justice to the complexity of television production at a time of enormous political and social upheaval. There is a respectable tradition of television analysis that foregrounds the text as a site of ideological contestation. The semiotics of television representation are well understood by research scholars and students engaged in the analysis of news media and documentary.

    "abstract": "At times, the unprecedented success of and rabid fan loyalty for The X-Files borders on the paranormal. Following FBI special agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully’s investigations of strange, often inexplicable crimes, The X-Files has outgrown its initial cult status and become a worldwide cultural phenomenon. Television audiences and critics alike are enthralled by the show’s innovative narrative strategies, wildly improbable story lines, stylish look, and attractive yet enigmatic lead characters (Littleton 1996; Rapping 1995; Reeves, Rodgers, and Epstein 1996). In turn, advertisers find the show’s upscale demographics irresistible: on the syndication market, media buyers pay top dollar for spot advertising in The X-Files (Mandese 1998). In the wake of the show’s popular success, The X-Files has generated the inevitable slew of product tie-ins, from books and soundtrack recordings to video games and CD-ROMs. Furthermore, The X-Files’ fan culture flourishes in cyberspace; chat lines, newsgroups, and hundreds of web sites provide fans—self-described X-philes—with an electronic forum to deliberate on plot twists and character development, debate the significance of program minutiae, and declare their fervent appreciation for the show’s stars David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson (Clerc 1996). All the while, network television producers—a notoriously unimaginative lot—scramble in vain to clone The X-Files’ award-winning blend of police drama, science fiction, and horror in hopes of coming up with a hit (Emery 1997). Not surprisingly, then, explanations of the program’s cultural significance are as plentiful as The X-Files’ (in)famous conspiracy theories.",

    "title": "Building on diversity: crafting a paradigm for digital design environments",
    "abstract": "Advanced computer systems for 3D design and modelling are widely used in many areas of design and manufacturing. However, although they offer undoubted benefits, there is growing awareness of their inadequacy to meet the range of capabilities required by designers. Limited types of design representations can be created in the virtual environment. The precise, detailed geometric modelling techniques are unsuited to the earlier stages of design, and emphasise the creation and visualisation of three-dimensional form, rather than the more dynamic and functional aspects of working with materials. There is a discrepancy between the highly sophisticated three-dimensional models, and current ‘two-dimensional’ ways of interacting with them via mouse and screen. In most systems, a complex user interface requires extensive experience before it can be used transparently. Ways of interacting intuitively and expressively in three dimensions are now highly desirable. Rapid advances in digital technologies, such as haptic and gesture interfaces, 3D imaging, and more intuitive modelling techniques, offer us a means of moving away from the ‘desk-top box’ scenario to more fluid and flexible human-centred ‘digital design environments’. The potential of such technologies to allow a less constrained, more naturalistic interaction with virtual models has increased the drive towards computer support for the whole design process, in particular for conceptual design. To take full advantage of these developments, we must understand how the types of interaction they enable are, or could be, used in the design process. Existing systems have developed around the ‘design-by-drawing’ paradigm, but this does not adequately reflect the complexity, diversity and individuality of designers’ processes. To truly move forward, a radical re-evaluation is required.",

The overall purpose of this aspect of my research has been to examine the influences of a range of representative works of American and British video art that have been significant to the development of my own practice (either by direct influence, or because of their position within the cultural context in which I was working) and to gain insight into the context of my recent work through an understanding of the complex interrelationships between developing electronic imaging technology and cultural form. This historical and contextual research forms the background to the production and exhibition of the three installations that form the core of my project.",

    "abstract": "Notions of skill and sensitivity in fine art printmaking have been transformed by the new action and knowledge environments brought about by digital technologies. However, the off-the-shelf programs used in these environments are still influenced by an ideology that promotes the simulation of traditional techniques, which in turn prevent a move away from conventional forms of depiction. The ideological stance that drives these programs is problematic because it re-enforces out-dated artistic paradigms. In order to move beyond these paradigms, artists who work with digital technologies will need to be more critical of attempts merely to import techniques analogous to those used in traditional practice (e.g. processing applications that only provide a virtual equivalent to traditional painting, drawing, montage, and photographic methods) and will have to face down the tendency to mimic existing paint and print media. What we need for computer printmaking is the sort of interdependence and autonomy gained by an all-digital approach.",

    "abstract": "Is computation altering how humans conceive of themselves and their relations to others? In Talan Memmott's literary hypertext Lexia to perplexia, subjectivity is the product of recursive cycles between humans and intelligent machines. To develop this vision, Memmott uses a variety of techniques, including an idiosyncratic pseudo-language comprised of coding expressions combined with English words, classical myths rewritten using technological terms and images, and screen designs that invite the reader to understand herself as a permeable membrane through which information flows. A prominent feature of screen design is occluded text–words and symbols overwritten with other text so that they are only partially visible. This strategy serves to remind the reader that she is not the only parser of this text; the machine also parses it. In contrast to the partial reading available to the human reader, for the machine all the layers of code are operationally coherent and functionally clear. In this context reading becomes a cyborg activity, a practice that involves both human and non-human cognisers.",

Using a range of theoretical writers including Margaret Morse, Nell Tenhaaf, Simon Penny, Brenda Laurel and Sue-Ellen Case, the article traces contemporary thought on femininity, technology and voice. Gilson-Ellis uses her own choreographic / poetic practice as examples in these discussions. Through an adaptation of Sue-Ellen Case's proposal of the voudou vever and the loa, the article suggests that the voice in relation to writing and new technologies has a radical potential to open up alternative kinds of spaces in digital art practice.",

    "abstract": "Interactive drama has been discussed for a number of years as a new AI-based interactive experience. While there has been substantial technical progress in building believable agents and some technical progress in interactive plot, no work has yet been completed that combines plot and character into a full-fledged dramatic experience. Part of the difficulty in achieving interactive drama is due to the lack of a theoretical framework guiding the exploration of the technological and design issues surrounding it. This paper proposes a theory of interactive drama integrating Laurel's Aristotelian structural model with Murray's concept of agency. The resulting theory illuminates the general conditions under which a user will experience agency in any interactive experience and provides design and technology guidance for the particular case of building interactive dramatic worlds.",

    "abstract": "This research project seeks to identify the points in the new materials/pedagogic production and application at which a student's perception and expectation of pedagogic interface design, navigation and learning activities are judged/mapped against their real-world experience. It asks whether, on the basis of this observation, new approaches to teaching and learning material design should be adopted, and what these new approaches should be if the materials produced are to satisfy expectations while enhancing the students' generic and transferable skills base. This paper describes the author's involvement as a developer with the Higher Education Funding Councils' initiative into computers and learning. It outlines some of our attempts to investigate a genuinely student-centred approach to the production of an exemplar for computer-assisted musical courseware in the HEI. It asks two main questions: 1. what range of approaches to music-based courseware design might be employed; 2. how do we chart student perceptions, expectations and evaluation of instructional courseware and the computer as an interface? The paper provides a brief overview of the project in practical terms, it considers pedagogic and cultural implications, and it outlines the methodological enquiry and application, including examples of visual data and commentary. It concludes with an interpretation of the interim findings, and identifies directions for further research.",

    "abstract": "A small country was ruled by a dictator from a strong fortress, situated in the middle of the country and surrounded by farms and villages. Many roads let to the fortress. The general knew that an attack by her entire army would capture the fortress and gathered her army at the head of one road, ready to launch a full-scale direct attack. However, she then learned that the dictator had planted mines on each of the roads. The mines were set so that small bodies of men could pass over them safely, since the dictator needed to move his troops and workers to and from the fortress. However, any large force would detonate the mines. Since this would not only blow up the road, but also destroy neighbouring villages, capturing the fortress seemed impossible. However, the general devised a simple plan. She divided her army into small groups and dispatched each group to the head of one road. When all was ready she gave the signal and each group marched down a different road so that the entire army arrived together at the fortress simultaneously. In this way, the general captured the fortress and overthrew the dictator. 1",

    "abstract": "Until recently, most video-game characters did not reflect our everyday life for the simple reason that most of them were trolls, aliens, and monsters. However, this has changed since the introduction of The Sims (Wright 2000), the people simulator. Nevertheless, characters in this game are still flat since The Sims simulates life in a Disneyland-like way, avoiding ideological conflicts. Encouraged by authors like Brenda Laurel and Janet Murray, video-game designers have been taking for granted that a high level of agency and immersion are desirable effects. However, I will show that alternative, non-Aristotelian techniques could be used to develop character-driven video games that enhance critical thinking about ideological issues and social conflicts while keeping the experience enjoyable. I will do this by borrowing some concepts from Bertolt Brecht's and Augusto Boal's ideas on non-Aristotelian theatre and applying them to video-game design. In this paper, I propose that a modified version of The Sims would allow players to create behavioural rules for their characters that reflect their personal opinions. Like in Boal's Forum Theatre, this game would foster critical discussion about social and personal problems.",

However during the development of the research my interest in the process of the creative activity and its role in the forming of subjectivity replaced the focus on the characteristics of digital art and their effect on subjectivity. 3.

    "title": "Beyond the icon: the role of the image in human computer interface (HCI) design",
    "abstract": "If we examine communication we see the origins of some of the most fundamental systems of reconciling experience. Primarily, it is our systems of classification and categorisation that allow us to objectify the world and assign names to ‘collections’ of experience. Such ordering has resulted in the isolation and establishment of a basic unit of communication, the sign. However, the sign can never be the original, as communication inherently involves taking aspects of experience and converting them into a different form that merely re-presents the original. Pierce describes the different association of a sign to ‘its object’ as either an icon, index or symbol (Figure 1). An icon refers to a sign that resembles its object in some way, such as a picture of a fire. An index is related to its object by an existential connection, in the way smoke is associated with a fire and finally the word ‘fire’ itself is a symbol, as we have learned to understand it through convention.",

    "abstract": "It is relatively stress-free to write about computer games as nothing too much has been said yet, and almost anything goes. The situation is pretty much the same when it comes to writing about games and gaming in general. The sad fact with alarming cumulative consequences is that they are under-theorized; there are Huizinga, Caillois and Ehrmann of course, and libraries full of board game studies,in addition to game theory and bits and pieces of philosophy – most notably those of Wittgenstein – but they won't get us very far with computer games. So if there already is or soon will be a legitimate field for computer game studies, this field is also very open to intrusions and colonisations from the already organized scholarly tribes. Resisting and beating them is the goal of our first survival game in this paper, as what these emerging studies need is independence, or at least relative independence.",

    "abstract": "Presently, designers of interactive narratives and video games have only a slender understanding of the aesthetic experiences their audiences and users seek. Using schema theory, this study articulates the two varieties of aesthetic pleasures that users of interactive works enjoy: immersion and engagement. It uses schema theory to define the characteristics of immersion and engagement in both conventional and new media. After examining how readers' experiences of these two different aesthetics may be enhanced or diminished by interface design, options for navigation, and other features, the essay concludes by looking beyond immersion and engagement to 'flow', a state in which readers are both immersed and engaged.",

    "title": "Need I repeat myself? Non-repeating computer-aided designs for printed textiles",
    "abstract": "Historically, repeating patterns have been a technological and commercial restraint of mass-produced printed textiles. However, we have a natural desire to find, or make, patterns and order in many aspects of our visual lives, making many repeating patterns pleasing to the eye. Now that the technology has the capability to produce lengths of fabric directly from computer to ink-jet printer, both the technological and commercial restraints are being lifted. This paper addresses the possibilities for non-repeating patterns on fabric, investigating both the practicalities and design considerations through the use of examples created in my own practical research. As the designer and programmer of the software I have been able to produce designs which look intriguingly like they may repeat, but in fact, never do.",

    "abstract": "The Virtual gallery of contemporary jewellery CD-Rom (VGCJ) is a series of curated exhibitions, contributing to, and arising from academic papers on key themes about cutting-edge design, trends, and innovations in jewellery. This paper records the development of the conceptual design of the gallery. It tells the story, not of the design process, but of the key design decisions, and the theoretical and practical considerations behind them, that transformed the initial concept into the reality of a final product. The project looked at the potential of new technology to approximate presentation and display, and one of the driving issues in the design was the primacy and authenticity of the object. By focussing on the issues relating to museums and museum display theory the project arrived at a solution that was shaped by these issues, rather than being driven by the technology. The final design represents a synergy between the salient features of a museum and gallery visit, an academic print publication, and a museum catalogue.",

Two case studies illustrate aspects of the visualisation of virtual environments: how authenticity in computer reconstructions is reduced to their visuality, and how historically-based VR environments as copies honour their original. The paper asks for more implementation of life forms into architectural settings, and also examines the impact of user expectations on the VR experience.",

    "abstract": "Computer and video games are blurring the boundaries of such categories as play, narrative, space, entertainment and art. Games are, if anything, a form of popular art. They present us with a particular kind of problematic regarding narrative and aesthetics. The article discusses computer and video games in the context of the cultural history of the moving image. The focus is on one type of games in particular. This is the game genre known as 'first-person shooter' (FPS), which became hugely popular with Doom (1994) and has spawned numerous other popular games (e.g. the Quake and the Unreal series). Pre-cinematic devices and techniques, special effects, 'cinema of attraction', and theories of visuality serve as points of reflection. The differences between games and narratives are also discussed. Games are situated between the paths of two aesthetic disciplines: aesthetics of the moving image (film, television, video) and aesthetics of the environment (landscapes, architecture, space). The formulations presented in the article help us to understand the inter-dependent nature of virtual environments and their users. In this way, they light the way towards understanding new media from an aesthetic perspective.",

    "abstract": "At 8.00 am one Thursday in August I was arriving at a conference session – a two and a half hour presentation and workshop on ‘Life drawing and 3D figure modelling with Maya’ which was part of the educators program. By that time the career centre and pathfinders station were already open. About to start were: an educator session (curricular modules), an educator paper/workshop (classical animation), two parallel panel sessions (interactive entertainment and non-linear animation), two parallel paper sessions (measurement and presentation and meshes), and four parallel sketches and application sessions (deformable objects, haptics, narrative gestures and image-based rendering). In an hour’s time the three animation theatres, the art gallery, the creative applications lab and the emerging technologies studio will all open for the day. By 10.00 am 126,400 square feet of trade exhibition will be open again, allowing 303 companies to offer re v ie w another seven hours of state-of-the-art hardware and software demonstration and exploration. Unusually my session was limited to 200 delegates and this proved to be because only (sic) 200 dedicated workstations running Maya were available for our use. It was the start of the fifth day of SIGGRAPH 2001 in Los Angeles. The rest of the day would include four educator forums, two exhibitor forums, one educator workshop, ten panel sessions, five paper sessions, ten sketches and applications sessions, a number of ‘birds of a feather’ meetings and one ‘special’ session. Coaches would later take delegates to the evening’s electronics theatre at The Shrine (where this year’s Oscar ceremony was held) ending at 9.00 p.m. and for the hardy the paper and panels reception would continue until 11.00 p.m. Subjects through the day would include: ‘VIPs’ (virtually invented people), ‘The teaching of computer graphics in an art and design curricu-",

    "abstract": "This project looks at virtual reality (VR) as a mode of displaying history in museums. It focuses on CAVE technology, a form of immersive VR, and examines how current CAVE presentations based on digital reconstructions of buildings and landscapes mediate the historic past. The project is partly based on observations from the use of the CAVE at the Foundation of the Hellenic World (FHW) in Athens, Greece. A special emphasis is placed on the digital reconstruction of ancient cities now in ruins. Miletus, an Athenian and later a Roman colony on the coast of Asia Minor, is the first created so far and constitutes the focus of my investigation. The empirical material I have collected consists of data (video/audio tapes) recording group visits to the CAVE (both school and adult groups) in April 2000. The virtual tourists are ‘shown round’ a digital version of Roman Miletus of the 1st century AD by a museum educator. My analysis concentrates on: • the structure of the CAVE experience (the way information is verbally and visually communicated); • the patterns of producing and communicating knowledge (historical/archaeological discourses practiced within the general pedagogic framework of FHW).",

    "title": "Towards an aesthetic of 'the Interactive",
    "abstract": "The Interactive is situated in the discourse of the user/player and discussed here in terms of domains of engagement and cursality, each of which is defined by a tension between qualities within the domain and each of which is affected by a dynamic of learning and familiarity. In its inherently ergodic nature, that discourse exists as particular instances which may never be shared. In its inevitable narrativity, in its construction of meaning through fleeting fragments juxtaposed in time, and in its unique instance determined by selection and selection histories, this discourse is unlike that of other media and represents a distinct and different way of storying the world. Reference is made to several contemporary interactive artworks and the text concludes with a short but detailed critique using the ideas mapped out in the preceding text.",
