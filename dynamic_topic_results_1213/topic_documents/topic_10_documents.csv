"2000","Online Personal Networks"," Personal relationships are noted for intimacy, frequent interaction, the maintenance of multiple relations, face-to-face contact and a desire for proximity. What happens to such relationships when face-to-face contact is unavailable or severely limited? How do pairs maintain personal relationships at a distance and via computer-mediated communication, and what do their personal networks look like under these conditions? Social network data from four computer-supported distance learning classes are used to build a picture of the size and composition of students' personal online networks. Individuals reported on their communications regarding instrumental and social relations with others in their class, and on which media they used to maintain these relations. In keeping with social network studies, those who communicate more frequently maintain more relations and more socially supportive relations, and report more positively about their desire for future work and social interaction. Individuals benefit from closer ties by feeling a stronger belonging to the class and perceiving greater social interaction among class mates. Unique to the online multi-media environment, strongly tied pairs use more media to communicate and appropriate both the technology and occasions for interaction to maintain their ties. Interview data from members of the same program reveal that pairs with closer ties used computer media to create virtual proximity, whispering to each other via Internet Relay Chat during synchronous classes, and seeking out others via email late at night.

"2001","Exploring Multiplexity: Social Network Structures in a Computer-Supported Distance Learning Class","A computer-mediated group is a complex entity whose members exchange many types of information via multiple means of communication in pursuit of goals specific to their environment. Over time, they coordinate technical features of media with locally enacted use to achieve a viable working arrangement. To explore this complex interaction, a case study is presented of the social networks of interactions and media use among members of a class of computer-supported distance learners. Results show how group structures associated with project teams dominated who communicated with whom, about what, and via which media over the term, and how media came to occupy their own communication niches: Webboard for diffuse class-wide communication; Internet Relay Chat more to named others but still for general communication across the class; and e-mail primarily for intrateam communication. Face-to-face interaction, occurring only during a short on-campus session, appears to have had a catalytic effect on social and emotional exchanges. Results suggest the need to structure exchanges to balance class-wide sharing of ideas with subgroup interactions that facilitate project completion, and to provide media that support these two modes of interaction.","",""
"2002","Strong, Weak, and Latent Ties and the Impact of New Media","This article argues that consideration of the strength of ties between communicators can help reconcile disparate results on the impact of new media on social relations. It is argued from the research literature and studies by the author that where ties are strong, communicators can influence each other to adapt and expand their use of media to support the exchanges important to their tie, but where ties are weak, communicators are dependent on common, organizationally established means of communication and protocols established by others. Due to this differential use of media, a new medium that adds means and opportunities for previously unconnected others to communicate will have positive effects on weak ties and weak-tie networks, in particular by laying an infrastructure of latent ties (ones that exist technically but have not yet been activated), and providing an opportunity for weak ties to develop and strengthen. A new medium may also have positive effects on strongly tied pairs where it adds another means of communicating and supports the communication needs and tasks of the pair. However, where a new medium replaces a former, common means of communication, the dependence of weak ties on a common medium makes weak-tie networks highly susceptible to dissolution. In contrast, strong-tie networks, with their connections via multiple relations and multiple media, can be expected to be more robust under conditions of change.","",""
"2003","A social network caught in the Web","We present an analysis of Club Nexus, an online community at Stanford University. Through the Nexus site we were able to study a reflection of the real world community structure within the student body. We observed and measured social network phenomena such as the small world effect, clustering, and the strength of weak ties. Using the rich profile data provided by the users we were able to deduce the attributes contributing to the formation of friendships, and to determine how the similarity of users decays as the distance between them in the network increases. In addition, we found correlations between users' personalities and their other attributes, as well as interesting correspondences between how users perceive themselves and how they are perceived by others.","",""
"2004","‘I’ve Never Clicked this Much with Anyone in My Life’: Trust and Hyperpersonal Communication in Online Friendships"," Earlier research on online communication has observed how its distinctive characteristics (such as limited cues and potential asynchronicity) facilitate online communication, notably ‘hyperpersonal communication’. Yet these distinctive characteristics do not explain the development of trust in online communication. This article uses qualitative interviews with 17 internet users to explore the foundations of trust in online friendships, drawing on Piotr Sztompka’s theoretical framework. It concludes that there are four main sources of online trust. First, reputation, whether grounded in a pseudonym or offline identity. Second, performance, due to the scope for enhanced performance in online communication. More than this, performance plays an especially important role in the building of online friendship, following Giddens’ model of the pure relationship (1991). Third, pre-commitment, through self-disclosure, which in turn encourages a ‘leap of faith’ and reciprocal self-disclosure. Finally, situational factors, especially the premium placed upon intimacy and the pure relationship in contemporary societies. ","",""

The study found that: (1) people heightened their dependency relations with traditional mass media after September 11, regardless of whether or not they had an internet connection; (2) ‘internet high-connectors’ intensified their internet connections, while ‘internet low-connectors’ decreased the intensity of their internet connections; and (3) internet high-connectors participated in a broader range of civic activities in response to September 11 than did internet low-and non-connectors.

"2004","Social Interactions Across Media"," Two studies compared college students’ interpersonal interaction online, face-to-face, and on the telephone. A communication diary assessed the relative amount of social interactions college students conducted online compared to face-to-face conversation and telephone calls. Results indicated that while the internet was integrated into college students’ social lives, face-to-face communication remained the dominant mode of interaction. Participants reported using the internet as often as the telephone. A survey compared reported use of the internet within local and long distance social circles to the use of other media within those circles, and examined participants’ most recent significant social interactions conducted across media in terms of purposes, contexts, and quality. Internet interaction was perceived as high in quality, but slightly lower than other media. Results were compared to previous conceptualizations of the roles of internet in one’s social life. ","",""
"2005","Social networks and Internet connectivity effects","This paper explores the impact of communication media and the Internet on connectivity between people. Results from a series of social network studies of media use are used as background for exploration of these impacts. These studies explored the use of all available media among members of an academic research group and among distance learners. Asking about media use as well as about the strength of the tie between communicating pairs revealed that those more strongly tied used more media to communicate than weak ties, and that media use within groups conformed to a unidimensional scale, showing a configuration of different tiers of media use supporting social networks of different ties strengths. These results lead to a number of implications regarding media and Internet connectivity, including: how media use can be added to characteristics of social network ties; how introducing a medium can create latent tie connectivity among group members that provides the technical means for activating weak ties, and also how a change in a medium can disrupt existing weak tie networks; how the tiers of media use also suggest that certain media support different kinds of information flow; and the importance of organization-level decisions about what media to provide and promote. The paper concludes with a discussion of implications for Internet effects.","",""
"2005","Weak Ties in Networked Communities","Communities with high levels of social capital are likely to have a higher quality of life than communities with low social capital. This is due to the greater ability of such communities to organize and mobilize effectively for collective action because they have high levels of social trust, dense social networks, and well-established norms of mutuality (the major features of social capital). Communities with “bridging” social capital (weak ties across groups) as well as “bonding” social capital (strong ties within groups) are the most effective in organizing for collective action. People who belong to multiple groups act as bridging ties. When people with bridging ties use communication media, such as the Internet, they enhance their capability to educate community members and to organize, as needed, for collective action. This article summarizes evidence from stratified household survey data in Blacksburg, VA, showing that people with weak (bridging) ties across groups have higher levels of community involvement, civic interest, and collective efficacy than people without bridging ties among groups. Moreover, heavy Internet users with bridging ties have higher social engagement, use the Internet for social purposes, and have been attending more local meetings and events since going online than heavy Internet users with no bridging ties. These findings may suggest that the Internet—in the hands of bridging individuals–is a tool for enhancing social relations and information exchange, and for increasing face-to-face interaction, all of which help to build both bonding and bridging social capital in communities.","",""

These contacts are considered as examples of the activation of “latent ties” which are said to exist within communities with associated interests. The research indicates that the Internet facilitates the activation of these ties and that the degree to which it is used for this purpose is associated with academic rank.  ","",""
"2006","Social capital online: Collective use of the Internet and reciprocity as lubricants of democracy","This article puts the democratic potential of using the Internet into perspective through an analysis of how collective uses of the Internet promote social capital. Research results reveal that social capital online (i.e. trust and reciprocity) is enhanced by involvement in collective use of the Internet such as participation in online communities and use of the Internet among informal groups in everyday life. This process could counter negative aspects of Internet use. Further, accumulated online social capital can be a powerful predictor of online political participation, i.e. online reciprocity has a positive effect on intention to participate in online civic discussion. Finally, the authors' analyses indicate the possibility of a spillover of online social capital into offline arenas. It is concluded that collective use of the Internet can be a lubricant for democracy.","",""
"2006","The Quality of Online and Offline Relationships: The Role of Multiplexity and Duration of Social Relationships","Recent studies have shown that adolescents use the Internet not only to maintain social relationships with distant relatives and friends but also to create new relationships online; some of these friendships become integrated into their social circle. Research has focused mainly on the effect of the Internet on existing relationships or the nature of online-only ties, so studies comparing the quality of online and face-to-face relationships are missing. The goal of this study is to bridge this gap. In keeping with previous studies on social association, we argue that the quality of social relationships is dependent on duration and diversity of topics and activities carried together. Time is important, as it facilitates the development of a collective shared history and identity. Intimacy develops through the participation in shared activities and discussion of diverse issues of personal concern. Using a representative sample of the adolescent population in Israel, we find that closeness to a friend is a function of social similarity, content and activity multiplexity, and duration of the relationships. Friendships originated in the Internet are perceived as less close and supportive because they are relatively new and online friends are involved in less joint activities and less topics of discussion. The implications of the findings are discussed.","",""
"2006","Focused Activities and the Development of Social Capital in a Distributed Learning “Community”","This study examined the development of individual social capital in a distributed learning community. Feld's theory of focused choice predicts that the formation of network ties is constrained by contextual factors that function as foci of activities. In our research, we examined how group assignment and location could function as such foci to influence the development of individual social capital in a distributed learning community. Given that networks with different content flows may possess different properties, we examined two different types of networks—task-related instrumental networks and non-task-related expressive networks. A longitudinal research design was used to evaluate the evolution of networks over time. Hypotheses were tested using a sample of 32 students enrolled in a distributed learning class. The results show strong support for Feld's theory. While serving as foci of activities to organize social interactions, both group assignment and geographic separation can also function to fragment a learning community.","",""
"2006","Friends, Friendsters, and Top 8: Writing community into being on social network sites","“Are you my friend? Yes or no?” This question, while fundamentally odd, is a key component of social network sites. Participants must select who on the system they deem to be ‘Friends.’ Their choice is publicly displayed for all to see and becomes the backbone for networked participation. By examining what different participants groups do on social network sites, this paper investigates what Friendship means and how Friendship affects the culture of the sites. I will argue that Friendship helps people write community into being in social network sites. Through these imagined egocentric communities, participants are able to express who they are and locate themselves culturally. In turn, this provides individuals with a contextual frame through which they can properly socialize with other participants. Friending is deeply affected by both social processes and technological affordances. I will argue that the established Friending norms evolved out of a need to resolve the social tensions that emerged due to technological limitations. At the same time, I will argue that Friending supports pre-existing social norms yet because the architecture of social network sites is fundamentally different than the architecture of unmediated social spaces, these sites introduce an environment that is quite unlike that with which we are accustomed.","",""
"2006","The social support networks of internet users"," The available research indicates mixed results regarding the internet’s role in social relations. The article contributes to this research by studying the provision of support in egocentred social networks. Data regarding size, structure and communication channels were assessed through two specially designed surveys. The results show that the internet has a relatively limited impact on social relationships. Internet users have slightly larger social networks only in certain socially de-privileged segments (e.g. divorced, less educated). However, they reveal some specifics with respect to the structure of networks (more friends and less kin, weaker ties) and communication channels (typically the internet is used as a complement). The article also illustrates certain serious problems when drawing a causal inference from non-experimental data. ","",""
"2007","Reconfiguring Friendships: Social relationships and the Internet","Debate on the social role of the Internet has centred on whether its use will tend to isolate or connect individuals, undermining or reinforcing social ties. This study moves away from this focus on more or less connectivity to explore the degree to which people use the Internet to make new friends and, thereby, reconfigure their social networks. The analysis identifies those who create new ties through the Internet and investigates under what conditions these online ties migrate to face to face settings. The analysis is based on data from the 2005 Oxford Internet Survey (OxIS), a national probability sample survey of individuals aged 14 and over in Britain. The findings indicate that about 20 per cent of Internet users have met new friends online, and about half of these individuals go on to meet one or more of these virtual friends in person. Sociodemographic characteristics, such as being single, shape patterns of Internet use, and are related to the greater propensity of some individuals to make online social relationships. However, experience with the Internet and the ways people choose to use the Internet, such as for chatting or communicating more generally, are most directly associated with who makes new connections over the Internet and who does not. These findings suggest that the Internet plays an important role in reconfiguring the social networks of many users. Also, multivariate analyses indicate that the dynamics of online friendships are driven more by the idiosyncratic digital choices made by users of the Internet than by any mechanistic social or technological determinism.","",""
"2007","The dynamics of Web-based social networks: Membership, relationships, and change","Social networks on the Web are growing dramatically in size and number. The huge popularity of sites like MySpace, Facebook, and others has drawn in hundreds of millions of users, and the attention of scientists and the media. The public accessibility of Web&amp;#150;based social networks offers great promise for researchers interested in studying the behavior of users and how to integrate social information into&#x0D; applications. However, to do that effectively, it is necessary to understand how networks grow and change. Over a two&amp;#150;year period we have collected data on every social network we could identify, and we also gathered daily information on thirteen networks over a 47&amp;#150;day period. In this article, we present the first comprehensive survey of Web&amp;#150;based social networks, followed by an analysis of membership and relationship dynamics within them. From our analysis of these data, we present several conclusions on how users behave in social networks, and what network features correlate with that behavior.","",""
"2007","`Extending Society': the role of personal networks and gratification-utilities in the use of interactive communication media"," This study examined the relationship among personal network characteristics, gratification-utilities and the frequency of use of three interactive communication technologies (landline telephone, email and instant messaging). A conceptual framework is presented, providing a rationale for three hypotheses predicting positive relationships between personal network characteristics (size, intimacy and physical proximity), gratification-utilities and frequency of use.The participants were 286 college students, whom research shows are primary users of interactive media. Hypotheses 1 and 2, proposing a link between network characteristics and gratification-utilities with frequency of use, were supported, while Hypothesis 3, predicting a link between the prior two variables, was only partially supported. Frequency of use was associated more strongly with network characteristics than with gratification-utilities across the three technologies. Of the network characteristics, network size was significantly associated with gratification-utilities. Directions for future research are discussed. ","",""
"2008","PERSONAL NETWORKS AND THE PERSONAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEM","In contrast to technologically deterministic approaches that focus on how communication technology affects social relationships, this paper examines how individuals draw on a variety of commonly used communication media in conjunction with in-person contact to stay connected to their personal networks. I term this use of multiple communication media the ‘personal communication system’. Findings are based on a random sample telephone survey of 2200 adults living throughout the continental USA. Descriptive statistics show that despite the popularity of email and mobile phones, in-person and landline phone contact are still the most common ways of connecting with personal networks. Multivariate analysis reveals a more complex picture of media use, showing that the extent to which each medium is used varies to differing degrees with the size and diversity of personal networks. Hierarchical cluster analysis is used to explore the possibility that individuals may have different types of personal communication systems. Results show only two distinct clusters: those who draw heavily on all types of media to connect with their personal networks and those who draw less heavily on all types of media. Heavy communicators typically have larger and more diverse personal networks than light communicators. When taken together, the results presented in this paper suggest that rather than radically altering relationships, communication technology is embedded in social networks as part of a larger communication system that individuals use to stay socially connected.","",""
"2008","HOW LOCALITY, FREQUENCY OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERNET USAGE AFFECT MODES OF COMMUNICATION WITHIN CORE SOCIAL NETWORKS","The number of ways that people communicate with their social networks has changed dramatically in the last 50 years. Traditionally, the local community was the basis for people's social interactions; most of people's closest friends resided locally and face-to-face communication was the predominant mode of communication. Yet, today face-to-face meetings are no longer the primary way to communicate as one can use a landline telephone or any number of the computer mediated communications such as email. This paper explores the modes of communication rural individuals use most often with their three closest friends and how these modes of communication vary by three factors: (1) social tie locality, (2) frequency of communication, and (3) degree of Internet usage. Using a 2005 random sample mail survey of 1,315 residents in an isolated region of the Western United States, the results show that people actively use email to maintain core social networks, particularly when alters live at a distance. However, contradictory to previous research, the results suggest that increases in Internet usage are associated with decreases in other modes of communication, with proficiency of Internet use serving as a mediating factor in this relationship.","",""
"2008","Text in social networking Web sites: A word frequency analysis of Live Spaces","Social networking sites are owned by a wide section of society and seem to dominate Web usage. Despite much research into this phenomenon, little systematic data is available. This article partially fills this gap with a pilot text analysis of one social networking site, Live Spaces. The text in 3,071 English language Live Spaces sites was monitored daily for six months and word frequency statistics calculated and compared with those from the British National Corpus. The results confirmed the existence of common domain-specific words and a marked personal focus. Unexpectedly, however, there was no evidence of an unusual degree of experimentation with new words or word spellings – perhaps this behaviour is limited to other social networking environments. Also surprising was the existence of a marked male gender bias in the most commonly used words. This was probably caused by a significant number of news-related discussions involving predominantly male politicians and other male public figures.","",""
"2008","Examining social media usage: Technology clusters and social network site membership","The popularization of “social media” has raised questions of how and why young people use these various technologies in their daily lives. This exploratory study proposes a classification system based on Rogers’ concept of technology clusters, which posits that likelihood of adoption is based around similar perceived characteristics of a technology or medium. Results from a survey administered to 401 undergraduates at a large southern university indicated that social and non-social technology cluster use is correlated with psychological, affective, and behavioral factors (extroversion, self-disclosure, computer anxiety and self-efficacy). One particularly popular type of “many to many” social media is the social network site (SNS). MySpace members were significantly more likely to use both other many-to-many social technologies as well as one-to-many. Gender differences were also found, as MySpace members were more likely to be female, and females had significantly higher levels of extroversion and self-disclosure. Implications for future research, marketing efforts, and online safety are discussed.","",""

While there is variation in the types of information provide within profiles, many medical students seem unaware of or unconcerned with the possible ramifications of sharing personal information in publicly-available online profiles even though such information could impact their professional lives. Thus, this study provides data based evidence that online tools such as social networking sites should become a part of the dialogue related to preparing future physicians to meet the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education (ACGE) professionalism competency.","",""

This article explores teenagers' practices of social networking in order to uncover the subtle connections between online opportunity and risk. While younger teenagers relish the opportunities to recreate continuously a highly-decorated, stylistically-elaborate identity, older teenagers favour a plain aesthetic that foregrounds their links to others, thus expressing a notion of identity lived through authentic relationships. The article further contrasts teenagers' graded conception of `friends' with the binary classification of social networking sites, this being one of several means by which online privacy is shaped and undermined by the affordances of these sites.

This study uses media niche theory to consider: changes in patterns of media use across time, which modalities tend to be used in association with other modalities; and the association between specific modalities and relational closeness. Data assessing modality usage and degree of friendship closeness were collected on best friendship pairs in 1987 and 2002. The results suggest that postal mail use has declined between 1987 and 2002, telephone contact has become a particularly potent predictor of relational closeness, and face-to-face contact is a less stable indicator of closeness. Intimacy and efficiency or convenience emerge as two potentially important constructs for understanding how modalities are used for maintaining relational closeness. ","",""

Specifically, asynchronous online communication and offline communication stimulated by online communication had direct positive paths to social interaction and social support which, in turn, were both predictive of healthier or lower levels of stress and depression. These findings support previous research, which has indicated positive associations between mass media use and social capital and between social capital and health outcomes. In contrast, internet information-seeking by information type had a negative direct path to social support and negative indirect paths to stress and depression, indicating that information-seeking online has a detrimental impact on social capital and the health indicators.

"2009","TUNES THAT BIND?","Despite the popularity of social network sites based on common interests, the association between these shared interests and relational development is not well understood. This manuscript reports results of an empirical investigation of interpersonal relationships on Last.fm, a music-based social network site with a multinational user base. In addition to baseline descriptors of relational behavior, the chief goals of this study were to examine the degree to which Last.fm relationships are characterized by homophily (and particularly by shared musical taste), the extent to which communication via Last.fm is associated with other forms of communication (both offline and online), how such communication behavior is associated with demographic and relational characteristics, and whether these variables predict strength of relational development. Results indicate that although Last.fm relational partners exhibit shared musical taste, this shared taste is not associated with relational development. Rather, following media multiplexity theory, relational development is strongly and uniquely associated with communication behavior across almost all forms of communication (including Last.fm). These results suggest that shared interests may foster the creation of weak ties, but conversion of these connections to strong ties is relatively rare.","",""

The demonstrations were carried out in response to the introduction of Facebook’s ‘News Feed’ and ‘Mini-Feed’ pages which greeted users upon signing in and presented a wealth of information about their friends and their online activities, seemingly without any form of privacy control. The pages even listed details of personal relationships and sexual orientations; both highly contentious issues. The response to this perceived intrusion on users’ privacy was staggering. Groups were set up overnight to pillory the Facebook News Feed, massive petitions that numbered hundreds of thousands were set up across international boundaries, online blogs and message boards became filled with incandescent comments.Eventually, Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook’s founder and himself a former Harvard student) was forced to issue a public apology and then amend the News Feed to allow users the opportunity to edit their privacy settings. No longer would such information be so publicly accessible. No longer would privacy be taken so lightly. The student body used the very means by which they were being surveilled (that is, the cyber-synoptic infrastructure of the Facebook network) to organize an internationally resistant movement to support their right to privacy. This confrontation provides an engrossing example of the World Wide Web being used as a powerful tool to mobilize many bodies against a perceived force of oppression and subjugation. This was a clear demonstration that the politics of surveillance (Haggerty 2006) and the politics of the self matter greatly in present climes; where issues of privacy and the sanctity of the virtual realm are never far from the headlines. As such, it provides an excellent empirical backdrop to a conceptual analysis of resistance-through-distance and resistance-through-persistence (Collinson 1994) in the virtual realm.","",""
"2009","Gaydar: Facebook friendships expose sexual orientation","Public information about one's coworkers, friends, family, and acquaintances, as well as one's associations with them, implicitly reveals private information.  Social-networking websites, e-mail, instant messaging, telephone, and VoIP are all technologies steeped in network data—data relating one person to another.  Network data shifts the locus of information control away from individuals, as the individual's traditional and absolute discretion is replaced by that of his social-network.  Our research demonstrates a method for accurately predicting the sexual orientation of Facebook users by analyzing friendship associations.  After analyzing 4,080 Facebook profiles from the MIT network, we determined that the percentage of a given user's friends who self-identify as gay male is strongly correlated with the sexual orientation of that user, and we developed a logistic regression classifier with strong predictive power.  Although we studied Facebook friendship ties, network data is pervasive in the broader context of computer-mediated communication, raising significant privacy issues for communication technologies to which there are no neat solutions.","",""

Our qualitative data reveal consumers derive a combination of functional value along with either social or emotional value from the applications. Female Facebook users indicate self-expression as important motivators, while males tend to use Facebook applications to socially compete.   Three broad categories emerged for application features; symmetrical features can both encourage or discourage recommendation, polar features where different levels of the same feature encourage or discourage, and uni-directional features only encourage or discourage but not both.  Recommending or not recommending an application tends to be the result of a combination of features and context, rather than one feature in isolation.","",""

The term Wikidentities is used in this paper to encapsulate the kinds of identity work which may occur through SNS. We argue that wiki-like behaviour has consequences for reconceptualizing identity as something that is mediated by (rather than at odds with) technology. Our research opens up ways for considering new forms of agency for young people appropriate to a high-tech era that encourages collaboration, negotiation, and risk.","",""

The report quickly became a media sensation and was picked up by hundreds of news outlets in a matter of days. However, the results were based on correlational data in a draft manuscript that had not been published, or even considered for publication. This paper attempts to replicate the results reported in the press release using three data sets: one with a large sample of undergraduate students from the University of Illinois at Chicago, another with a nationally representative cross sectional sample of American 14- to 22-year-olds, as well as a longitudinal panel of American youth aged 14-23. In none of the samples do we find a robust negative relationship between Facebook use and grades. Indeed, if anything, Facebook use is more common among individuals with higher grades. We also examined how changes in academic performance in the nationally representative sample related to Facebook use and found that Facebook users were no different from non-users.","",""

Both sex and geographic distance differences emerged on these factors and all factors except asynchronous private communication predicted friendship interdependence. These findings clarify underlying patterns of media use and suggest that both privacy and orality are salient properties delineating media types. ","",""

The making and maintaining of friendships has been shown to be particularly important to young adults, but there is a strong debate in the literature on computer-mediated communication about the value of the often weak ties that are created. Relatively little is known about the kind of contact that is made on Facebook in the UK context. This study interviewed 16 second-and third-year undergraduates who all joined Facebook soon after it was launched in UK universities in October 2005.

Such friendship can shift to other settings. For example, many online friends also meet each other face-to-face. Therefore, online friendship can be performed in different social spaces. The relationship between online friendship and the social spaces where it is performed has rarely been discussed. Based on a study of seafarer-partners’ friendships formed on a discussion website, this paper demarcates friendship performed in three different spaces: the website itself, another online setting, and offline space. It suggests that the more spaces the friendship expands into, the more intimate and rewarding it becomes. This paper also explores the implications of each setting for maintaining performing friendship.","",""
"2010","HOW OFFLINE GATHERINGS AFFECT ONLINE COMMUNITIES","This paper builds on past studies of virtual community by illuminating the effect of offline gatherings (‘meetups’) on physically dispersed virtual communities. Although research to date has examined the way in which online interaction affects offline community, the question of how offline interaction affects online community has largely been ignored. On the one hand, these offline gatherings may provide individual benefits for members as the development of relationships strengthens social ties, leading to the creation of bonding social capital. However, these gatherings do not necessarily benefit the community at large as the resources found in weak ties may be sacrificed as attendees favour interaction with one another to the detriment of those that do not attend meetups. Non-obtrusive analysis of over eight years of user activity from a large, active online community suggests that the development of multiplex relationships – relationships maintained both online and offline – enhances attendees’ engagement with the online community as a whole, strengthens ties to other attendees, and contributes to the creation of bonding social capital. However, weak ties with non-attendees dissolve and bridging social capital is sacrificed as those who meet offline favour interaction with other attendees.","",""
"2010","PREDICTORS AND CONSEQUENCES OF DIFFERENTIATED PRACTICES ON SOCIAL NETWORK SITES","Applying a typology of social network site (SNS) usage that takes into consideration the intensity with which people use such sites, this piece offers an empirical investigation of how users' social practices on SNSs differ and whether different levels of engagement have consequences for academic performance. We rely on a unique survey-based data set representing a diverse group of young adults to answer these questions. We find, not surprisingly, that the more intense users of such sites engage in more social activities on SNSs than those who spend less time on them and only use one such site. This finding holds in the realm of both stronger-tie activities and weaker-tie activities, that is, social practices involving one's close friends as well as less established ties. Our analyses suggest gender differences in level of engagement with SNS social practices. Women pursue more stronger-tie activities than men, such as interacting with existing friends. In contrast, women engage in fewer weaker-tie activities than men, such as developing new relationships on such sites. However, neither SNS usage intensity nor social practices performed on these sites is systematically related to students' academic performance, findings that challenge some previous claims to the contrary.","",""

"2010","Emotion homophily in social network site messages","Social network sites (SNS) like MySpace seem to play a role in friendships and wider relationships for many people. Emotion expression can be important in relationship maintenance but little is known about the role of emotion in SNSs, other than positive comments being widespread in MySpace. But is emotion typically reciprocated, and do Friends express and/or receive similar levels of emotion expression to each other? Based upon an analysis of over two million MySpace public comments associated with 2,990 pairs of UK and US Friends using a sentiment detection program, statistically significant evidence was found for a weak correlation between the strength of positive emotion exchanged between Friends and received by Friends. This is consistent with two separate hypotheses: members tend to Friend others with similar levels of public emotion expression, or the expression of emotion in MySpace is contagious. The results may help to identify non-optimal behaviour and at-risk individuals in SNSs.","",""

In doing so, this investigation focuses on two dimensions of social networking site use frequency (i.e., how often people use social networking sites) and amount (i.e., how much time people spend on social networks). Integrating the technology acceptance model with uses and gratification and other consumer characteristics, this study found that interpersonal utility, perceived ease of use, privacy concerns, and age predict the frequency of social networking site use. Interpersonal utility motive, escape motive, and Internet experience explain the time spent on social networking sites.","",""

Japanese engagement with SNS (social networking sites) in the global age"," Much has been written about how social networking sites (SNS) have provided new avenues for self-expression, connectivity and ‘self-creation’ among young people, but few pay due attention to geographical and cultural variations. This article takes up the Japanese case by analysing how its youths engage with SNS, like MySpace and Mixi, within a framework of ‘audience engagement’ that encompasses the multiple dimensions of audience activities. Drawing on an ethnography of Japanese youths living in the media-rich Tokyo Metropolitan Area, this article discusses the following four dimensions of audience engagement: information-seeking activity, connectivity, bricolage and participation. While it is neither all about me in MySpace nor all about us in Mixi, it is suggested that MySpace is about me and them and Mixi is about me with them. Japanese young people reflexively create and re-create themselves in everyday life with to-ing and fro-ing in the spectrum between two different cultural values, via SNS. ","",""
"2010","Trends in online social networking: adolescent use of MySpace over time"," MySpace has received a significant amount of negative attention from the media and many concerned adults, who point to several isolated incidents where predators have contacted, become involved with and even assaulted adolescents whom they met through the popular social networking web site. Furthermore, concerned parents have expressed discontent with the amount and type of personal and private information youth seem to reveal on their profile pages. In 2006, the authors performed an extensive content analysis of approximately 2423 randomly sampled adolescent MySpace profiles, and found that the vast majority of youth were making responsible choices with the information they shared online. In this follow-up study, the authors revisited the profiles one year later to examine the extent to which the content had changed. Though exceptions occur, youth are increasingly exercising discretion in posting personal information on MySpace and more youth are limiting access to their profile. Moreover, a significant number of youth appear to be abandoning their profiles or MySpace altogether. ","",""

Although some have argued that internet use may erode an individual’s social capital, this study found that people who access the internet for online community use tend to have more sociability and higher levels of generalized norm than do online community non-users.When important socio-psychological factors of social capital, such as trust and life contentment, were considered, however, social capital was not fully related to online community use. In this regard, it is suggested that online communities may enhance the communication ability of individuals due to technological advantages, but face-to-face communication in the form of the traditional community is still essential to ensure the quality of community as a whole.","",""
"2011","CORE NETWORKS, SOCIAL ISOLATION, AND NEW MEDIA","Evidence from the US General Social Surveys (GSS) suggests that during the past 20 years, people have become increasingly socially isolated and their core discussion networks have become smaller and less diverse. One explanation offered for this trend is the use of mobile phones and the Internet. This study reports on the findings of a 2008 survey that replicates and expands on the GSS network methodology to explore the relationship between the use of new technologies and the size and diversity of core networks. The findings conflict with the results of the 2004 GSS, i.e. we find that social isolation has not increased since 1985. However, the current study supports the conclusions that the size of core networks has declined and the number of nonkin in core networks has diminished. Mobile phone and Internet use, especially specific uses of social media, were found to have a positive relationship to network size and diversity. In discussing these trends, we speculate that specific social media provide for a ‘pervasive awareness’ within personal networks that has increased the specialization of close ties. We argue that this same pervasive awareness provides for heightened surveillance of network members, the result of which is a higher level of perceived diversity within networks based on metrics that include political affiliation.","",""
"2011","THE USE OF ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKING BY RURAL YOUTH AND ITS EFFECTS ON COMMUNITY ATTACHMENT","In recent years, an increasing amount of attention has been placed on improving access to Information and Communication Technology in the United States. With the rapidity at which broadband construction projects are dotting America, it is important to understand the social impacts of these infrastructural projects. One particularly salient issue is whether access to the Internet would decrease the involvement of youth in their home communities since youth and issues of talent retention are crucial to the long-term viability of rural communities. However, findings on this topic have been a mixed bag with some studies suggesting that the use of online social networking decreases community involvement while others have found that it may maintain or even increase community involvement. This study set out to clarify the conflicting findings and in the process, it has found support for both the displacement effect as well as an augmentation effect. The dual processes suggest that merely examining time spent on social networking sites does not provide a complete picture of the effects of Internet use on community involvement. The nature of the interactions and the participants in the online social networking also play an important role. For rural community leaders working towards the long-term viability of their communities, the findings suggest that efforts should be directed towards mitigating the displacement effects of Internet use while harnessing popular Internet applications such as social networking sites to augment the involvement that youth have in their home communities.","",""

Specifically, the present study investigates personal network composition, bridging and bonding social capital and relationship development of SNS users from the United States and Korea. Data were colleted via an online survey of 349 American and 240 Korean college students. Findings suggest that, although commonalities exist between the two groups, the use of SNSs for relational purposes and the resulting social capital and relationships are still culturally driven, reflecting the prevalent values and norms of the particular cultures in which the users belong. More specifically, American college students held larger but looser networks with a far greater portion of weak ties, whereas their Korean counterparts maintained smaller and denser networks with the roughly even ratio of strong and weak ties. American college students also reported obtaining more bridging social capital from their networks in SNSs than did their Korean counterparts, whereas the level of bonding social capital was not significantly different between the two groups. Finally, Korean respondents' relationships in their networks in SNSs were generally at a more advanced stage of development than their American counterparts.","",""
"2011","COMPARING BONDING AND BRIDGING TIES FOR DEMOCRATIC ENGAGEMENT","The structure of people's social networks predicts democratic engagement. However, the relative contribution of different types of social ties to civic and civil behaviors is unclear. This paper explores the role of core networks – bonding social capital – to the role of overall network diversity – bridging social capital – for participation in formal civic institutions and informal civil behaviors. Emphasis is placed on the possible role of heterogeneity within core networks – political disagreement and the presence of nonkin ties – and on frequency of interaction, in-person and mediated: mobile phone and the Internet. This study finds that overall network diversity is a more consistent and substantive predictor of civic and civil behaviors than the size or heterogeneity of the small number of ties that make up the core network of most people. The two dominant new media used to interact with core network members – email and mobile phones – are unrelated to any of the behaviors measured. Some other media – contact in-person, postal mail, texting, instant messaging, and social network services – have an inconsistent and modest relationship to civic and civil behaviors. Findings lead to speculation that political disagreement within core networks, typically associated with lower levels of political participation, has a spillover effect that results in other forms of democratic engagement. There is evidence of glocalization; contact with core ties using new media supports local civil and civic behaviors. Internet use largely supports democratic engagement through interaction with bridging, but not bonding ties.","",""

The results from a survey of 145 bloggers from 32 countries suggest that bloggers' self-disclosure tendencies and their inclination to target their content towards strong-tie networks are positively associated with the adoption of traditional self-disclosure norms when using blogs. Additionally, results indicate that while female bloggers expect others to acknowledge posts to their blogs, they do not feel obligated to acknowledge others' posts.","",""
"2011","SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS UPDATES","There are numerous indirect ways in which socioeconomic status (SES) can advantage or disadvantage people in developing social capital. Specifically, SES affects the access individuals have to beneficial resources that indirectly affects the social capital benefits individuals receive from personal and group social networks. With the advent of social network sites like Facebook, the ability to quantify and measure the effects of SES on social capital benefits is possible to a much greater degree than ever before. This study of undergraduate students focuses on the relationship between SES and social capital. We examine the relationship between SES and three structural measures of students' social capital using online social network data: general social capital (network size), bridging social capital (number of clusters), and bonding social capital (average degree). According to our results, higher SES relates to larger and denser networks, but not to networks with more clusters. These findings suggest that SES is not related to greater opportunities for networking, but better capitalization of existing network contexts. In addition to the novel substantive contribution, this paper offers a methodological advance in the structural study of social capital, which has previously been limited in size or complexity due to recall.","",""

Using a multinomial logistic model, I examine whether offline divides across gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, self-esteem, and social capital predict teenagers’ membership into the popular SNSs, Facebook and Myspace.  The results show that the characteristics of teens that use Facebook, Myspace, or both SNSs show distinct differences, which illuminate questions of digital divide and complex adolescent social practices as they relate to online participation.  The study offers two main contributions by providing an analysis of: (a) teenage SNS users, a population that is less examined in the research literature of online communities; and, (b) the relationship between their off-line characteristics and online social networks.","",""

Integrating these Internet tools into the college classroom, however, is not an easy task. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to examine the role of social networking in education and demonstrate how social network sites (SNS) can be used in a college classroom setting. To do this, existing research relating to SNS and education is discussed, and the primary advantages and disadvantages of using SNS in the classroom are explored. Most importantly, specific instructions and guidelines to follow when implementing SNS (i.e., Facebook) within the college classroom are provided. Specifically, we show that multiple types of Facebook course integration options are available to instructors. It is concluded that SNS, such as Facebook, can be appropriately and effectively used in an academic setting if proper guidelines are established and implemented.","",""

They are also being used actively by pet owners. Just as pet owners are different, we might expect their needs within a social network to differ. In this work, we present an analysis of dog– and cat–owners behavior in pet–oriented social networks. Our results show that dog and cat owners use these sites quite differently. While dog owners focus on their relationship with their pets and looking for advice, cat owners tend to use the site more to build community. Both results show that these pet social networks are already being used to help support the human–animal bond online, and that different types of pet owners would benefit from different types of support within the systems. We discuss the implications of these results for designing networks to support different types of users and what this means for the understanding of passion–based social networks.","",""

Survey data ( N = 450) from a random sample of undergraduate students reveal that only social information-seeking behaviors contribute to perceptions of social capital; connection strategies that focus on strangers or close friends do not. We also find that reporting more ‘actual’ friends on the site is predictive of social capital, but only to a point. We believe the explanation for these findings may be that the identity information in Facebook serves as a social lubricant, encouraging individuals to convert latent to weak ties and enabling them to broadcast requests for support or information.

We find that a limited set of technologies directly afford diversity, but many indirectly contribute to diversity by supporting participation in traditional settings such as neighborhoods, voluntary groups, religious institutions, and public spaces. Only one internet activity, social networking websites, was related to lower levels of participation in a traditional setting: neighborhoods. However, when direct effects were included, the total influence of social networking services on diversity was positive. We argue that a focus on affordances of new media for networked individualism fails to recognize the continued importance of place for the organization of personal networks: networks, that as a result of the persistent and pervasive nature of some new technologies, may be more diverse than at any time in recent history.

A survey was conducted among a random sample of 710 Chinese migrants in Singapore, to measure the extent the migrants participate in CMSS and to identify factors that affect their CMSS-seeking behavior. This study found that CMSS has become an efficient and valuable supplement to the migrants’ traditional/offline social support and that the migrants actively seek CMSS, especially in the early migration stage. Factors affecting CMSS-seeking behavior include length of migration, availability of traditional social support, and level of satisfaction resulting from the CMSS seeking experience. This study took the Uses and Gratifications theory from a different angle to look into the relationship between the level of satisfaction on the CMSS received and the possible continued seeking of CMSS.

It departs from a pre-defined network (in a secondary school in Flanders, Belgium) and investigates how friendship type and clique formation (an important dynamic in this (micro) context) are related to face-to-face communication (FTFC) and the use of email, instant messaging, text messaging, telephone and social network sites in this network. Hypotheses/expectations were derived from network theory and (qualitative and quantitative) studies on the social affordances of communication technologies for adolescents. Data were collected among the 78 pupils of a fourth grade (15–16-year-olds) in a Belgian secondary school. First, dyadic quadratic assignment procedure regression analyses were run to explain the frequency of FTFC and communication through different technologies by looking at dyad characteristics (strength of ties, number of friends in common, same sex…). Second, FTFC and communication through technologies were compared for in-group versus out-group ties. The analyses show that the patterns of FTFC were sometimes reproduced (and therefore extended), and sometimes deviated from in communication through technologies. The specific function each of the studied technologies fulfilled in relation to social structure (in this network) is addressed in the discussion.","",""

A particular focus is on the connectivity between different social spheres. It is hypothesized that the type and number of social spheres and technological features of SNS interact such that increased levels of social tension result. These ideas are supported by the findings from a survey study among Facebook users. Social diversity of the Facebook network predicted online tension as did the number of family members on Facebook, in contrast to work and social contacts. Furthermore, evidence was found to support the idea that tension might impose an upper limit on network size. Follow-up interview data also showed that online tension was predominantly about unwanted connectivity between the spheres. All the technological features that users reported as problematic focused on the easy access to and broadcast of text and pictures.

It tests the hypothesis that use of SNSs is related to higher levels of social capital. The results show that youth who use Facebook and Myspace report higher social capital in both their school and online relationships. In addition, the analysis suggests that distinct modes of SNS experiences are differentially related to bridging and bonding social capital. Time spent in SNSs is related to bridging capital, while positive or negative experiences are related to bonding capital.

Much less is known about the use of SNSs beyond the individual level and outside of the American context. This study fills in the gaps by offering insight into the personified use of interactive features on SNSs by organizations in China for branding purposes. Based on the notion of the social affordances of technologies, we conducted a content analysis of the presence and activities of 98 organizations on a popular Chinese SNS and identified 15 interactive features, including profile related features (e.g., status updates, discussion board, message forwarding) and social game related features (e.g., game players, raffles, virtual goods). The results of our statistical analysis indicated that the more interactive features that an organization used, the more page visits and fans it attracted and the more electronic word of mouth (eWOM) behavior occurred. All of these interactive features helped personify the organizations as friends to their fans, followers, service users, and potential customers, which created a new form of organization–public communication: sharing as “frands.”","",""

Building on theories addressing the social mechanisms of interactive or communicative technologies, we tested the postulation that the decision of individuals to participate in Facebook would be linked to their perceptions of how widely Facebook had been diffused either at large or among their off–line contacts. Regression analyses confirm this bandwagon tendency in Facebook participation. Moreover, multiple SNS users tended to use Facebook more than all other SNSs if they perceived that it penetrated their off–line contacts more widely. The results suggest that Internet users engage in SNSs to forge personal online networks in ways complying with real–world group proximity and their perception of the prevalence of adoption rather than making random or amorphous choices.","",""

Interestingly, a more pronounced positive effect was found for mobile-mediated discussion in larger networks of like-minded close ties. In this case, open dialogue was facilitated by mobile-mediated discussion, revealing potential for mobile communication among close personal ties to expand spheres of public discourse and deliberation.

Employing Expectancy Violations Theory (Burgoon, 1978) as a guiding framework, results from a series of focus groups suggest that both the content of the violation and the users’ relationship to the violator impact how individuals react to negative violations. Specifically, acquaintances who engage in minor negative violations are ignored or hidden, while larger infractions (that could negatively impact the individual) result in deletion of the offending content and – in extreme cases – termination of the Facebook friendship. Negative violations from close friends (that did not impact participants’ goals) resulted in confrontations, while similar violations from acquaintances were often ignored by participants in an effort to ‘keep the peace.’ Furthermore, positive violations were more likely to arise from acquaintances than close friends.

Comparing core networks in the United States, Norway, and Ukraine, we reject the conclusions that frequent in-person contact predicts individual well-being and that large/diverse networks predict broader societal well-being. Individuals of lower socioeconomic status (SES) and societies with lower levels of overall prosperity have higher rates of in-person contact. Internet use is associated with higher in-person contact for the socioeconomically advantaged but lower rates of in-person contact for the disadvantaged. In-person and ICT-based contact is generally associated with maintaining a larger network, but in societies of lower well-being frequent interaction impedes the ability to maintain a large network. In contrast to the positive relationship between individual SES and network size, societal prosperity has a negative relationship to network size. Findings are discussed in relation to social support, democratic engagement, and the digital divide.","",""

Along with new possibilities also come challenges – as professionals are engaging in real-time conversations with their audiences on Facebook, Twitter, blogs and the like, they have to learn to mentally cope with an oversupply of possibly relevant information, with an invasion of work matters into the private domain and with changing work contents and structures. This paper proposes a measurement routed in the technostress and overload research to assess these challenges brought to communication workforces by social media. These data were collected in a quantitative survey among 2,579 marketing and communication professionals. Based on an exploratory factor analysis, we demonstrate that being literate in an age of social media encompasses not only knowing how to retrieve and process information appropriately in various social settings, but also – and maybe more importantly – to mentally cope with overload, invasion and uncertainty.","",""

It draws upon recent research conducted by the authors in the UK in 20091 and in the Kingdom of Bahrain in 20102 (the first large-scale research study on young people and internet usage to be conducted in a country in the Middle East). A similar methodological approach was adopted in both studies, which included large random, stratified samples of young people aged 12–18 and focus groups with children aged 7 plus. Both studies investigated internet usage and online behaviours, definitions of risk, awareness of safety and use of SNS. In total, approximately 4,500 young people participated in the research, along with teachers, stakeholders and adults. Findings suggest that young people use digital media in much the same way regardless of the social and cultural contexts, but that culturally gendered perspectives place restrictions upon usage.","",""

The role of social capital in narrowing the digital divides has been frequently mentioned but few studies have empirically examined how various types of social capital may affect people's access and use of the Internet. Drawing on a two-wave national panel data set, this article aims to fill this gap. Results demonstrate that social capital facilitates Internet access and use. In particular resource-rich bonding social capital helps overcome the digital divides in access, general use, and online communication. Before the Internet can revitalize social capital, there must be the right social capital in place to close the digital divides. Highlighting the relationship between social connectivity and digital connectivity, the findings have important implications for policymakers and practitioners.","",""

Compared to social media users, non-adopters had less economic stability, more fractured educational trajectories, and weaker support from parents and friends. Non-adopters did not use social media because they lacked access or leisure time, were not socialized into their use, lacked skills, or did not want to maintain social contacts via social media technologies. If social media are increasingly used in attempts to to improve young people’s lives, practitioners must understand who is left behind in the wake of these technologies. ","",""
"2013","Friendship and trust in the social surveillance network","This article draws on findings from semi-structured interviews to investigate an important, and previously unexplored aspect of the social networking site Twitter, which is the ways that users can employ lateral surveillance to initiate friendships.  Social penetration theory (Altman and Taylor 1973) is used to investigate the ways that Twitter provides a platform to technologically augment friendship evolution.  Three consecutive phases of online surveillance are proposed, which are: unidirectional ‘studied’ following; ‘reciprocal’ following, when interaction between the user and the Tweeter only occurs online; and fully fledged friendship, when online relations are supplemented by offline meetings.  The visibility of users via their Tweets creates information that others can use to evaluate character in what might be considered a phase of pre-friendship screening, and that this also generates trust and solidarity prior to an offline meeting. Perceived similarity between the user and the Tweeter was contributory to an assessment of their worth as a potential friend.  Geographic proximity and ‘transferable trust’ were also factors that helped offline friendship to develop. Ultimately, Twitter was an important tool for sociality, and provided a wider source of potential friends than was available offline.","",""
"2013","Understanding the role of social media in online health: A global perspective on online social support","Around the globe, people are increasingly using social media for the provision of online social support. Online social support may be especially relevant for parents who have children that are afflicted with rare chronic diseases such as MECP2 Duplication Syndrome. Despite increasing evidence that online social support enhances a person’s psychological well-being, there is little research that seeks to understand how and why various forms of social media facilitate social support. This study develops a theoretical framework from the existing psychosocial and media theories that describes the relationship between social media and social support. This paper concludes with implications for health information systems design.","",""

The study further examined whether SNS usage moderates the relationship between smartphones and social capital. A cross-sectional survey data ( N = 339) from a random sample of university students was gathered. The results demonstrated that smartphone and SNS usage have direct effects on all social capital dimensions. In addition, the intensity of smartphone usage has an indirect effect on various social capital dimensions, except organizational participation. These results provide evidence that smartphone and SNS usage is not intrinsically harmful to one’s social capital and may in fact broaden social capital among its users. ","",""

However, the process through which social capital conversions occur is unclear. This study presents results from semi-structured interviews with 18 adult Facebook users (ages 25 to 55) about their Facebook use, focusing on how participants use the site to request and provide social support (associated with bonding social capital) and information (associated with bridging social capital). Findings describe how Facebook use facilitates interactions related to social capital and users’ beliefs about the potential negative outcomes of these interactions, providing insight into how users negotiate potential benefits and risks when making decisions about site use.

"2013","Media refusal and conspicuous non-consumption: The performative and political dimensions of Facebook abstention"," This paper is a study of consumer resistance among active abstainers of the Facebook social network site. I analyze the discourses invoked by individuals who consciously choose to abstain from participation on the ubiquitous Facebook platform. This discourse analysis draws from approximately 100 web and print publications from 2006 to early 2012, as well as personal interviews conducted with 20 Facebook abstainers. I conceptualize Facebook abstention as a performative mode of resistance, which must be understood within the context of a neoliberal consumer culture, in which subjects are empowered to act through consumption choices – or in this case non-consumption choices – and through the public display of those choices. I argue that such public displays are always at risk of misinterpretation due to the dominant discursive frameworks through which abstention is given meaning. This paper gives particular attention to the ways in which connotations of taste and distinction are invoked by refusers through their conspicuous displays of non-consumption. This has the effect of framing refusal as a performance of elitism, which may work against observers interpreting conscientious refusal as a persuasive and emulable practice of critique. The implication of this is that refusal is a limited tactic of political engagement where media platforms are concerned. ","",""

In contrast to much existing research on online friendship, this article takes on a software-sensitive approach. Through a close reading of various sociotechnical processes in which friendship is activated on Facebook (i.e., registering, making a profile, finding friends, communicating, etc.), this article suggests that friendships online need to be understood as a gathering of heterogeneous elements that include both humans and nonhumans. Moreover, this article attempts to show how the traditional notion of friendship as something created between equals and free of structural constraints does not apply to the realm of social networking sites, where software increasingly assists users in making certain choices about who will and who will not be their friends.

"2013","The Martini Effect and Social Networking Sites: Early adolescents, mobile social networking and connectedness to friends"," The Martini Effect refers to being constantly connected to people through mobile devices; research into mobile phone use reports that its use may be related to feelings of connectedness. Social Networking Sites (SNSs) are becoming increasingly popular among early adolescents with the majority using them to stay in contact with existing friends. In addition, many adolescents use a range of mobile devices to access these sites. The present study compared feelings of belonging to the friendship group between SNS users who used a mobile device and those who did not. A self-report questionnaire was completed by 337 early adolescent SNS users (11–13 years, mean age = 12.28 years, SD = 0.73). Mobile device users were found to have significantly higher levels of belonging than non-mobile device users and this relationship was partially mediated by the frequency of use of SNSs. It is suggested that these mobile devices not only afford an opportunity for increased use of SNSs and therefore increased interaction with friends but that mobile device SNS users feel constantly connected to their friends.

Facebook use was the strongest predictor of social support reception, even stronger than the number of strong ties, although its link to life satisfaction was not significant. Findings also demonstrated that gender difference in social support reception was not found in the context of social media and that fixed Internet use had a negative association with life satisfaction, whereas mobile Internet use had no such relationship.","",""

It examined the roles of two main variables—communication with influential others and social capital—for mediating social media use and relative deprivation. For this examination, a path model was tested through structural equation modeling (SEM). SEM results indicated that communication with influential others significantly and positively mediated the relationship between social media use and social capital—personal network and personal trust. Moreover, it could be found that social capital significantly reduced relative deprivation. These results indicate the considerable role of social media for reducing relative deprivation, helping the resolution of social problems related to relative deprivation.","",""

A follow-up interview study further revealed that the perceived benefits of online SC depend on both the type of FB interaction and the type of friendship, as well as a combination of situational circumstances and cultural background of the interviewee. This study also contributes to the study of cross-cultural social networking by employing and validating a scale for measuring online CCSC.","",""
"2014","Testing the validity of social capital measures in the study of information and communication technologies","Social capital has been considered a cause and consequence of various uses of new information and communication technologies (ICTs). However, there is a growing divergence between how social capital is commonly measured in the study of ICTs and how it is measured in other fields. This departure raises questions about the validity of some of the most widely cited studies of social capital and ICTs. We compare the Internet Social Capital Scales (ISCS) developed by Williams [2006. On and off the ’net: scales for social capital in an online era. Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 11(2), 593–628. doi: 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2006.00029.x] – a series of psychometric scales commonly used to measure ‘social capital’ – to established, structural measures of social capital: name, position, and resource generators. Based on a survey of 880 undergraduate students (the population to which the ISCS has been most frequently administered), we find that, unlike structural measures, the ISCS does not distinguish between the distinct constructs of bonding and bridging social capital. The ISCS does not have convergent validity with structural measures of bonding or bridging social capital; it does not measure the same concept as structural measures. The ISCS conflates social capital with the related constructs of social support and attachment. The ISCS does not measure perceived or actual social capital. These findings raise concerns about the interpretations of existing studies of ‘social capital’ and ICTs that are based on the ISCS. Given the absence of measurement validity, we urge those studying social capital to abandon the ISCS in favor of alternative approaches.","",""

Longitudinal effects of Internet use in adolescence","The article departs from an overarching research question: How does young people's engagement in different Internet spaces affect the development of their public orientation during adolescence? It analyses longitudinal panel data in order to explore how young people's public orientation develops during a phase in life (13–20) which is critical for political socialization. Data are derived from three waves of data collection among young people who were 13–17 years old at the time for the first data collection. The concept public orientation is measured by three indicators: young people's values, interests and everyday peer talk. These indicators are analysed with reference to respondents' Internet orientations, which we conceptualize as four separate but inter-related spaces (a news space, a space for social interaction, a game space and a creative space). The results primarily emphasize the importance of orientations towards news space and space for social interaction. Overall, the findings strongly suggest that orientations towards these spaces are related to adolescents' public orientation. The findings confirm the centrality of news and information in political socialization, but they also challenge the idea that social media facilities – such as Facebook, Twitter and blogging – enable forms of social interaction and creative production that have an overall positive impact on young people's public orientation.","",""

To assess these questions, group discussions, qualitative interviews ( n = 25) and an online survey ( n = 757) were conducted in Thailand and Austria. While all of the respondents use SNS for lifelogging – storing and sharing life experience – the perception of emotional third-place qualities of SNS varies among young people living in Thailand and Austria. The findings show that some effects related to emotional aspects of technology usage might result from the stage of diffusion of technology, while aspects of emotional experience and expression might be influenced by cultural models.

This project sought to explore network structure in these sites, and to explore trends in network structure by surveying participants about their use of sites and motivations for making connections. Social network analysis revealed that discipline was influential in defining community structure, while academic seniority was linked to the position of nodes within the network. The survey revealed a contradiction between academics use of the sites and their position within the networks the sites foster. Junior academics were found to be more active users of the sites, agreeing to a greater extent with the perceived benefits, yet having fewer connections and occupying a more peripheral position in the network.","",""

Specifically, these requests and the responses they receive can serve as a window into how, why, and with what results individuals turn to their Friends network for help. In this study, we synthesize the existing research on resource mobilization requests via Facebook and present new analyses of survey data collected from a random sample of Facebook users who have made any post in the past 28 days ( n = 573) and a sample of those who have posted a mobilization request in the past 28 days ( n = 1074). To identify mobilization requests, an automated classifier trained on a hand-labeled sample of public status updates was used. Using participants’ self-reported survey data and server-level behavioral data, we examine how mobilization request behaviors relate to perceptions of bridging and bonding social capital, participants’ perceptions of Facebook’s utility regarding these requests, and related variables such as engagement in Facebook Relational Maintenance Behaviors. We find that those who post mobilization requests on Facebook report higher social capital, are more likely to try to respond to Friends’ expressed needs, and tend to see the site as a better source of information, coordination, and networked communication.

Drawing on theories of relationship development, this study examined usage patterns among 34 college students participating in six geographically stratified focus group interviews. Analyses revealed a sequence of media use tied to stages of relationship development − from Facebook in early stages to instant messaging and then cell phones as a relationship progressed. Judgments about the efficacy and appropriateness of using a medium were based on how well its salient features matched prominent goals or addressed major concerns of a relationship at the given stage. International students added two technologies to the sequence to accommodate time differentials and distance from communication partners. Males were less explicit about the sequence, except when referring to cross-sex relationships. ","",""

Based on data from an online survey, the study examines the consumption of print media, radio, television, online news sites, and social media by Latvian users of three social networking sites. According to the findings, most of the surveyed social networking site users regularly consume other media, although they are more likely to consume online news media than print or broadcast media. However, those users who spend the most time on social networking sites do not exhibit much interest in other types of media. Thus, the main distinction among the surveyed individuals is not between online and traditional media use but rather between the use of social media and traditional/journalism-based media. These results are relevant to the discussions of the potential of social media to attract audiences for the mass media.","",""

Interviews (N = 227) with emerging adults from Wave 3 of the National Study of Youth and Religion reveal the boundary work emerging adults undergo to limit negative SNS interactions and how they navigate the dynamic and permeable boundaries between positive and negative interactions. This work includes following three informal rules meant to limit negative interactions: do not share excessive personal information, do not spy on or stalk other users, and make online friendships with people one already knows. Several important implications result from this boundary work: crossing boundaries can have negative offline and online consequences, following the informal rules helps stabilize SNS communities by limiting the potential and severity of harmful interactions, and SNS may be popular among emerging adults but some disenchantment is not uncommon and some emerging adults may not use SNS as a result.","",""

Television and other electronic media were therefore dismissed as having a potentially negative impact on social capital development. Based on an analysis of high-quality data and a rich variety of social capital indicators in the General Social Survey 2012, we assess the impact of two broad categories of screen time – internet and television – on both attitudinal and behavioural components of social capital. The results show that while watching television is either unrelated or negatively related to a range of social capital indicators, there is usually a positive relation between internet use (in various forms) and social capital indicators. This direct comparison of the impact of internet and television usage on social capital indicators in a nationally representative study challenges the expectation that television and other digital technologies would have a similar negative impact on social capital. The findings suggest that internet-based activities clearly play a positive role in the development of social capital despite the lack of in-person interaction, and the concluding discussion reviews avenues for future research to tease out causal mechanisms in the production of social capital in the digital age.","",""

Most studies have either examined issues surrounding the question whether or not new online contacts have been established or they have focused on the distinction between perceived bridging capital and bonding capital. Research has rarely focused on the kind of specific benefits that may arise due to the establishment of new online contacts. In this context, the study examines the specific forms of social capital which can be accessed via different social media (i.e. email lists, instant messaging, multiplayer games, weblogs and -forums, chat rooms, social networking sites and an own weblog). This article makes a distinction between the maintenance of existing contacts and the making of new contacts. Utilizing a random sample of Internet users from a major city in the Netherlands, we find that new online relationships do not always provide access to specific resources. But the type of social media employed for communication with new contacts has an influence on the provision (or non-provision) of access to resources and to the kind of resources which are accessed.","",""

Beyond feelings, people who speak of FOMO also speak of it as a behavior, most often as a compulsivity (related to what I characterize as conspicuous sociality) and as an illness to be remedied.

Communications on SNSs may be seen as simply an extension of on- and off-campus lives, and hence fall under the same policies governing institutional codes of conduct. The medium however, allowing for the capture and broadcast of events in academic and everyday lives, merits special considerations for contemporary faculty and administrators. The objective of this critical review is synthesize literature discussing dual relationships, context collapse, and digital persistence to contextualize and inform policy development regarding the use of SNSs in higher education.

A content-analysis of SNS research published in six interdisciplinary journals between 1997 and 2013 is first reported to better understand the degree to which studies published in these journals have examined various SNS brands (e.g. Facebook, MySpace, Cyworld, Hyves). The results show that more than two-thirds of SNS studies were explicitly limited to a single brand and that Facebook was the brand examined in approximately 80% of these studies. Five implications of this trend are then discussed as potentially limiting what can be learned in aggregate from such a body of SNS scholarship.

We conduct three separate analyses to triangulate on the phenomenon of reversion: simple quantitative predictors of reversion, factor analysis of adjectives used by respondents to describe their experiences of not using Facebook, and statistical topic analysis of free-text responses. Significant factors predicting either increased or decreased likelihood of reversion include, among others, prior use of Facebook, experiences associated with perceived addiction, issues of social boundary negotiation such as privacy and surveillance, use of other social media, and friends’ reactions to non-use. These findings contribute to the growing literature on technology non-use by demonstrating how social media users negotiate, both with each other and with themselves, among types and degrees of use and non-use.

"2015","The Affordances of Social Networking Sites for Relational Maintenance in a Distrustful Society: The Case of Azerbaijan"," The Internet and social media afford opportunities for relational maintenance, but most scholarship has focused on relational maintenance in high-trust environments. This study explores relational maintenance online and offline in a distrustful society. In distrustful societies, trust is situated within one’s particularized kin network, and friendships have strategic significance and are characterized by norms of reciprocity. In distrustful societies, relational maintenance behaviors are different from trustful societies and take on greater significance. This preliminary study, based on informant interviews in Azerbaijan, examines both offline relational maintenance and the affordances of social networking sites (SNSs) for relational maintenance in such an environment. SNSs do provide for some relational maintenance behaviors through supplementing offline behaviors at a low cost and give some additional benefits like status display, yet SNSs do not replace traditional relational maintenance behaviors in Azerbaijan.

"2015","Using attitude functions, self-efficacy, and norms to predict attitudes and intentions to use mobile devices to access social media during sporting event attendance"," The recent years have observed an increased use of social media through mobile devices on different occasions. The present investigation examines why sports spectators use social media (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) while attending sporting events. Based on a cross-sectional survey of 466 participants who generally attended games with friends or family, structural equation modeling analysis revealed that social media use through a mobile device during sporting event attendance served four functions: information-based and game pleasure-based utilitarian functions, an ego-defensive function, and a value-expressive function. The first three functions, descriptive norms, and self-efficacy predicted attitudes toward social media use. When placed within a larger theoretical framework, attitudes, self-efficacy, descriptive norms, and the ego-defensive function predicted intentions to use social media during sporting event attendance. Both theoretical and practical implications are discussed. ","",""
"2016","Social networking sites and low-income teenagers: between opportunity and inequality","ABSTRACT Recent studies on social networking sites (SNSs) reveal that users’ social background is not a significant predictor of participation in this type of social media. The broad user bases of Facebook and other social media platforms also appear to suggest that social background no longer affects access to SNSs. A small number of studies even claim that in the participatory web environment, social content is more likely to be created by non-elites, such as lower-income people or racial minorities [Blank, G. (2013). Who creates content? Stratification and content creation on the Internet. Information, Communication & Society, 16(4), 590–612]. Nevertheless, engagement with SNSs also reproduces inequalities, for example via class- and ethnic-based ‘self-segregation’ [boyd, d. (2012). White flight in networked publics? How race and class shaped American teen engagement with MySpace and Facebook. In L. Nakamura & P. A. Chow-White (Eds.), Race after the internet (pp. 203–222). New York, NY: Routledge]. Drawing on a large-scale survey (N = 2327) and a set of 56 interviews with Italian teenagers, the current paper explores the persistent influence of socio-economic background and cultural capital in adolescents’ use of SNSs. The research findings show that, although structural variables inevitably influence their participation in social media, teenagers from ‘lower-income’ families are more enthusiastic about the communication and relational features of these sites. In contrast, their peers from ‘elite’ families focus on the capital-enhancing opportunities offered by SNSs and display a critical stance that leads them to limit their social activities on these platforms. Overall, the results suggest that SNSs are not exempt from digital inequalities, but nonetheless provide novel opportunities to lower-income teenagers.","",""
"2016","Network domains in social networking sites: expectations, meanings, and social capital","This paper examines why the use of social networking sites (SNSs) leads to different results in cultivating bridging and bonding social capital for different groups of people. Based on in-depth interviews of 45 university students in Hong Kong, I find that Mainland Chinese students studying in Hong Kong actively use SNSs for seeking practical information about offline matters, and they obtain substantial enacted support from other Mainland students of the same university through SNS use. As a result, they accumulate both bridging and bonding social capital. Local Hong Kong students, however, use SNSs mainly for social information seeking and are only able to accrue limited bridging social capital through SNS use. Drawing on the theory of network domains, I argue that the different offline network structures in which students are located – namely, homogeneous and closed networks versus heterogeneous and open networks – explain this difference. Students with closed offline networks have defined expectations of online ties; they think of their online activities as practical and leading to real changes in their status among peers. Those with open networks have indefinite expectations of their online audience; thus, they interpret online activities differently, thinking of them as recreational, and they are playful in their online behaviour. These different outcomes of online activities consequently lead to diverse results in social capital accrual.","",""

Online communities with greater activity and interactivity may vary in regards to specific words signaling stability, cohesiveness, and sociability. These message characteristics can be quantified using language processing software. Fifteen reddit messages boards were analyzed using linguistic inquiry and word count to determine the prevalence of message characteristics related to viability in online communities. Results revealed highly active boards – those with more total messages – were more likely to use terms referencing the past indicating stability and have greater thread depth indicating interactivity. Moderately active boards were more likely to have linguistic markers of cohesiveness and stability. Highly interactive boards – those with greater thread depth – were more likely to have language markers indicating stability, cohesiveness, and sociability.","",""
"2016","Contextual social capital: linking the contexts of social media use to its outcomes","ABSTRACT The established link between social media use and social capital reflects the understanding that these media are useful for establishing and maintaining relationships. Yet, social media are frequently used for other purposes, such as entertainment, information seeking, and companionship. Using a uses and gratifications approach, this study explores how contexts of social media use intersect with social capital. From data gathered in an online survey of approximately 350 social media users, multiple multivariate regression analysis was used to analyze the contributions that individual contexts of social media use make on bridging, bonding, and maintained social capital. This analysis demonstrates that while everyday instrumental communication is a primary contributor to the accrual of all forms of social capital, the use of social media use to express care and concern for others and for entertainment is also important to social capital outcomes. These findings underscore the importance of considering context to understand the effects of social media use.","",""

Focusing on positive effects only, this study examines whether there is a boundary between online and offline realms in cohorts of student digital natives and what differences exist between German and US populations. Using data collected in 2013 and 2014 we find that social grooming activities in social networking sites (SNS) significantly increase positive emotional outcomes and indirectly increase subjective well-being. We also conclude that there is a significant impact of online social grooming activities on offline social activities. But this impact is significantly moderated by cultural aspects: only within the subsample of US students is this effect of spreading social capital from online to face-to-face interaction significant. This striking result can be attributed to the stronger separation of communication activities between online and offline life among German students. Further, these differences can be explained by differences in underlying usage motives, which do also differ between US and German students.","",""

This augmented capacity to build connection with a distant other has become an important condition of romantic relationship in our time. This article explores the implication of constant connection as a media affordance for romantic relationship by examining media use among young Chinese lovers. Based on in-depth interviews with young Chinese lovers, it argues that constant connection contributes to a continual sense of togetherness between romantic couples as they continually engage in phatic communication, but that it intensifies lovers’ negotiation of intimacy and individuality by pushing their personal boundaries on one hand and cultivating an intolerance of separation on the other. Overall, this article contributes to the scholarly conversation about media technology and human intimacy by offering a critique of social media based on the inner dynamics of romantic relationship.

Though motivations to use social networking sites are widely researched and published, studies on implications eventuating from different types of content posted by users on social networking sites is sparse. Hence, this study addresses the gap in literature by an interpretive analysis of user-generated content posted by users on the Facebook of two organisations. The content posted by users is classified using an information classification framework for social networking sites. Implications eventuating from the classified user-generated content to individuals and organisations are established using thematic analysis. The results of analysis demonstrate that the major types of user-generated content posted in the social information category are requests, criticism, greetings, status updates, and announcements. The theoretical implications in terms of user benefits are information seeking, relationship building, coordination and collaboration, identity construction and knowledge dissemination whereas social conflict is a major cost to users. The practical implications are understood in terms of technical assistance, supporting projects that extend open access repository initiatives, collaboration and building capacity among repository users, user community development, marketing and communication as well as accomplishing the core principles of the National Strategy for Disaster Resilience. This study also leads to considerable gains for users and designers of social networking sites by identifying the different types of user-generated content so that social networking sites can be used as a beneficial tool maximizing its implications.","",""

Academic scholars are no exception, and a host of social networking platforms designed specifically for scholars abound. This study used Amazon’s Mechanical Turk service to code 10,500 profile pictures used by scholars on three platforms — Mendeley, Microsoft Academic Search, and Google Scholar — in order to determine how academics are presenting themselves to their colleagues and to the public at large and how they are perceived — particularly in relation to professionalism and attractiveness. The majority of the individuals on Mendeley, Microsoft Academic Search, and Google Scholar were Caucasian, male, and perceived to be over the age of 35. Females and younger individuals were perceived as less professional than male and older individuals, while women were more likely to be perceived as “attractive.” In addition, the Mechanical Turk coders were susceptible to framing; the individuals in the profile pictures were considered more “professional” if they were identified as “scholars” rather than merely as “individuals.” The results have far-reaching implications for self-presentation and framing, both for scholars and for other professionals. In the academic realm, there are serious implications for hiring and the allocation of resources and rewards.","",""

International students don’t feel comfortable discussing their distress via social media due to complex cultural internetworking present in the online networking sphere. The results of this study indicate that in studying this topic we should take into account both common challenges in getting social support online and special circumstances facing international students.

"2016","Intimacy and social capital on Facebook: Beyond the psychological perspective"," Social capital has become a key concept in the study of social network sites such as Facebook. An influential body of literature has emerged which links the accumulation of social capital on Facebook to various psychological traits and depositions. There is a need to augment this work with a more critical, qualitative approach which recognises other key social and technological aspects of Facebook. Based on ethnographic research, I explore how the exchange of social capital on Facebook is significantly influenced by mobility, surveillance and norms of public intimacy. Facebook users must continually negotiate intimacy when claiming on social capital, and this involves a nascent set of social skills and digital literacies. I suggest the term ‘intimacy capital’ to conceptualise the way in which these skills are distributed unevenly in society, opening up a critical way of thinking about social capital and intimacy on Facebook.

Six kinds of digital stressors that engender two distinctive types of digital stress are identified. Type 1 stressors—“mean and harassing personal attacks,” “public shaming and humiliation,” and “impersonation”—reflect the migration of common forms of relational hostility onto the online space and echo discussions of harassment, drama, and bullying. Type 2 stressors stem from adolescents’ use of digital technologies in the service of seeking relational connection. These lesser-discussed Type 2 stressors—“feeling smothered,” “pressure to comply with requests for access,” and “breaking and entering into digital accounts and devices”—transpire in the context of adolescents’ attempts to form and maintain intimacy or close connections with others.

The effect of content and structure of the respective online network on professional informational benefits was examined on the general (users vs. non-users of a platform) and more fine-grained level (within users of a specific platform). Overall, users of LinkedIn and Twitter reported higher informational benefits than non-users, whereas the Facebook users reported lower informational benefits. Posting about work and strategically selecting ties consistently predicted informational benefits. The network composition mattered most on LinkedIn; strong and weak ties predicted informational benefits. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the social capital framework. ","",""
"2016","Exploring the Relationship Between Mobile Facebook and Social Capital: What Is the “Mobile Difference” for Parents of Young Children?"," Mobile media have generally been found to reinforce close ties. Many have predicted this will bring about an onerous social insularity or “network privatism.” However, mobile media now enable frequent communication and multimedia activities with larger, more diffuse social networks. Might we be at a tipping point where certain groups benefit from weak tie connections on mobile social media? To answer this question, this study considers how mobile media altered social capital outcomes on Facebook among parents with young children, a group that are heavy users of mobile media and requiring social support. An online survey ( N = 262) conducted with parents with young children reveals a generally positive picture. Results show differences between desktop and mobile use of Facebook. Toward a contextual understanding of the impact of visual media, multimedia activities with social ties accrued bridging over bonding capital. Social capital was in turn correlated with mobile Facebook activities beneficial for parents’ well-being. Far from negative predictions, this study provides evidence of how mobile social media broaden our social spheres. ","",""
"2016","Motives for Online Friending and Following: The Dark Side of Social Network Site Connections"," Motives for “friending,” following, or connecting with others on social network sites are often positive, but darker motives may also play an important role. A survey with a novel Following Motives Scale (FMS) demonstrates accordingly that positive, sociable motives (i.e., others providing a valued source for humor and information, others sharing a common background, as well as relationship maintenance) and inspirational motives (i.e., others providing a target for upward social comparison) can be distinguished from darker motives related to insecurity (i.e., others providing reassurance, preference for online interaction, mediated voyeurism, as well as social obligation), and even darker antisocial motives related to self-enhancement (i.e., others providing a target for downward social comparison, competition, schadenfreude, gossip, as well as “hate-following”). Results show that lower self-esteem and higher levels of need for popularity, narcissism, and dispositional schadenfreude characterize users with stronger dark side motives, whereas users with more sociable motives report more satisfaction with life, thereby providing construct validity for the novel scale. Convergent validity is demonstrated by positive relations between following motives and both time spent and following counts on different social network sites. Moreover, an embedded experiment shows that antisocial motives predicted acceptance of a Facebook friendship request from a male or female high school acquaintance who suffered a setback in the domain of appearance or status (i.e., a convenient source for self-enhancement), thereby providing additional convergent validity for the Antisocial Motives subscale.

Disclosures on the site go on to serve as intimate, co-constructed life records, albeit with unique and always-evolving affordances. The ways in which romantic relationships are mediated on the site are complex and contested: “What is the significance of articulating a romantic relationship on Facebook?” “Why do some choose to make socially and culturally critical moments like the beginning and ends of relationships visible on Facebook, whereas others (perhaps within the same relationship) do not?” “How do these practices change over time?” and “When is it time to go “Facebook official”?” In this article, we draw on qualitative research with Facebook users in their 20s in Australia and the United Kingdom who have been using the site for 5 years or more. Interviews with participants revealed that romantic relationships were central to many of their growing up narratives, and in this article, we draw out examples to discuss four kinds of (non-exclusive) practices: (1) overt relationship status disclosures, mediated through the “relationship status” affordance of the site, (2) implied relationship disclosures, mediated through an increase in images and tags featuring romantic partners, (3) the intended absence of relationship visibility, and (4) later-erased or revised relationship disclosures.

Results of the survey reveal some significant between-platform differences in perceived effectiveness of social support provided by a PDA, but no significant differences in the relational closeness of ties across platforms. These findings were used to design and conduct focus groups ( N = 36) to understand why the identified differences exist. Focus groups reveal that although social support is exchanged across all platforms, different dimensions of social support are sought and received depending on the platform and the network audience that platform accesses. In addition, the focus groups revealed meaningful differences in the nature of network relationships between the platforms, if not the degree of closeness. Taking the two studies together, it seems the adoption and continued use of a platform is an idiosyncratic function of both the social and the technological. Findings underscore the importance of conducting cross-platform studies and demonstrate the value of using PDAs as a convenient cross-platform comparison tool, as they are one of the few common features across social media.

We observed that, in order to achieve various levels of intimacy on Facebook, people engage in various strategies: Showing rather than telling, Sharing implicit content, Tagging, Expectation of mutual understanding and Liking. These strategies produce a collaborative disclosure that relies on others’ cooperation to maintain the boundaries between private and public space. Based on these premises, we developed a framework of collaborative strategies for managing public intimacy that both systematizes and extends the findings identified in previous studies of intimacy on Facebook. We describe this framework as networked intimacy and we discuss the consequences of it in the light of already existing research on online self-disclosure.","",""

Based on data from a representative, national survey, we compare the relationship between social network structure and various activities on Facebook for one type of resource: informal social support in the form of companionship, emotional support, and tangible aid. In addition to a positive association between number of close ties, overall network size and diversity and social support, we find that Facebook status updates and private messaging are independently associated with perceived support. We argue that these affordances are an outcome of the “pervasive awareness” provided by social media. ","",""
"2017","Why do we tag photographs on Facebook? Proposing a new gratifications scale"," Using a multi-stage investigation, this study developed and validated a 35-item instrument for measuring gratifications of photo-tagging on Facebook. The questions were developed based on open-ended responses of 141 people who use photo-tags on Facebook. From their answers, 58 items were extracted and then tested on 780 people. This resulted in a 35-item scale that was re-examined with 313 adolescents and 186 adult photo-taggers. The 35-item instrument offers nine gratifications: likes and comments, social influence, peer pressure, gains popularity, entertainment, feels good, social sharing, affection, and convenience. The factorial structure and instrument validity and reliability were high and fairly stable over time. The findings are discussed in relation to the uses and gratifications theory, and the practical implications of this new instrument are explored. ","",""
"2017","Explicating problematic social network sites use: A review of concepts, theoretical frameworks, and future directions for communication theorizing"," The prevalence of social network sites (SNSs) has sparked a growing interest in understanding the development of problematic SNSs use among adolescents. Yet, this nascent area of research is marked by some deficiencies in existing theoretical paradigms. This article seeks to review the state of research in problematic SNSs use—broadly with a specific focus on adolescents—and identify key areas of research for future scholarly work. First, we summarize the historical and recent developments of media addiction and problematic SNSs use research. Second, we discuss the theoretical perspectives that contribute to our understanding of the problematic SNSs use phenomenon and identify the weaknesses of these frameworks. Third, we propose that communication scholars should strive for theoretical integration and examine the impact of microsystem (e.g. parents and peers) and macrosystem (e.g. surveillance culture) on the development of problematic SNSs among adolescents. Directions for future theoretical and methodological approaches are suggested. ","",""
"2017","Imagined Facebook: An exploratory study of non-users’ perceptions of social media in Rural Zambia"," This article describes an exploratory study of Facebook non-users living in rural Zambia. Drawing on evidence from 37 group interviews with mobile phone owners, we discovered that the majority of our participants were aware of, or ‘imagined’ Facebook, despite never having seen or used the site. Our analysis of how participants perceive Facebook suggests that they are interested in the communication and income-generating possibilities access to the site may provide, but that barriers prevent them from acting on these interests. This study contributes to social media research by making visible the experiences of a population whose non-use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) results from economic, infrastructural, and linguistic sources, as well as from other, hitherto less-explored areas. We discuss the practical significance of these findings, offer future research suggestions, and comment on what our respondents have not yet imagined about Facebook. ","",""

This article provides a link between relational dynamics and online risks identified in previous research toward a new perspective on how social tie strength is related to experiences of hate victimization and harassment online. The analysis is based on survey data of Finnish ( n = 555), American ( n = 1033), German ( n = 978), and British ( n = 999) young people aged 15–30 years. Variables, including age, gender, main activity, SNS use, quantity, and extent of online and offline social networks including social tie strength and online community identification, were analyzed toward finding their associations with online hate victimization and harassment. Results showed that experiences of hate victimization and harassment were similar cross-nationally and that those who were personally harassed online also reported high SNS activity. Furthermore, no association was found between social network size and negative experiences. Notable cross-national differences were also detected in the results. Findings emphasize the importance of understanding variables fostering online risks for young people while providing a new perspective on what aspects of social life may help negate negative effects online.

Individuals who access faith-based content on Facebook were recruited to participate in an online survey through a series of Facebook advertisements. An exploratory factor analysis revealed four primary motivations for accessing religious Facebook content: ministering, spiritual enlightenment, religious information, and entertainment. Along with identifying the uses and gratifications received from engaging with faith-based Facebook content, this research reveals how the frequency of Facebook use, the intensity of Facebook use for religious purposes, and also religiosity predict motivations for accessing this social networking site for faith-based purposes. The data revealed those who frequently use Facebook for posting, liking, commenting, and sharing faith-based content and who are more religious are more likely to minister to others. Frequent use also predicted seeking religious information. The affiliation with like-minded individuals afforded by this medium provides faith-based users with supportive content and communities that motivate the use of Facebook for obtaining spiritual guidance, for accessing religious resources, and for relaxing and being entertained.

"2017","“You Shouldn’t Use Facebook for That”: Navigating Norm Violations While Seeking Emotional Support on Facebook"," Facebook users who choose to seek emotional support publicly via Facebook Timeline posts must balance their needs for emotional comfort with norms for appropriate behavior within the Facebook context. Although Facebook promotes access to diverse social contacts who could serve as emotional support providers, the norms of Facebook use often prevent users from explicitly and directly venting their affect and requesting emotional support. A community sample ( N = 185) completed an online questionnaire through which participants provided their most recent public Facebook post that was intended to garner social support. Inductive thematic analysis was employed to identify the strategies individuals enact to navigate the tension between effectively seeking emotional support while avoiding violating implicit Facebook norms associated with oversharing or appearing emotionally needy. Six themes characterizing emotional support-seeking strategies on Facebook emerged from the data. These themes are further subdivided, described, and discussed as they pertain to extant literature on supportive communication and Facebook norms. ","",""

Focusing on Facebook use as an extremely popular leisure activity, this study examines the influence of depressive tendencies on the intensity of using Facebook by considering the moderating effects of relevant personality traits and different motivations associated with social network site (SNS) use. Based on an online survey among 510 young Facebook users, this study shows that increasing depressive tendencies are associated with an increased frequency of posting status updates—most likely for negative reasons. Moderated mediation models show that the personality traits of neuroticism and extraversion only influence the motivations behind using Facebook and not the time spent on the SNS. Findings are also discussed with regard to novel digital help offers for Facebook users with depressive tendencies. ","",""

Do digital divides persist across adoption/non-adoption of SNSs, across different SNSs, and across different capital-enhancing activities used on those SNSs? The current study analyzes a context where social ties are more salient for resource access due to untrustworthy institutions, and large gaps exist between elites and non-elites. Demographic divides characterize the 31% of Armenian adults using two major SNSs in 2013: Facebook and Odnoklassniki. Facebook is used more for getting information, while Odnoklassniki more for gaming. However, the divides in SNS usage are much greater than in activity use, with implications for capital enhancement and stratification. ","",""

A sample of young adults ( N = 147) completed an online survey which measured SNS usage, problematic SNS use, BI, SE, and ED symptom/concerns. The findings revealed that females and males spent 4.1 ± 3.9 and 2.9 ± 2.8 hr on SNS, respectively, with the majority of time spent lurking (i.e., looking at another users’ profile but not actually communicating with them). Furthermore, problematic SNS use was found to be related to BI, SE, and ED symptoms/concerns. Moreover, SNS activities, such as lurking and posting comments on others’ profiles, were found to be related to BI, whereas SNS total time was found to be related to ED symptoms/concerns. Overall, this study demonstrates the possible correlational influence of SNSs on BI, SE, and ED symptoms/concerns. ","",""

Data were collected by means of in-depth interviews of daily Facebook users in two distinct cultures, the United States and Ecuador. The findings of the study reveal that the Like may be used (1) to acknowledge the gratifications obtained with the use of Facebook, (2) to share information with others, and (3) as a tool for impression management. Four categories of gratified usage motives influencing Liking behavior with distinctly different preferences in each culture, were found. The four categories that gratified usage motives are entertainment, information/discovery, bounding, and self-identification. Three types of underlying motives dominated the use of the Like to share information: presentation of the self, presentation of the extended-self, and social obligations. Finally, the Like can be used as a self-protective tool for impression management. The present findings lay the foundation for a grounded theory model that may guide future research efforts in this area. ","",""
"2017","Understanding and measuring mobile Facebook use: Who, why, and how?"," Although social media are increasingly used through mobile devices, the differences between mobile and computer-based practices remain unclear. This study attempts to tease out some of these differences through multiple analytical strategies and samples. Drawing on theoretical expectations about the affordances, motivations, and cognition of mobile use, we investigate who uses mobile Facebook, why they use it, and how they use it. To do this, we first compare those who use Facebook only on a PC with those who also use the service on mobile devices. Then, in order to quantify mobile Facebook use, we propose a new set of survey measures to tap into more and less mobile users among the sample of people who access Facebook through multiple modes. These questions serve to validate measures of mobile Facebook use, and allow us to examine how patterns of use relate to user motivations and experiences. Findings revealed important differences between PC-only and mobile users as well as a distinct and reliable measure of mobileness. Whereas motivations for Facebook use did not differ across users, more habitual and absorbing use of Facebook was strongly, positively associated with mobile practices. These findings illustrate that people use mobile Facebook in more automatic and immersive ways that are independent of overall frequency of use or motivations. Implications for the psychological mechanisms involved in mobile communication, as well as survey measurement of social media use, are discussed. ","",""

Facebook use and the link between offline and online social capital among Palestinian youth in Israel","ABSTRACT Studies have shown that using social networking sites contributes to social capital. This study investigated the association between specific features of Facebook and online social capital. Two contrasting hypothesis were tested. The first posits that the rich get richer, meaning that the creation of social capital online reflects the stock of offline resources already available. In contrast, the compensation hypothesis argues that disadvantaged ethnic minorities are more likely to use social media to compensate for their lack of social capital offline. We tested these two theories among a representative sample of Palestinian teenagers (N = 567). While we found no gender differences in the use of Facebook’s features, our results highlight the positive correlation between the use of active and passive communication features and perceived social capital online. Moreover, the results support the rich-get-richer model; in that, even among this socially disadvantaged group, the youngsters who already had a store of social capital offline benefitted more from using Facebook.","",""

Little research has studied how social media technologies impact sleep quality among college students. This study aims to determine the relationship between social media use and sleep quality among freshman undergraduates during their first quarter in college. Specifically, we explored whether variations in Twitter use across the time of day and day of the week would be associated with self-reported sleep quality. We conducted a study of freshman Twitter-using students (N = 197) over their first quarter of college, between October and December of 2015. We collected students’ tweets, labeled the content of the tweets according to different emotional states, and gave theme weekly surveys on sleep quality. Tweeting more frequently on weekday late nights was associated with lower sleep quality (β = −0.937, SE = 0.352); tweeting more frequently on weekday evenings was associated with better quality sleep (β = 0.189, SE = 0.097). Tweets during the weekday that were labeled related to the emotion of fear were associated with lower sleep quality (β = −0.302, SE = 0.131). Results suggest that social media use is associated with sleep quality among students. Results provided can be used to inform future interventions to improve sleep quality among college students.","",""
"2018","Adolescent friendship challenges in a digital context"," The authors analyzed 300 stories about adolescents’ friendship challenges in order to explore the roles of digital technologies in contemporary friendship conflicts. An initial round of analysis facilitated the identification and subsequent classification of stories by five commonly described challenges: betrayal, isolation, meanness and harassment, concern about a Friend, and Maintenance Challenges. Drawing on previously identified features of exchanges in and through digital contexts, including scalability, persistence, replicability, and anonymity, the role of technology was then explored in the context of the five friendship challenges. Scalability, leveraging the affordance of efficiently reaching a broad audience, was the most common way technology amplified friendship challenges. However, technology also often functioned solely as the medium for communication. Additionally, adolescents described difficulties related to sexting as a contemporary friendship challenge. Implications for supporting youth in their friendships are discussed. ","",""
"2018","More friends, more interactions? The association between network size and interactions on Facebook","With social networking sites (SNS) such as Facebook, individuals have immediate access to hundreds of people from different aspects of their lives. On one hand, this may increase the number of people that individuals can interact with directly because communication now requires less effort. On the other hand, individuals may still only interact with a small portion of their networks because humans have limited time and resources. Mayhew and Levinger (1976) proposed that because of time and resource constraints, individuals in larger networks spend, on average, less time with each contact. Thus, while people may have opportunities through Facebook to interact with more people, they may not actually do so. Using logging software, we explored the percentage of their Facebook network that individuals sent direct messages to and whether individuals with larger networks sent direct messages to a smaller percentage of their networks. We found that in line with Mayhew and Levinger’s claim, users messaged a very small percentage of their networks (less than two percent) and that users with larger friend networks sent messages to a smaller percentage of their friend networks. This suggests that while Facebook may enable users to connect with more people than ever before, there are still limits to the number of ties with whom individuals actively interact.","",""

An exploratory, qualitative phase included interviews, focus groups, and anonymous confession posts on Facebook, followed by three quantitative online surveys using college freshman students during their initial semester. Dormitory dining halls were among primary social settings on campus; yet, freshman students did not want to eat dinner alone there. Dinner location was not correlated with sense of belonging; however, underrepresented minority (URM) who had dinner in dormitory dining halls reported lower sense of belonging. URM solo-diners more likely used screens. Solitary URM diners who used a screen in the dining hall reported lower sense of belonging early in the initial semester. Text messaging in the dining halls was associated with greater sense of belonging. Furthermore, greater sense of belonging was related to better mental health. URMs’ greater sense of belonging in the initial semester could predict greater academic achievement over the next few semesters.","",""

In doing so, we address the ambiguity of previously reported relationships between Facebook use and well-being. We test temporal (shorter vs longer time spans) and spatial (at home vs away from home) dimensions of Facebook activity using an innovative approach. By triggering smartphone surveys in response to users’ naturalistic Facebook posting, we captured the immediate context of both mobile and desktop activities during daily life. Findings indicated positive—yet fleeting—emotional experiences up to 10 minutes after active posting and higher arousal for 30 minutes following posting at home. Nonetheless, Facebook activities predicted no changes in aggregate mood over 2 weeks, despite showing positive relationships to bridging social capital during the same period. Our results call attention to fleeting experiences (vs enduring consequences) and encourage future research to specify temporal and spatial boundaries. ","",""

We combined channel complementarity theory and media multiplexity theory to investigate first-year college students’ ( N = 155) use of CTs (video chat, phone calls, and text messaging) in close, long-distance friendships over a 3- to 10-day period. Overall, CTs were used complementarily. However, complementary use of phone calls and text messaging was higher in closer friendships. In contrast, phone calls and video chat were complementary at low but not high levels of closeness.

Furthermore, this study also tested whether thin ideal internalization or appearance comparison tendency moderated any effect. Viewing idealized images taken from social media had a negative influence on women’s body image, with or without the presence of disclaimers. Disclaimer comments also had no impact on women’s mood. They did, however, impact perceptions of the target, with women forming a less positive impression of the target if she attached disclaimer comments to her social media images.

How do daily interactions with social apps influence adolescents’ affective well-being? Survey self-reports ( n = 568) portray social media use as predominantly positive. Exploratory principal component analysis further indicates that positive and negative emotions form orthogonal response components. In-depth interviews with a sub-sample of youth ( n = 26), selected for maximum variation, reveal that affect experiences can be organized across four functional dimensions. Relational interactions contribute to both closeness and disconnection; self-expression facilitates affirmation alongside concern about others’ judgments; interest-driven exploration confers inspiration and distress; and browsing leads to entertainment and boredom, as well as admiration and envy. All interviewees describe positive and negative affect experiences across multiple dimensions. Analyses suggest the relationship between social technology usage and well-being—whether enhanced or degraded—is not confined to an “either/or” framework: the emotional see-saw of social media use is weighted by both positive and negative influences.

This study examines how the use of social networking sites (SNSs) for celebrity-related information and interactions influences users’ life satisfaction. Data analysis demonstrates that celebrity-related SNS activities decrease users’ life satisfaction by increasing relative deprivation through comparison with celebrities. However, the comparison also leads to system justification, serving a palliative function to cope with the potentially negative consequences of such comparisons, which in turn increases life satisfaction. Interestingly, materialism moderates the relationship such that the effects of comparison with celebrities on system justification are observed only among SNS users who hold high materialism values. Also, the direct positive effects of celebrity-related SNS use on life satisfaction are stronger for those with high materialistic values than for those with low materialistic values. The multifaceted functions of celebrity-related SNS activities for life satisfaction are discussed. ","",""

Data from a content analysis of Facebook profiles and an online survey with older adults (aged 60 years and older) who have used Facebook for at least 1 year ( N = 202) show that while status updating and posting personal stories are associated with activity and community-building gratifications respectively, profile customization is key for obtaining agency-enhancement gratification, and participating in conversations on comment threads plays an important role in providing interaction gratification.

Using two-wave panel data representative of the Dutch population between 15 and 45 years, we examine changes in the core discussion networks (CDNs) of 5312 respondents (with 10,896 relations). Contradicting an erosion of strong ties, we found positive effects of social media use on CDN size, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Social media use was positively related to talking to CDN members in our cross-sectional model. Finally, we found that the CDNs of frequent social media users were more dynamic than those of less frequent users: they are more likely to both lose old and gain new ties. This suggests that Internet use is associated with more, and more dynamic, social interaction. ","",""

Furthermore, this study tested whether internalization of the societal beauty ideal, appearance comparison tendency in general, or appearance comparisons to specific target groups on Instagram mediated any relationships between Instagram use and the appearance-related variables. Greater overall Instagram use was associated with greater self-objectification, and that relationship was mediated both by internalization and by appearance comparisons to celebrities. More frequently viewing fitspiration images on Instagram was associated with greater body image concerns, and that relationship was mediated by internalization, appearance comparison tendency in general, and appearance comparisons to women in fitspiration images. Together, these results suggest that Instagram usage may negatively influence women’s appearance-related concerns and beliefs. ","",""

Data were collected using an online questionnaire, completed by 333 instructors in higher education, that asked about general social media use and specific use in teaching. Education and learning theories suggest three potential reasons for instructors to use social media in their teaching: (1) exposing students to practices, (2) extending the range of the learning environment, and (3) promoting learning through social interaction and collaboration. Answers to open-ended questions about how social media were used in teaching, and results of a factor analysis of coded results, revealed six distinct factors that align with these reasons for use: (1) facilitating student engagement, (2) instructor’s organization for teaching, (3) engagement with outside resources, (4) enhancing student attention to content, (5) building communities of practice, and (6) resource discovery. These factors accord with a Uses and Gratifications perspective that depicts adopters as active media users choosing and shaping media use to meet their own needs.

Using mixed methods, we find that those perceiving Facebook as a more efficient disclosure medium are more likely to announce breakups. We show how media ideologies around Facebook breakup disclosures vary; yet people assume others hold similar beliefs about what is appropriate. We contribute to self-disclosure and online identity literature by identifying two new ways people engage in disclosure and self-presentation on social media: announcements, which highlight how social media can serve as efficient one-to-many disclosure sources, and private status change behaviors, a reflexive means of self-presentation.

"2018","Explaining unplanned online media behaviors: Dual system theory models of impulsive use and swearing on social networking sites"," Unplanned (i.e. spontaneous) online behaviors such as impulsive use of social networking sites (SNS) and swearing on SNS are prevalent and can adversely affect users and society. Drawing on dual system theory, this article conceptualizes and empirically investigates the etiology of such behaviors. Results of two studies ( n1 = 295 SNS users, focuses on impulsive use; n2 = 336 SNS users, focuses on swearing) show that both of these online behaviors are driven, in part, by cognitive-emotional preoccupation with the SNS and inhibited, in part, by cognitive-behavioral control over using the SNS. The inhibition effect is both direct and indirect, through the suppression of the cognitive-emotional preoccupation effects. The findings provide a theoretical lens of analysis through which impulsive and unitneded media use behaviors can be explained. ","",""
"2018","“To Respond or not to Respond, that is the Question”: The Decision-Making Process of Providing Social Support to Distressed Posters on Facebook"," The aim of this study is to understand whether, why, and under what conditions young adults respond to distressed posts on social networking sites (SNSs). Semi-structured interviews with 27 participants revealed a wide range of salient factors that influenced participants’ likelihood of responding to distressed posts. By identifying the factors and mapping the conditions under which they are operational, we posit a conceptual framework useful in understanding key features of the decision-making process participants use to decide whether and how to respond to distressed SNS posts. Results suggest that relationship closeness is the first and most significant determinant of likelihood to respond. When relational closeness was high, the responses were likely to be direct and immediate. In the absence of relational closeness between respondent and poster, likelihood of responding depended on (1) perceived acuity and seriousness of content, (2) consistency in posting patterns, (3) perceived capacity to provide efficacious support, (4) history of reciprocity, (5) perceived resonance with poster or posted content, (6) perceived motivations of the poster, and (7) perceptions of other viewers. The findings have implications for understanding social support interactions and bystander interventions in peer networks on SNSs. ","",""

Focusing on two major types of social media activities (i.e., profile maintenance, social grooming), this study investigated whether these specific types of user activities would be significantly related to greater appearance comparison with peers, and in turn, would be linked to increased levels of body image concerns. An online survey ( N = 305) was conducted among young Korean women (aged 18–29) in Korea. Results indicated that the frequency with which Korean female participants engaged in profile maintenance and social grooming activities on Facebook was positively associated with appearance comparison with peers, and the mediation analysis revealed that appearance comparison mediated the relationship between Facebook use variables and body image concerns, such as lower weight satisfaction and greater drive for thinness. Theoretical and practical implications for these findings are further discussed. ","",""
"2018","When Nobody “Likes” You: Perceived Ostracism Through Paralinguistic Digital Affordances Within Social Media"," This research explores the processes of perceived ostracism ensuing from a lack of feedback via paralinguistic digital affordances (PDAs), the one-click tools (e.g., Likes and +1s) which are one of the most used features of social media, provided to an individual’s posted social media content. The positive and negative psychological outcomes of social media communication have been well-documented. However, as social media have become entrenched as some of our most common communication channels, the absence of communication via social media has been underexplored and may have negative psychological and communicative outcomes. We utilized focus groups ( N = 37) to examine perceptions of ostracism when individuals did not receive PDAs to their posted content across social media platforms. Participants reported feeling excluded only when they did not receive PDAs from select relationally close or socially superior network members, suggesting audience targeting and expectations when posting. Users frequently attributed low PDA counts to system and content factors. These results contribute to a developing understanding of the psychological effects of lack of communication via social media and provide insight for future research, demonstrating that social exclusion may not manifest from a complete lack of social interaction but rather may occur when individuals do not receive expected or desired feedback.

"2018","Social Media’s Role in Romantic Partners’ Retroactive Jealousy: Social Comparison, Uncertainty, and Information Seeking"," Social media often have a dark side in romantic relationships. Affordances such as persistence, association, and visibility can promote romantic jealousy and the salience of relationship threats, including ex-partners. Retroactive jealousy occurs when a person feels upset about their partner’s romantic history even though ex-partners are not actively interfering in the current relationship. Interviews ( N = 36) probed how participants felt social networking sites (SNSs) promoted and mitigated retroactive romantic jealousy. Furthermore, we examined the consequences of these experiences. Participants indicated that SNSs lead to retroactive jealousy via social comparison, digital remnants, and relational uncertainty. In addition, participants used SNSs to gather information or monitor their partners. These information-seeking activities allowed them to disparage a romantic partner’s exes; avoid direct, interactive information seeking about exes; and digitally fact-check information the partner disclosed. Some participants reframed information about the ex-relationship or actively avoided SNSs to reduce retroactive jealousy. Although SNSs may be used in an attempt to mitigate retroactive jealousy, our findings suggest this strategy may backfire in some cases. ","",""

Yet, there has been little investigation of how young adults experience, navigate, and negotiate FB sabbaticals and the impact this has on their social connections and overall well-being. To address this, we conducted a qualitative study of six young adults, aged 18–34 to understand their FB sabbatical experiences, how they negotiated their social connections during their sabbatical and sough to explain the reasons associated with their return to FB. We propose a FB sabbatical support model and offer three research propositions. Our results suggest that (1) FB sabbaticals are of benefit in addressing unhealthy FB habits, yet key supportive factors vary in value of importance and influence between genders; and (2) despite young adults’ efforts to mitigate technostress via FB sabbaticals, this strategy presented multiple challenges that affected their online and offline connections and personal health and well-being in positive and negative ways, contributing to cyclic habits of FB discontinuation and reconnection.

"2018","Facebook Interactions: An Ethnographic Perspective"," This article starts with a consideration of the different reasons academics might be interested in the detailed analysis of who interacts with whom on a social media platform such as Facebook. We then describe our analysis of the levels of interaction between Facebook friends for two populations, one based in South England and the other in South India. We first used statistical data analysis to identify those who interacted most with our informants. We then exploited our ethnographic grounding to elucidate who exactly these interactions were with upon returning to our informants. This allows us to characterize the nature of interactivity in the two sites, for example, the role of kinship as against friendship. In general, we found that the explanation for interactivity in the English fieldsite tended to depend on identifying specific genres of communication for particular social relations, while the Indian fieldsite reflected strong social parameters such as gender and class. We also comment on a few of the many general issues that arise, including the relationship between online and offline sociality, the importance of both reciprocity and asymmetry in interactivity, and the question of whether people are aware of who interacts most with them on their Facebook profiles.

Two classes belong to a traditional brick-and-mortar university, where an offline acquaintance is a common resource, and two classes belong to a distance-learning university with a loose offline acquaintance. We analyzed the offline and online networks of interactions at the individual, dyadic, and community levels. We found that there is a positive association between offline social capital and online learning interactions across all classes at the individual and dyadic levels. Using network analysis, we found evidence for a substitutional relationship between the offline and online networks at the community level, thus suggesting that online interactions may be encouraged as a complementing dimension of offline social capital.","",""

We argue that users handle this challenge by collectively establishing norms. Applying a focus group methodology, we analyzed which norms of self-disclosure exist among German Facebook users and the reference groups to which they referred, how they shape users’ self-disclosure practices on Facebook, and how these norms and practices have changed over time. Descriptive norms manifested themselves mainly by referring to negative self-disclosure practices of relevant others, but the injunctive norms of self-disclosure were of great relevance to the participants. The participants stated that users should present themselves strategically, communicate consciously concerning their privacy, and not post about the private lives of others. Users can manage the context collapse on Facebook by adapting their communicative activities there to the norms they perceive within their reference groups.","",""
"2019","How Does Communication Anxiety Influence Well-Being? Examining the Mediating Roles of Preference for Online Social Interaction (POSI) and Loneliness","I proposed a conceptual model that assumes communication anxiety leads to preference for online social interaction (POSI), which in turn leads to loneliness, resulting in a negative influence on well-being. I collected data from college students ( N  = 336) taking an introductory communication course at a public university in the U.S. and analyzed the model using PROCESS. Findings revealed that communication anxiety increases POSI and loneliness but reduces well-being; POSI is positively associated with loneliness but is not associated with well-being. The one-mediator path from communication anxiety to well-being via POSI is not significant, but the one-mediator path from communication anxiety to well-being via loneliness is significant. The two-mediator path from communication anxiety to well-being through POSI and then through loneliness is also significant. I also conducted path analyses to examine the fit indices of a modified optimal model and an alternative model and found that the former is superior to the latter. Thus, I concluded that the mediation path from communication anxiety to well-being is more likely to be first through POSI and then through loneliness.","",""

Specifically, and inspired by the concept of opinion leadership, I explore whether there are normative leaders: friends who are recognized as advisors and who have a distinct norm-signaling relevance by shaping normative perceptions to a particular extent. Hypotheses are tested based on egocentric networks of 311 young drivers (egos) and three of their friends regarding three road traffic risk behaviors (i.e., speeding, driving after drinking, and texting while driving). The results corroborate the idea of the norm-signaling relevance of friends’ behaviors and the special role of normative leaders in this regard. Friends who are recognized as advisors by the egos have a distinct impact on injunctive normative perceptions, that is, perceptions about the behavior’s social approval among friends. Implications for social norms research, opinion leadership research, and norms-based interventions are discussed.","",""

Drawing on a randomly sampled survey of adult residents in a major US city, we examine how general Internet use, interacted with network diversity, contributes to various returns of social capital: bonding and bridging, online and offline. We further unpack general Internet use to specific Internet use and explore their relations with the returns of social capital. The results show that general Internet use is positively related to all the online bonding, online bridging, and offline social capital returns, whereas specific Internet use (i.e., informational, participatory, and recreational) is only positively related to online but not offline returns of social capital. Network diversity moderates the relationship between general Internet use and offline returns of social capital.","",""

We employed experience sampling methods and collected data over the course of two weeks—combined with surveys at baseline and endpoint, from a random sample of college students (N = 154). We show that individuals who prefer to be more available to others report more rewarding interactions with weak ties. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the quality of weak tie interactions mediates a positive relationship between availability preferences and bridging social capital. We conclude by discussing the relationships between availability, interaction quality, and bridging social capital. We propose availability preferences as a key construct to be considered in future research.","",""

Study 1 used the Longitudinal Study of American Youth (N = 2774), which is a national probability sample of Generation X, to test displacement over a three-year time period. Latent change scores were used to test associations among social media adoption in 2009, social media use in 2011, direct contact frequency across years, in relation to change in well-being. Although social media adoption in 2009 predicted less social contact in 2011, increased social media use between 2009 and 2011 positively predicted well-being. Study 2 used experience sampling with a combined community and undergraduate sample (N = 116). Participants reported on their social interactions and passive social media use (i.e., excluding chat via social media) five times a day over five days. Results indicate that social media use at prior times of day was not associated with future social interaction with close others or with future face-to-face interaction. Passive social media use at prior times predicted lower future well-being only when alone at prior times. Neither study supported the social displacement hypothesis. Several interpretations of results, including a need-based account of social media use, are examined. The challenges of identifying an appropriate time scale to study social displacement are identified as critical question for future research.","",""
"2019","Why we migrate in the virtual world: factors affecting switching intentions in SNS","ABSTRACT The popularity of Social Networking Sites (SNS) continues to steadily increase, but their success depends on user turnover. Understanding the factors that impact user intentions to switch SNS services is therefore important. This study adapted the push–pull–mooring framework developed in migration literature to examine these factors. In particular, we proposed the concept of SNS fatigue as a push factor. Our survey of 180 Korean SNS users revealed that two SNS fatigue factors (SNS interaction overload and unwanted relationships) and two pull factors (alternative attraction and peer pressure) significantly influenced users’ switching intentions. However, we did not find the effect of the mooring factor (switching cost). These findings increase our understanding of SNS users’ migration behavior and carry important implications for both research and practice.","",""
"2019","Bridging bonds: Latvian migrants’ interpersonal ties on social networking sites"," Conflicting accounts exist regarding the influence of online-based communication platforms on the development of cross-border migrants’ networks. It has been reported that such platforms can either promote migrants’ participation in the host society or support secluded ethnic networks at the expense of developing ties with the local population. This article examines this issue through the analysis of the accumulation of online-based social capital among first-generation Latvian migrants. The study is based on interviews with 20 Latvians living in other countries who are frequent users of social networking sites and a survey of Latvian migrants ( N = 14,068). Migrants use social networking sites to maintain ties with friends and relatives in Latvia and also to broaden their networks and enable access to relevant information and contacts. Rather than interpreting social networking site-mediated communication among migrants as the accumulation of either bridging or bonding social capital, this article highlights the limitations of construing this pair of concepts as a binary opposition. In their online connections, Latvian migrants develop ‘dispersed ties’ – a bonding connection with fellow Latvians as a group and simultaneously bridging connections with individual members of the group, which increase heterogeneity of their networks and serve instrumental functions.

"2019","Social capital and subjective well-being: The mediating role of social networking sites","Many studies have examined the separate impacts of social capital (bonding and bridging) and the use of social networking sites (SNSs) on subjective well-being (SWB). However, few studies address the mediating role that SNS use has on the relationship between social capital and SWB. The current study addresses this research gap, examining the extent to which SNS use mediates the relationship between social capital and SWB. Moreover, this study theorizes SNS use to be a behavioural outcome of social capital, as opposed to the widespread view that SNSs are a tool to generate social capital. Using primary data from a sample of 307 undergraduate students, the partial least squares structural equation modelling technique was used to analyze the data via a sequential mediating mechanism. The findings highlight the importance of the utilitarian use of SNS in mediating the relationship between bridging social capital and SWB. On the other hand, the direct effect of bonding social capital on SWB was found to be stronger than the indirect effects, indicating that SNS use is not crucial in mediating this particular relationship. Theoretical and practical implications of the study are subsequently discussed.","",""

In this article, we use several conceptions of levels of embodiment to compare empirical work on the effects of virtual reality and social media as they relate to perceptions and conceptions of the self and body. We encourage social media researchers to utilize research on embodiment in virtual reality to help frame the effects of social media use on well-being. Similarly, researchers in immersive media should consider the opportunities and risks that may arise as embodied experiences become more social. We conclude our discussion with implications for future applications in mental health. ","",""

To provide a deeper understanding of this relationship, not only direct links are inspected, but fear of missing out (FoMO) and social comparison orientation (SCO) are considered as possible mediators. The results show that loneliness, depression, and anxiety are positively related to increases in SME. FoMO and SCO jointly mediate the connection between well-being and SME, that is, decreases in well-being are connected with increases in FoMO and SCO, which in turn positively predict SME. Furthermore, SCO and FoMO are found to be positively related to each other, suggesting that those with a high SCO might form a particular at-risk group for the development of FoMO. ","",""

Importantly, researchers have hypothesized that exposure to this content could be a risk for self-harm and suicide in vulnerable audiences. We tested this hypothesis using a two-wave US panel survey among young adults ( N = 729). Analyses indicated that exposure to self-harm on Instagram was associated with suicidal ideation, self-harm, and emotional disturbance even controlling for exposure to other sources with similar content. As hypothesized, exposure to self-harm on Instagram at the first wave prospectively predicted self-harm and suicidality-related outcomes at the second wave 1 month later.

Participants who reported having an Instagram account were also asked about their time spent on Instagram and Instagram anxiety. To understand the association between Instagram and psychological well-being, the study’s first aim was to compare participants who had an Instagram account with those who did not have one. Results revealed that participants with the application reported lower levels of anxiety, depression, and loneliness, and higher levels of self-esteem, than participants who did not have an account. Furthermore, loneliness and self-esteem mediated the association between having an Instagram account and depression and anxiety. The second aim of the study was to examine what factors are associated with Instagram users’ reports of anxiety and depression, focusing specifically on participants who reported having an Instagram account. Results revealed that anxiety and depression were predicted by Instagram anxiety and social comparison, respectively. Overall, these results show that Instagram is associated with psychological well-being. However, when Instagram users experience Instagram anxiety or engage in social comparison, it is associated with poorer psychological outcomes. This research provides an insight into the psychological impact that Instagram can have on its users. ","",""

Participants were 17- to 27-year-old Australian men who used Instagram ( N = 118). Frequency of viewing fitspiration content was not directly associated with body satisfaction or reasons for exercise. However, significant indirect pathways were observed through greater muscular-ideal internalisation and appearance comparison tendency. Viewing more fitspiration content was associated with greater muscular-ideal internalisation and higher appearance comparison tendency, which in turn was associated with less body satisfaction, more appearance-based exercise motivation and less health-based exercise motivation. Fitspiration appears to be more closely related to appearance than health in men. ","",""

Participants were 195 young women (18–30 years old) who were randomly allocated to view either body-positive, thin-ideal, or appearance-neutral Instagram posts. Results showed that brief exposure to body positive posts was associated with improvements in young women’s positive mood, body satisfaction and body appreciation, relative to thin-ideal and appearance-neutral posts. In addition, both thin-ideal and body-positive posts were associated with increased self-objectification relative to appearance-neutral posts. Finally, participants showed favourable attitudes towards the body positive accounts with the majority being willing to follow them in the future.

Findings indicate that when pre- and early adolescents engage in online self-presentation, they can generate feedback such as likes on social media. Although such positive appraisals are positively associated with their self-esteem, they also appear to provoke an increased dependence on social approval, which is paradoxically related to decreased self-esteem.

To address this research gap, we conduct a quantitative survey among 148 homeless individuals in Hawai'i to examine how Facebook use (vs. nonuse) is associated with demographic characteristics, social capital levels, cell phone use, and instrumental uses of the Internet. Results showed that homeless Facebook users are more likely to be younger and female as compared with nonusers. Homeless Facebook users also exhibited significantly higher levels of bonding social capital than did nonusers. Also, homeless Facebook users were more likely than nonusers to use the Internet to search for jobs. Finally, Facebook users were significantly more likely to have their own cell phones, access the Internet from their cell phones, and be heavier cell phone users than Facebook nonusers. Implications of these findings are discussed.","",""
"2020","The differential impact of network connectedness and size on researchers’ productivity and influence","ABSTRACT We analyze the effect of different types of online and offline ties – acquaintanceship, advice, and co-authorship – on researchers’ productivity and influence. Unlike static studies of networked work, we look at how changes in these networks affected researchers’ performance and influence. Using the number of publications as an indicator of productivity and the number of citations as an indicator of influence, we investigate when researchers were more productive and influential. We study whether their networks were cohesive, if the researchers were central in their networks or linked to central players, and whether their work had more opportunities to be disseminated through diverse, non-redundant ties. Although the connectedness of their networks was positively associated with the researchers’ productivity, it was the non-redundant effective size of the networks that was positively associated with the researchers’ influence.","",""
"2020","The influence of social media use on attitude toward suicide through psychological well-being, social isolation, and social support","ABSTRACT Analyzing national online panel survey data in South Korea, this study explored how social media use is associated with attitude toward suicide. Furthermore, we examined the mediating paths by which social media use is associated with the formation of one's attitude toward suicide mediated by psychological well-being, social support, and social isolation. The study found that psychological well-being and social isolation mediated the relationship between social media use and attitude toward suicide. Social media use was positively associated with psychological well-being and negatively associated with social isolation. A higher level of psychological well-being was related to negative attitude toward suicide, whereas a higher level of social isolation was associated with positive attitude toward suicide. This study provides an understanding of the impact of social media use on attitude toward suicide and implications for suicide-prevention strategy using social media.","",""
"2020","The social academic: a social capital approach to academic relationship management on social media","ABSTRACT Social media platforms offer scholars an additional channel to strengthen their social capital through networking, sharing content, showing appreciation for the work of others, and sharing information about themselves. The present study explores the relationship between demographic factors, academic factors, the relevance attributed to networking, career aspiration, social media use, and social media efficacy and relationship management on social media through a survey of 1,500 academics working in Germany. The results indicate that personal factors such as the relevance attributed to networking, career aspiration, social media use, and social media efficacy are stronger predictors of relationship management than demographic and academic factors. Furthermore, the results indicate that academics tend to create informative static profiles but do not use the potential of social media for dynamic interaction and exchange.","",""
"2020","The Breakup 2.1: The ten-year update","Abstract Since 2007–2008, American undergraduates’ media ecology has changed dramatically without an accompanying transformation in how they use media to end relationships. The similarities in people’s breakup practices between 2008 and 2018 reveal that, regardless of what social media is used, American undergraduates turn to media in moments of breakup as ways to manage three complicated aspects of ending a relationship: untangling all the ways in which people signal intertwined lives, deciphering the quotidian unknowable of another person’s mind, and trying to control who knows what when. This paper explores how rapid shifts in media ecologies may change the ways in which conventionalization around social practices emerges, leading to more norms oriented around what all media accomplish, rather than generating norms around the affordances of a specific medium.","",""
"2020","Digital stigma coping strategies: A meta-analytic review of the association between health-related stigma dimensions and social support messages shared online","Abstract Although stigma is widely accepted to be a multidimensional construct, the implications of its dimensions for social support warrant greater consideration. We conducted a meta-analysis of 31 content analyses to investigate the association between specific dimensions of stigma and the types of social support messages shared in health-related contexts online. Among health conditions where character stigma was greater, information, network, and tangible support were more prevalent. Physical stigma was associated with a higher prevalence of esteem support. Information, emotional, network, and tangible support were more prevalent among health conditions where concealable stigma was greater. Among health conditions where visible stigma was greater, information, and esteem support were more prevalent. Our study contributes to stigma and social support research by providing evidence that health-related stigma has multiple dimensions each with distinct implications for social support. More broadly, this project offers a framework that can be used to examine the ways in which social meanings of health conditions may be translated into digital behavior.","",""

This work is situated within the significant body of social research and popular cultural discourse surrounding the consequences of technology and cultural integration among young adults. Analyzing interviews with 52 participants, I explore how they construct, establish and maintain cultural practices and social norms that shape peer interaction, social networks and interpersonal relationships in offline and online settings. This paper focuses specifically on the emergence of techno-social cultural norms that impact friendship and social network construction. Findings suggest the establishment and maintenance of friendships using social networks frequently includes the use of social media profiles as means to collect social and political attitude data on potential friends. Some participants report the use of such data as essential to the decision-making process utilized while establishing and maintaining offline friendships. Motivations for this practice include safety and security, social normativity and a desire for efficiency. Furthermore, participants articulate a social and politically homogeneous friendship network as a desirable outcome to data collection. These findings contribute to our ongoing understanding of the role of informational echo chambers within a technologically integrated social environment.","",""

As Denmark for long has been one of the countries with relatively most Facebook users and as Facebook plays an important role in everyday life and the public debate, data from Denmark might give good indications of Facebook’s development in general. This paper is based on five consecutive surveys among Danish Internet users, in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 (N between 1200 and 1500 each year). I focus on the use of different parts of Facebook across age groups; the personalized uses like Messenger, private groups and intimate communication, versus “mass media use” like reading news, organizational and political information and taking part in nationwide debates. I also investigate different age groups’ attitudes towards Facebook and whether they see it as a personal or a mass medium. First and foremost, I find notable differences across age groups. I also find that the differences are increasing over the years. In 2015 there were not significant differences in Facebook use across age groups. In 2019 a vast majority of the youngest, aged 18-30, used Facebook dominantly as a personalized medium, highlighting Messenger and private groups as their preferred ways of communication and interaction. The older generations have a much more diversified use, treating Facebook as a personal as well as a mass medium.","",""
"2020","THE ‘SEARCH-FOR METHOD’: EXAMINING INSTANCES OF SUPPORT IN FACEBOOK   GROUPS FOR DONOR-CONCEIVED PEOPLE","Facebook groups represent an important resource for donor-conceived people to access information, seek advice and share their experiences with their peers. Limited research has considered how donor-conceived people create supportive relationships with peers through social media or how this form of social support contributes to donor-conceived people’s health and wellbeing. This work in progress outlines the ‘search-for method’, a practical user-led tool for discussing instances of participation in Facebook groups. The ‘search-for method’ involves inviting participants to search for their name in the search bar of a Facebook group, thereby retrieving data of all instances they have posted in the group. This paper reports on initial findings from applying the ‘search-for method’ to semi-structured interviews with administrators and members (N=30) of Facebook groups for donor-conceived people from across Australia. The ‘search-for method’ enabled the participant and researcher, as co-analysts, to track and examine specific instances of participation and interaction in the group. By scrolling through content on their own device, participants could decide how to frame their stories of support and whether to disclose sensitive information or omit experiences they did not wish to discuss. Broadly, this approach illuminated how individual and collective donor-conceived identities emerged and evolved with and through online group platforms. In doing so, it provided a framework for understanding sociality between donor-conceived peers longitudinally. This paper contributes to understandings of how digital affinities and peer intimacies develop in Facebook groups over time.","",""

My IRB approved dissertation research, which will be completed by AoIR 2020, will examine ‘lurking’ in neighborhood Facebook groups. Through community mapping and interviews of Facebook users enrolled in the same neighborhood Facebook group, this study seeks to describe both the ‘lurker’ literacy practices of Facebook group users and to understand if and how the features of the Facebook social media platform encourage these literacy practices. Given that neighborhood groups are intended for people who live in the same geographic area, there is a likelihood that many members of the group may know one another offline and in real life. Since ‘lurkers’ are groups that are typically not included in academic studies, this research will have broad appeal to scholars across the social sciences. When scholars only examine the role of active contributors and ignore the literacy practices of the silent majority of ‘lurkers’, their findings present an incomplete portrait of the way people engage in participatory culture and how these online experiences influence our offline lives.","",""

Consequently, the lines between work and personal lives have blurred, when constant connection and working across time-zones can be job requirements for workers providing social media support. Studies investigating digital labour, boundary management and Post-Fordism have explored technology’s impact on working conditions, but few have specifically examined the perspectives of social media professionals within the context of 'digital well-being', defined as """"...the ability to look after personal health, safety, relationships and work-life balance in digital settings"""". This pilot study provides an insight into the perceptions of 15 social media professionals from six continents, to examine if current working conditions have impacted their health and well-being. Results indicated that most participants perceived the responsibility for digital well-being to be equally shared between employer and employee. However, the majority of the sample reported experiencing the inability to disconnect from work during their personal time, feelings of stress when managing live events/campaigns, including live-streaming, and being exposed to negative comments and messages when managing online communities. Only three out of the 15 social media professionals interviewed identified measures implemented at their workplaces to promote digital well-being, suggesting employers may perceive their duty-of-care ends when social media professionals leave work for the day even though their responsibilities can follow them home.","",""
"2020","Malicious Social Surveillance and Negative Implications in Romantic Relationships among Undergraduates","In the process of normalizing some surveillance dynamics in a society that has become increasingly more accustomed to infringements of privacy, citizens have been provided with a series of tools that allow them to control their peers. Thus, this paper relates interpersonal electronic surveillance to the negative implications that social networks may have for romantic relationships in the Spanish university context by analyzing three main aspects of interpersonal electronic surveillance: user perception and awareness, the types of pernicious social networking practices involved, and their consequences for romantic relationships. To achieve these objectives, a mixed methodology was used. Specifically, an in-person survey involving 311 respondents and two focus groups of seven and eight members, respectively, were conducted. All of the participants were undergraduate communication students between the ages of eighteen and twenty-six. Findings from the current study show that the respondents believed that social networks incited jealousy and promoted control and surveillance practices, thus making romantic relationships more conflictive and artificial. However, they tended to blame individual uses more than the inner workings of social networks. For instance, some respondents regretted having resorted to certain practices, while others justified those practices because they had allowed for the detection of infidelity-related behaviors. In short, in a context in which social surveillance is now the norm, the monitoring and control of partner profiles was generally accepted even though the respondents called for more education about social networking in order to curtail these pernicious practices and to maintain healthier romantic relationships.","",""

In particular, its penetration has occurred more rapidly in developing and low-income countries with abounding health and psychological disadvantages. Given the understanding that women are more prone to psychological disorders than men, the current research is an effort to examine social media motives and subsequent effects on the psychological well-being of women social media users in Pakistan. The study is based on an online survey conducted to ascertain as to what extent social media use contributes to women’s psychological well-being or otherwise. The survey recorded responses of 240 women selected through purposive sampling technique. SEM-PLS analysis of the collected data revealed that social media usage plays a meaningful role in women’s psychological health. However, results exposed that Pakistani women, under the traditional patriarchal social pressure, not only have to observe cultural norms in online practices but are also forced to adhere to socially constructed gender roles in online spaces. The mixed results suggest conducting extensive research for a deeper insight into the role of social media in psychological well-being of women in other low-income countries.","",""

Guided by adaptive structuration theory and the concept of cognitive automaticity, a survey of 255 individuals aged 18–24 assessed the cognitive processes and communicative meanings associated with the provision of Facebook Reactions and Likes. Although Like and Reaction cues (excluding Angry) were all identified as more literal in meaning than not, specific results indicated: (a) Likes were perceived more faithfully than Reactions; (b) the Like and Love cues were labeled as the most faithful; and (c) Reactions were perceived as more deliberate and less automatic communicative behaviors than Likes. Collective results suggest social media platforms that offer multiple one-click response cues (e.g., Facebook) can afford different communicative opportunities than platforms with a single PDA response option, presenting challenges for future cross-platform research addressing lightweight response cues.","",""

This study is based on the analysis of 22 semi-structured interviews with people who define themselves as “polyamorous” and are active members of the two biggest polyamory groups on Facebook in Italy.The results suggest that people come to the decision to engage in non-monogamous relationships before they join online groups dedicated to this topic. Moreover, specific online groups do not constitute a privileged base from which to recruit new romantic or sexual partners. However, the availability of shared online spaces is important for “giving things a name”, making it easier to share experiences with other group members and more generally off-line, sometimes helping in coming out.","",""

This study aimed to experimentally investigate the effect of such images on body image. Participants were 305 women aged 18–30 years who were randomly assigned to view one of three sets of Instagram images: ‘Instagram vs reality’ images, the ‘ideal’ side alone or the ‘real’ side alone. As predicted, viewing the ‘Instagram vs reality’ and real images resulted in decreased body dissatisfaction relative to the ideal images. Furthermore, the detrimental effects of appearance comparison were much less marked for the ‘Instagram vs reality’ and real images than for the ideal images. It was concluded that ‘Instagram vs reality’ and real posts have the potential to bolster women’s body satisfaction, but more research is needed to assess their longer-term impact. ","",""

This study tested whether higher levels of media literacy can protect against the internalization of a tanned ideal and participation in appearance comparisons online. A total of 151 young Australians aged 18 to 29 years (61 males, 90 females) completed a measure of media literacy before being randomly assigned to view photos of models with either tanned ( n = 77) or pale skin ( n = 74) on social media. Participants completed measures of internalization of a tanned ideal and tendency to make appearance comparisons following exposure to the photos. There were significant negative relationships between level of media literacy skills and both internalization of a tanned ideal and appearance comparisons. Moreover, exposure to tanned models resulted in a higher tendency to make appearance comparisons than exposure to pale models. Results indicate that media literacy skills protect against skin cancer risk factors associated with media exposure. Future interventions to reduce skin cancer risk should address the role of social networking sites in proclaiming tanned skin as ideal and increase skepticism about photos of tanned models online.

With research showing that trust, joy, and anticipation are among the most influential positive emotions in aspects of online communication, determining the environmental factors that may influence communication and interaction is of significant interest. This research aims to identify the ways prosocial actions influence language within an online social community. Using a longitudinal observational analysis of linguistic markers, an analysis was done on an online community, surrounding the game “Fortnite.” At different time intervals, the written dialogue was analyzed for psycholinguistic markers through LIWC to detect variance in tone within the community. Users were queried ( n = 9,037), filtered to meet the inclusion criteria (n = 7,221) and having their posts (n = 1,232,741) assigned to three cohorts, those of pre-prosocial, post-prosocial, and post-reciprocity, depending on the posting date. A statistically significant ( R2 = .572) increase in positive emotion linguistic markers was detected in the data set after the prosocial action was added. A change in motivation did not reduce the use of positive emotion linguistic markers, contrary to what was expected. This research observes how individuals within online communities treat each other and that interaction can be influenced to improve the participant’s experience and the quality of dialogue. This research addresses how game design and human–computer interaction influence human communication and behavior.

It will show how users are prompted toward habits of “healthy” active usership—commenting on posts, direct messaging, and liking, for instance, through the design of the News Feed’s user interface. This article will detail how Facebook users are technologically nudged to choose practices of active behavior on the News Feed for the sake of their own health. This socio-technical configuration brings together contingent evolutionary psychology and neoliberal theories of social capital to construct a model of eudaimonic well-being—normative descriptions of what it means to live well as a human in time. In this way, Facebook will be shown to conceptualize well-being as an outcome of user choice, raising pertinent links to modalities of neoliberal responsibilization as a result. The conclusion will argue that Facebook’s configuration of its ideal user ought to be situated within a historical lineage of governance through habit, and will critically assess the extent to which the discursive and material scripting of the News Feed, which seeks to channel user behavior along “healthy,” predictable, and profitable avenues of interaction, operates as a technology of power entwined with contemporary relations of digital capitalism.

Furthermore, we critically assess the potential of what respondents describe to address the problems of overconnection. We find explicit awareness of the automaticity of use, the value and content of Facebook, and how it makes users feel. We find that users came to practice disconnection at many nested levels of vernacular affordances. Ultimately, we argue that Facebook has become a landscape trap, altering daily life such that individual practices, such as mindful scrolling, cannot overcome the overconnection problems it may create. Mindfulness in this discourse may be power, but it is power to avoid elements of Facebook, not power to transform it. ","",""

"2020","Priming Effects of Social Media Use Scales on Well-Being Outcomes: The Influence of Intensity and Addiction Scales on Self-Reported Depression"," To understand behavior on social media, researchers have created and validated dozens of scales. Many can be sorted into two main categories: those that focus on the intensity of social media use and those that focus on addictive aspects. These scales tend to result in different conclusions regarding people’s well-being: studies asking about addiction find that social media use is often associated with higher reported depression scores, whereas studies focusing on intensity typically find an association with improved well-being. While these different outcomes may be explained by real underlying differences in well-being, the difference may also be due to the priming effects that addiction and intensity scales have on subsequent well-being measures. In this article, we report on two studies that examine priming effects on reported depression for these two types of social media use scales. We examine the possibility that different associations between social media and depression may be caused by the survey design itself, not by underlying differences in depression. In light of our findings, we propose that researchers investigating the relationship between social media and well-being adopt the methodology of asking questions about well-being before questions about social media use to mitigate effects of priming.

Guided by established research on smartphones, social media, and affordances, we used a qualitative approach and conducted field interviews that included photo-elicitation interview (PEI) techniques to examine participants’ private social media data. Our analysis of these rescue decisions reveals why so few people used the official 9-1-1 system. We show how rescue communication often occurs through a socially constructed assessment of risk that involves persuasion by trusted others in their network, regardless of professional qualifications. Furthermore, trusted others can function as proxies and can draw upon mobile social network affordances, helping to compensate for material limitations. The affordances people drew from can be organized into two sets: foundational and amplification. Hierarchical relationships exist among these sets of affordances, and materiality plays a pivotal role in rescue communication. Ultimately, our analysis uncovers the multimodality around people’s decisions to ask for help. ","",""

Building on studies of Simmelian ties, interactive exchange, and phatic communication the study presents six characteristics of public intimacy along with brief examples drawn from users’ experiences on Facebook and Twitter. It is concluded that by mediating the shift from dyad to triad and from triad to mass community social media do not necessarily entail a reduction in intimacy but rather a concretization of social relations. The recursive relationship between interpersonal ties and mass solidarity is sustained and reaffirmed thanks to triadic interactions of public intimacy. ","",""

FRUSTRATION EXPERIENCES WITH NETWORKED MEDIA         AND THE ROLE OF SOCIAL SUPPORT","This proposal investigates experiences of frustration with networked         media from a users’ perspective. It explores how these experiences are resolved and what         role helping friends and family members play in this process. Experiences of frustrations         refer to concrete problems in the use of networked media. The examination of their causes         and elimination helps to better understand the socio-technical logics of commercial media         technologies as well as their impact on everyday life. This study seeks to offer insights         into societal power relations with regard to succeeding in and shaping the ongoing digital         transformation process. It thus contributes to the wider field of digital inequalities         research. Theoretically, my considerations are guided by the concept of media deconvergence         which highlights the disorder and messiness of converging media environments. Furthermore, I         am inspired by the domestication approach and by “broken world thinking"""" (Jackson 2014),         which takes disruptions and failures as a starting point for analyzing socio-technical         change. Insights into novel forms of expertise and changing constellations of support and         neediness were gained on the basis of a qualitative study consisting of visualizations of         support networks and their written reflection and explanation as well as guided interviews         about expertise and mutual support in media usage.","",""
"2021","AFFORDANCES IN DIGITAL DETOX AND PRODUCTIVITY APPS","The smartphone has become a crucial devise in everyday life, providing access to a range of communication, entertainment and utility tools. This has led to concern about intrusive media and worries that tech companies take advantage of our """"easily distracted mind"""". This has also incited a booming app industry where digital detox and productivity apps are offered as tools to restrain smartphone use. The aim of this study is to add new empirical data and a conceptual framework to shed new light on this issue. The analysis is based on descriptions of 70 digital detox and productivity apps retried from the App Store and Google Play. The analysis focus on affordances, and distinguishes between two broad categories: undesign affordances, which comprise affordances that punish or inhibit certain types of use and gamification affordances which, in general, reward the user or encourage certain user behavior. The product description is also subject to a discourse analysis. A general finding is gamification affordances such as rewards, achievements, and ratings are generously used in most apps regardless of what kind of context it is meant to be used. More relentless undesign affordances, such as complete blocking of the smartphone is uses to a much lesser degree. The frequent use of gamification design means that the apps can, paradoxically, direct more attention toward the smartphone.","",""
"2021","Media addictions as Apparatgeist: What discourse on TV and smartphone addiction reveals about society"," Disconnection presents itself as a modern answer to problems of media addiction and overuse. But, is it really novel? Through a thematic analysis of Dutch and American newspaper articles spanning several decades, this study examines public news discourses on TV and smartphone addiction and their imagined solutions. The analysis reveals Apparatgeist: While there are parallels stemming from similar affordances, the discourse surrounding each affliction and its treatment is also unique to its time. While TV addiction discourse alludes to the loss of traditional values, smartphone addiction discourse emphasizes self-governance. Disconnection is framed as a solution but is imbued with moral imperatives regarding the necessity of self-discipline and productive time. Overall, smartphone addiction discourse points toward being “present” and “in touch with one’s authentic Self” as states that are morally valuable and time-worthy, but under stress in contemporary society.

"2021","What do others’ reactions to body posting on Instagram tell us? The effects of social media comments on viewers’ body image perception"," Studies have highlighted the influence of social media comments on users’ perceptual consequences, but whether this holds true in the body image context is still largely unknown. This experimental study investigated the effects of social media comments on ideal body perception and how it influences one’s own body satisfaction. Results showed that comments guided the viewers’ perceptions of what is considered as “ideal” body. Viewers of favorable comments to body posting reported greater idealization of the body imagery (i.e. ideal-enhancing effects), whereas viewers of unfavorable comments showed a lower level of idealization (i.e. ideal-derogating effects). Also, the indirect effects of comments on body satisfaction via idealization were moderated by individual self-discrepancy between personal ideal and own body. This study sheds light on potentially inspiring or protective role of comments against perfect-looking bodies on social media while calling attention to the need for reconsidering the media effects theory for body image.

The present study examined the reciprocal relationships between selfie-related behaviors and both self-objectification and appearance concerns among adolescents using a longitudinal design. Chinese adolescent boys and girls completed questionnaires at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. The key constructs included selfie-posting, selfie-editing, selfie-viewing, self-objectification, facial dissatisfaction, and body dissatisfaction. Results indicated that selfie-editing, but not selfie-posting, predicted increases in adolescents’ self-objectification and appearance concerns (both body and face) over time. Selfie-viewing predicted increases in self-objectification and facial dissatisfaction, but not body dissatisfaction over time. In the other direction, adolescents’ antecedent levels of self-objectification predicted increases in subsequent selfie-related behaviors. In addition, adolescents’ facial dissatisfaction positively predicted selfie-viewing and selfie-editing but not selfie-posting over time, whereas body dissatisfaction had no influence on subsequent selfie-related behaviors among adolescents. Findings from this study provide new insights into the reciprocal relationships between selfie-related behaviors and body image. ","",""
"2021","Applying the Uses and Gratifications Model to Examine Consequences of Social Media Addiction"," The purpose of this research is to test the uses and gratifications model (U&amp;G) with respect to addictive outcomes for young adult social media users. Two cross-sectional survey studies were completed with college students aged 18–25 years. Study 1 applied path analysis with regression to determine how individual traits, motives, and dependency related to intrusive and emotional consequences of addiction ( N = 373). Results indicated that, among other predictor variables, being dependent on social media for personal understanding was associated with increased emotional consequences of addiction. In Study 2, the functional alternative of interpersonal interaction and frequency of social media use were included to more fully test the U&amp;G model with structural equation modeling ( N = 446). Interpersonal interaction was a significant predictor in the intrusive consequences model. Participants who reported engaging in more offline interpersonal interactions that engaged in heavy use of social media found it to be more intrusive in their lives. In addition, being dependent on social media to understand oneself mediated the relationships between various motives and emotional consequences of addiction. Taken together, results of these studies supported U&amp;G. Contextual age variables were found to be related to motives, dependency, and addictive consequences. In addition, motives in both studies were important variables in explaining addictive consequences. ","",""
"2021","Birds of a Feather Flock Together Online: Digital Inequality in Social Media Repertoires"," Communication has long been concerned with people’s media repertoires, yet little of this approach has extended to the combination of social media platforms that people use. Despite their considerable popularity, research has found that people do not select into the use of social network sites (SNSs) randomly, which has implications for both whose voices are represented on them and where messaging can reach diverse people. While prior work has considered self-selection into one SNS, in this article we ask: how are different SNSs linked by user base? Using national survey data about 1,512 US adults’ social media uses, we build networks between SNSs that connect SNS pairs by user base. We examine patterns by subgroups of users along the lines of age, gender, education, and Internet skills finding considerable variation in SNS associations by these variables. This has implications for big data analyses that depend on data from particular social media platforms. It also offers helpful lessons for how to reach different population segments when trying to communicate to diverse audiences. ","",""
"2021","Plurality in the Measurement of Social Media Use and Mental Health: An Exploratory Study Among Adolescents and Young Adults"," On a daily basis, individuals between 12 and 25 years of age engage with their mobile devices for many hours. Social Media Use (SMU) has important implications for the social life of younger individuals in particular. However, measuring SMU and its effects often poses challenges to researchers. In this exploratory study, we focus on some of these challenges, by addressing how plurality in the measurement and age-specific characteristics of SMU can influence its relationship with measures of subjective mental health (MH). We conducted a survey among a nationally representative sample of Dutch adolescents and young adults ( N = 3,669). Using these data, we show that measures of SMU show little similarity with each other, and that age-group differences underlie SMU. Similar to the small associations previously shown in social media-effects research, we also find some evidence that greater SMU associates to drops and to increases in MH. Albeit nuanced, associations between SMU and MH were found to be characterized by both linear and quadratic functions. These findings bear implications for the level of association between different measures of SMU and its theorized relationship with other dependent variables of interest in media-effects research.

"2021","Implications of Facebook Engagement Types and Feed’s Social Content for Self-Esteem via Social Comparison Processes"," Self-esteem, generally understood as subjective appraisal of one’s social worth and qualities, is related to how people use social media and the gratifications derived from their use—processes driven in part by social comparison. Two major components of the social media experience drive social comparison processes: (1) what content people engage with (feeds content) and (2) how they engage with such content (engagement type). We conducted an eye-tracking study ( N = 38), to measure viewing time spent on individual Facebook posts and paired this measurement with clicking behaviors. We found that spending more time looking at posts and clicking on more of them was associated with lower self-esteem for people with more social content on their feeds. We discuss the importance of examining browsing behaviors as a combination of viewing time, clicking, and feed’s content—especially given its potential impact on well-being outcomes such as self-esteem via social comparison processes.

To overcome methodological limitations of earlier research, we present a mixed-methods study. Forty-one participants were interviewed and asked to identify five weak, medium, and strong ties each and to report on perceived and actually received social support (emotional, informational, instrumental, and appraisal) associated with each. Complicating traditional understandings of “the strength of weak ties,” the qualitative analyses of actual support events show that both emotional and informational support is provided by strong ties. In an additional quantitative between-subjects study design, 352 participants were asked about various aspects of a weak, medium, or strong tie. These results indicate that participants valued their strong ties more regarding every form of support. Although there were only weak correlations between perceived and recalled actually received support, people also report actual support events with strong ties to be more helpful—overall suggesting the strength of strong ties.

"2022","Tox and Detox","Introduction The public sphere includes a range of credible discourses asserting that a proportion of teenagers (“teens”) has an unhealthy dependence upon continuous connection with media devices, and especially smartphones. A review of media discourse (Jaunzems et al.) in Australia, and a critical review of public discourse in Australia and Belgium (Zaman et al.), reveal both positive and negative commentary around screentime.  Despite the “emotionally laden, opposing views” expressed in the media, there appears to be a groundswell of concern around young people’s dependence upon digital devices (Zaman et al. 120). Concerns about ‘addiction’ to and dependency on digital media first emerged with the Internet and have been continually represented as technology evolves. One recent example is the 2020 multi-part Massey Lecture series which hooked audiences with the provocative title: “we need to reclaim our lives from our phones” (Deibert). In Sydney, a psychology-based “outpatient addiction treatment centre” offers specialised recovery programs for “Internet addiction”, noting that addicts include school-aged teens, as well as adults (Cabin). Such discourse reflects well-established social anxieties around the disruptive impacts of new technologies upon society (Marvin), while focussing such concern disproportionately upon the lives, priorities, and activities of young people (Tsaliki and Chronaki). While a growing peer-reviewed evidence base suggests some young people have problematic relationships with digital media (e.g. Odgers and Robb; Donald et al.; Gaspard; Tóth-Király et al.; Boer et al.), there are also opposing views (e.g. Vuorre et al.) Ben Light, for instance, highlights the notion of disconnection as a set of practices that include using some platforms and not others, unfriending, and selective anonymity (Light). We argue that this version of disconnection and what we refer to as ‘detox’ are two different practices. Detox, as we use it, is the regular removal of elements of lived experience (such as food consumption) that may be enjoyable but which potentially have negative consequences over time, before (potentially) reintroducing the element or pratice. The aims of a detox include ensuring greater control over the enjoyable experience while, at the same time, reducing exposure to possible harm.    There is a lack of specific research that unequivocally asserts young people’s unhealthy dependence upon smartphones. Nonetheless, there appears to be a growing public belief in the efficacy of “the detox” (Beyond Blue) or “unplugging” (Shlain). We argue that a teen’s commitment to regular smartphone abstinence is non-fungible with ‘as and when’ smartphone use. In other words, there is a significant, ineluctable and non-trivial difference between the practice of regularly disconnecting from a smartphone at a certain point of the day, or for a specified period in the week, compared with the same amount of time ‘off’ the device which is a haphazard, as and when, doing something else, type of practice.   We posit that recurrent periods of smartphone abstinence, equating to a regular detox, might support more balanced, healthy and empowered smartphone use. Repeated abstinence in this case differs from the notion of the disconnected holiday, where a person might engage in irregular smartphone withdrawal during an annual holiday, for example (Traveltalk; Hoving; Stäheli and Stoltenberg). Such abstinence does have widespread historical and cultural resonance, however, as in the fasting practices of Islam (the month of Ramadan), the Christian season of Lent, and the holy Hindu month of Śravaṇa. Where prolonged periods of fasting are supplemented by weekly or holy-day fasts, they may be reprised with a regularity that brings the practice closer to the scheduled pattern of abstinence that we see as non-fungible with an unstructured as-and-when approach. An extreme example of the long fast and intermittent fast days is offered by the traditional practices of the Greek Orthodox church, whose teachings recommend fasting on Wednesdays and Fridays as well as on religious holy days. With the inclusion of Lent, Greek Orthodox fasting practices can comprise 180 fast days per year: that’s about half of available days.     As yet, there is no coherent evidence base supporting the benefits of regular intermittent disconnection. The Australian mental health Website Beyond Blue, which asserts the value of digital detox, cannot find a stronger authority to underpin a practice of withdrawal than “Research from Deloitte’s annual Mobile Consumer Survey report” which indicates that “44 per cent of people in Australia think their phone use is a problem and are trying to reduce how much time they spend on it” (Beyond Blue).  Academic literature that addresses these areas by drawing on more than personal experience and anecdote is scarce to non-existent. Insofar as such studies exist over the past decade, from Maushart to Leonowicz-Bukała et al., they are irregular experiments which do not commit to repeated periods of disconnection. This article is a call to investigate the possibly non-fungible benefits of teens’ regularly practicing smartphone disconnection. It argues that there is actual evidence which is yet to be collected. New knowledge in this area may provide a compelling dataset that suggests verifiable benefits for the non-fungible practice of regular smartphone disconnection. We believe that there are teenagers, parents and communities willing to trial appropriate interventions over a significant period of time to establish ‘before’ and ‘after’ case studies. The evidence for these opinions is laid out in the sections that follow.    Teens’ Experiences of Media, Smartphone, and Other Cultural Dis/connection  In 2018, the Pew Research Center in the US surveyed teens about their experiences of social media, updating elements of an earlier study from 2014-15. They found that almost all (95%) the 743 teens in the study, aged between 13 and 17 when they were surveyed in March-April 2018, had or had access to a smartphone (Anderson and Jiang). A more recent report from 2021 notes that 88% of US teenagers, aged 13-18, have their own smartphone (Common Sense Media 22). What is more, this media use survey indicates that American teens have increased their screen entertainment time from 7 hours, 22 minutes per day in 2019 to 8 hours, 39 minutes per day in 2021 (Common Sense Media 3). Lee argues that, on average, mobile phone users in Australia touch their phones 2,617 times a day. In Sweden, a 2019 study of youth aged 15-24 noted a pervasive concern regarding the logical assumption “that offline time is influenced and adapted when people spend an increasing amount of time online” (Thulin and Vilhelmson 41). These authors critique the overarching theory of young people comprising a homogenous group of ‘digital natives’ by identifying different categories of light, medium, and heavy users of ICT. They say that the “variation in use is large, indicating that responses to ubiquitous ICT access are highly diverse rather than homogenously determined” (Thulin and Vilhelmson 48). The practice or otherwise of regular periods of smartphone disconnection is a further potential differentiator of teens’ digital experiences. Any investigation into these areas of difference should help indicate ways in which teens may or may not achieve comparatively more or less control over their smartphone use.  Lee argues that in Australia “teens who spend five or more hours per day on their devices have a 71% higher risk factor for suicide”. Twenge and Campbell (311) used “three large surveys of adolescents in two countries (n = 221,096)” to explore differences between ‘light users’ of digital media (&lt;1 hour per day) and ‘heavy users’ (5+ hours per day). They use their data to argue that “heavy users (vs. light) of digital media were 48% to 171% more likely to be unhappy, to be low in well-being, or to have suicide risk factors such as depression, suicidal ideation, or past suicide attempts” (Twenge and Campbell 311). Notably, Livingstone among others argues that emotive assertions such as these tend to ignore the nuance of significant bodies of research (Livingstone, about Twenge). Even so, it is plausible that teens’ online activities interpolate both positively and negatively upon their offline activities. The capacity to disconnect, however, to disengage from smartphone use at will, potentially allows a teen more opportunity for individual choice impacting both positive and negative experiences. As boyd argued in 2014: “it’s complicated”. The Pew findings from 2018 indicate that teens’ positive comments about social media use include:  81% “feel more connected to their friends”; 69% “think it helps [them] interact with a more diverse group of people”; and 68% “feel as if they have people who will support them through tough times.” (Anderson and Jiang)  The most numerous negative comments address how of all teens:  45% “feel overwhelmed by all the drama there”; 43% “feel pressure to only post content that makes them look good to others”; and 37% “feel pressure to post content that will get a lot of likes and comments.” (Anderson and Jiang)  It is notable that these three latter points relate to teens’ vulnerabilities around others’ opinions of themselves and the associated rollercoaster of emotions these opinions may cause. They resonate with Ciarrochi et al.’s argument that different kinds of Internet activity impact different issues of control, with more social forms of digital media associated with young females’ higher “compulsive internet use […] and worse mental health than males” (276). What is not known, because it has never been investigated, is whether any benefits flowing from regular smartphone disconnection might have a gendered dimension. If there is specific value in a capacity to disconnect regularly, separating that experience from haphazard episodes of connection and disconnection, regular disconnection may also enhance the quality of smartphone engagement. Potentially, the power to turn off their smartphone when the going got tough might allow young people to feel greater control over their media use while being less susceptible to the drama and compulsion of digital engagement. As one 17-year-old told the Pew researchers, possibly ruefully, “[teens] would rather go scrolling on their phones instead of doing their homework, and it’s so easy to do so. It’s just a huge distraction” (Anderson and Jiang). Few cultural contexts support teens’ regular and repeated disengagement from smartphones, but Icelandic society, Orthodox Judaism and the comparatively common practice of overnight disconnection from smartphone use may offer helpful indications of possible benefits.  Cross-Cultural and Religious Interventions in Smartphone Use Concern around teens’ smartphone use, as described above, is typically applied to young people whose smartphone use constitutes an integral part of everyday life. The untangling of such interconnection would benefit from being both comparative and experimental. Our suggestions follow. Iceland has, in the past, adopted what Karlsson and Broddason term “a paternalistic cultural conservatism” (1). Legislators concerned about the social impacts of television deferred the introduction of Icelandic broadcasting for many years, beyond the time that most other European nations offered television services. Program offerings were expanded in a gradual way after the 1966 beginnings of Iceland’s public television broadcasting. As Karlsson and Broddason note, “initially the transmission hours were limited to only a few hours in the evening, three days a week and a television-free month in July. The number of transmission days was increased to six within a few years, still with a television-free month in July until 1983 and television-free Thursdays until 1987” (6).  Interestingly, the nation is still open to social experimentation on a grand scale. In the 1990s, for example, in response to significant substance abuse by Icelandic teens, the country implemented an interventionist whole-of-Iceland public health program: the Icelandic Prevention Model (Kristjansson et al.). Social experimentation on a smaller scale remains part of the Icelandic cultural fabric. More recently, between 2015 and 2019, Iceland ran a successful social experiment whereby 1% of the working population worked a shorter work week for full time pay. The test was deemed successful because “workers were able to work less, get paid the same, while maintaining productivity and improving personal well-being” (Lau and Sigurdardottir). A number of self-governing Icelandic villages operate a particularly inclusive form of consultative local democracy enabling widespread buy-in for social experiments. Two or more such communities are likely to be interested in trialling an intervention study if there is a plausible reason to believe that the intervention may make a positive difference to teens’ (and others’) experiences of smartphone use. Those plausible reasons might be indicated by observational data from other people’s everyday practices. One comparatively common everyday practice which has yet to be systematically investigated from the perspective of evaluating the possible impacts of regular disconnection is that practiced by families who leave connected media outside the bedroom at night-time. These families are in the habit of putting their phones on to charge, usually in a shared space such as a kitchen or lounge room, and not referring to them again until a key point in the morning: when they are dressed, for example, or ready to leave the house. It is plausible to believe that such families might feel they have greater control over smartphone use than a family who didn’t adopt a regular practice of smartphone disconnection. According to social researchers in the Nordic nations, including co-authors Kjartan Ólafsson and Elisabeth Staksrud, it is likely that an Icelandic community will be keen to trial this experience of regular smartphone disconnection for a period of six months or more, if that trial went hand in hand with a rigorous evaluation of impact.    Some religious communities offer a less common exemplar for teens’ regular disconnection from their smartphone. Young people in these communities may suspend their smartphone (and other media use) for just over a full day per week to focus on deepening their engagement with family and friends, and to support their spiritual development. Notable among such examples are teenagers who identify as members of the Orthodox Jewish faith. Their religious practices include withdrawing from technological engagement as part of the observance of Shabbat (the Sabbath): at least, that’s the theory. For the past ten years or so in Australia there has been a growing concern over some otherwise-Orthodox Jewish teens’ practice of the “half-Shabbat,” in which an estimated 17-50% of this cohort secretly use digital media for some time during their 25 hours of mandated abstinence. As one teacher from an Orthodox high school argues, “to not have access to the phone, it’s like choking off their air” (Telushikin). Interestingly, many Jewish teens who privately admit practicing half-Shabbat envision themselves as moving towards full observance in adulthood: they can see benefits in a wholehearted commitment to disengagement, even if it’s hard to disengage fully at this point in their lives. Hadlington et al.’s article “I Cannot Live without My [Tablet]” similarly evokes a broader community crisis around children’s dependence on digital media, noting that many children aged 8-12 have a tablet of their own before moving onto smartphone ownership in their teens (Common Sense Media 22). We appreciate that not every society has children and young people who are highly networked and integrated within digital dataflows. Nonetheless, while constant smartphone connectivity might appear to be a ‘first world problem’, preparing teens to be adults with optimal choice over their smartphone use includes identifying and promoting support for conscious disengagement from media as and when a young person wishes. Such a perspective aligns with promoting young people’s rights in digital contexts by interrogating the possible benefits of regularly disconnecting from digital media. Those putative benefits may be indicated by investigating perspectives around smartphone use held by Orthodox Jewish teenagers and comparing them with those held by teens who follow a liberal Jewish faith: liberal Jewish teens use smartphones in ways that resonate with broader community teens. A comparison of these two groups, suggests co-author Lynne Cohen, may indicate differences that can (in part) be attributed to Orthodox Jewish practices of digital disconnection, compared with liberal Jewish practices that don’t include disconnection. If smartphone disconnection has the potential to offer non-fungible benefits, it is incumbent upon researchers to investigate the possible advantages and drawbacks of such practices. That can be done through the comparative investigation of current practice as outlined above, and via an experimental intervention for approximately six months with a second Icelandic/Nordic community.   The Potential Value of Investigating the (Non-)Fungibility of Digital Engagement and Digital Inactivity The overarching hypothesis addressed in this article is that a lived experience of regular smartphone disconnection may offer teenagers the opportunity to feel more in control of their personal technologies. Such a perspective aligns with many established media theories. These theories include the domestication of technology and its integration into daily life, helping to explain the struggle teens experience in detaching from digital media once they have become a fundamental element of their routine. Domestication theory asserts that technology moves from novelty to an integral aspect of everyday experience (Berker et al.). Displacement theory asserts that young people whose lives are replete with digital media may have substituted that media use for other activities enjoyed by the generations that grew up before them, while boyd offers an alternative suggestion that digital media add to, rather than displace, teens’ activities in daily contexts. Borrowing inputs from other disciplinary traditions, theories around mindfulness are increasingly robust and evidence-based, asserting that “attentiveness to what is present appears to yield corrective and curative benefits in its own right” (Brown et al. 1). Constant attention to digital media may be a distraction from mindful engagement with the lived environment. A detailed study of the non-fungible character of smartphone disconnection practices might offer an evidence base to support suggestions, such as those proffered by Beyond Blue, that a digital detox benefits mental health, resilience, and sociality. Such information might support initiatives by schools and other organisations central to the lives of teenagers to institute regular digital disconnection regimes, akin to Iceland’s experiments with television-free Thursdays. These innovations could build upon aligned social initiatives such as “no email Fridays” (Horng), which have been trialled in business contexts. Further, studies such as those outlined above could add authority to recommendations for parents, educators, and caregivers such as those recommendations contained in papers on the Common Sense Media site, for example, including Tweens, Teens, Tech, and Mental Health (Odgers and Robb) and Device-Free Dinners (Robb). Relevantly, the results from such observational and intervention studies would address the post-COVID era when parents and others will be considering how best to support a generation of children who went online earlier, and more often, than any generation before them. These results might also align with work towards early-stage adoption of the United Nations’ General Comment No. 25 on Children’s Rights in Relation to the Digital Environment (UNCRC). If so, an investigation into the fungibility or otherwise of digital abstention could contribute to the national and international debate about the rights of young people to make informed decisions around when to connect, and when to disconnect, from engagement via a smartphone.

This may lead users to adopt unrealistic ideals of physical appearance. In a two-part study with college students, this investigation explored associations between general use of Snapchat lenses and body image concerns, and experimentally examined how taking selfies with Snapchat lenses influences appearance satisfaction. Taking more photos using Snapchat lenses, in general, was associated with greater body image concerns. However, there was little experimental evidence indicating that taking selfies with lenses influences state appearance satisfaction relative to an appearance-neutral control. There was no evidence of gender moderation. Notably, taking more selfies without lenses until reaching one satisfactory for posting on social media was associated with greater body image concerns.

"2022","Evolution of audience duplication networks among social networking sites: Exploring the influences of preferential attachment, audience size, and niche width"," This study examines the evolution of social networking sites (SNSs) from a networked audience duplication perspective. Guided by social network theory, the theory of double jeopardy, and niche theory, this study proposes an integrated framework to explain the evolution of SNS choices of the US audience between 2016 and 2019. Shared traffic data were retrieved from comScore’s Media Metrix Multi-Platform database. The empirical results of the separable temporal exponential random graph model (STERGM) confirm that preferential attachment, audience size, and niche width significantly drive the likelihood of tie formation and dissolution in the evolving audience duplication network. These effects hold true even when other endogenous structural features and exogenous nodal attributes are taken into account. Theoretical implications for the networked media landscape are discussed.

"2022","The associations of active and passive social media use with well-being: A critical scoping review"," A recurring claim in the literature is that active social media use (ASMU) leads to increases in well-being, whereas passive social media use (PSMU) leads to decreases in well-being. The aim of this review was to investigate the validity of this claim by comparing the operationalizations and results of studies into the association of ASMU and PSMU with well-being (e.g. happiness) and ill-being (e.g. depressive symptoms). We found 40 survey-based studies, which utilized a hodgepodge of 36 operationalizations of ASMU and PSMU and which yielded 172 associations of ASMU and/or PSMU with well-/ill-being. Most studies did not support the hypothesized associations of ASMU and PSMU with well-/ill-being. Time spent on ASMU and PSMU may be too coarse to lead to meaningful associations with well-/ill-being. Therefore, future studies should take characteristics of the content of social media (e.g. the valence), its senders (e.g. pre-existing mood), and receivers (e.g. differential susceptibility) into account.

In this quantitative study, we examined how SMNSU can directly and indirectly influence depression, with loneliness and social anxiety examined as mediator variables. A 39-item questionnaire was used to collect survey data on SMNSU, loneliness, social anxiety, and depression from 244 blended learning undergraduate students from universities in the Hunan province in China. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was conducted using SmartPLS 3.3.3 to measure the relationships between the stated variables of interest. Results indicated that SMNSU has a direct, significant, and positive relationship with depression. In terms of mediating effects, both loneliness and social anxiety have an intervening role in the association between SMNSU and depression. This study focused on the higher education sector of China by recruiting students who were enrolled in blended learning courses during the COVID-19 pandemic and experiencing psychological problems. We found that excessive SMNSU is associated with depression. Loneliness and social anxiety also increase depression along with excessive SMNSU among blended learning students during unprecedented situations, in this case, the COVID-19 pandemic. The valuable implications of these findings for teachers, counselors, and university managers are discussed, along with a consideration of future research directions. ","",""

"2022","Instagram Photo Sharing and Its Relationships With Social Connectedness, Loneliness, and Well-Being"," Photo sharing is one of the most popular online social media activities and has been associated with changes in mental health. Research investigating the effect of sharing photos on a social media user’s social connectedness, loneliness, and well-being has generated conflicting results. This study analyzed the effect of Instagram photo sharing on the relationships among social connectedness, loneliness, and well-being. The study focused on photos sharing separate to viewing photos to understand the specific effect of photo sharing. The research measured how those with transient and chronic levels of loneliness respond differently to photo sharing, which has not been previously considered. Well-being and loneliness are conceptualized as dependent variables that have a relationship with social connectedness as an independent variable, which is moderated by the number of photos shared. Results from an online survey of 373 participants found Instagram photo sharing does significantly moderate relationships among social connectedness, loneliness, and well-being. Highest levels of photo sharing were found to have the largest moderating effect. Levels of well-being decreased as social connectedness and photo sharing increased. Differences were found for types of loneliness where photo sharing was most beneficial at low levels of social connectedness for transient loneliness. In contrast, for those experiencing chronic trait loneliness, high levels of photo sharing were associated with highest levels of loneliness when social connectedness was high. One obvious implication for social media and policy may lie in education for users and technology enhancement for optimal photo sharing levels that minimize loneliness and maximize well-being.

Our study uses interview data collected from Black high school students in Detroit ( N = 24) to examine their experiences and perceptions as they prepare for the transition to post-secondary education. In contrast to traditional social capital perspectives that tend to dominate social media scholarship, we instead employ a Community Cultural Wealth framework to reveal how students access distinctive forms of cultural resources via online and offline interactions. Our findings suggest students used social media to access cultural wealth as they (1) developed post-secondary educational aspirations, (2) planned to navigate the post-secondary admissions process, (3) resisted stereotypes about youth from Detroit, and (4) engaged in platform-switching to cultivate their college information networks online.

"2022","How Social Media, FoMO, and Isolation Influence Our Perceptions of Others Who “Break the Rules”"," Research has suggested that social media usage increases during times of social isolation. However, rather than making users feel more connected to others, social media may cause negative mental health and relational outcomes, including a fear of missing out (FoMO). Against the backdrop of the global coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, this health communication study sought to understand the impact of physical and emotional isolation (i.e., prescribed social isolation) on people as we turned to social media more frequently. As the pandemic wore on, many remained online, watching people they knew “returning to normal,” potentially creating high levels of FoMO despite disagreeing with others’ decisions. This study examines whether social media use (frequency and purpose) influences individuals’ perception of the acceptability of others’ behavior, and whether those perceptions impact individuals’ own behavioral decisions. Participants ( N = 459) from the United States were recruited from late 2021 to early 2022 to complete an anonymous online survey regarding the “acceptableness” of behavior shown in posts by friends and family. Results indicated that increased social media frequency was correlated with an increased sense of FoMO, which was significantly and positively associated with favorable perceptions of others’ behaviors, such as gathering indoors with others, even when public health officials discouraged it. However, FoMO was not significantly related to users’ personal intentions to follow public health recommendations. A post hoc analysis determined that fear of COVID-19 moderated the relationship between FoMO and the perception of others’ behavior, as well as the relationship between FoMO and behavioral intentions.

"2022","Differing Relationships Between Instagram and Twitter on Suicidal Thinking: The Importance of Interpersonal Factors"," Suicide is a major public health problem. For young adults in the United States, the rate of death by suicide has increased substantially. The evidence for the effects of social media on mental health are contradictory. However, there is limited research investigating effects of social media usage on suicide ideation. Given the interpersonal nature of social media (SM), we examined the relationship between Instagram, Twitter, and suicidal ideation in the context of the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide in 449 young adults. We found a significant indirect effect of Instagram use on lower suicide ideation through lower perceived burdensomeness. Our results are inconsistent with the literature demonstrating negative mental health effects associated with SM usage. Rather, our results indicate that some SM platforms may be associated with positive mental health outcomes. Our results also demonstrate that different SM platforms may result in differing effects on mental health and interpersonal factors specifically. Future research should examine the content and activities that users engage in while using SM to provide a deeper understanding of these relationships. ","",""

Is it the kind of problematic media use that takes over one’s life or just habitual ritualized use characterized by mindless scrolling? How can we differentiate between the two based on the use of Instagram features and perceived gratifications from the technology itself? Drawing on the theoretical framework of Uses and Gratifications (U&amp;G) and U&amp;G 2.0, we conducted a survey study ( N  = 482) to answer these questions. Our findings show that habitual Instagram use is positively related to the use of lurking- and connection-related features and the gratification of play. By contrast, problematic Instagram use is positively correlated with the use of broadcasting-related features and the gratification of novelty. Theoretical implications for differentiating problematic from habitual Instagram use and practical implications for designing ethical interfaces, which consider the digital well-being of users, are discussed.

This exploratory study explores the correlations among media use, anxiety, and wellbeing in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey questionnaire was designed to measure the following five constructs: media dependency, media attention, anxiety, wellbeing, and collectivism. A total of 722 respondents in China participated in the survey from November 2020 to December 2020. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the data. Our findings indicate that respondents who report collectivist norms tend to experience higher levels of wellbeing (and lower levels of anxiety), regardless of their scores for media use, media attention, or media dependency. Conversely, those respondents who record low collectivism tend to have higher levels of anxiety (and lower wellbeing), even if they report lower media use, attention and dependency during the pandemic. Study results also found that anxiety mediates the relationship between media use and wellbeing. Our introduction of collectivism as a possible moderating variable represents a significant contribution to current academic debates and suggests the inclusion of cultural factors for future studies on media use and anxiety/wellbeing during public health crises.

"2022","Weak ties matter: Social network dynamics of mobile media multiplexity and their impact on the social support and psychological well-being experienced by migrant workers"," This study investigates the contextual and relational characteristics that underlie people’s information and communication technology (ICT) use and the implications for their well-being. We contextualize this investigation according to migrants, because they are faced with disruptions to their personal networks in the migration process that may attenuate the availability of social support and negatively affect their mental health. Migrants tend to be proficient in using mobile ICT to connect with different social ties to fulfill their needs, which potentially makes a difference to their psychological well-being. Through a survey of 504 internal migrant workers in China, we examined the social network factors that underlie multiple mobile ICT use and the attendant influences on social support and psychological well-being. Redressing the overemphasis on the importance of strong ties in extant literature, this study highlights the salience of mobile media multiplexity (i.e., the use of multiple mobile communication channels for social interactions) in weak tie communication and the greater contribution of weak ties toward social support and psychological well-being than strong ties. Our findings suggest that mobile-mediated communicative relationships with newer and more distanced social connections outside their immediate circles enhance the well-being of migrants. We contend that media multiplexity vis-à-vis weak ties underscores the reconfiguration of migrants’ communicative relationships following the separation from original ties and facilitates rewarding interactions with new ties.

"2022","Digital detox: An effective solution in the smartphone era? A systematic literature review"," Smartphone use, e.g., on social network sites or instant messaging, can impair well-being and is related to clinical phenomena, like depression. Digital detox interventions have been suggested as a solution to reduce negative impacts from smartphone use on outcomes like well-being or social relationships. Digital detox is defined as timeouts from using electronic devices (e.g., smartphones), either completely or for specific subsets of smartphone use. However, until now, it has been unclear whether digital detox interventions are effective at promoting a healthy way of life in the digital era. This systematic literature review aimed to answer the question of whether digital detox interventions are effective at improving outcomes like health and well-being, social relationships, self-control or performance. Systematic searches of seven databases were carried out according to PRISMA guidelines, and intervention studies were extracted that examined timeouts from smartphone use and/or smartphone-related use of social network sites and instant messaging. The review yielded k = 21 extracted studies (total N = 3,625 participants). The studies included interventions in the field, from which 12 were identified as randomized controlled trials. The results showed that the effects from digital detox interventions varied across studies on health and well-being, social relationships, self-control, or performance. For example, some studies found positive intervention effects, whereas others found no effect or even negative consequences for well-being. Reasons for these mixed findings are discussed. Research is needed to examine mechanisms of change to derive implications for the development of successful digital detox interventions. ","",""
"2023","A history of features for online tie breaking, 1997-2021","Abstract Online spaces provide opportunities for creating ties with other people, allowing us to communicate and share content with them. Sometimes, though, we wish to break some of these ties; we wish not only to friend and to follow, but to unfriend and unfollow as well. In this paper, we present a history of the many features for online interpersonal disconnectivity, showing how they have developed over time. We present five main findings: the language of tie breaking is consistently bureaucratic; over time, the features for tie breaking tend to operate on the feed rather than on social ties themselves; platforms are more reactive than proactive when it comes to tie breaking features; new ways for preventing interactions are launched over time; and the features for tie breaking sometimes create what we call “impossible social situations.” This approach shines a spotlight on a neglected aspect of social media, and opens up new ways of thinking about how the platforms conceive of–and construct–online sociability.","",""

Evidence from the Health Behavior in School-aged Children study in 43 countries","ABSTRACT Research on the social determinants of Problematic Social Media Use (PSMU) among adolescents is scant and focused on proximal contexts and interpersonal relationships. This study examines the relation of PSMU with economic inequality, measured at country, school and individual levels. It also evaluated the moderating role of family and peer support in these associations. The 2017/18 Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) study measured PSMU in 179,049 adolescents aged 11-, 13- and 15-year-olds in 43 countries and sub-regions of Belgium (Flanders and Wallonia) and the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, and Wales). Associations between inequality and PSMU were tested using multilevel logistic regression analyis. Results showed that adolescents who were relatively more deprived than their schoolmates and attended more economically unequal schools had a higher likelihood of reporting PSMU. In addition, school wealth inequality was more closely related to PSMU among adolescents with lower levels of peer support. A similar effect of country income inequality was found, but only in adolescents who reported low family support. Our findings expand the existing literature on the detrimental impact of inequalities in different social contexts on adolescent wellbeing by showing the role of inequalities in the engagement in PSMU.","",""

This current study draws upon a three-wave longitudinal panel (N = 355) and focuses on the link between Facebook use and depression. Results from the cross-lagged panel analyses showed that increased Facebook use (t1) leads to increased depression (t2) which further leads to greater Facebook use (t3). This relationship is further enhanced when the role of envy is accounted for. Specifically, more Facebook use (t1) leads to greater users’ envy (t2) which leads to more depression (t3).

There has been only limited empirical investigation of parents’ Facebook practices in the years following babyhood. This article examines patterns of Facebook use among parents of children aged between two and eight based on interviews and observations. In contrast to earlier phases of parenting, many users had adopted selective modes of engagement or were seeking to step back from the platform. Parents’ accounts highlight the affective dimensions of their enactments of Facebook for information and support. Situated in the literature on connective and disconnective strategies on Facebook, I argue that the affective forces users experience in relation to Facebook extend beyond what we would traditionally think of as the boundaries of the Facebook user assemblage, with experiences of anxiety and judgment continuing after the choice to disconnect. Parents who remained active users had developed strategies to know with the technology, and to manage its affective forces.","",""

With substantially reduced face-to-face interactions, many people may have relied heavily on social media for connection, information, and entertainment. However, little is known about the psychological and physical health implications of social media use during strict lockdown. The current study investigates the associations of social media use with psychological well-being and physical health among Wuhan residents (N = 1214). Our findings showed that non-COVID related self-disclosure was positively associated with psychological well-being, while COVID related information consumption and sharing were negatively associated with psychological well-being. Further, more generic use of social media was associated with lower psychological well-being, which in turn related to more somatic symptoms. Quarantined people used social media more frequently than non-quarantined people. Importantly, the negative association between social media use and psychological well-being was significantly stronger for quarantined people than unquarantined people.","",""

Using data from a representative sample of Finnish social media users, this article studies both aspects of social media job attainment by analyzing how much individuals successfully apply for jobs and get recruited to positions through social media. Results show that the prevalence of successfully applying to jobs through social media does not differ statistically between socio-economic groups, but the prevalence of getting recruited to jobs through social media is greater within higher socio-economic groups. LinkedIn users are more likely to get recruited to a job, while strategic networking and posting of professional content increase the chances of both successfully applying and getting recruited to a job through social media. The findings demonstrate that in social media-mediated job market, job seekers’ online behavior affects one’s exposure to job leads and career opportunities.","",""

We used a mixed-method approach combining survey and interview research to analyze how international students’ social media use and perceived social support/adjustment are associated with their sense of mental well-being when taking into account demographic and social psychological characteristics. Our findings show that international students spent an increased amount of time on social media during the pandemic for both networking and information seeking purposes. Those who use social media primarily for networking purposes reported better mental health, whereas social media use for information seeking was not significantly associated with their mental health. Social support was an important predictor of international students’ social media use.

Consumers who are more active on social media and had high (vs low) Fear of Missing Out expressed more favorable attitudes toward online products after being exposed to Instagram content (vs not exposed). The theoretical and practical implications for cognitive processing research and advertising strategy and study limitations are discussed. ","",""
"2023","Permanent connectedness and its impact on news sharing"," The ubiquitous use of Internet-connected media enables individuals to stay in constant touch with personal contacts in an “always-on” society. Consequently, some individuals have developed the habit of being permanently connected with others through digital media. This article examines the psychological and political consequences of permanent connectedness. Analysis of two independent sets of data collected via a two-wave panel survey and an online experiment reveals that, over time, permanent connection—the behavior of constantly engaging in mediated communication—increased the perception of permanent togetherness with others, which I label as permanently connected perception. This perception was in turn positively associated with news sharing through the belief that information one shares online can instantly be received and responded to by online contacts as it is shared. Findings emphasize the “spillover” influence of permanent connectedness, in which perpetual mediated communication encourages political behavior, news sharing, and the role of the permanently connected perception in mediating this process.

"2023","How behavioral homophily on social media influences the perception of tie-strengthening within young adults’ personal networks"," This study examines how social media and information-sharing behavior can influence young adults’ perceptions of changes in tie strength within their own personal networks. By focusing on the extended personal networks (27.56 relationships) of young adults, we show that social media leads them to feel closer to their “friends” whom they think of as exhibiting online behaviors similar to their own. This behavioral homophily mainly stems from frequent reactions between friends, when they like or comment upon each other’s posts. Such homophily is also related to the sharing of political news and entertaining content, which constitute a salient affordance in the “pervasive awareness” of social media and lead users to feel closer to those exhibiting similar content-sharing behavior. This similarity reveals how social media platforms help to shape personal networks over time, particularly by influencing user relationships with weak ties who share similar online behavior. ","",""
"2023","Toxic positivity on social media: The drawbacks and benefits of sharing positive (but potentially platitudinous) messages online"," Sharing positive messages on social media can produce positive outcomes for message senders due to self-effects—the effect of sending messages on message senders themselves. In this domain, one question is whether the performative display of positivity can engender positivity. By examining the sharing of personal experiences in a positive manner on social media, several boundary conditions to self-effects were found: displaying positivity is beneficial to message senders only if message senders have higher (vs. lower) self-esteem or if they experience less (vs. more) toxicity—defined as the suppression of the negative aspects of one’s perceived reality due to engagement with or sending a positive message. Otherwise, displaying positivity can dampen enjoyment or make message senders reluctant to commit to their public self-presentations. However, after people receive feedback from friends, perceived social approval is a better predictor of enjoyment and commitment than displaying positivity. ","",""

One hundred and twenty-two young Italian women (Mage = 22.29 ± 2.26 years) were randomly assigned to three different conditions of daily exposure on Instagram (i.e., body-positive, fitspiration and neutral content) and followed with an experience sampling method over a period of 28 consecutive days. Comparisons between groups were performed via multilevel regression modelled as a linear growth model. Results showed that daily exposure to body-positive images was associated with the highest rates of growth of positive mood and body satisfaction. Daily exposure to fitspiration images was associated with the highest rates of growth of negative mood and appearance comparison. In conclusion, the body-positive movement may be considered in interventions aimed at improving young women’s body image. Fitspiration content on Instagram should be deemed inappropriate. ","",""
"2023","Tie strength and media use in friendships across the course of a year: Testing media multiplexity theory’s third proposition"," Although central to media multiplexity theory’s logic, the proposition that tie strength and media multiplexity mutually cause each other has received limited empirical test. This study evaluated this proposition via survey data collected from friends in Spring 2020 and Spring 2021, examining their friendship across the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. When examining retrospective reports of the relationship pre-pandemic, results supported the claim that media multiplexity predicts tie strength; in contrast, longitudinal results between Spring 2020 and Spring 2021 supported the claim that tie strength predicts media multiplexity. These findings may indicate a need for clearer boundary conditions for the theory, as well as more thorough consideration of the explanatory mechanisms that underlie the link between multiplexity and tie strength.

The current cross-sectional study examined how preadolescents’ different (i.e., authentic and inauthentic) online presentation strategies, as well as the social feedback these representations receive, are associated with their perceived attractiveness. The results of our study ( n = 638; 52.4% girls, 9–13 years, Mage = 10.94, SDage = 0.85) showed that more truthful online self-presentation practices coincided with feeling more positive about one’s appearance. A significant moderation effect was found for social feedback, with the association becoming stronger as levels of online feedback (e.g., online popularity, likes, comments, and tags by other users) increased. Contrary to our expectations, inauthentic self-presentation was negatively related to preadolescents’ perceived attractiveness, while no significant interaction effect with online feedback was found.

"2023","Will Using Social Media Benefit or Harm Users’ Self-Esteem? It Depends on Perceived Relational-Closeness"," Prior research concerning social media use and self-esteem showed inconsistent findings. In the current research, two studies were conducted to examine the moderating role of perceived relational-closeness between social media use and self-esteem, and the underlying mediating mechanisms. In Study 1 (a quasi-experimental study), by assigning participants to the weak (reporting TikTok use intensity) or strong (reporting WeChat use intensity) relational-closeness condition, we found that using social media with weak relational-closeness harmed users’ self-esteem, while using social media with strong relational-closeness benefited users’ self-esteem. Moreover, participants in the strong relational-closeness condition reported higher social support perception and self-esteem than those in the weak relational-closeness condition. Further analyses showed that upward social comparison mediated the relationship between social media use and self-esteem in the weak relational-closeness; in the strong relational-closeness condition, upward social comparison and perceived social support both mediated the relationship between social media use and self-esteem, but perceived social support played a dominant role in the mediating effects. In Study 2 (an experimental study), we presented the same examination experiences-sharing for all participants. We found that, even exposed to the same stimuli, participants in the strong relational-closeness condition (declaring that the experiences-sharing was extracted from QQ) still reported higher social support perception and self-esteem than those participants in the weak relational-closeness condition (declaring that the experiences-sharing was extracted from Bilibili). The current research provided a possible explanation to reconcile previously inconsistent findings about social media use and self-esteem. ","",""
"2023","Scrolling Through the COVID-19 Pandemic: Exploring the Perceived Effects of Increased Social Media Use on the Mental Health of Undergraduate University Students"," Social media has become increasingly integrated into the lives of students for the past decade; however, the public health restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have led to a sharp increase in social media use in a short period of time. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of social media use on university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fifteen students from a mid-sized Canadian city were interviewed to share their experiences with social media during the COVID-19 pandemic. Purposive sampling was conducted to gather a diverse sample of participants, including individuals of various ages, gender and sexual identities, and ethnicities. Thematic analysis on the 15 interviews was completed using NVivo (version 12). Participants experienced both advantages and disadvantages associated with social media use. Ease of communication and stress relief were acknowledged as the strongest benefits. Social comparison, loneliness, development of bad habits, and lack of focus were cited as major disadvantages to social media use during the pandemic. Cost–benefit analysis of social media was common, and participants expressed the importance of using social media with moderation, balance, and awareness. Our study indicates that the focus on health with respect to the pandemic should not be solely based on physical health, rather the potential mental health risks associated with social media use during the pandemic should be recognized and addressed by healthcare providers.

"2023","User-Defined Relationships: Exploring the Dynamics of Attachment Style and Motives, Activities, and Outcomes of Social Network Sites"," The rise of social network sites (SNSs) provided users with new ways to initiate and maintain personal relationships. Numerous functions (e.g., messaging, sharing, and reacting on content) allow for social interaction customized to distinct relationship needs and behaviors. This study investigated the associations of attachment style with distinct SNS usage patterns. Furthermore, the relationships of SNS (1) motives, (2) activities, and (3) outcomes were examined. In line with previous research, attachment anxiety was strongly related to SNS use. It predicted all relational SNS motives and activities. In contrast, high avoidance predicted a higher motive to use SNS to maintain autonomy, less monitoring activity, and higher scores on social media addiction. SNS motives (i.e., intimacy) partially mediated the relationship of attachment style on SNS activities. Furthermore, certain SNS motives, activities, and combinations of both aspects fully mediated the associations between attachment dimensions and social media addiction. The findings indicate that neglecting the mediating role of SNS motives and activities might partly account for inconsistencies in previous findings. ","",""
"2023","Non-Sexualized Images and Body-Neutral Messaging Foster Body Positivity Online"," The body-positive movement is one of many decentralized, user-generated movements on social media that seek to engender positive societal change. In support of the body-positive movement, social media users employ a variety of messages and images to advocate for more inclusive beauty standards across different online platforms. We examine how the nature of body-positive messaging (mainstream body positivity vs body neutrality), the degree to which images are sexualized (sexualized vs non-sexualized), and the platform that hosts body-positive content (Instagram/Flickr/blog) influence how people evaluate body-positive content online. The results indicate that the more participants felt messaging was body-neutral, the more morally appropriate and less self-interested they found the posts. The extent to which participants felt messaging was morally appropriate also led them to embrace more inclusive beauty standards. Moreover, non-sexualized (vs sexualized) images were rated more morally appropriate and less self-interested. Implications for promoting body positivity and other prosocial movements online are discussed. ","",""

This study explored social media utilization patterns among young Asian American adults and their effect on perceived family influence on lifestyle behaviors. Methods: The study analyzes data from Asian American young adults (aged 18–35 years) participating in an online survey in March 2021. Results: A total of 739 Asian Americans participated in the survey: 45.6% East Asian, 23.4% Southeast Asian, and 22.7% South Asian. Common social media platforms include Facebook Messenger (60.9%) and Instagram (57.0%). US-born Asian Americans reported higher odds of using Instagram (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.64, 95% CI: [1.09, 2.46]) than foreign-born Asian Americans. Higher acculturation was associated with lower odds of using Instagram among South Asians (AOR: .46, 95% CI: [.24, .83]) and greater odds of using Instagram among East Asians (AOR: 1.72, 95% CI: [1.09, 2.75]). Interacting with mothers using Facebook and Instagram had a higher perceived influence on one’s ability to improve sleep (AOR: 2.08, 95% CI: [1.19, 3.65]; AOR: 2.53, 95% CI: [1.15, 5.55]) and develop stress-management strategies (AOR: 1.73, 95% CI: [1.02, 2.96]; AOR: 4.05, 95% CI: [1.83, 9.49]). With one’s siblings, Facebook was associated with a lower perceived influence on avoiding risky substances (AOR: .48, 95% CI: [.23, .97]), and WhatsApp was associated with a higher perceived influence on one’s ability to develop stress-management strategies (AOR: 3.10, 95% CI: [1.26, 7.78]) and form/maintain relationships (AOR: 2.58, 95% CI: [1.02, 6.58]).

"2024","How will your relationship be remembered?: virtual relational curation following a breakup","ABSTRACT The Relationship Dissolution Model (RDM) was used to analyze what and why virtual possessions people retain or delete after a romantic relationship breakup. Participants (N = 406) completed online open-ended survey questions to understand their decision-making process for retaining or deleting relationship possessions. Upon completing an emergent thematic analysis, findings showed that people retained and deleted virtual possessions for a variety of reasons, including documenting memory, documenting emotion, managing the past – moving on, and managing the present – emotional regulation. Based on these findings, the RDM was adapted to include a relationship curation process, which describes the management of relationship memories tied to virtual possessions. The implications offer a foundation for expanding on memory management processes.","",""
"2024","A network analysis approach to core symptoms and symptom relationships of problematic social media use among young adults","ABSTRACT Problematic social media use (PSMU) is a new and potentially addictive behavior causing a public health issue among young adults. PSMU has been extensively researched; however, prior studies primarily focus on the direct or indirect correlation of PSMU and other proximal or distal variables, rather than examining links with distinct factors or the importance of each factor in the development of PSMU. The current study, based on the Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution model aimed to investigate the relationship between PSMU, the intensity and extent of social media usage, personal characteristics, negative emotions and cognitions, and self-control using network analysis. A total of 896 Chinese young adults (Mage = 20.57, SD = 2.00) were included in this study. The results showed that state-fear of missing out had the closest association with PSMU, followed by social network site usage intensity, social media self-control failure, and social media engagement, which were the strongest risk factors of PSMU. Social media engagement, fear of missing out, and social media self-control failure were the most core co-occurring symptoms with PSMU. Neuroticism was a distal factor that influenced the whole network. This study contributed to the conceptualization and visualization used to explain the development of PSMU and provided important theoretical and practical implications.","",""
"2024","Slantwise disengagement: Explaining Facebook users’ acts beyond resistance/internalization of domination binary"," This theoretical and empirical investigation builds upon the concept of ‘slantwise behavior’ to further complicate notions of the ‘digital disengagement’ of subjects within technological infrastructures such as Facebook. It has been previously suggested that the ubiquity of the data privacy paradox is the most common reason for disengagement practices. Our study contributes to this discussion by examining subjects’ disengagement on Social Network Sites (SNS). While numerous concepts concerning disconnection and disengagement from SNS have been conceptualized by media theorists, largely based on a binary construct of resistance or domination, our work proposes an alternative conceptualization of subjects’ disengagement. By employing a qualitative methodological approach and using 30 semi-structured interviews to capture subjects’ discursive patterns, we illustrate that disengagement on Facebook can be seen as a hybrid reaction and a complex phenomenon in which certain disconnection practices cannot be easily classified as resistance practices or as indications of the internalization of domination but rather are best understood as slantwise behaviors, that is, actions that may unintentionally lead to obfuscation.

In response to alarming rates of body dissatisfaction among college women, particularly in comparison to a Meta Inc. study, which highlighted the disproportionate impact of social comparison on young females, this research delves into the firsthand accounts of young females regarding their past and current experiences, perceptions, and usage trends on the platform. Through interviews, recurring themes emerged, indicating that many female participants engaged in social comparison on Instagram, yielding both positive and negative outcomes. Participants reported adverse effects on mental and physical well-being due to comparisons on social media, aligning with existing literature. The study further revealed that participants intentionally adjusted their habits to mitigate the negative impact of social comparison, shedding light on the evolving usage, comparison, and perceptions of social media users in response to unwanted effects during young adulthood. ","",""

However, less is known regarding prospective, bidirectional, or mediating effects. In line with sociocultural theory, this study used a three-wave design to examine direct and indirect effects between social media use and body satisfaction, via thin-ideal and muscular-ideal internalisation and social comparisons. Adolescents ( n = 1911; Mage = 14.27, SD = 1.08) were invited to complete three surveys over 1 year. Cross-lagged panel models indicated acceptable fit for two social media use operationalisations, with better fit statistics for the appearance-focused use rather than photo-based activities model. Despite largely no direct effects, indirect effects were found. Social comparisons mediated the relationships over time, whereby higher social media use predicted higher comparisons, which predicted lower body satisfaction. The reverse direction was also found. Gender invariance indicates that prevention aimed at reducing comparisons may be suitable for boys and girls. ","",""

This qualitative study describes the lived experiences and perceptions of social media use among Nigerian adults with vision impairment, using a transcendental approach. Findings showed that people with vision impairment experienced a reduction in social connectedness due to their vision impairment, but those who used social media were able to enhance social connectedness, increase social interaction, develop social relationships and expand their social networks. Participants described social media as a good medium for learning and education as it enabled ready access to information. Results indicated that supporting adults with vision impairment experiencing reduced social connectedness to engage with social media could help improve their social well-being. ","",""

We summarised them into a unique model by performing a multiple linear regression to evaluate the role-played by offline components in the development/reinforcement of digital capital. The interaction between these new indexes and the digital capital index shows that, with the exception of the political component, all offline backgrounds positively contribute to digital capital. Moreover, the multiple regression analysis shows that the economic and social components have the strongest influence on digital capital. ","",""

The aim of this study was to investigate the strength and nature of the relationship between MD and SNSs among men in the general population. With SNSs allowing users to view and interact with online content, this study focussed on three SNS activities: (a) viewing men’s celebrity and fashion content, (b) viewing fitness-related content and (c) the importance of received likes and comments. Young men ( N = 95) completed an online questionnaire recording demographic information, SNS activities and MD symptomatology. A hierarchal regression revealed that the importance of received likes and comments significantly predicted MD symptomatology over and above demographic factors. These findings reflect a need to emphasise the interactive components of SNSs within body image literature. ","",""

As such, this study tests the premise that FoMO can be understood as a self-regulatory limbo, arising from deficits in psychological need satisfaction and/or lower well-being. This limbo is suggested to lead to reciprocal relations between these constructs, yet no study so far has formally put this to the test. At the between-person level, all variables were related. At the within-person level, part of a reciprocal trajectory for FoMO and social media use was found. FoMO at T1 predicted social media use at T2, which subsequently predicted FoMO at T3. The results provide partial evidence of a self-regulatory limbo and raise questions about current theorizing in which such a process is believed to arise from deficits in psychological need satisfaction and psychological well-being.

We computationally analyzed three million Facebook posts to test whether user reactions (likes, shares, loves, and cares) reflect biophilia gratification derived from human-created nature on social media, that is, mediated nature. Ten percent of posts that are image-based (approximately 170,000) were also randomly selected and analyzed. The results showed that social media users were more likely to react to most posts (particularly image-based posts) of mediated nature compared with nonmediated nature posts. These findings may imply that user reactions on social media may serve as indicators of biophilia gratification fulfilled through engagement with mediated nature. ","",""

In doing so, we draw on qualitative data about the forms of disconnection experienced, negotiated, and enacted by low-income families in regional Australia before and during their participation in a digital inclusion initiative that provided them with Internet connections and laptops. We argue that their experiences illustrate the complex interplay of voluntary and involuntary factors that shape socially situated practices of disconnection. We also identify further implications for inclusion and disconnection research, including the need to recognise that within digital inclusion initiatives, participants’ non-use of provided technologies does not necessarily indicate failure but may instead be a positive outcome.

To examine these relationships, we used two-wave panel data ( Nw1 &amp; w2 = 657) gathered among Belgian adolescents (14–18 years). Structural equation analyses indicated that peer appearance conversations were associated with increased perceived task relevance and credibility of social media ideals.

However, due to increasing use of social media, individuals might feel availability pressure to be online and production pressure to post content, which might result in negative consequences. The present study aims to disentangle the relationships between active social media use (private interactions), active public social media use (broadcasting), and passive social media use (monitoring) in relation to digital pressure and life satisfaction. The results of a two-wave panel survey with N = 415 late adolescents and young adults ( Mage = 19.08, SD = 1.57, 58.31% female) reveal a longitudinal reciprocal relationship between active public use and production pressure. However, availability pressure positively predicts active social media use over time, suggesting increase in private interactions due to perceived peer’s expectations to be reachable over social media. In contrast, production pressure is related to lower active social media use, thus placing focus on active public broadcasting instead. Notwithstanding the reciprocal interplay between social media use and digital pressure, the present study does not demonstrate harmful consequences of digital pressure on life satisfaction. ","",""

Anchored in the differential susceptibility to media effects model, we examined adolescents’ (1) individual motives and (2) moods leading to social media use, (3) the nature of this use, (4) their affective responses, and (5) perceived longer-term effects. Through deductive thematic analysis, we noted large homogeneity in motives for social media use but heterogeneity in moods leading to social media use. In addition, our findings revealed heterogeneity and duality in the affective responses and the perceived long-term effects of social media use. This duality, where the same individual is affected in both positive and negative ways by social media use, appeared in various forms: concurrently, when adolescents experience conflicting feelings simultaneously, such as feeling both envy and inspiration; alternately, when adolescents shift between experiences, such as feelings of connection and isolation; and sequentially, for example, where initial enjoyment gradually turns into boredom. Furthermore, duality appeared across different cognitive and affective aspects of well-being. Directions for future research are provided on how to examine the role and meaning of various forms of homogeneity, heterogeneity, and duality in the relationship between adolescents’ social media use and well-being.

"2024","Happiness and Sadness in Adolescents’ Instagram Direct Messaging: A Neural Topic Modeling Approach"," We investigated the expressions of happiness and sadness in adolescents’ direct messages (DMs) on Instagram. Using neural topic modeling ( BERTopic), we analyzed 211,778 DMs belonging to 96 adolescents, who donated data from 101 Instagram accounts. Results showed that (1) expressions of happiness were more than four times more prevalent than expressions of sadness; (2) the number of DMs containing expressions of happiness and expressions of sadness were highly correlated; (3) there are temporal trends in the expression of happiness and sadness in adolescents’ DMs, and there are individual differences in these trends; and (4) there is no significant between- or within-person relationship between the number of DMs containing expressions of happiness and sadness and adolescents’ well-being.

"2024","The Ethoses of (Dis)Connecting with Friends on Social Media: Digital Cocooning and Entrepreneurial Networking among People with Eating Disorders"," Recent media studies conversations on disconnection or reducing mainly the quantity of engagement with social media so as to enhance well-being have suggested that these practices articulate a contemporary spirit focused on self-care and performance (productivity) that does not consider others or collective solutions. Drawing on and pushing forward disconnection research, we put forward a Foucauldian inspired concept of ethos that draws attention to qualitatively different principles and values characterizing social media socialities which users seek to foster and avoid. Interviews with people ( n = 31) with eating disorders (EDs) featured what we call digital cocooning; that is, interaction with trusted real-life friends and family afforded by messaging apps characterized by mutual responsiveness, acceptance, and belonging. However, what we term entrepreneurial networking with wider acquaintances mostly on traditional social media was experienced as evaluative and competitive and fuelled a sense of non-belonging, prompting unfriending. Disconnection research has highlighted how social media (dis)connections are often underpinned by contemporary possessive individualism, obscured by the dominant research on ostensibly universal psychological processes. The concept of ethos pushes this research beyond criticism toward also highlighting alternatives or how social relations in social media and society could be imagined otherwise. ","",""
"2024","Visual interpersonal communication on social network sites in romantic relationships","  Based on a research project examining visual communication in close relationships in Switzerland, this study examines interpersonal communication between romantic partners on social network sites (SNSs). It explores (1) the role of SNSs in couples’ communication repertoires and (2) the social functions accomplished in the exchange of visual elements on SNSs. Sixty-three semi-structured couple and individual in-depth interviews with romantic partners (N = 42) were conducted, including network drawings for visual elicitation. The results suggest that interpersonal communication on SNSs is intertwined with mass self-communication on SNSs and other channels that make up the communication repertoires of romantic partners. The partners nearly exclusively exchanged visual elements through interpersonal communication on SNSs, accomplishing four social functions: phatic communication, visual references to shared experiences and shared knowledge, functional sharing, and inspirational sharing. This study extends understanding of the importance of communicative interdependence in the field of interpersonal communication and the significance of visual communication on SNSs in maintaining romantic relationships.

"2024","Escaping the rough life of the street: Roofless people and mobile social media"," Roofless people are among the most vulnerable, marginalized, and silenced societal groups. However, access to social media through mobile devices may provide opportunities for battling their stigmatization, social exclusion, low self-esteem, and self-acceptance. This study aims to explore how people who are experiencing rooflessness use and represent themselves on social media. This qualitative study, using thematic analysis of 16 in-depth interviews, reveals that roofless people may use social media to increase their social capital, advocate for other homeless people, and, most importantly, escape or reconstruct the reality of life on the street through continuous online social interaction and revalidation of oneself.

"2025","Experience machines for well-being? Understanding how social media entertainment matters for teens"," This article explores how social media entertainment matters for teens and does so by connecting experiences to conditions crucial for well-being. I ask if and how teens experience the content they seek and encounter on TikTok, YouTube and Instagram as worthwhile and meaningful. To answer this question, I analyse qualitative interviews with Norwegian teens. The analysis portrays how teens experience social media entertainment as meaningful in how content connects to self-formation processes, to the need for belonging, and to the agency they perceive to have in user-platforms relations. Theoretically, the study draws on two overlapping but currently unconnected fields of research: media psychology-informed entertainment studies and a capabilities approach. My theoretical aim is to elucidate how these fields complement and contrast each other in relating media experience to well-being. I argue that media psychology offers an operationalization of the same well-being conditions that are central in a capabilities approach, while the latter opens a space for a critique of the platform economy.

"2025","Me, myself, and I: Self-presentation, self-esteem, and uses and gratifications on Facebook, LinkedIn, and TikTok","Empirical evidence has suggested a positive correlation between authentic self-presentation on social media and improved mental health and well-being. False self-presentation, conversely, may bring about negative outcomes to subjective and psychological well-being. Our study examines the different selves that users present, as well as factors influencing self-presentation, on social media platforms. Results from 392 survey responses suggest that, first, users present themselves differently on Facebook, LinkedIn, and TikTok; generally, they tend to present their real and ideal selves more than the false selves. Second, users seek significantly different uses and gratifications from different social media platforms (e.g., maintaining existing relationships on Facebook, meeting new people and socializing on LinkedIn, or entertainment purposes on TikTok); nevertheless, education and information is a common motivation for social media use. Third, social media uses and gratifications, social media usage, and self-esteem are influential factors of users’ self-presentation on social media. The dynamics of these influential factors, however, differ across platforms. Theoretical implications, as well as empirical suggestions to enhance the quality of social media interactions, are further discussed.","",""
"2025","Lonely and online:  An investigation of social media use and social isolation in China","Research on the link between social media and well-being has lead to ambiguous findings — some research has found a positive, negative, and mixed relationship between the two. We employ the case of China, in which social media is controlled in important ways, as a useful alternative case to gain leverage on these ambiguities. Using data from a nationwide survey of Chinese citizens (n=2,292), we principally find that individual, heterogeneous effects are an important driver of the relationship between levels of social media use and reported well-being. Additionally, our results lend support to a FOMO (fear of missing out) mechanism as an important driver of the relationship while not finding support for the mechanism of exposure to negative content on social media as a predictor of well-being. Finally, our findings suggest that institutional context may not play an important role in the social media — social isolation relationship.","",""
"2025","Exploring subjective sociocultural understandings of “fear of missing out” (FoMO) and the unsettled self in a time of deep mediatization"," The public sphere has become increasingly digitalized and transformed by the intermeshing of social media platforms and mobile devices cultivating reimagined selves. The negative impact of living in a deeply mediatized world has fostered a phenomenon both in the public mind and academic discourse known as “fear of missing out” or by its acronym FoMO. Historically, and consistent with the “media effects” tradition, hundreds of studies have highlighted the psychological and behavioral dimensions of this construct, noting its negative effects. In opposition to the “effects” paradigmatic studies, we utilize social constructionist mediatization theory and Q methodology as frameworks for audience research that foreground subjectivity and understandings concerning the mediations of FoMO as a sociocultural construct. A total of 37 millennials and post-millennials Q sorted 55 statements resulting in three selfhood factors. Both dominant and counter “hegemonic” accounts were uncovered in the factors, respectively, identified as envy/exclusion, grounded vigilance, and managed vulnerability. ","",""
"2025","Serial mediation effects of ubiquity and notification on the relationship between habitual social media checking behaviors and self-control failures"," This study investigated the correlation between habitual checking behavior and self-control failure during social media use among South Korean university students. The study also examined how the ubiquity of and immediate responses to social media notifications affect this relationship, both independently and serially. An online survey was conducted with 400 undergraduate students at South Korean universities. The findings indicate a significant positive relationship between habitual checking behaviors and self-control failure in South Korean university students’ social media use. Ubiquity mediated habitual checking behaviors and self-control failure; ubiquity and immediate responses to notifications mediated the relationship between habitual checking behavior and self-control failure; and ubiquity and immediate responses to notifications serially mediated the relationship between habitual checking behavior and self-control failure. The results highlight the social media use challenges of university students and the factors that contribute to self-control failure in this context. ","",""
"2025","Posting photos that reflect positive aspects of everyday life on Instagram increases appreciation, life satisfaction, and happiness"," We conducted two studies to verify whether using Instagram to post photos that reflect positive aspects of one’s life increased appreciation and subsequently improved well-being. In the correlational Study 1, participants ( N = 291) were regular users of Instagram, and in the randomized controlled trial Study 2 ( N = 283), they were newcomers. We found that regular users are motivated to use Instagram to capture life’s positive moments, and their higher frequency of posting was associated with increased appreciation and, in turn, greater life satisfaction and happiness (Study 1). New users, regardless of whether they were instructed to post positive photos (experimental conditions) or not (control conditions), posted exactly this kind of content. The more positive the photos were, the higher participants’ appreciation, life satisfaction, and happiness (Study 2). Posting appreciative content on social media might have a beneficial impact on users’ well-being and become a foundation for future interventions. ","",""
"2025","Go big or go home: Examining the longitudinal relations between exposure to successful portrayals on social media and adolescents’ feelings of discrepancy"," Social media abound with successful portrayals in nearly every life domain (e.g. appearance, social life). Many researchers have expressed concerns about such portrayals, claiming that they might be detrimental to adolescents’ self-development. More specifically, continuous exposure to successful portrayals on social media may encourage adolescents to perceive these portrayals as standards to meet, which might evoke feelings of discrepancy (i.e. the feeling of falling short of important standards). The results of a three-wave longitudinal study ( N = 1032, Mage = 14.55, SD = 1.65) revealed that exposure to different types of successful portrayals on social media (i.e. attractive appearance and a perfect life) does not relate to feelings of discrepancy over time, and vice versa at a within-person level. Yet, between-person associations were present for both types of successful portrayals with feelings of discrepancy. Hence, our findings stress the importance of taking into account both between- and within-person relations when examining social media effects. ","",""
"2025","OnlyFans use and satisfactions with oneself and others: The role of upward social comparison","             OnlyFans is a patronage platform primarily for sexually explicit content. Unlike professionally produced pornography, OnlyFans allows users to actively select their subscriptions and engage directly with creators. However, little is known about how the use of OnlyFans relates to various satisfaction with oneself and others. This study (             n              = 293) explores the association of OnlyFans usage—including viewing and interaction—with different types of satisfaction: sexual self-esteem, relational satisfaction with sexual partners, and sexual satisfaction. The study also examined the role of upward comparisons (e.g. comparing oneself to performers, comparing sexual partners to performers, and comparing one’s sex life to depicted performances) in these dynamics. Contrary to expectations based on previous pornography research, the data revealed a positive relationship between OnlyFans use and satisfaction through upward comparisons. The findings suggest that OnlyFans use was associated with upward comparisons with content creators, which in turn may relate to increased sexual knowledge, skill development, and inspiration.

"2025","No Consistent Evidence for Between- and Within-Person Associations Between Objective Social Media Screen Time and Body Image Dissatisfaction: Insights From a Daily Diary Study"," With the abundance of social media content that promotes unrealistic beauty standards, there are growing concerns about the potential negative impact of social media use on body image satisfaction. While some studies highlight negative associations, others present null effects, pointing to methodological limitations like biased and unreliable self-reported screen time measures and a focus on singular platforms. Addressing these gaps, our study employed a daily diary method to objectively measure social media screen time across six major platforms ( Twitter, Reddit, TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook), alongside daily body image dissatisfaction among 252 young adults ( Mage = 21.67 years, 67.77% female) over 7 days. Through multilevel modeling, our analysis revealed no significant within- or between-person associations between social media screen time and body image dissatisfaction, a finding consistent across all platforms. In addition, the lack of association between social media screen time and body image dissatisfaction was consistent across several exploratory moderators such as sex, self-esteem, and perfectionistic self-presentation. The current study did not find strong evidence supporting the concerns surrounding the potential detrimental link between social media screen time and body image dissatisfaction. ","",""

Furthermore, social media addiction and emotional exhaustion were significant mediators between future uncertainty stress and psychological distress. These findings could enrich the understanding of how uncertainty stress contributes to psychological distress in an era characterized by pervasive digital connectivity.","",""
