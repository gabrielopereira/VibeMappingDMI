"2000","Matinees, Summers and Opening Weekends","       Newspapers and the 7:15 Showing       Cinemagoing involves planning. Even in the most impromptu instances, one         has to consider meeting places, line-ups and competing responsibilities.          One arranges child care, postpones household chores, or rushes to finish         meals. One must organise transportation and think about routes, traffic,         parking or public transit. And during the course of making plans for a         trip to the cinema, whether alone or in the company of others, typically         one turns to locate a recent newspaper. Consulting its printed page lets         us ascertain locations, a selection of film titles and their corresponding         show times. In preparing to feed a cinema craving, we burrow through a         newspaper to an entertainment section, finding a tableau of information         and promotional appeals. Such sections compile the mini-posters of movie         advertisements, with their truncated credits, as well as various reviews         and entertainment news. We see names of shopping malls doubling as names         of theatres. We read celebrity gossip that may or may not pertain to the         film selected for that occasion. We informally rank viewing priorities         ranging from essential theatrical experiences to those that can wait for         the videotape release. We attempt to assess our own mood and the taste of         our filmgoing companions, matching up what we suppose are appropriate         selections. Certainly, other media vie to supplant the newspaper's role         in cinemagoing; many now access on-line sources and telephone services         that offer the crucial details about start times. Nonetheless, as a         campaign by the Newspaper Association of America in Variety aimed to         remind film marketers, 80% of cinemagoers refer to newspaper listings for         times and locations before heading out. The accuracy of that         association's statistics notwithstanding, for the moment, the local daily         or weekly newspaper has a secure place in the routines of cinematic life.        A basic impetus for the newspaper's role is its presentation of a         schedule of show times. Whatever the venue -- published, phone or on-line         -- it strikes me as especially telling that schedules are part of the         ordinariness of cinemagoing. To be sure, there are those who decide what         film to see on site. Anecdotally, I have had several people comment         recently that they no longer decide what movie to see, but where to see a         (any) movie. Regardless, the schedule, coupled with the theatre's         location, figures as a point of coordination for travel through community         space to a site of film consumption. The choice of show time is governed         by countless demands of everyday life. How often has the timing of a film         -- not the film itself, the theatre at which it's playing, nor one's         financial situation --determined one's attendance? How familiar is the         assessment that show times are such that one cannot make it, that the film         begins a bit too earlier, that it will run too late for whatever reason,         and that other tasks intervene to take precedence?        I want to make several observations related to the scheduling of film         exhibition. Most generally, it makes manifest that cinemagoing involves         an exercise in the application of cinema knowledge -- that is, minute,         everyday facilities and familiarities that help orchestrate the         ordinariness of cultural life. Such knowledge informs what Michel de         Certeau characterises as """"the procedures of everyday creativity"""" (xiv).          Far from random, the unexceptional decisions and actions involved with         cinemagoing bear an ordering and a predictability. Novelty in audience         activity appears, but it is alongside fairly exact expectations about the         event. The schedule of start times is essential to the routinisation of         filmgoing. Displaying a Fordist logic of streamlining commodity         distribution and the time management of consumption, audiences circulate         through a machine that shapes their constituency, providing a set time for         seating, departure, snack purchases and socialising. Even with the         staggered times offered by multiplex cinemas, schedules still lay down a         fixed template around which other activities have to be arrayed by the         patron. As audiences move to and through the theatre, the schedule         endeavours to regulate practice, making us the subjects of a temporal         grid, a city context, a cinema space, as well as of the film itself. To be         sure, one can arrive late and leave early, confounding the schedule's         disciplining force. Most importantly, with or without such forms of         evasion, it channels the actions of audiences in ways that consideration         of the gaze cannot address. Taking account of the scheduling of cinema         culture, and its implication of adjunct procedures of everyday life,         points to dimensions of subjectivity neglected by dominant theories of         spectatorship.        To be the subject of a cinema schedule is to understand one assemblage of         the parameters of everyday creativity. It would be foolish to see cinema         audiences as cattle, herded and processed alone, in some crude Gustave         LeBon fashion. It would be equally foolish not to recognise the manner in         which film distribution and exhibition operates precisely by constructing         images of the activity of people as demographic clusters and generalised         cultural consumers. The ordinary tactics of filmgoing are supplemental         to, and run alongside, a set of industrial structures and practices.          While there is a correlation between a culture industry's imagined         audience and the life that ensues around its offerings, we cannot neglect         that, as attention to film scheduling alerts us, audiences are subjects of         an institutional apparatus, brought into being for the reproduction of an         industrial edifice.        Streamline Audiences       In this, film is no different from any culture industry. Film         exhibition and distribution relies on an understanding of both the market         and the product or service being sold at any given point in time.          Operations respond to economic conditions, competing companies, and         alternative activities. Economic rationality in this strategic process,         however, only explains so much. This is especially true for an industry         that must continually predict, and arguably give shape to, the """"mood"""" and         predilections of disparate and distant audiences. Producers, distributors         and exhibitors assess which films will """"work"""", to whom they will be         marketed, as well as establish the very terms of success. Without a doubt,         much of the film industry's attentions act to reduce this uncertainty;         here, one need only think of the various forms of textual continuity         (genre films, star performances, etc.) and the economies of mass         advertising as ways to ensure box office receipts. Yet, at the core of the         operations of film exhibition remains a number of flexible assumptions         about audience activity, taste and desire. These assumptions emerge from         a variety of sources to form a brand of temporary industry """"commonsense"""",         and as such are harbingers of an industrial logic.        Ien Ang has usefully pursued this view in her comparative analysis of         three national television structures and their operating assumptions about         audiences. Broadcasters streamline and discipline audiences as part of         their organisational procedures, with the consequence of shaping ideas         about consumers as well as assuring the reproduction of the industrial         structure itself. She writes, """"institutional knowledge is driven toward         making the audience visible in such a way that it helps the institutions         to increase their power to get their relationship with the audience under         control, and this can only be done by symbolically constructing         'television audience' as an objectified category of others that can be         controlled, that is, contained in the interest of a predetermined         institutional goal"""" (7). Ang demonstrates, in particular, how various         industrially sanctioned programming strategies (programme strips,       """"hammocking"""" new shows between successful ones, and counter-programming to         a competitor's strengths) and modes of audience measurement grow out of,         and invariably support, those institutional goals. And, most crucially,         her approach is not an effort to ascertain the empirical certainty of       """"actual"""" audiences; instead, it charts the discursive terrain in which the         abstract concept of audience becomes material for the continuation of         industry practices.        Ang's work tenders special insight to film culture. In fact, television         scholarship has taken full advantage of exploring the routine nature of         that medium, the best of which deploys its findings to lay bare         configurations of power in domestic contexts. One aspect has been         television time and schedules. For example, David Morley points to the         role of television in structuring everyday life, discussing a range of         research that emphasises the temporal dimension. Alerting us to the non-         necessary determination of television's temporal structure, he comments         that we """"need to maintain a sensitivity to these micro-levels of division         and differentiation while we attend to the macro-questions of the media's         own role in the social structuring of time"""" (265). As such, the         negotiation of temporal structures implies that schedules are not         monolithic impositions of order. Indeed, as Morley puts it, they """"must be         seen as both entering into already constructed, historically specific         divisions of space and time, and also as transforming those pre-existing         division"""" (266). Television's temporal grid has been address by others as         well. Paddy Scannell characterises scheduling and continuity techniques,         which link programmes, as a standardisation of use, making radio and         television predictable, 'user friendly' media (9). John Caughie refers to         the organization of flow as a way to talk about the national         particularities of British and American television (49-50). All, while         making their own contributions, appeal to a detailing of viewing context         as part of any study of audience, consumption or experience; uncovering         the practices of television programmers as they attempt to apprehend and         create viewing conditions for their audiences is a first step in this         detailing.        Why has a similar conceptual framework not been applied with the same         rigour to film? Certainly the history of film and television's         association with different, at times divergent, disciplinary formations         helps us appreciate such theoretical disparities. I would like to mention         one less conspicuous explanation. It occurs to me that one frequently sees         a collapse in the distinction between the everyday and the domestic; in         much scholarship, the latter term appears as a powerful trope of the         former. The consequence has been the absenting of a myriad of other -- if         you will, non-domestic -- manifestations of everyday-ness, unfortunately         encouraging a rather literal understanding of the everyday. The         impression is that the abstractions of the everyday are reduced to daily         occurrences.        Simply put, my minor appeal is for the extension of this vein of         television scholarship to out-of-home technologies and cultural forms,         that is, other sites and locations of the everyday. In so doing, we pay         attention to extra-textual structures of cinematic life; other regimes of         knowledge, power, subjectivity and practice appear. Film audiences         require a discussion about the ordinary, the calculated and the casual         practices of cinematic engagement. Such a discussion would chart         institutional knowledge, identifying operating strategies and recognising         the creativity and multidimensionality of cinemagoing. What are the         discursive parameters in which the film industry imagines cinema         audiences? What are the related implications for the structures in which         the practice of cinemagoing occurs?        Vectors of Exhibition Time       One set of those structures of audience and industry practice involves         the temporal dimension of film exhibition. In what follows, I want to         speculate on three vectors of the temporality of cinema spaces (meaning         that I will not address issues of diegetic time). Note further that my         observations emerge from a close study of industrial discourse in the U.S.         and Canada. I would be interested to hear how they are manifest in other         continental contexts.        First, the running times of films encourage turnovers of the audience         during the course of a single day at each screen. The special event of         lengthy anomalies has helped mark the epic, and the historic, from         standard fare. As discussed above, show times coordinate cinemagoing and         regulate leisure time. Knowing the codes of screenings means         participating in an extension of the industrial model of labour and         service management.        Running times incorporate more texts than the feature presentation alone.         Besides the history of double features, there are now advertisements,         trailers for coming attractions, trailers for films now playing in         neighbouring auditoriums, promotional shorts demonstrating new sound         systems, public service announcements, reminders to turn off cell phones         and pagers, and the exhibitor's own signature clips. A growing focal         point for filmgoing, these introductory texts received a boost in 1990,         when the Motion Picture Association of America changed its standards for         the length of trailers, boosting it from 90 seconds to a full two minutes         (Brookman).        This intertextuality needs to be supplemented by a consideration of inter-         media appeals. For example, advertisements for television began appearing         in theatres in the 1990s. And many lobbies of multiplex cinemas now offer         a range of media forms, including video previews, magazines, arcades and         virtual reality games. Implied here is that motion pictures are not the         only media audiences experience in cinemas and that there is an explicit         attempt to integrate a cinema's texts with those at other sites and         locations.        Thus, an exhibitor's schedule accommodates an intertextual strip,         offering a limited parallel to Raymond Williams's concept of """"flow"""",         which he characterised by stating -- quite erroneously -- """"in all         communication systems before broadcasting the essential items were         discrete"""" (86-7). Certainly, the flow between trailers, advertisements         and feature presentations is not identical to that of the endless, ongoing         text of television. There are not the same possibilities for       """"interruption"""" that Williams emphasises with respect to broadcasting flow.         Further, in theatrical exhibition, there is an end-time, a time at which         there is a public acknowledgement of the completion of the projected         performance, one that necessitates vacating the cinema. This end-time is         a moment at which the """"rental"""" of the space has come due; and it harkens a         return to the street, to the negotiation of city space, to modes of public         transit and the mobile privatisation of cars. Nonetheless, a schedule         constructs a temporal boundary in which audiences encounter a range of         texts and media in what might be seen as limited flow.        Second, the ephemerality of audiences -- moving to the cinema, consuming         its texts, then passing the seat on to someone else -- is matched by the         ephemerality of the features themselves. Distributors' demand for         increasing numbers of screens necessary for massive, saturation openings         has meant that films now replace one another more rapidly than in the         past. Films that may have run for months now expect weeks, with fewer         exceptions. Wider openings and shorter runs have created a cinemagoing         culture characterised by flux. The acceleration of the turnover of films         has been made possible by the expansion of various secondary markets for         distribution, most importantly videotape, splintering where we might find         audiences and multiplying viewing contexts. Speeding up the popular in         this fashion means that the influence of individual texts can only be         truly gauged via cross-media scrutiny.        Short theatrical runs are not axiomatically designed for cinemagoers         anymore; they can also be intended to attract the attention of video         renters, purchasers and retailers. Independent video distributors,         especially, """"view theatrical release as a marketing expense, not a profit         center"""" (Hindes &amp; Roman 16). In this respect, we might think of such         theatrical runs as """"trailers"""" or """"loss leaders"""" for the video release,         with selected locations for a film's release potentially providing         visibility, even prestige, in certain city markets or neighbourhoods.          Distributors are able to count on some promotion through popular consumer-         guide reviews, usually accompanying theatrical release as opposed to the         passing critical attention given to video release. Consequently, this         shapes the kinds of uses an assessment of the current cinema is put to;         acknowledging that new releases function as a resource for cinema         knowledge highlights the way audiences choose between and determine big         screen and small screen films. Taken in this manner, popular audiences         see the current cinema as largely a rough catalogue to future cultural         consumption.        Third, motion picture release is part of the structure of memories and         activities over the course of a year. New films appear in an informal and         ever-fluctuating structure of seasons. The concepts of summer movies and         Christmas films, or the opening weekends that are marked by a holiday,         sets up a fit between cinemagoing and other activities -- family         gatherings, celebrations, etc. Further, this fit is presumably resonant         for both the industry and popular audiences alike, though certainly for         different reasons. The concentration of new films around visible holiday         periods results in a temporally defined dearth of cinemas; an inordinate         focus upon three periods in the year in the U.S. and Canada -- the last         weekend in May, June/July/August and December -- creates seasonal         shortages of screens (Rice-Barker 20). In fact, the boom in theatre         construction through the latter half of the 1990s was, in part, to deal         with those short-term shortages and not some year-round inadequate         seating.        Configurations of releasing colour a calendar with the tactical         manoeuvres of distributors and exhibitors. Releasing provides a         particular shape to the """"current cinema"""", a term I employ to refer to a         temporally designated slate of cinematic texts characterised most         prominently by their newness. Television arranges programmes to         capitalise on flow, to carry forward audiences and to counter-programme         competitors' simultaneous offerings. Similarly, distributors jostle with         each other, with their films and with certain key dates, for the limited         weekends available, hoping to match a competitor's film intended for one         audience with one intended for another. Industry reporter Leonard Klady         sketched some of the contemporary truisms of releasing based upon the         experience of 1997. He remarks upon the success of moving Liar, Liar (Tom         Shadyac, 1997) to a March opening and the early May openings of Austin         Powers: International Man of Mystery (Jay Roach, 1997) and Breakdown         (Jonathan Mostow, 1997), generally seen as not desirable times of the year         for premieres. He cautions against opening two films the same weekend,         and thus competing with yourself, using the example of Fox's Soul Food         (George Tillman, Jr., 1997) and The Edge (Lee Tamahori, 1997). While         distributors seek out weekends clear of films that would threaten to         overshadow their own, Klady points to the exception of two hits opening on         the same date of December 19, 1997 -- Tomorrow Never Dies (Roger         Spottiswoode, 1997) and Titanic (James Cameron, 1997). Though but a         single opinion, Klady's observations are a peek into a conventional strain         of strategising among distributors and exhibitors. Such planning for the         timing and appearance of films is akin to the programming decisions of         network executives. And I would hazard to say that digital cinema,         reportedly -- though unlikely -- just on the horizon and in which texts         will be beamed to cinemas via satellite rather than circulated in prints,         will only augment this comparison; releasing will become that much more         like programming, or at least will be conceptualised as such.        To summarize, the first vector of exhibition temporality is the         scheduling and running time; the second is the theatrical run; the third         is the idea of seasons and the """"programming"""" of openings. These are just         some of the forces streamlining filmgoers; the temporal structuring of         screenings, runs and film seasons provides a material contour to the         abstraction of audience. Here, what I have delineated are components of         an industrial logic about popular and public entertainment, one that         offers a certain controlled knowledge about and for cinemagoing audiences.        Shifting Conceptual Frameworks       A note of caution is in order. I emphatically resist an interpretation         that we are witnessing the becoming-film of television and the becoming-tv         of film. Underneath the """"inversion"""" argument is a weak brand of         technological determinism, as though each asserts its own essential         qualities. Such a pat declaration seems more in line with the mythos of         convergence, and its quasi-Darwinian """"natural"""" collapse of technologies.          Instead, my point here is quite the opposite, that there is nothing         essential or unique about the scheduling or flow of television; indeed,         one does not have to look far to find examples of less schedule-dependent         television. What I want to highlight is that application of any term of         distinction -- event/flow, gaze/glance, public/private, and so on -- has         more to do with our thinking, with the core discursive arrangements that         have made film and television, and their audiences, available to us as         knowable and different. So, using empirical evidence to slide one term         over to the other is a strategy intended to supplement and destabilise the         manner in which we draw conclusions, and even pose questions, of each.        What this proposes is, again following the contributions of Ien Ang, that         we need to see cinemagoing in its institutional formation, rather than         some stable technological, textual or experiential apparatus. The         activity is not only a function of a constraining industrial practice or         of wildly creative patrons, but of a complex inter-determination between         the two. Cinemagoing is an organisational entity harbouring, reviving and         constituting knowledge and commonsense about film commodities, audiences         and everyday life. An event of cinema begins well before the dimming of         an auditorium's lights. The moment a newspaper is consulted, with its         local representation of an internationally circulating current cinema, its         listings belie a scheduling, an orderliness, to the possible projections         in a given location. As audiences are formed as subjects of the current         cinema, we are also agents in the continuation of a set of institutions as         well.

"2000","Dialogue on Film and Philosophy","       Editors' Preface       When Ulf Wilhelmsson first contacted us about including his """"Dialogue on Film and Philosophy"""" in the M/C 'chat' issue, we were initially taken aback. True, the notion of chat surely must include that of 'dialogue', but Wilhelmsson's idea, as he put it to us, was that of a Socratic dialogue about film. The dialogue """"Film och Filosofi"""" already existed in Swedish, but he had done an initial rough translation of the dialogue on his Website. Since Wilhelmsson put this to us in the very early days of the submission period, we decided to have a look.       Wilhelmsson had omitted to mention the fact that his dialogue was amusing as well as informative. Playing Socrates was ... Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino was not just discussing film, but he was moderating a hefty grab-bag of influential philosphers, film-makers, film-scholars and the odd Beatle (John Lennon). Furthermore, creeping in to many of the utterances in the discussion was Wilhelmsson's take on Tarantino's vernacular -- keep an eye out for """"Bada boom bada boom, get it?"""" and """"Oh Sartre. Dude, I would also like to provide a similar example"""". The philosphers sometimes also get a chance to break out of their linguistic bonds, such as Herakleit, who tells us that """"War is the primogenitor of the whole shebang"""". Occasionally, Wilhelmsson lets his conversants get rowdy (St Thomas of Aquinas and Aristotle yell """"Tabula Rasa!"""" in unison), put on accents (Michel Chion with French accent: """"Merci merci. Je vous en pris that you are recognising tse sound""""), be """"dead sure of themselves"""" (George Lakoff and Mark Johnson; Noam Chomsky thanks us for our attention) and wander in and out of the dialogue's virtual space (at the end, Immanuel Kant returns to us after his daily walk around town).       Unfortunately, due to its length, the dialogue can not be supplied in regular M/C 'bits', and so we have made it available as a downloadable Rich Text Format file.       Felicity Meakins &amp; E.

"2000","Some Speculation on the Future of the Body and Soul","       It's the beginning of 2000 and the 21st century is all mapped out.         Since we've just had that time at the end of a decade (not to mention the end of the century, as well as the Christian calendar """"millennium""""), when all the pundits came out to review where we had been and forecast where we are going, we should have expected a profundity of future-casting. But neither the familiar prognostications of the coming apocalypse spewing forth from the Religious Right, nor the usual statistical projections made by """"experts"""" on such things as population growth, world politics, economic cycles, new products and shifting job markets, etc. will provide any help in reading the map we have already drawn up, or translating the directional signs.        The future is now. It occupies the same domain as the past. Both are inhabitants of the present moment. History, memory, desire, imagination, the creative instinct, and the impetus to act, unfold and are realised as the future becomes the present. We cannot help but tinker with the universe. The future is what we make it and there are an infinite number of possible timelines. Or maybe not.        It's the beginning of 2000 and the 21st century is all mapped out. The Human Genome Project1 is about to decode our physiology. We are preparing for the next evolution of the species. The battle between the cyberneticists and the geneticists for a new and improved version of homo sapiens version 3.0 has just begun. The question of where it will lead is open-ended. Will the insatiable quest for self-improvement lead to enlightenment -- a world with less suffering, hunger, disease, violence, and greed? Or, will we be the makers of our own extinction, and end up as a version of Star Trek's Borg -- the ultimate consumers, assimilating automatons devouring everything they encounter, and utterly devoid of the qualities that make us human?         As an example of a hypothetical biological and social future the Borg are an interesting model -- a synthesis of a utopian socialist dream and the capitalist imperative of acquisition in the information age. As organic/cybernetic humanoid machines with one unified mind, equal and undifferentiated, untroubled by ego or id, individual ambitions, desires or passions, loneliness, alienation, or imagination they are the ultimate homogeneous collective. At the same time they are both the perfect corporate entity -- masters of the merger, the hostile takeover (""""resistance is futile""""), and a mindless population programmed to consume and continually upgrade each and every new technology and product.             But the Borg don't invent; they only appropriate. Postmodern androids to the core! And we are presently very busy making new discoveries, creating and inventing, and transforming theories into things which tell us not only what is possible, but probable. One of the determining factors in the course of our future is whether or not our belief in technology over other values turns us into the puppets instead of the puppeteers, slaves to masters of our own invention -- be it HAL, Dr. Frankenstein's monster, or the Terminator. Let us consider some possible future scenarios, based not on fiction, but on what already exists, or is about to do so.        Facts            No one now disputes that the transformation of stem cells into new body parts, cloning technology, genetic engineering, nanotechnology, and microchip replacements not only could, but will dramatically change medicine and extend life in the coming century. In strictly medical terms, the implementation of all these technologies will bring about extraordinary relief of both the physical and psychological pain and suffering caused by debilitating, disabling, or disfiguring disease or injuries, not to mention the lives saved, and the genetic diseases prevented.        Current research has found that not only stem cells taken from human embryos or fetuses could be directed to grow replacements for ailing hearts, livers or other organs, but that some stem cells taken from adult tissue could be converted into other types of cells -- brain cells becoming blood cells, or bone marrow becoming liver. The application of this technology is dazzling -- transformative biology, and it is just over the horizon2. Recently, scientists announced the creation of the first artificial cornea made from human cells. It could help restore the sight of those with certain kinds of eye damage. At the same time cybernetics is playing an equally important part. In development is a mini-computer that essentially takes over damaged visual functions and projects them onto a screen. One model expected to be ready for market within three years is a version of Geordie's visor in Star Trek: Next Generation. Another is a microchip that is inserted behind the eye3.        In his newest book Fuzzy Future: From Society and Science to Heaven in a Chip, University of Southern California electrical engineering professor Bart Kosco, author of Fuzzy Thinking (1993), projects his theories onto everything from smart machines, the politics of genomes (who owns you, your genetic material, that is) and the environment (who owns the sea, or for that matter the air) to the problem of human mortality. Kosco foresees the day when we may be able to download our brains onto a microchip, thus achieving digital immortality via a gradual (fuzzy) transformation in which the brain's """"meat"""" is replaced piece by piece with nanochips that work ever faster, better, and more creatively than old-fashioned neurons and synapses. The use of microchips to repair or replace damaged cells or portions of the brain is one thing, but as a means to greatly increase mental capacity, and gain everlasting life by """"leaving your gray matter pickled in a jar"""" in favour of a computer in your skull is another. Would you still be you?        While researchers have currently found new molecules in the brain that play a role in creating memories and learning, it does not ensure wisdom in how we put our knowledge to work. That great benefits await us, in the prevention and treatment of disease and the disintegration due to aging, is not in dispute. Nor is the enhanced capacity of a healthier society in body and mind. What constitutes the latter is. We are still left with ethical questions about the uses of technology, and spiritual and philosophical questions about what it means to be human. What are the political and social ramifications of biotechnology?        British television playwright Dennis Potter's last work Cold Lazarus represents the ethical dilemmas of a future world capable of robbing a man's soul against his will. Scientists, whose funding is controlled by one or another governing media megalomaniac, seek to experience the 20th century through the genuine memories of the late Daniel Feeld, whose frozen head they have obtained. Their biochemical experiments are no less despicable than the CEO who wants to broadcast Feeld's """"consciousness"""" worldwide twenty-four hours a day. Political opposition exists only in the form of a clandestine """"terrorist"""" organization known as R.O.N. (Reality Or Nothing).        If we were to base our forecasts on the patterns of history, just such a techno-fascist corporate future awaits us. If we are to judge by the dominant values of the present, the economic priorities of the marketplace will overpower the dissenting voices, placing not only the natural environment at risk, but our social environment as well. What will such a society do about the underclasses when smart machines have taken over their work, and they haven't the means to buy our goods, only consume precious resources; that is, when they are no longer """"necessary"""" to the economic system. Will they be technologically phased out or upgraded?        Fast Forward        Let's not jump too far ahead. Maybe just to 2050. You can grow your own body part replacements, not just internal organs, but muscle, nerve tissue, skin. You can rejuvenate. Living to 120 or longer will not be unusual. The manufacture of body parts will be a big biotech business. Invest now! But will this technology be available to anyone and everyone, or only those who can afford it? Will we have parts kept in cold storage ready and waiting? Organs grown from extractions of our own foetal tissue perhaps. If it is a right not a privilege, how will our society deal with the problems of overpopulation? Will only those over a certain age -- say 80 -- who are viewed as """"contributing"""" or """"productive"""" members of society be eligible for new organs? Or will your lifestyle and health habits be a factor? No new livers for recalcitrant unreformed alcoholics? Will there be a ranking system of qualifications? Who will decide what they will be? Never mind arms and drugs. Consider this black market in the making! Subterranean high-tech operating rooms, organ factories, contraband stem cells, DNA, """"smart"""" nanochips.        Fast Forward        And what about those microchips for brain functions? Not just for disease but for self-improvement. You might be able to improve your personality the way you can have a face-lift or breast implants. Then again, microchips could replace both pharmacology and psychotherapy in the treatment of mental disease, or merely antisocial or criminally aberrant behaviour, a new form of rehabilitation. As for sheer brain power, there would be no end to your capacity to absorb information, memorize and catalogue it, or to calculate stock market transactions. And just think of the lawsuits bound to jam up the courts, should someone have the misfortune to get a faulty chip, or even one that doesn't live up to expectations. Advertising is bound to promise you the answer to your dreams. The insertion of these parts by choice is one thing, but suppose it is forced on you by a government or a corporation. Or even by a parent while you are too young to fight back, the ones who want their offspring to be a math genius, Olympic athlete, or musical prodigy. Then again, genetic engineering may take care of some of that. Babies to order. By the end of this century you might not even have to have one the old messy way. Or you might not even be allowed to. Your genetically selected child might be grown in a computer-controlled organic womb. No more unwanted pregnancies. No more crack babies, or Downs Syndrome, or spina bifida4.        We've been messing around for quite some time with a lot of things we don't know or haven't considered the consequences of in terms of the long term ecological balance of life and all its interdependent systems: cross-species genetic implants in plants and animals; plants altered to kill insects that are food for another creature on the food chain. And so on up the ladder: tomatoes that only look like tomatoes, but aren't really tomatoes any more. A perfect example of surface over substance. While we are so sure of our technological mastery, the actual """"apocalypse"""" may well be of our own making when the forces of nature wreak havoc and pay us back for our abuses and arrogance. Or perhaps it will be nature's way of resetting the balance of things by greatly reducing the human population. Or it just might turn out this way. The newly evolved, genetically and cybernetically enhanced humanoids 3.0 survive and adapt (to 3.5), while the great mass of old humans become an endangered species like the Siberian tiger.        Present Tense        If you think this is all just science fiction, consider this. Already a number of young men in Silicon Valley or at M.I.T. walk around all day every day with one eye and ear always focused on the little headset computer screen that keeps them perpetually """"on-line"""", plugged in. Do they look a little like the Borg? Well yes. Or, think about this. About a year ago a bill came up in the California state legislature proposing that a microchip be inserted in all newborn infants, like the ones you can put in your dog so you can track her if she gets lost or stolen. Same principle with babies. The bill was defeated. But very soon we will all be locatable, """"on-line"""". No chance of disappearing in the 21st century when the wilderness is about to become another """"theme"""" park, and when, at this very moment, you can be traced every time you use a plastic card or make a phone call. What a scary thought for dissidents, revolutionaries, battered women, or anyone who just wants to """"get away from it all"""". In the 21st century, Huxley's """"savages"""" would have as hard a time surviving or avoiding capture as a wolf in Arizona. How will our civil rights, our human rights be affected at the present rate of invasion into our privacy. Is your body your own? And what about your mind? What exactly will the """"right to your life"""" mean? Will """"smart"""" machines have that right? How will we define a sentient being?        And so here we are. The 21st century is all mapped out. Maps can be misread. Maps can be wrong. The place that has been charted can be changed. By a force of nature, or an act of will. Or better still, by an act of conscience or consciousness, for it is an energy force with transformative powers. We could become better in our hearts and souls. We could use our knowledge with grace. Now go out and draw a new map(s). Happy New Century!              Footnotes         Huge advances in genomics, the science of deciphering the basic genetic pattern of life, were made in 1999, including the complete gene sequence for three microbes, a third of the base pairs in human DNA, along with one complete chromosome, number 22, and a rough draft of the entire human genome is expected by March 2000.

"2000","Book of the Undead","       Memory depends on void,       as void depends on memory, to think.        -- Anne Carson       Sunday, 26th December, 1999       It was a peculiar ritual to perform to bring a personal end to the twentieth century. A journey through the snow to visit Egypt, at the Metropolitan Museum in Manhattan. I took two books, the latest New Yorker and the New York Times to keep me company.       Ancient Egyptian funeral art fascinates me. How unreadable it is. Perhaps it isn't meant to be read. If it is addressed to anyone, or anything, it isn't human. It addresses otherness itself, eternity. Serenity masks, and faces, nothingness. A reminder of how little a decade, or a century matters, even a millennium, compared to these fragments of monuments that could stare down handfuls of years in their thousands -- and still not blink.       As Paul Valery wrote: """"we later civilisations ... we too now know we are mortal. We had long heard tell of whole worlds that had vanished, of empires sunk without a trace, gone down with all their men and all their machines into the unexplorable depths of the centuries..."""" (23). Our ancestors may have conquered space, spread ourselves thin across the bread of the earth, but Egypt conquered time. Their empires of the dead will probably still be living when the last of ours are rat food.       As Paul Valery wrote: """"we later civilisations ... we too now know we are mortal. We had long heard tell of whole worlds that had vanished, of empires sunk without a trace, gone down with all their men and all their machines into the unexplorable depths of the centuries..."""" (23). Our ancestors may have conquered space, spread ourselves thin across the bread of the earth, but Egypt conquered time. Their empires of the dead will probably still be living when the last of ours are rat food.       Thanks to universal standard time, everyone could know where they stood in relation to the planet's movement. Thanks to geopositioning, everyone could know the coordinates upon the map that corresponded to the patch of earth under foot. As the world turned, an arc of humans from one latitude to another could experience the arbitrary yet somehow convincing sensation of leaving the twentieth century.       As the New Yorker reported: """"in a daring act of multiculturalism, the good people of Tonga rose at midnight to sing the 'Hallelujah Chorus' from Handel's Messiah"""" (Lane 24). Meanwhile, in New York, the Caligula of capital George Soros offered his 250-odd guests bronze medallions featuring etched profiles of himself, and the inscription: """"Enlightened by the Past. Embraced by the present. Empowered by the future"""" (Cassidy 26).       Y2K kept bothering me. It was all a little too much data hitting the sensoria. I tried to ignore it, to think about Egypt. I thought that if I closed my eyes to the world's turning, it would go away. It won't go away. Not any more. There is nowhere left to hide. At twilight, in the desert, your satellite phone rings. It's a telemarketer.       Egypt is exhausting, even at the Met. There's so many objects, so much information. I'd brought a book or two, so I could pause for coffee and make some notes. The books were by Harold Innis, that quirky old communication theorist. He's a detour, like Egypt, but he'll get us to where I want to go, to thinking media.      Egypt is exhausting, even at the Met. There's so many objects, so much information. I'd brought a book or two, so I could pause for coffee and make some notes. The books were by Harold Innis, that quirky old communication theorist. He's a detour, like Egypt, but he'll get us to where I want to go, to thinking media.              A simple observation. Consider what it makes it possible to think: """"empires must be considered from the standpoint of two dimensions, those of space and time, and persist by overcoming the bias of media, which over-emphasise either dimension. They have tended to flourish under conditions in which civilisation reflects the influence of more than one medium and in which the bias of one medium toward decentralisation is offset by the bias of another toward centralisation"""" (Empire 7).       Consider, for instance, Egypt, where: """"a concern with problems of space and time appears to have marked the beginnings of civilisation... A change from a pre-dynastic to dynastic society, or a precise recognition of time... appears to have coincided with writing, monumental architecture and sculpture"""" (Bias 92). Kings and priests colonised time. """"The permanence of death became a basis of continuity through the development of the idea of immortality, preservation of the body, and development of writing in the tombs by which the magical power of the spoken word was perpetuated in pictorial representation of the funeral ritual"""" (Bias 93).       On the one hand, """"the pyramids were an index to power over time"""" (Bias 135). On the other, """"by escaping from the heavy medium of stone, thought gained lightness"""" (Empire 16). The papyrus document became the means for scribes and soldiers to colonise space. These different media, with their different properties, were the basis of a flexible continuity and integrity for the empire, but also a source of conflict within it. """"The profound disturbances in Egyptian civilisation involved in the shift from absolute monarchy to a more democratic organisation coincides with a shift in emphasis on stone as a medium of communicating or as a basis of prestige, as shown in the pyramids, to an emphasis on papyrus"""" (Empire 15). But it was not to last. Egypt """"failed to establish a stable compromise between a bias dependent on stone in the pyramids and a bias dependent on papyrus and hieroglyphics"""" (Bias 96).        Failed, and yet succeeded, in replicating itself by virtue of the fascination those of us who, like Valery, see something strikingly different in the shape of this ancient space and time. There's some irony in monuments to eternity being themselves preserved at the Met. """"The emphasis of a civilisation on means of extending its duration as in Egypt accompanied by reliance on permanence gives that civilisation a prominent position in periods such as the present when time is of little significance"""" (Bias 66).       What can you say about a civilisation that gives itself an early mark and toddles into its second millennium a year early? One in which global empires grow and merge and collapse each week on the lone and level sands of the market. Or where Danny Hillis, Silicon Valley magus, is making a monument to last out the centuries -- and it's a clock. What is to become of it all?       Consider this observation, by Innis, of what became of Egypt: """"we can perhaps assume that the use of a medium of communication over a long period will to some extent determine the character of knowledge to be communicated and suggest that its pervasive influence will eventually create a civilisation in which life and flexibility will become exceedingly difficult to maintain and that the advantages of a new medium will become such as to lead to the emergence of a new civilisation"""" (Bias 34). The scribes and the priests, between them, ran things, and for centuries kept control of the skills to do so. This very facility became a limit, making the empire vulnerable to stagnation and conquest from without.       Consider how this might work out in more recent times, when monopolies guard their source code and battle against open source technologies. Innis writes that """"a simple flexible system of writing admits of adaptation to the vernacular but slowness of adaptation facilitates monopoly of knowledge and hierarchies"""" (Bias 4). Microsoft write twentieth century hieroglyphics. It is an empire with an Egyptian approach to source code intended to perpetuate itself through time, even at the risk of arresting flexible and adaptive approaches to creating communication tools anywhere else.       Or take the lead story that greeted me over coffee in the Met's cafe: AMERICA ONLINE AGREES TO BUY TIME WARNER FOR $165 BILLION; MEDIA DEAL IS RICHEST MERGER (New York Times 11 Jan 2000). This is the way of things now. Vigorous new empires annex old Egypts in a burst of press release fireworks. Empires that straddle continents but are not built to last much longer than London's Millennium Dome, structures held aloft by tensed steel cables, built to be seen on television by distant cousins by not by any descendants.       We may have left the twentieth century, but has it left us? Its ruins lie about us, persisting, insisting. Its miniature monuments lie in the landfill of memory. So many new ways that were discovered, during the century, for impressing the century on memory. Perhaps that's why so little of its architecture is built to last. The great pyramid of Las Vegas is an image preserved in a million snapshots.       The monument has become something miniature, even molecular. Exotic pesticide residues now shop up in Antarctic penguins. As Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari write: """"a monument does not commemorate or celebrate something that happened but confides to the ear of the future the persistent sensations that embody the event"""" (176). Perhaps Innis is wrong about this civilisation. It looks like its bias is towards the colonising of space, but in its own way it has colonised time, too. It communicates its chaos, its blind will to creative destruction, through the pulverising of every last particle of the earth. The twentieth century's answer to the pyramids, it's ongoing contributions to civilisation, are the death factories of the Holocaust and the negative architecture of the bombing of Hiroshima.       And yet, those memories aside, it was also the century in which for the first time one glimpses a possible life outside the monopoly of knowledge by priests and scribes, where no matter how hard they try, empires can no longer control for millennia the flows of information that allow them to colonise space and time. I'm tempted to say that if Egypt lives on in the Book of the Dead, our time will live on as a Book of the Undead. It left its mark by mummifying nothing except change itself. But the book is one of the things the twentieth century changed too. As Friedrich Kittler writes, """"as long as the book was responsible for all serial data flows, words quivered with sensuality and memory"""" (10).       But the book has lost its sovereignty. The scribes and priests and scholars who monopolised knowledge and prestige through mastery of textual codes are going the way of their Egyptian precursors, into the museums.

"2000","666 Ways to Ambush the Future","       For some time, I have been concerned with uses and abuses of the future, how the exchange of temporally loaded language through conversation and text affects the pace, moods and behaviour of individuals, communities, cultures and civilisations. I am equally curious about Christianity which as a narrative structure begins with creation but awaits a conclusion. Whether it is religions announcing ten-point plans to attain paradise quickly, or cults encouraging group passes to heaven through suicide, it is the future end that counts. Whether it be ego-theologists -- as I prefer to call those pastors who proclaim the 'you are/they are god' creed -- scalping spiritual quick-fixes at the local entertainment centre, with a McDonald's-like serving of 'Would you like a blessing with that?', or the visiting soulwinner from New South Wales distributing 'Mark of the Beast' warning pamphlets, the future conclusion of the Christian narrative plays the lead.        I cannot disguise my discomfort with the salvation franchises or merchants who market pre-fabricated responses to the Christian apocalyptic narrative, curiously shaped by contemporary circumstances, and who profit excessively from such business. Many times I wonder what dubious purposes their perception of the future is put to. Surviving Armageddon, it appears, can provide a diverse source of mobilisation for many. With such prominence in the everyday topics of public and mainstream dialogue, our age is the first historical period where the marginal phenomenon of apocalyptism has moved from the edge of society to its present-day popular near-centre. Money, I dare say, is made from such a shift.        Ego-theologists are keen to boast the vices of contemporary society that are bringing apocalypse while conveniently offering the hefty-priced product that upon purchase will begin the process of surviving the end.         It is no accident that the narrower the definition of salvation, the more specialised the rituals for attaining it, the qualifications for distributing it and the exclusivity for keeping it. Such restrictions place the power of salvation into the hands of a small number of people who make available -- upon specialised or ritualised request -- the means to lease it. I use the word lease because salvation is never completely settled. Instead, a symbolic contract is achieved between the franchise and the seeker in which salvation is conveyed to the seeker for a specified period but usually in exchange for membership and often mental and financial obligation. If the seeker breaks the contract, salvation is lost. Jehovah's Witnesses call this act of severance 'disfellowshipping' and the seeker is designated by continuing followers of Watchtower as an 'apostate', as one against the almighty creator. Many ex-witnesses are emotionally scared by this devastating, violent act of seemingly removing salvation.             In this sense, a small elite using exclusive language and narrow definitions and who therefore monopolise the forms and the senses of achieving salvation habitually frame salvation and the rituals of being saved from a monstrous future. Who benefits and who is disempowered by the agenda being set in this manner? Why are only selected people able to lease directions to the road of salvation with maps that periodically imply the master planner has changed compass, be it the secular salvation from ecological doom or theological salvation from the damnable mark of the beast?            Saving a person from the antichrist has today become a robust industry. Religious entrepreneurs proliferate their scriptural shandies and spiritual quick-fixes to the middle-class disheartened with the expertise of experienced confidence tricksters and the finesse of door-to-door selling. Subscribe to a local salvation franchise of the 'gospel of wealth' variety found marketing in the early morning hours of Australian televangelism and a continual stream of ministrations will arrive in the mail replete with US postage markings and external messages warning you and your postie: 'This envelope contains important information the devil hopes you will never find out!', 'Eight things you need to know before the new millennium', 'Has Y2K plunged us into a countdown to chaos? Don't panic -- prepare and trust God!' or 'Unleash the power of your faith!'.        Content will vary across a range of marketable approaches. Two recent postings I received from the same franchise respectively presented a 4-5 page personalised letter requesting I purchase 'dynamic ministry materials' like Your Y2K New Millennium Survival Personal Library Kit for an appropriate 'seed harvest' of $165.99. This reflected fair market value, naturally, on 'powerful' items including The Antichrist: 666 video, a three audio tape set called End Time Signs and the Book of Revelation Comic Book.        An explanation sheet was also included for explaining the rituals required to activate an enclosed 'miracle touch' 2-inch square cloth, apparently anointed -- touched in a supernatural way -- by a special class of persons self-identified as 'prayer warriors'. Some packages have reflected telegram-style formatting to 'emphasize the great URGENCY' felt by a pastor 'that many of you may be on the verge of falling apart or feeling absolutely overwhelmed by fear, anger, depression, rejection, worry' and who desperately require a newly-released 'powerful book of wisdom' to overcome personal tribulation and to successfully 'rebuke the devil'.        Often, correspondence signed from the pastor displays these excesses of individual concern, claims of divine new revelation blended with unbiblical doses of numerological deduction. The accompanying letter to my Y2K Personal Request Sheet begins: 'Dear Jason, you are now reading a letter that had to be sent to you ... Yes, the Lord told me to prepare this ... He gave me a vivid, supernatural glimpse of the miracle difference this one letter could make in your life ... especially in this year of 1999 ... See it as your year of double fruitfulness'.        What role does this type of 'future-thinking' and others play in Australian forms of hope and expectation? Can we establish a discourse of ethics regarding the use or abuse of future mythology? And how might we engage studies of the future in the historical and sociological disciplines which would see the future as itself: a theory with very particular ideological and metaphysical investments; an address to the present, transforming it into the fulfillment of the future we aim to aspire to; and, often, as a tool or weapon which has been waved about for some form of gain?        To answer these questions requires us to place ourselves in a position to see something of the design and construction of contemporary futures as an invented thing with specific limitations.        George Orwell's famous and relevant exploration of the future in 1984 is the story of Winston Smith's rebellion against the Party, of his hatred towards Big Brother and the thoughtcrime. On page thirty-four, Winston reflects on the perpetual state of war that has existed between Oceania and Eurasia: 'The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliance with Eurasia ... But where did that knowledge exist? Only in his own consciousness ... if all the others accepted the lie which the party imposed if all records told the same tale, then the lie passed into history and became truth. """"Who controls the past,"""" ran the Party slogan, """"controls the future: who controls the present controls the past."""" It was quite simple. All that was needed was an unending series of victories over your own memory. """"Reality control,"""" they called it; in Newspeak, """"doublethink.""""'        Transposing the direction of Orwell's commentary, from a control of knowledge about the past to a monopoly control of future mythology, provides more than just an occasional point. To paraphrase, I would like to suggest that: 'Who controls the future controls the present. And that all is needed is an unending series of victories over your imagination'. In futurespeak, that is, the language and discursive strategies used to talk and think about the future, I call this 'thinkphobia'.        Alvin Toffler, in his successful sociological trilogy, describes the cultural fallout from overchoice and the dangerous discrepancies between society's technological accelerative thrust and the pace of our individual adaptive abilities. This peculiar state results in what Toffler defines as future shock; that is, an overload of our individual decision-making processes from the demands of choice that we simply cannot tolerate. Thinkphobia, as an analogy to thoughtcrime, is one step removed: it is the fear we develop of choice, of options in the future and it is not, I suspect, limited to doomsayers.        For members of Watchtower (Jehovah's Witnesses), the present is probed only in the interests of the future and they project only one intended and necessary future, squashing coherent, intellectual responses to it, closing alternatives to active public and popular debate. The future as promoted by Watchtower is totalist, monocultural, and biblically sealed, closed to individual modification, to the extent that a handbook 'Reasoning from the Scriptures' can provide the dialogue that accompanies their knock at your door. But, I wonder, are the future-systems of our societies any different in their application?        What I'm suggest here is that the secular billions of people today who are either implicitly or explicitly coerced to reckon the future and time in ways they did not choose is highly questionable. While we may scoff at the witness who has their dialogue mapped out and a sense of the future pre-structured for them, should we ourselves spend much time exchanging talk about things called the 'millennium' and the year 2000, encouraging other cultures to share our enthusiasm, much like a cultist would promote their pattern of future for emulating? In other words, when our societies are diversifying culturally, socially and intellectually, why is our concept of the future homogenising, almost, dare I suggest, in cultic mimicry?        The approach of the year 2000/2001AD seems to evoke excess response from Christian groups throughout Australia. But can a culture of apocalypse or a cult of the future -- that is, a philosophically sealed community deriving identity from its expectation of doom in the future -- be limited to popular, extra-societal ideas of cult?        A 'cult of the future' could be described as a community of people, which embraces a particular system of linear time reckoning as part of its cultural and/or social code, which encourages (either explicitly or implicitly) and sustains specialised activity as supplication to some qualitative or quantitative 'future'. A 'cult of the future', to draw from sociological literature, does not adhere to the possibility of unforeseen occurrence but rather devotes itself to a presumed unalterable and necessary future to which all current activity and thought seems conditional upon it.        I wonder whether the term 'cult of the future' can be applied to a whole society and not just to the small evangelical cult based in the outer suburbs, which studiously awaits the end of the world. Can a cult of the future, traditionally applied to an unconventional extra-societal gathering, include society itself? How our societies conceive of the future may be different in content and style to evangelical and theological communities, but could the aim be similar? Whether it is a social reformer or a cult leader, is the process the same in the way future mythology is constructed? Could future-oriented systems conceivably sit alongside the systems of more controversial groups like Heaven's Gate or Jehovah's Witnesses as related efforts of installing pre-organised future-mythology into the mindset of a group of receptive people?        To interrogate the monopolisation of future mythology by the leading mythmakers and the salvation merchants, whose greatest tool is the rumour of what we fear and whose largest assets are the hopes of seekers, is to begin reclaiming responsibility about the future. It is to reclaim meaning for an individual long-term present that would otherwise be lonely in the crowd of social, commercial and regulated short-term futures. Futures thinking should encourage us to ponder what part of ourselves goes on to the future and it should initiate a strong sense of responsibility to prospective generations: it should not invite us to consider what books or tapes to purchase in order to survive the various doomsday scenarios marketed at us.

"2000","Panel Discussion: Some Futures for Cultural StudiesWith contributions from Liz Ferrier, John Banks, Susan Luckman, Graeme Turner","        Conducted in the Department of English, University of Queensland, 29 Oct. 99               Instead of the usual lead essay, for this issue we organised a panel on the future of Cultural Studies, to enable a consideration of our disciplinary home in our physical one -- the Department of English, University of Queensland. The participants were all members of the Department -- John Banks, Dr Liz Ferrier, Susan Luckman and Professor Graeme Turner. They were chosen to represent both staff and postgraduate students within that part of the Department that bases its work on Cultural Studies. The large audience we drew for the event testifies -- as does the success of M/C itself -- to the interest in the area.        The participants were asked not to read from prepared papers, but instead to present more informally their personal views of how to consider the future of our discipline. Some of the panellists took up a suggestion that they develop ideas arising from a recent piece of work, of their own or others, which might indicate future directions for the field. Although there is no direct reference here, all of the participants had been asked to read the 13.1 Continuum Editorial (April 1999).        Click on for the panellists' speeches...

"2000","Future","       In the beginning, the editors were brought together by science fiction, the popular cultural form most devoted to thinking about the future. The world though is too complex to produce a straight line from academic work on science fiction to editing a journal issue on the future, so the sf we started with was science fiction about the past. It's taken us a while to get to the future, but here, to a certain extent, we are.        Thinking about the future is never easy, never really free of fiction, and the only strong chance is that you'll get it wrong (as innumerable prognostications from space ships with punch cards driving them to Government transport planning can testify).        It became apparent as we worked through the submissions that there was a strange inhibition at work. Even though contributors knew that the publication date for the issue was 2000, not one had been able to project themselves into such a significant future time. Piece after piece talked of here in 1999 and what it would be like in the 21st century without actually trying to be there. Was it those millennial fears that stopped people writing 'here in 2000' or daring 'this century' for the 21st? Actually we don't think we've found many references anywhere at all to 'this century' yet; perhaps we're still recovering from the surprise at the uneventfulness of our entering it. Although we had been saying there was nothing special about the shift from one lot of numbers to another and that the fuss was a lot of marketing hype, actually believing it seems to have been more difficult.

Although we had been saying there was nothing special about the shift from one lot of numbers to another and that the fuss was a lot of marketing hype, actually believing it seems to have been more difficult.       Daniel Palmer discusses the ways that one of the most interesting and provocative science fiction films of the last few years, Luc Besson's The Fifth Element, represents its future and what this can say about historicity. Given how very much the recent prognostication pieces in popular print media drew on stills from this film in preference to alternative images, we think his choice is a wise one. He doesn't mention the differential reception of the film inside and outside the US, but its role in displaying the ability of non-US film-makers to do big-budget sf as well as the thoughtful kind is worth noting. Andrew M. Butler continues the sf line with a light-hearted bid for power in the world of terminology in narrative theory.        We move from Butler's parody to one of the most serious of the areas where attempts are made to regulate the future - welfare policy. Lisa Gunders specifically talks of the Australian situation but raises issues of global currency. Jacki Apple's contribution steers clear of parody in her consideration of what be the case in fifty years time in the light of recent developments in fields like nano-technology and genetic engineering. Our final contributor, Jason Ensor, takes us to religious prophecy -- for many the antithesis of where we began with science fiction.

"2000","Three Cultures from the """"Inside""""","       Prologue        It's not what I am but what I do. Or is it? The relationship between doing and being is the theme of these three explorations of cultural """"identity"""". The first is a search for the ways in which the Jewish preoccupation with eating, talking, and talking-about-eating, works to create, embody, enact, and/or produce Jewishness. Felicity provides an example of the formation of identities through one specific practice: """"eating"""". Tracey questions the use of identity in a particular site: law. She replaces the notion of identity with something ostensibly different which is based on a collection of practices. The concept of a collection of practices is picked up by Reece as a way of doing something other than (the usual understanding of) """"identity politics"""" with sexual subjectivities.        If a conclusion can be taken away from these three related pieces, it would be that one can't help but fall into cultural or collective subject positions, regardless of the problematic of essentialised identities, but that these are derived from common (ordinary, everyday) cultural practices. It is the doing that gives rise to the being. These remain crucial sites of investigation.        The Jew: Felicity        It's nauseating really, the clamour to claim an identity: ethnicity is particularly fashionable. But then I can say that, because I'm ethnic, even if """"impossibly"""" (as Jon Stratton puts it). Suddenly everyone is searching the attic; ethnicities which were once millstones have now become markers. I'm not so sure how much otherness I can claim, though. After all, where I grew up, in Bondi, being Jewish was de rigeur and consequently mundane. Removing myself made me different. It was only after leaving Bondi that I experienced anti-semitism. Living without Jews I have become very Jewish, if fraudulently. Certainly, I'm seen to be ethnic, and academia embraces means 'authentic'. But I have known """"real"""" Jews, so I know myself to be """"not them"""", and this still doesn't displace my suspicion of the concept of authenticity because, after all, I don't say """"there is an authentic"""", I say """"I'm not it"""". I eat ham on Saturday. My parents were not Holocaust survivors. I'm not married, let alone to a Jew. Even so, I have a mezzuzah on my door. It lives comfortably with my pantheism. My child is Jewish. I cook matzo balls that are fluffy everytime.        Of course, we could say, it's """"globalisation"""" and that """"postmodern"""" blurring of boundaries that's behind it all. As we intermarry, eat each other's food and become more alike, we desperately search for ways of inscribing difference. Jewish food may not be as sexy as Thai, but it too has been appropriated. Just think of the bagel.        Jewish food, the ways of eating it and the talk which goes on about it, and while eating it, are what have made me feel Jewish. I use Jewish food and foodways to introduce my child to the notion of being Jewish in an even more secular world than the one I inhabited as a child. I once asked my mother why she cut the claws off chicken wings before cooking them.        -- Because we're Jewish, that's what we do.        I have never forgotten; I always cut the claws off, even if I'm only making stock. I never even asked why again, and I don't think she could have told me anyway.        Jewish foodways serve to make Jews conscious of their difference when performing the most mundane of everyday acts. We're talking about creating certain kinds of (perhaps """"docile"""") bodies here, bodies whose every act reinscribes their cultural identity. Eating ham makes me feel Jewish because I shouldn't do it. When I do, I am not just anybody eating a ham sandwich; I am Jew eating ham -- it is an abomination and I know this even if I don't believe it.        So what does it mean to be Jewish and how does it show? Are there any necessary and sufficient parameters of Jewishness (and I mean this in a cultural rather than a strictly religious sense)? Because there's """"being Jewish"""" and there's """"being recognised as being Jewish"""". I recently ran into a woman, an academic I'd met several times before, only this time I was wearing my Magen David.        -- Oh! she said, you are Jewish, I thought so... . I am too, but it's not the sort of thing you ask somebody.          We both laughed, then I said:          -- Yes, but our mothers would!               Jews recognise each other as such, when gentiles might not, and this is probably true of many groups linked by cultural practices. How does this happen, how do you learn to become Jewish?        My answer is that it's all about food, and the ultimate expression of the importance of food to Jews is the Seder, an occasion when story and food combine in such a way that the meal tells a story, the story of Exodus. And just to give it a little extra cachet, that meal has also become a defining moment for Christianity. I employ the Seder as my vehicle for the exploration of Jewishness; as a metaphor for Jewish foodways. Passover is a lot like Christmas, because even the most secular of Jews will pay lip-service, even if it's just the purchase of a box of matzo. My mission appears to find out how it is that this preoccupation with eating, talking and talking-about-eating works to create Jewishness.        The Lawyer: Tracey        My colleagues speak here of """"identities"""". Such a sexy tag. But describing myself as """"a lawyer"""" doesn't exactly feel too sexy. It feels a little fraudulent as well, since I do law but I don't practice law in the conventional sense. I don't own a briefcase; playing dress-ups is donning my Spice Girls boots. If I were to wear a wig, it wouldn't be grey. And the closest I get to St Georges Terrace (aka """"Law Suit Drive"""") is the Perth Myers store. So what is the marker of authenticity for these other identity groups, vis-à-vis my own? How is that I """"do"""" law (probably as well as Reece does lesbian and Felicity does Jewish) and yet I'm not counted as lawyer?        The difference might be the degree to which """"identity"""" touches upon one's soul, one's sense of being. And while """"doing law"""" might connect me to a fraternity of other people who do law in a variety of ways, it's not what I am when I wake up on a non-work morning. It's what I do, but it isn't what I am. Law may have a culture, but it isn't a culture.        This isn't to say that studying law and taking on the professional mantle of law doesn't affect me outside of work. Clearly, to engage with any discipline, even on a purely """"academic"""" level, I must establish that I can engage with it discursively. I'd have to consult with my learned friends on this one, but I submit that the flow between this particular work life and home life is not transparent to those who knew me BL (before law) and AL (after law). But it only touches my identity on the fringes. It's not centrally a part of my being. There might be radars that are alerted from Jew to Jew, or from lesbian to lesbian without a word being spoken. But take a lawyer out of the space of work and I doubt that you'd recognise her as one. No law-person-to-law-person """"wink"""" or tilt of the head; no """"I know what you do, so do I"""" sort of look.        And yet clearly there are ways in which those doing law, whether through practising, studying or teaching, do form alliances and adopt markers of community, apart from the driving of quite posh cars (perhaps there's even a signature car for successful law people, a community of which I'm patently not a part). There are cultural associations. However, these aren't necessarily attached simply to law as a broad category. Instead, I think the attachments exist in the ways in which one engages with the law; they're loose groupings formed on the basis of what it is one wishes to achieve with and through that institution.        This might be what permits a parallel between my """"community"""" -- or whatever it is one wishes to call their social organisation -- and the communities (aka """"identities"""") of my co-writers. That is, while my identity might not be constructed with a view to law-ing, I will at times come into play with others who read law, becoming part of a community of people who read law in a particular (for example, legalistic) fashion. At other times, I might do law in other ways with other people; for example with feminist lawyers, thereby becoming part of a different community. It's about the practices upon which we hang these relationships. It's what is done and for what purpose. Isn't this what one does when coming together with others under a single """"identity"""", or when they form alliances within that identity grouping?        In short, I might not have a sexy identity but, no doubt, I have something that looks like identity in the formation of communities of practices. I might not walk proud, but at different times, for different reasons, I belong -- and at other times, I don't.        The Dyke: Reece        Who are we and how does that relate to politics? Having spent a futile decade or more trying to get the answer right, many of us gave up and argued that the question was wrong. Insisting that it's 'our' party (organisation, collective, music festival, nightclub, Mardi Gras, Pride parade...) didn't help because the next round of questions always returned -- or at least threatened to -- to questions like: """"Who do we mean when we say 'ours'?"""" """"Who don't we mean?"""" """"Who makes the guest list, and who gets to spend the evening in the 'bin' (repository of undesirables)?"""" Besides, """"Who decides anyway?""""        Not having recourse to a """"proper"""" answer -- the sort of answer one could give a quick press and pop on for any occasion -- one strategy has been to depend on a sort of tactical vagueness when drawing up the guest list. """"Not straight"""" will do. But, given that straight is taken as """"heteronormative"""" (the """"two point two kids, one spouse, good suburb, lights on, no fantasy, pervert free"""" model in which sex/gender/sexuality are not only true, but line up, utterly), such a move makes for a potentially exhaustive list. So """"queer"""" becomes the statistical norm. And who, except the Rev Fred and the WA Liberal government front bench, would elect to be seen dead in a yesterday category like """"heteronormative""""?        A related, and much stronger version of this, is to argue that identity, as in identity politics, is neither possible nor desirable. The problem, it seems, is not the content of GLBTQ or whatever identity categories, but our understanding of identity per se. In some wild and woeful accounts, however, a lack of absolute identity slides into an absolute lack of identity (no essential identity, therefore, essentially, no identity), making any claim to an """"us"""" necessarily futile. Post """"identity politics"""" becomes """"post-identity"""" politics. And even if identity were possible, the story goes, it is a regulatory regime. As such, it creates a """"bin"""", an anathema to an anti-oppressive politic. If sexuality is fluid, mobile, partial, not reducible to the homo/heterodivide etc., then the most useful project would be to destabilise the regulatory regimes by which the logic of identity (and the bin) is held in place.        These moves, simultaneously, mobilise an all-inclusive category (queer), retain specificities (G,L,B,T,Q) and undo the whole edifice (queer as critique of all """"identity""""). Another move is, of course, to avoid the mistake of slipping between """"no absolute truth"""" and """"absolutely no truth"""" and, instead, to ask how we go about making up what we do, including who we are, (à la Sedgwick, Halberstram, etc.), what purpose it serves, and for whom. My question then is how """"same-sex"""" has been used, by what """"communities of sign users"""", in the formation of which subject positions, and with what effects. Sometimes the """"community of sign users"""" is the same as """"queer community"""" (""""queer community"""" may be an oxymoron in some quarters, but there are no signs of its immanent withdrawal from """"community"""" circulation, regardless of contamination or logical impossibility). In other instances, the """"community of sign users"""" is not so readily identified in terms of our existing identity markers (maybe we need Eve's nonce taxonomies?), like """"pro- and anti-gay law reformists"""" for instance. And sometimes the subjectivities in question are marked """"queerly"""" (G,L,B,T,Q, for example(s)). Others are not necessarily marked as """"sexual"""" at all, yet are brought into being by and for their relation to queer (in the extended sense). The """"Average West Australian"""", for instance, bears a very specific relation to """"same-sex"""" when used by Peter Foss (W.A. Attorney-General) to argue for continuing legalised discrimination on the grounds of sexuality. Critiques of """"identity politics"""" rightly focus on the nonsense that what we do, unproblematically, is who or what we are. Nevertheless, some sense of 'who or what', some sense of identity, remains crucial to the ways in which we (and they) negotiate the world, even if that identity, like the """"Average West Australian"""", is not necessarily understood as such.

"2001","""""There Is Not Much Thrill about a Physiological Sin""""","                                              In January of 1908 H. Addington Bruce, a writer for the North American Review, observed that """"On every street, at every corner, we meet the neurasthenics"""" (qtd. in Lears, 50). """"Discovered"""" by the neurologist George M. Beard in 1880, neurasthenia was a nervous disorder characterized by a """"lack of nerve force"""" and comprised of a host of neuroses clustered around an overall paralysis of the will. Historian Barbara Will notes that there were """"thousands of men and women at the turn of the century who claimed to be ‘neurasthenics,’"""" among them Theodore Roosevelt, Edith Wharton, William and Henry James, and Beard himself. These neurasthenics had free roam over the American psychiatric landscape from the date of Beard’s diagnosis until the 1920s, when more accurate diagnostic tools began to subdivide the nearly uninterpretably wide variety of symptoms falling under the rubric of """"neurasthenic."""" By then, however, nearly every educated American had suffered from (or known someone who had) the debilitating """"disease""""--including Willa Cather, who in The Professor’s House would challenge her readers to acknowledge and engage with the cultural phenomenon of neurasthenia.            Cultural historian T.J. Jackson Lears, long a student of neurasthenia, defines it as an """"immobilizing, self-punishing depression"""" stemming from """"endless self-analysis"""" and """"morbid introspection"""" (47, 49). What is especially interesting about the disease, for Lears and other scholars, is that it is a culture-bound syndrome, predicated not upon individual experience, but upon the cultural and economic forces at play during the late nineteenth century. Barbara Will writes that neurasthenia was """"double-edged"""": """"a debilitating disease and [...] the very condition of the modern American subject"""" (88). Interestingly, George Beard attributed neurasthenia to the changes wracking his culture:                        Neurasthenia is the direct result of the five great changes of modernity: steam power, the periodical press, the telegraph, the sciences, and the mental activity of women. (qtd. in Will, 94)                      For Beard, neurasthenia was a peculiarly modern disease, the result of industrialization and of the ever-quickening pace of commercial and intellectual life. Jackson Lears takes Beard’s attribution a step further, explaining that """"as larger frameworks of meaning weakened, introspection focused on the self alone and became ‘morbid’"""" (49). These frameworks of meaning--religious, political, psychosexual--were under steady assault in Beard’s time from commodifying and secularizing movements in America. Self-scrutiny, formerly yoked to Protestant salvation (and guilt), became more insular and isolating, resulting in the ultimate modern malady, neurasthenia.            While Willa Cather may have inherited Beard’s and her culture’s assumptions of illness, it ultimately appears that Cather’s depiction of neurasthenia is a highly vexed one, both sympathetic and troubled, reflecting a deep knowledge of the condition and an ongoing struggle with the rationalization of scientific psychology. As an intellectual, she was uniquely positioned to both suffer from the forces shaping the new disease and to study them with a critical eye. Godfrey St. Peter, the anxious protagonist of The Professor’s House, becomes then a character that readers of Cather’s day would recognize as a neurasthenic: a """"brain-worker,"""" hard-charging and introspective, and lacking in what Beard would call """"nerve force,"""" the psychological stoutness needed to withstand modernity’s assault on the self. Moreover, St. Peter is not a lone sufferer, but is instead emblematic of a culture-wide affliction--part of a larger polity constantly driven to newer heights of production, consumption, and subsequent affliction. Jackson Lears theorizes that """"neurasthenia was a product of overcivilization"""" (51), of consumer culture and endemic commodification. Beard himself characterized neurasthenia as an """"American disease,"""" a malady integral to the rationalizing, industrializing American economy (31).            Cather reinforces the neurasthenic’s exhaustion and inadequacy as St. Peter comes across his wife flirting with Louis Marsellus, prompting the professor to wonder, """"Beaux-fils, apparently, were meant by Providence to take the husband’s place when husbands had ceased to be lovers"""" (160). Not only does this point to the sexual inadequacy and listlessness characteristic of neurasthenia, but the diction here reinforces the modus operandi of the commodity culture--when an old model is used up, it is simply replaced by a newer, better model.            Interestingly, Cather’s language itself often mirrors Beard’s. St. Peter at one point exclaims to Lillian, in a beatific reverie:                        """"I was thinking [...] about Euripides; how, when he was an old man, he went and lived in a cave by the sea, and it was thought queer, at the time. It seems that houses had become insupportable to him"""" (156).                        The Professor’s """"symptom of hopelessness,"""" Beard might explain, """"appears to be similar to that of morbid fear--an instinctive consciousness of inadequacy for the task before us. We are hopeless because our nerve force is so reduced that the mere holding on to life seems to be a burden too heavy for us"""" (49). Both Beard and Cather, then, zero in on the crushing weight of modern life for the neurasthenic. The Professor here aches for rest and isolation--he, in Beard’s language, """"fears society,"""" prompting Lillian to fear that he is """"’becoming lonely and inhuman’"""" (162).            This neurasthenic craving for isolation becomes much more profound in Book III of the novel, when St. Peter is almost completely estranged from his family. Although he feels he loves them, he """"could not live with his family again"""" upon their return from Europe (274). """"Falling out, for him, seemed to mean falling out of all domestic and social relations, out of his place in the human family, indeed"""" (275). St. Peter’s estrangement is not only with his family (an estrangement perhaps rationalized by the grasping or otherwise distasteful St. Peter clan), but with the human family. It is a solipsistic retreat from contact and effort, the neurasthenic’s revulsion for work of any kind.            Neurasthenia, if left untreated, can become deadly. Beard explains: """"A certain amount of nerve strength is necessary to supply the courage requisite for simple existence. Abstaining from dying demands a degree of force"""" (49). Compare this to the scene near the end of the narrative in which St. Peter, sleeping on the couch, nearly dies:                        When St. Peter at last awoke, the room was pitch-black and full of gas. He was cold and numb, felt sick and rather dazed. The long-anticipated coincidence had happened, he realized. The storm had blown the stove out and the window shut. The thing to do was to get up and open the window. But suppose he did not get up--? How far was a man required to exert himself against accident? [...] He hadn’t lifted his hand against himself--was he required to lift it for himself? (276)                      This classic scene, variously read as a suicide attempt or as an accident, can be understood as the neurasthenic’s complete collapse. The Professor’s decision is made solely in terms of effort; this is not a moral or philosophical decision, but one of physiological capacity. He is unwilling to """"exert"""" the energy necessary to save himself, unwilling to """"lift his hand"""" either for or against himself. Here is the prototypical neurasthenic fatigue--almost suicidal, but ultimately too passive and weak to even take that course of action. Accidental gassing is a supremely logical death for the neurasthenic. This appropriateness is reinforced by the Professor at the end of the narrative, when he remembers his near death:                        Yet when he was confronted by accidental extinction, he had felt no will to resist, but had let chance take its way, as it had done with him so often. He did not remember springing up from the couch, though he did remember a crisis, a moment of acute, agonized strangulation. (282)                      Again, the Professor is a passive figure, couch-ridden, subject to the whims of chance and his own lack of nerve. He is saved by Augusta, though, and does somehow manage to carry on with his life, if in a diminished way. We cannot accredit his survival to clinical treatment of neurasthenia, but perhaps his vicarious experience on the mesa with Tom Outland can account for his fortitude.            Treatment of neurasthenia, according to Tom Lutz, """"aimed at a reconstitution of the subject in terms of gender roles"""" (32). S. Weir Mitchell, a leading psychiatrist of the day, treated many notable neurasthenics. Female patients, in line with turn-of-the-century models of female decorum, were prescribed bed rest for up to several months, and were prohibited from all activity and visitors. (Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s """"The Yellow Wallpaper"""" has long been considered a critique of Mitchell’s """"rest cure"""" for women. Interestingly, St. Peter’s old study has yellow wall paper.) Treatments for men, again consistent with contemporary gender roles, emphasized vigorous exercise, often in natural settings:                         Theodore Roosevelt, Thomas Eakins, Frederic Remington, and Owen Wister were all sent to the Dakotas for rough-riding exercise cures [...] Henry James was sent to hike in the Alps, and William James continued to prescribe vigorous mountain hikes for himself[.] (32)            Depleted of """"nerve force,"""" male neurasthenics were admonished to replenish their reserves in rugged, survivalist outdoor settings. Beard documents the treatment of one """"Mr. O,"""" whom, worn out by """"labor necessitated by scholarly pursuits,"""" is afflicted by                        a settled melancholia, associated with a morbid and utterly baseless fear of financial ruin...he was as easily exhausted physically as mentally. He possessed no reserve force, and gave out utterly whenever he attempted to overstep the bounds of the most ordinary effort. [As part of his treatment] He journeyed to the West, visited the Yellowstone region, and at San Francisco took steamer for China [...] and returned a well man, nor has he since relapsed into his former condition. (139-41)             Beard’s characterization of """"Mr. O"""" is fascinating in several ways. First, he is the prototypical neurasthenic--worn out, depressed, full of """"baseless"""" fears. More interestingly, for the purposes of this study, part of the patient’s cure is effected in the """"Yellowstone region,"""" which would ultimately be made a national park by neurasthenic outdoors man Theodore Roosevelt. This natural space, hewn from the wilds of the American frontier, is a prototypical refuge for nervous """"brain-workers"""" in need of rejuvenation.            This approach to treatment is especially intriguing given the setting of Book II of The Professor's House: an isolated Mesa in the Southwest. While St. Peter himself doesn’t undertake an exercise cure, """"Tom Outland’s Story"""" does mimic the form and rhetoric of treatment for male neurasthenics, possibly accounting for the odd narrative structure of the novel. Cather, then, not only acknowledges the cultural phenomenon of neurasthenia, but incorporates it in the structure of the text.            Outland’s experience on the mesa (mediated, we must remember, by the neurasthenic St. Peter, who relates the tale) is consistent with what Jackson Lears has termed the """"cult of strenuousity"""" prevalent in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. According to Lears neurasthenics often sought refuge in """"a vitalistic cult of energy and process; and a parallel recovery of the primal, irrational sources in the human psyche, forces which had been obscured by the evasive banality of modern culture"""" (57). Outland, discovering the mesa valley for the first time, explains that the air there """"made my mouth and nostrils smart like charged water, seemed to go to my head a little and produce a kind of exaltation"""" (200). Like Roosevelt and other devotees of the exercise cure, Outland (and St. Peter, via the mediation) is re-""""charged"""" by the primal essence of the mesa. The Professor later laments, """"his great drawback was [...] the fact that he had not spent his youth in the great dazzling South-west country which was the scene of his explorers’ adventures"""" (258).            Interestingly, Outland’s rejuvenation on the mesa is cast by Cather in hyperbolically masculine terms. The notoriously phallic central tower of the cliff city, for instance, may serve as a metaphor for recovered sexual potency:                        It was beautifully proportioned, that tower, swelling out to a larger girth a little above the base, then growing slender again. There was something symmetrical and powerful about the swell of the masonry. The tower was the fine thing that held all the jumble of houses together and made them mean something. It was red in color, even on that grey day. (201)             Neurasthenics embraced """"premodern symbols as alternatives to the vagueness of liberal Protestantism or the sterility of nineteenth-century positivism"""" (Lears xiii). The tower stands in striking contrast to St. Peter’s sexless marriage with Lillian, potentially reviving the Professor’s sagging neurasthenic libido.            The tower also serves, in Outland’s mind, to forge meaning out of the seemingly random cluster of houses: """"The notion struck me like a rifle ball that this mesa had once been like a bee-hive; it was full of little cluff-hung villages, it had been the home of a powerful tribe"""" (202). Outland’s discovery, cast in martial terms (""""rifle ball""""), reinscribes the imperialistic tendencies of the exercise cure and of Tom’s archeological endeavor itself.            Tom Lutz notes that the exercise cure, steeped in Rooseveltian rhetoric, exemplified """"a polemic for cultural change, a retraining, presented as a ‘return’ to heroic, natural, and manly values...The paternalism of Roosevelt’s appeal made sense against the same understanding of role which informed the cures for neurasthenia"""" (36). Outland seems to unconsciously concur, reflecting that """"Wherever humanity has made that hardest of all starts and lifted itself out of mere brutality, is a sacred spot"""" (220-1). While Outland does have genuine admiration for the tribe, his language is almost always couched in terms of martial struggle, of striving against implacable odds.            On a related note, George Kennan, writing in a 1908 McClure’s Magazine edited by Cather, proposed that rising suicide rates among the educated by cured by a """"cultivation of what may be called the heroic spirit"""" (228). Cather was surely aware of this masculinizing, imperializing response to neurasthenic ennui--her poem, """"Prairie Dawn,"""" appears at the end of Kennan’s article! Outland’s excavation of Cliff City and its remains subsequently becomes an imperializing gesture, in spite of his respect for the culture.            What does this mean, though, for a neurasthenic reading of The Professor’s House? In part, it acknowledges Cather’s response to and incorporation of a cultural phenomenon into the text in question. Additionally, it serves to clarify Cather’s critique of masculinist American culture and of the gendered treatment of neurasthenia. This critique is exemplified by Cather’s depiction of """"Mother Eve"""": """"Her mouth was open as if she were screaming, and her face, through all those years, had kept a look of terrible agony"""" (214-15). Not only does this harrowing image undermine Outland’s romantic depiction of the tribe, but it points to the moral bankruptcy of the cult of strenuousity. It is easy, Cather seems to argue, for Roosevelt and his ilk to """"rough it"""" in the wilderness to regain their vigor, but the """"real-life"""" wilderness experience is a far harsher and more dangerous prospect. Cather ultimately does not romanticize the mesa--she problematizes it as a site for neurasthenic recovery. More importantly, this vexed reading of the treatment suggests a vexed reading of neurasthenia and of """"American Nervousness"""" itself.            Ultimately, in spite of his best efforts to recover the intense experience of his past and of Tom Outland’s, St. Peter fails. As Mathias Schubnell explains, Cather’s """"central character is trapped between a modern urban civilization to which he belongs against his will, and a pastoral, earth-bound world he yearns for but cannot regain"""" (97). This paradox is exemplified by the Professor’s early lament to Lillian, """"’it’s been a mistake, our having a family and writing histories and getting middle-aged. We should have been picturesquely shipwrecked together when we were young’"""" (94). The reader, of course, recognizes the absurdity of this image--an absurdity strongly reinforced by the image of the deceased """"Mother Eve"""" figure. These overcivilized men, Cather suggests, have no conception of what intense experience might be.            That experience has been replaced, the Professor explains, by rationalizing, industrializing forces in American culture:                        Science hasn’t given us any new amazements, except of the superficial kind we get from witnessing dexterity and sleight-of-hand. It hasn’t given us any richer pleasures...nor any new sins--not one! Indeed, it has taken our old ones away. It’s the laboratory, not the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sins of the world. You’ll agree there is not much thrill about a physiological sin...I don’t think you help people by making their conduct of no importance--you impoverish them. (68)            St. Peter, the neurasthenic humanist, gets here at the heart of his (and America’s) sickness--it has replaced the numinous and the sacred with the banal and the profane. The disorder he suffers from, once termed a sin, has become """"physiological,"""" as has his soul. It is worthwhile to contrast the Professor’s lament with Beard’s supremely rational boast: """"It would seem, indeed, that diseases which are here described represent a certain amount of force in the body which, if our knowledge of physiological chemistry were more precise, might be measured in units"""" (115). The banal, utterly practical measuring of depression, of melancholia, of humanity’s every whim and caprice, Cather suggests, has dulled the luster of human existence. The Professor’s tub, then, becomes an emblem of the relentless stripping away of all that is meaningful and real in Cather’s culture: """"Many a night, after blowing out his study lamp, he had leaped into that tub, clad in his pyjamas, to give it another coat of some one of the many paints that were advertised to behave like porcelain, but didn’t"""" (12). Porcelain here becomes the religion or art which once sustained the race, replaced by the false claims of science. The Professor, though, seems too world-weary, too embittered to actually turn to religious faith. Perhaps God is dead in his world, eliminated by the Faustian quest for scientific knowledge. """"His career, his wife, his family, were not his life at all, but a chain of events which had happened to him"""" (264). Godfrey St. Peter, like the rest of the neurasthenics, is doomed to an incurable sickness, victim of a spiritual epidemic which, Cather suggests, will not soon run its course.

"2001","""""Paranoid Visions""""","                                              Despite the period's fashionable aspiration to a materialist, scientific objectivity, the new wilderness revealed by the microscope in the nineteenth century did not lend itself quickly or easily to sober, observational consensus. Rather, the nature of the microscopic world was, like the cosmos, largely open to interpretation. Since techniques of observation were largely undeveloped, many microscopists were not certain precisely what it was they were to look for, nor of the nature of their subjects. Did monstrosity lurk at the threshold, or was the microscope a window to the divine designs of the creator? Monstrosity and the microscopic may be a familiar relationship today, but prior to Pasteur and Koch's development of a germ theory of disease in the 1870s, the invisible world revealed by the microscope was not especially horrific, nor did it invalidate long-standing notions of the divinity of Nature. It is more than probable that many microorganisms were, prior to their identification as causal agents of disease, looked upon and admired as beautiful natural specimens. Certain microscopists may have suspected early on that all was not well at the microscopic level (suspicion of wilderness is traditional within the Western cartographic project), but by and large nineteenth century microscopy was deeply enmeshed in the extensive romanticism of the period, and most texts on the nature of the microorganism prior to the late nineteenth century tend to emphasise (in retrospect, a little naively), their embodiment of the amazing, wonderful complexity of the natural world.             Germany was the center of this modern fusion of romanticism, naturalism, and microscopic visuality, where the prolific microgeologist, Christian Godfried Ehrenberg (1795 - 1876) achieved considerable attention through his discovery of the intricately symmetrical, skeletal remains of unknown microorganisms in the calacerous tertiaries of Sicily and Greece, and Oran in Africa. Documenting these fossils in Microgeologie (1854), he established for them the group Polycystina, in which he also included a series of forms making up nearly the whole of a silicious sandstone prevailing through an extensive district of Barbadoes. These widely admired microscopic sea-dwelling organisms were later discovered and studied in their living state by Johannes Muller, who named them Radiolaria. Ehrenberg's pursuit of natural beauty, rather than monstrosity, was clearly appealing throughout the mid-to-late nineteenth century. Central to the aesthetic evaluation of the natural world inspired by his discoveries was a privileging of symmetrical forms as divine signifiers. Drawing heavily from Ehrenberg's approach to the natural world, it had been the intention of Gideon Algernon Mantell, Vice-President of the Geological Society of London and author of The Invisible World Revealed by the Microscope (1850), to """"impart just and comprehensive views of the grandeur and harmony of the Creation, and of the Infinite Wisdom and Beneficence of its Divine Author; and which, in every condition and circumstance of life, will prove a never-failing source of pleasure and instruction"""" (ix-x).            An admirable project indeed, but increasingly problematic in the wake of evidence suggesting the infinite wisdom and beneficence of the divine author included the scripting of destructive, ruthless, mindless, invisible agents of suffering and death against which human beings were granted little, if any, defence. What did such evidence say of our allegedly privileged role in the story of life on Earth? Where might the raw, biological body reside within such an arrangement? Precisely at the vulnerable center of the controversy surrounding the nature of its own existence. Not surprisingly, consensus on what the body actually is has always been fairly frail, since it closed its modern formation in conjunction with the revelation of the body's mysterious, """"hidden powers"""" through the lens of the microscope, which radically expanded, and confused, the cartographic field. Renaissance anatomical representation, thought once to be so authoritative and thorough (maybe too thorough), now seemed superficial. And moreover, as shown by the discovery of electricity and its extensive, shockingly experimental application to the body, we were enigmatic entities indeed, consisting of, and vulnerable to, mysterious, untamed forces of attraction and repulsion. The invention of the """"Leyden jar"""" in the eighteenth century, which allowed the storage and regulation of electrical charge, had been turned almost immediately to the human body, often with all the playful naivete of a child. As Sarah Bakewell (2000) writes:                         One experimenter, Jean-Antoine Nollet (1700-70), liked to demonstrate the power of the new equipment by lining up 180 of the king's guards with hands clasped and connecting the man on the end to a Leyden jar, so that the whole line leaped involuntarily into the air. (36)             The discovery that the biological body was an electrical organism unquestionably inspired the exorbitant interest in the """"ether"""" that underpinned much nineteenth century spiritualism, horror fiction, and the emergence of paranoia as a cultural condition in the modern era. Most notably, it disrupted the notion of an external God in favour of a """"divine power"""" running through, and thus connecting, all life. And as psychiatry has since discovered, the relation of the body to such a deeper, all-pervasive, unmappable power - an ontology in which matter has no empty spaces - is """"profoundly schizoid"""" (Anti-Oedipus 19).            But this did not prevent its intrusion into nineteenth century science. Biologist Ernst Haeckel (1834 - 1919), nineteenth century Germany's most vocal advocator of Darwinism, openly subscribed to a mystical, arguably delusional approach to the natural world. Drawn to study of the microscopic by Ehrenberg, Haeckel was likewise attracted to the patterned aesthetic of the natural world, especially its production of symmetrical forms. Although he drew his fair share of critics, it is unlikely he was ever considered """"sick"""", since neither paranoia nor schizophrenia were recognised illnesses at the time. Yet in retrospect his writings clearly indicate a commitment to what would now be regarded as a paranoid/schizophrenic ontology in which """"matter has no empty spaces"""". Haeckel's recourse to monism may be understood, at least in part, as a reaction to the agency panic provoked by the invasion narrative central to the germ theory of disease: if all is One, notions of """"invasion"""" become redundant and transformed into the internalised self-regulation of the whole. Devoted to monism, Haeckel was adamant that """"ever more clearly are we compelled by reflection to recognise that God is not to be placed over against the material world as an external being, but must be placed as a """"divine power"""" or """"moving spirit"""" within the cosmos itself"""" (Monism 15). This conception of God is synonymous with that discussed by Deleuze and Guttari in their exploration of the nervous illness of Judge Daniel Schreber, in which God is defined as the Omnitudo realitatis, from which all secondary realities are derived by a process of division (Anti-Oedipus 13). Like a textbook schizophrenic, Haeckel stressed the oneness of the cosmos, its operation under fundamental conditions of attraction and repulsion, the indissoluble connection between energy and matter, the mind and embodiment, and God and the world. His obsession with the """"secret powers"""" of the Creator led him to adopt the notion of a """"cosmic ether"""", which was itself almost totally dependent on contemporary research into the properties of electricity. Haeckel wrote that """"the ether itself is no longer hypothetical; its existence can at any moment be demonstrated by electrical and optical experiment"""" (Monism 23).            Recognising the inherent conflict of nature whilst providing convincing evidence of its divine, harmonious beauty through his hundreds of spectacularly symmetrical, mandala-like representations of Radiolarians and other microscopic forms in Die Radiolarian (1862) and Kunstformen der Natur (1899), Haeckel furthered his views through several popular manifestos such as Monism as Connecting Religion and Science: The Confession of Faith of a Man of Science (1894), The Wonders of Life: A Popular Study of Biological Philosophy (1905), and The Riddle of the Universe at the Close of the Nineteenth Century (1911). For Haeckel, clearly entranced by the hypersignificance of nature, the struggle for biological survival was also a mystical one, and thus divinely inspired. Tying this notion together with the Volkish tradition, and clearly influenced by the emerging germ theory, which emphasised conflict as precondition for (apparently mythic) harmony, Haeckel wrote that:                         We now know that the whole of organic nature on our planet exists only by a relentless war of all against all. Thousands of animals and plants must daily perish in every part of the earth, in order that a few chosen individuals may continue to subsist and to enjoy life. But even the existence of these favoured few is a continual conflict with threatening dangers of every kind. Thousands of hopeful germs perish uselessly every minute. The raging war of interests in human society is only a feeble picture of the unceasing and terrible war of existence which reigns throughout the whole of the living world. The beautiful dream of God's goodness and wisdom in nature, to which as children we listened so devoutly fifty years ago, no longer finds credit now - at least among educated people who think. It has disappeared before our deeper acquaintance with the mutual relations of organisms, the advancement of ecology and sociology, and our knowledge of parasite life and pathology. (Monism 73-74).             The """"war of existence"""", according to Haeckel, was ultimately an expression of the ethereal power of an omnipresent God. Denying real difference between matter and energy, he also implicitly denied the agency of the subject, instead positing the war of existence as a self-regulating flow of divine power. Biological survival was thus synonymous with the triumph of divine embodiment. Since Haeckel was resolutely convinced that nature was hierarchically structured (with the Aryan Volk fairly close to the top), so too were its expressions of God. And since God was not a being external to the Self, but rather the vital spirit or soul running through all being, divinity may be contained by organisms in varying degrees depending on their level of evolution. Domination of others was thus a prerequisite for the pursuit of God. And this was the essence of Haeckel's highly problematic distortion of the Darwinist theory of evolution:                        At the lowest stage, the rude - we may say animal - phase of prehistoric primitive man, is the """"ape-man"""", who, in the course of the tertiary period, has only to a limited degree raised himself above his immediate pithecoid ancestors, the anthropoid apes. Next come successive stages of the lowest and simplest kind of culture, such as only the rudest of still existing primitive peoples enable us in some measure to conceive. These """"savages"""" are succeeded by peoples of a low civilisation, and from these again, by a long series of intermediate steps, we rise little by little to the more highly civilised nations. To these alone - of the twelve races of mankind only to the Mediterranean and Mongolian - are we indebted for what is usually called """"universal history. (Monism 5-6)             This fairly crude, very German take on Darwinism, with its emphasis on the transference of biological principles to the social realm, contributed to the establishment of the preconditions for the emergence of National Socialism in that country shortly after Haeckel's death in 1919. In The Scientific Origins of National Socialism (1971), Daniel Gasman reveals the extent of Haeckel's descent into mysticism and its part in the wider development of the Volkish myths that underpinned Nazism in the twentieth century. And although the """"sick"""" ideals of Nazism are undeniably deplorable, upon review of the cultural circumstances in which Haeckel's ideas developed, many of them seem inevitable for a frightened, paranoid culture convinced - based on scientific evidence - that life itself can only ever be a form of war: the very notion that continues to underpin, and indeed sustain, the germ theory of disease in the modern era                      References             Bakewell, Sarah.

"2001","The Noisy Mix of Hip Hop Pedagogies","                                        """"(W)hen you look at the historic angle of what’s going on, DJ culture is the future, everything is a mix. Whether it’s video, electronic shit, studio shit, painting, you name it, the psychology is in place. It’s the DJ."""" – Paul D. Miller, AKA DJ Spooky, qtd. in Tobin                               """"Turn it up! Bring the noise."""" – Public Enemy, """"Bring the Noise                    """"Turn down that damned noise!!!"""" Thus began the nightly negotiation with my father during my adolescence — him firmly rooted in his recliner as he stared at the television, me locked in my bedroom, fingers nudging the stereo knobs to experiment with acceptable volumes. It was never, """"turn down the music,"""" or """"lower that Boogie Down Productions album,"""" it was always, """"turn down that damned noise!!!"""" I hear his words echoed daily in the attitudes of many of the pre-service teachers that I work with as they navigate the tumultuous maelstrom of education in postmodern culture.          Perhaps my students merely reveal legacies of their own educational experiences, or perhaps they embody the transitional dissonance of an epochal shift. Regardless of the """"origin"""" of their discomfort, they seem to turn to those of us engaged in preparing them as teachers to sanitise the """"mess"""" they encounter in schools. They desire Skinnerian behaviorist reductionism (if """"x"""" then """"y""""). They seek to tame the """"noise"""" of the extraordinarily complex endeavor of teaching and learning. I fiddle with the volume knob of my own teaching, crank it up, and offer them hip hop pedagogies.1          By hip hop pedagogies I do not mean simply the inclusion of hip hop culture (e.g., DJing, rapping, graffiti art, dancing) as objects of study in the classroom, although these are indeed worthwhile curricular considerations. Instead of dominant modes of schooling which are informed by a factory model of efficiency and knowledge transmission (Adams et al.), I suggest a fundamental reorientation to pedagogies guided by the aesthetics of hip hop culture, particularly the power of recombinant textuality embodied in hip hop’s """"noisy mix.""""         Dick Hebdige locates the origins, as diffuse as they are, of hip hop music in the fundamental nature of the mix, noting that """"(r)ap is DJ (disc jockey) and MC (Master of Ceremonies or Microphone Controller) music . . . (I)t relies on pre-recorded sounds. . . . The hip hoppers """"stole"""" music off air and cut it up. Then they broke it down into its component parts and remixed it on tape"""" (141). Paul Miller identifies the possibilities inherent in such processes:                    DJ culture – urban youth culture – is all about recombinant potential. It has as a central feature a eugenics of the imagination. Each and every source is fragmented and bereft of prior meaning – kind of like a future without a past. The samples are given meaning only when re-presented in the assemblage of the mix (7)                    In hip hop, mixing occurs within discursive realities of """"noise."""" Tricia Rose notes that the """"sonic power"""" of hip hop, with its """"distinctive bass-heavy, enveloping sound does not rest outside of its musical and social power"""" (63). She summarizes the significance of this sonic barrage:                    """"Noise"""" on the one hand and communal countermemory on the other, rap music conjures and razes in one stroke. Rap's rhythms . . . are its most powerful effect. Rap's primary focus is sonic . . . Rap music centers on the quality and nature of rhythm and sound, the lowest, """"fattest beats"""" being the most significant and emotionally charged . . . The arrangement and selection of sounds rap musicians have invented via samples, turntables, tape machines, and sound systems are at once deconstructive (in that they actually take apart recorded musical compositions) and recuperative (because they recontextualise these elements creating new meanings for cultural sounds that have been relegated to commercial wastebins) . . . (64-65                    Herein lies one of the most transformative possibilities of hip hop pedagogies – the model it offers as a recombinant text, as a mix. Miller explains:                    It is in this singularly improvisational role of """"recombiner"""" that the DJ creates what I like to call a """"post symbolic mood sculpture,"""" or the mix; a disembodied and transient text . . . The implications of this style of creating art are three fold: 1) by its very nature it critiques the entire idea of intellectual property and copyright law, 2) it reifies a communal art value structure in contrast to most forms of art in late capitalist social contexts, 3) it interfaces communications technology in a manner that anthropomorphisizes it. (12-13                    If we were to begin thinking of our classrooms/schools as a mix, as recombinant, fluid texts where the copyrighting privilege of authority in the guise of """"teacher"""" is challenged, where the entire process of teaching and learning becomes communal, and where human/technological cyborgs are valued, we can see how hip hop pedagogies might be transformative. The classroom might become, in my favorite image of postmodern education that William Doll borrows from Milan Kundera and Richard Rorty, a """"fascinating imaginative realm where no one owns the truth and everyone has the right to be understood"""" (151).         Such pedagogical orientations toward the mix invite students to reject modernist attempts to channel and control learning – to """"school"""" the body and mind. Instead, as Potter notes, """"hip-hop aims for a world made hole, aporic, fracturing the fragmented, graffiti on graffiti"""" (8, emphasis in original). Instead of the master narratives of modernity, it """"offers us a model . . . as it produces knowledge in the active consumption of the everyday materials the world makes available . . . it is a work which instructs in its process, indeed, by its process"""" (Block 339).          Is this not a better way to envision our work in schools, which Pinar et al. see as ultimately an engagement with larger conversations of what it means to prepare the next generation (847)? Such mixing infuses life into pedagogies as meanings are reassembled, and acknowledges a """"new paradigm"""" that does """"not necessarily require new data, but rather (is) characterized by clever and substantively different ways of recasting what we already know"""" (Samples 187). """"The previous meanings,"""" Miller concludes, are """"corralled into a space where the differences in time, place, and culture, are collapsed to create a recombinant text or autonomous zone of expression"""" (14). Hip hop pedagogies offer such """"zones"""" of hybrid selves, hybrid cultures, and hybrid conversations that are recombined continually through collisions with cultures, histories, and technologies.         So that’s the noisy mix I share with my students as most salient to postmodern education – cacophonous, turbulent, and sure to infuriate my father, even now.         Notes         1. I follow Gore in her use of the plural form of pedagogy: """"(Pedagogies) use is important to signify the multiple approaches and practices that fall under the pedagogy umbrella"""" whereas """"rely(ing) on the singular form is to imply greater unity and coherence than is warranted"""" (7).

"2001","""""That All May Be One""""","                            In the 1980's, I was privileged to attend the profession ceremony of my sister into the Catholic Sisters of St. Joseph (SSJ). She entered the convent in the fall after her high school graduation and, ten years later, had decided that she was ready to make her final vows and commit her life to the work of God on earth and to this particular apostolic community. Though I was happy that my sister was following her calling in life, I worried that she was committing herself to an unnecessarily harsh life, ruled by the long-standing patriarchy of the Catholic Church. I didn't have much faith that the Church, in its tradition and dogma, could accommodate my sister's spirit of activism and desire to bring about social justice. However, this ceremony, designed and enacted by the SSJ, changed my mind about the possibilities. They demonstrated how """"sisterhood"""" and life in community would position my sister to affect change in the community and allow her to participate in the creation of a kinder, more inclusive version of the Catholic religion.            The profession ceremony and the accompanying mass, though they reflected the new directions in the Church, were unlike any other Catholic ceremonies that I had ever experienced. In a break from the usual service, the Sisters performed the majority of the activities of the mass. A priest (male, of course) was present only to carry out the consecration of the host for communion services and to give the blessing. The taking of such freedom in the mass by the Sisters was something that was unheard of in earlier days in the Church. In the Catholicism that I knew, the strictly ordered rituals of the mass were to be enacted by the priest and observed by the congregation. The enactment of mass also served as a subliminal vehicle for hierarchically ordering the congregation: from God to priests, to nuns, and finally to the people.            The positioning of priests and nuns and their respective roles in the church has been an ongoing struggle for nuns since Vatican II, a series of councils created in 1962 by Pope John XXIII to update the workings and interactions of the Church (http://www.rcchurch/vatican2/). Religious orders were given much more autonomy over their lives and lifestyles, but little had changed in regard to the hierarchy. In 1979 when the Pope visited the U.S., women religious urged him to allow greater recognition and participation for nuns. Theresa Kane, president of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious (LCWR) asked the Pope on behalf of all nuns to """"respond by providing the possibility of women as persons being included in all ministries of the church"""" (Kane, in McNamara, 1996, p.663). Their request went unheeded. Even now, with the turn of a new century, Catholic women religious are still denied the privilege of becoming priests or moving into positions of power within the Church. It has been a great disappointment for many nuns, but they have persevered and created new ways of operating. They changed into contemporary dress, moved beyond just teaching and nursing positions and took up social activism in earnest (Rogers, 1996). They have been bolstered by their desire to make a difference in the church and society, and are determined to find alternative ways to have their voices heard in their work of serving the people.            My sister's commitment ceremony also broke from Catholic tradition and reflected the new directions of the SSJ. She based her personal statement of commitment on the Shakertown Pledge, making a connection to another monastic community, the Shakers, who live simply in the service of God and community (http://www.nypl.org). Among others, she made promises of becoming a world citizen, leading an ecologically sound life, living a life of creative simplicity, sharing of her personal wealth with the poor, renewing herself through prayer, meditation, and study, and responsibly participating in a community of faith. This personal statement was followed by her formal commitment to the Sisters of St. Joseph. To the President of the SSJ, (no longer a Mother Superior), my sister vowed to unite her life to the Community, bring the Gospel to the people and seek union of neighbor with neighbor through commitments to poverty, celibacy and obedience. She received a plain gold wedding band, not as a """"bride of Christ"""", but as a symbol of her commitment to God, the community of the SSJ, and the world community.            In their simplicity and sincerity, the vows touched my heart. My sister had moved from our nuclear family into a new family of the SSJ and the world. Her work and the world in which she moved would certainly be different than the one we had envisioned throughout our childhood together. According to Schneiders (2000), it is much more difficult today to """"locate"""" and """"situate"""" women religious. Unlike nuns of the earlier part of the century, my sister would not be secluded in a convent, away from people and identifiable only by a flowing black habit and service in an insular community. The world was open to her to find her ministry. In these times, many religious orders find and create their own ministries, like a """"bricolage"""", pieceworking solutions to individually fit the myriad of life situations. Schneiders (2000, p. xxvii) describes the phenomenon in this way: """"The unity of the final product and its utility result not from a preordained plan correctly followed but from the inner directedness of the one creating."""" More than likely, the possibility of continually being involved in creative change was the lure of the SSJ for my sister. For the SSJ, the ever-changing, creative nature of their work allows them the freedom to work in places where ministries are most needed.            The Sisters of St. Joseph use their marginalized position in the Church and society as a position for change. At the profession ceremony, the Sisters had found an alternative way to reach the people and serve their congregation. They knowingly pushed the limits of tradition in the church as they expanded their participation in the ceremony and the mass. Then and in the present time, the SSJ, like bell hooks, choose to live on the margins of society for a reason; the margins are """"a site one stays in, clings to even, because it nourishes one's capacity to react. It offers to one the possibility of a radical perspective from which to see and create, to imagine alternative-new worlds (1990, pp. 149-50)."""" At the ceremony, members of the SSJ made statements of ongoing commitment to service and their ministries. They spoke in support of poor people, disabled people, those labeled as criminals, and for all those who were not getting their fair share of life.            The SSJ profoundly believe in God """"who is the origin of all that is"""", and they seek """"the union of ourselves and all people with God and with one another in and through Christ Jesus"""" (1987, Constitution of the Sisters of St. Joseph, p. 3; http://www.nd.edu/~csjus/home.html). For the SSJ, this charism means becoming prophets of the Church. Like their founding order, the Sisters of St. Joseph of Le Puy, France in the seventeenth century, they continually seek out those people and organizations that are in need and create solutions with them. Once programs are established and integrated into the community, they move on to the next area of need. Similarly, they see their formation as Sisters of St. Joseph as a """"lifelong process"""" (SSJ Constitution, p. 18).            After the seriousness of the vows and statements, the profession ceremony became a celebration. Happiness and energy filled the chapel as people smiled widely and enthusiastically joined in the singing of hymns. The final song, an old Black spiritual, """"Oh, Happy Day"""", nearly brought the house down. It was the most emotional group expression I had ever seen in a Catholic service. A special experience had been co-created and shared by all of us, even the many long-time traditional Catholics who all responded enthusiastically. With the staid protocol of the mass was cast aside, the spirit of the people took over. Pearce and Cronen (1980) would propose that we, the nuns and laity, in our conjoint action, had reached a moment of liberation; we were able              to create a new way of being in the Catholic Church.            In their work, the SSJ accept and circumvent the worldly struggles they face with the Catholic Church by acting in a spirit of connection with the people and the community. In their ongoing ministries, the SSJ give witness to their """"love of God and neighbor by living simply and working for a more just society"""" (SSJ Constitution, p. 12). They often struggle with the most difficult of situations and work with the most unfortunate members of society. With their love of God and service, they encourage community members to work with them to change not only the daily conditions of life, but also, the way the Church and others in the community understand and accept all people. The Catholic religion in this form is reachable; the Creator, positioned as God, works through and is simultaneously created in the actions and words of the people. In a circular fashion, God is connected with people, and people are connected neighbor to neighbor, as they connect with the spirit and word of God. In this way, the SSJ continually work toward and create their goal """"that all may be one.""""            At the profession ceremony, the people took this gift of spirit with them and, hopefully, were inspired to begin connecting in new ways with the people and chosen God/spirit of their own lives. When my sister first entered the convent, I used to wonder why nuns thanked each other after sharing a religious service. After participating in the profession ceremony, I knew. Thank you, Teresa.                      ","",""
"2001","The Fall of Every Sparrow","                            That he marks the fall of every sparrow was duly considered by Brother Clothren as he keyed the designation """"Denumerable"""" into the blank spaces following the prompt CARDINALITY? blinking in pale violet on his workscope. A fitting designation, he thought for the paternal man-god of an insignificant water planet-- a god beset on one hand by the most ordinary of human emotions and on the other serving as the crux of impenetrable mysteries. By any measure though, this Yahweh was a small figure indeed compared to deities of higher cardinality such as the ineffably beautiful Aleph Three god of the aboreals of Ka'a Ntg whose very name can only be approximated by a metaphorical conjunction of the galactagrams for """"starwheel"""", """"phoenix"""", and """"beyond all attributes"""".            For countless millennia the graceful metallocrete arch of Brother Clothren's Order of Remembrance has lifted its motto in archaic Fa'an into the dazzling night sky of Kletha. Etched on crystal lithium, its sinuous script reads, """"Choose as gods might choose, those few things to be honored with perpetual remembrance.""""            The surprising proof of Meinong's Conjecture in ages past had established the existence of non-intersecting realms of deities as irrefutable fact - deities wrought into existence solely by the collective belief and adoration of the worshipful races.            Although Brother Clothrens's ancient order originally strove to record the detailed history of each such race, such aspirations proved too daunting owing to their unexpected large numbers. As a result, an early Abbot -- the stately Haa'tan - reluctantly issued a Standing Order limiting historical accounts to the quintessence of each race -- namely, a detailed account of its gods. In this, the Abbott was surely right, thought Brother Clothren recalling one of Haa'tan's more popular quotes, """"Tell me about your gods and I will reveal the inmost secrets of your heart"""". Nevertheless, even Brother Clothren in his chosen vocation of Archeotheist, sometimes murmured at preserving such a minuscule part of the vast and glorious history of vanished races while consigning the large measure of their past to certain oblivion. Nevertheless, like other members of his ancient Order, each night the meek and obedient Brother Clothren dreamed the eventless white dream of the pure.            For the account of the Terrene god a final page still remained. Brother Clothren continued keying in text, """"...that such a simple contingency could spell the demise of a deity of his cardinality was not only inconceivable to his devotees but also beyond the ken of the very deity who would himself succumb as its victim...""""            Brother Clothren paused for a moment contemplating the deep mystery of divine existences then continued,. . .""""On April 7, 1984 (by local solar reckoning) in Estill Fork, Alabama, a solitary sparrow alighted erratically on a redbud tree in Otis Farnborough's side yard. Underneath, a strutting rooster in vivid metallic hues imperiously herded three clucking hens scratching for grubs. The sparrow had flown south from Tennessee into the mountain fastness of the upper Paint Rock Valley in North Alabama where it had contracted aviomycosis and was terminally ill. There on Otis Farnborough's redbud tree its long journey ended as its eyes glazed over, its body spasmed, and then, releasing its grip, the dead bird toppled headlong into a clutch of startled hens. At that precise moment, the ceaseless purview of the ever-watchful Yahweh was exceeded and he became zero in all his parts signifying his total extinction.""""                      ","",""
"2001","Is It Sick to Want to Live to 100? The Popular Culture of Health and Longevity","                                             An elderly man of my acquaintance once told me that there was nothing much to recommend living beyond 90. Things have changed over the past two decades, however. These days all he'd need is a touch of Viagra, an attitude reorientation, a little bit of manifesting and he'd be feeling as fit as, as, well … as a man in his 60s. Had he been around now, as a knowledgeable nonagenarian, he need not have mourned the passing of the years. Instead, he could have concentrated on becoming daily younger. As Second Youth so blithely trumpets: """"In your youth, your mind, body and spirit are capable of great recuperative powers but, as you get older, you believe that those powers diminish. Not true! As long as you have a will -- and a method -- to improve your life, you will find the power to make it happen."""" Lacking the method? Look no longer…            Books entitled RealAge: Are You as Young as You Can Be? (Roizen 1999) appear at the top of the New York Times best seller list, arguing that some 70-year olds can have the health profile of average 44-year olds within three years of making the right choices. (www.RealAge.com) This is the book's manifesto:                      The whole point of RealAge is to promote old age. Healthy, vibrant and young old age. RealAge shows you how you can live at eighty with all the energy and vigor of a fifty-five year old, how you can be the ninety year old who still lives on your own, travels and forcefully expresses feisty opinions -- the person who leaves the 'kids' marveling, 'How does she do it?' Having respect for old age means wanting to end the suffering that so often goes along with it. No one wants to be bedridden, afflicted with heart disease, or undergoing cancer treatment. Everyone wants to be able to do all the things he or she has always done and more.

It represents a new generational perspective reflective of the mindset and the life experience of the post mid-1940s 'baby boomer'.           Boomers refuse to see 40 as middle aged (Wetzstein 1999), and would perish the thought that the Rolling Stones would ever retire. They define 50s as ‘Second youth’. (Gabriel &amp; Molli 1995) They continue to participate in adventure and encounter holidays and subscribe to complementary health care regimes and new age approaches to daily life. They sign up for www.lovinguniversity.net and marvel at how much younger 43-yr old founder Susan Bradley looks on her website than in a recent Who Weekly (2001, p. 71). This baby boomer refusal to age has manifested itself widely in general and specialist consumer magazines, in broadcast TV and radio shows concentrating on good health and super-fitness, and in other elements of popular culture. Even given the hype, however, this new perspective might have long-term beneficial health/medical effects. The aging of the boomer generation may not be accurately predictable from the data collected from other generations with other mindsets. The back cover of Second Youth proclaims: """"Desperate and aging far too fast she staked everything on discovering a natural source of Young Women's Hormones. Now, her triumph gives you thirty extra years of Second Youth. Age moved backwards for this woman. Just as it can -- this very month -- for you"""". (Gabriel &amp; Molli 1995, back cover) Did someone mention snake oil? Or Bluebeard?            Coupled with an optimism that allows them to forecast health and happiness into double-digit decades, however, boomers have a demonstrable suspicion of conventional medical ‘authority’ and a willingness to do their own research on health topics of interest. According to Mycek (1999) """"In 1998, the [US] bill for homeopathic remedies (chiropractic and massage therapy, vitamins, yoga, herbal remedies, hypnosis, acupuncture) exceeded the total gross domestic product of all [US] hospitals put together."""" For boomers, a greater emphasis on health is not going to mean more of the same health care products, delivered in the same way. It is going to mean doing things differently. But is this a healthy way for us to look at aging and (shall we mention the word) death? Is our desire/burning commitment to remain indefinitely young and healthy in some way 'sick'?            It is eminently reasonable to hypothesise -- as many people approaching their 'middle years' do -- that baby boomers are aiming to reinvent the aging process. (Dychtwald, 1999) The past quarter century has seen the burgeoning growth of preventative/health promotion and complementary health promoting services including nutritionists, naturopaths, chiropractors, rebalancers, meditation teachers, physiotherapists, counsellors and life coaches. The oldest members of the richest, best informed, most numerous generation in history are turning 55. The boomers (born from 1946--1960) can't put off for any longer the fact that -- chronologically -- they are approaching middle age. But what does this mean to a generation with many members who would rather be dead than old? Does the denial of chronological age, and the espousal of 'physiological age' (the premise upon which the RealAge philosophy and empire is built) represent a sick fantasy to avoid accepting our mortality?            Baby boomers are a specific, much researched, sociocultural phenomenon. Their aim is to move beyond actuarial projections to re-write expectations of aging. From the self-help movement to the success of the potency drug Viagra, there is ample evidence that boomers have plans and expectations for their own aging processes that differ radically from those adopted by their parents. People born into the prosperity and plenty of the early post-WWII years often police their health attitudes and behaviours in proactive ways. These patterns are likely to impact upon their health profiles in the future and to influence the creation of services tailored to meet different hopes, fears and expectations. Who says Cher can't look young forever?            Most health care planning is based on actuarial data that examines past events and extrapolates from these events into the future. However, this is not likely to result in a valid prediction of the health and aging patterns of the boomer generation. Graham May is a futurologist. He suggests that (May 2000), in anticipating the future, we are attempting either to foresee it, to manage it, or to create it. The philosophical distinctions between these perspectives provide different rationales for those who wish to influence the future. Attempts to foresee, or predict, the future – for example by extrapolating trends – presuppose that in some very particular ways the future already exists and/or is closely related to the forces evident in the present and the past. Managing the present with the future in mind accepts that present actions and decisions influence the future, and suggests that the future does not exist and is capable of being influenced by our current choices. The creation of the future – through techniques such as ‘creative visioning’ – works on the basis that once situations that do not exist have been imagined they can be brought into existence. These three approaches, separately and in parallel, offer ways of negotiating the uncertainty and essential unpredictability of the future, and of longevity and fitness. The longevity and second youth approach combines the idea of managing the future and envisioning it: 'the manifestation' approach.            Baby boomers have already created a different future for our society. They are credited with re-writing the institutions of marriage (via de factos, divorce, blended families, single parents, older pregnancies); marketing (psychodemographics rather than age, sex, socioeconomic status); religion (the decline of the Church and the rise of new age philosophies, faith healing, angels on demand); education (just-in-time learning, lifelong learning); work practices -- and health. The boomers are also rewriting what aging means for them, and to them. Using popular culture starting points, such as Second Youth and RealAge, it seems that a major boomer project of the next twenty years is working to defy/turn back the aging clock. This project is invested with the hopes, fears, dreams and expectations of millions of citizens in western societies. Boomers are practical, however, as well as ‘just in time’ and they know that a belief that they can do it is half the battle.            Let's assume that although many boomers are already fitter and healthier than any generation before them at their age, others may be intending to ‘make a break’ for fitness as an early priority of their retirement. Boomers may also expect their retirement years to be years of health and plenty, and they seem to indicate that they're prepared actively to work with these goals in mind. However, not all will be successful in beating their biology. How do boomers expect to manage their own chronic ailments in the future: arthritis, failing hearing and sight, late onset diabetes, heart disease, incontinence, dementia etc? Will the stem cell implants solve all foreseeable problems?            Excluding alternative and complementary medical strategies, the health care industry is one of the biggest sectors of the economy representing 8% GDP (and rising). As indicated by its growing place in popular culture, health is also a hobby, pastime and pleasure – and the contemporary obsession with health is … sick. Although the social advantage to be conferred by living as healthily as possible, and as well as possible, is self-evident, it may require a level of selfishness and self-absorption unparalleled in human history.            More to the point, however, this approach to getting older brings problems of its own. Firstly, it is built on a fear of aging, and a wish to deny the aging process which may become more desperate as the years (and they will) take their toll. Far from increasing the pleasure and satisfaction of 'a good age' this dynamic, operating over the decades, is as likely to build frustration, depression and a sense of powerlessness. As a (breast) cancer patient once told me: 'It's bad enough having cancer without everyone else thinking it's my fault for not having a positive enough attitude!' Aging is going to happen -- will we go with the flow - or end up like King Canute, with wet feet, trying to turn back the tide?            Secondly, this perspective is counter-productive in fetishising a numerical age. When we're so focused on chronological age, biological age and the celebrating of our first, second and third 'year younger' parties (with fruit and water, please) we're not coming to terms with what's real for us in our ecological niche. Humanity is comprised of sentient, vertebrate, mammals. Far better to know our life cycle, and plan our lives to fit within it, than to pretend it can be revered. Much better to accept that we can be a very fit seventy year old (or a very unfit seventy year old) than to persuade ourselves that 'That's just my chronology, my real age is 44.' I'm sure we'll all be able to tell the difference… If anyone seriously believed the hype of living 26 years younger, you'd have to feel more than sorry for them. You'd have to suspect that maybe, even if they were blissfully unaware of it, they're a little bit sick.            I gather that there's a Centre for Positive Aging recently started up in Perth: that's something altogether healthier                      References            Cassel, C. and Vallasi, G.

All they taught us was Red'. He'd expected to learn something new. Colour identification was for babies. The worst thing was that the teacher kept going on about it: they had to talk about red, eat red fruit, sing red songs, inflate red balloons, colour-in little red riding hood. And then Mrs B wrote the word Red on the blackboard with WHITE chalk. I thought it was an incredibly interesting semiotic exercise and was annoyingly positive about the experience he'd found so disappointing. Going on about the obvious is the business of cultural studies; thinking again about those qualities that seem most neutral or obvious. Colour - and RED especially - is not neutral. (L. F.)                                                        Cultural Studies has been informed by a strong tradition of emancipatory politics. Decolonisation and liberation movements have created a heightened awareness of the way that apparently obvious categories such as gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, are never neutral, and have been historically linked with unequal power relations.                        Colours have become synonymous with certain styles and genres of photography, writing, film, video and art. Colour is at once literal, a property or quality of a thing, and figurative, standing in for more abstract qualities.            What these various figurative uses of colour have in common is the way that they present colour as linked with perception, and as perception that is not neutral or objective, but value added that is, overlaid with cultural value. Sometimes 'to colour' is to add something that enhances. Film Noir has 'artistic' mise en scene to create a particular mood. In cinema, colour constitutes 'special effects'.             is overdone. To 'show your colours', is to identify your bias. In this context 'colour' is used to imply a distortion of the objective truth: judgement can be """"coloured"""", or we see things 'through rose coloured glasses'.                        Colourful is a doubtful adjective. It can suggest the popular of the people. Never have your art or architecture described such, unless you're a Warhol or Venturi. For sophistication and intellectual credibility, avoid wearing colour. A colourful region or district has a strong presence of simple folk, or is promoted as 'multicultural' - has street markets or a Mardi Gras.            This figurative use of """"colour"""" is closely related to the critical analysis of culture and media. Cultural and Media Studies have been concerned with the popular, with perception, with the 'value added'; with the way that perceptions are coloured, and cultural meanings are inscribed within everyday things.            The question of colour is crucial, even obvious, within the visual arts and media. And yet perhaps because of this colour is rarely considered contentious in that context. This is an ideal place to begin then. The feature article, Christine Dauber's interview with artist John Catapan, addresses the uses of colour within visual media forms, and in particular, explores Catapan's preoccupation with the colour of the city at night. The interview draws our attention to the way that Catapan uses colour, not just as an aesthetic element, but as a medium through which he creates a different semiotic field, a 'submerged' world that is presented as something Other than that conveyed by conventional language and narrative.            Naomi Stead writes about the significance of colour, or more accurately, the absence of colour, chromophobia, in modern architecture. Stead takes up the interesting relationship between architecture and the cultural significance of colour in the representation of indigenous cultures. Her analysis of the architecture of the National Museum of Australia encourages us to think of the intersections between colour in form and design, and colour of skin. Mark Mussari explores the cultural significance of colour through a discussion of Umberto Eco's work on chromatic perception and visuality.            Christopher Kelen addresses colour in the context of Nationalism and cultural imperialism. His essay, which examines the very recent adoption of a National Anthem in Australia, highlights the difficulties faced by postcolonial countries trying to develop a sense of national pride that is not linked with the imperialist culture. In The colour of copyright Margaret McDonell comments on the another dilemma for post colonial countries, the appropriation of indigenous cultural material. Mabo offered a promise through its recognition of traditional law, but the expected flow-on has been impeded by the statutory nature of copyright law. Indigenous Intellectual Property Law has become an issue dealt with at the level of the United Nations, although this does not always serve to protect indigenous copyright from imported copied material.            Andy Miller also explores questions of race and colour in 'Multiculturalism and Shades of Meaning in the New South Africa', reflecting in a most interesting and personal way on the spectrum of racial and social categories associated with colour. Karl Beckwith's essay explores the sub-cultural resonances of black and white in the Extreme Metal scene. His work highlights the significance of colour codes in sub-cultures. Finally, Felix Cheong gives us his take in a poem entitled """"RED""""                       """"NELLIE NELLIE NELLIE NELLIE NELLIE NELLIE NELLIE I want you to come back, to shampoo my hair and make a pink cake and we can sit in the back and roll mealie pap in our hands see, I told you not to go in those marches and I told you, I told you what you guys don't understand, what you didn't see, is apartheid's for YOU.

"2002","What is Real?","                        Paul Theroux, like most writers, is far uglier in person than he is in photographs. For one thing, there's the matter of his bluntly-cut toupee, which tilts noticeably from side to side as he shifts in his chair. For another, there are Theroux's teeth, which are so badly stained they seem to be carved from the driftwood that dots the nearby Cape Cod shoreline. Never mind his unpleasant habit of hacking up massive gobs of phlegm, which he then expectorates into the Persian carpet at his visitor's feet.                So begins the introduction to Dwight Garner's interview with the author in Salon in 1996. Though he continues…                 None of this is true, of course. I've never met Paul Theroux, and have no reason to believe that he wears a toupee, or has rotten teeth, or likes to spit into his carpet. But he has encouraged me, over the course of several telephone conversations, to make things up about him.              In 1989 Theroux wrote a book called My Secret History. He declared quite emphatically that it was a work of fiction, and that his central character Andre Parent -- 'a writer, a world traveller, a lover of every kind of woman he chances to meet in a life as varied as a man can lead' -- while loosely based on his experiences, was a character that 'strolled out of my imagination'. Despite this, however, many critics continued to label it as a 'biographical work… couched as fiction to allow for creative license'.        Partly in response to this, in 1996 Theroux wrote My Other Life 'about a fictional character named Paul Theroux, who has led a life quite similar to the author's own… But for the most part the 'truth' ends there' (Garner). In this novel Theroux aims to explore the 'wildly shifting nature of identities'. Did he really meet the Queen, interviewer Garner asks? 'Yes', says Theroux. But no, she didn't fart!        Apart from his deliberate toying with the reader in this book (and perhaps an often misunderstood sense of humour/irony… he is often described as 'prickly', 'irascible', 'doesn't suffer fools gladly' and 'dyspeptic', while he says of himself 'I believe I have a sunny disposition and am not naturally a grouch') perhaps the confusion comes as a result -- unlike his friend and fellow travel writer Bruce Chatwin -- of his producing equal parts of fiction and travel writing, and drawing clear distinctions between the two. Unlike, as he describes: 'the highly imaginative works of someone like the late Bruce Chatwin, who was never quite sure if he was writing travel books or novels. Not that he cared much – the question nearly almost produced his loudest and most desperate laugh, as though he was being tickled in the ribs by a complete stranger' (Fresh-Air Fiend 37). In the cases of My Secret History and My Other Life, I suspect Theroux is having a similar laugh at our expense.        Where Theroux does differ, however, is in his approach to travel writing, about which he states quite clearly: 'a travel writer must report faithfully about what he or she encounters in a country' (Fresh-Air Fiend 40). In fact telling the truth is a central theme of his  Fresh-Air Fiend: Travel Writings 1985 – 2000. And he raised this with Chatwin. 'I think when you're writing a travel book you have to come clean', he said. 'This made Bruce laugh, and then he said something that I have always taken to be his motto…'I don't believe in coming clean!'' (Fresh-Air Fiend 388)        But of course this begs the question as to whether there is really any such thing as 'fact', and if so, do the facts, in fact, accurately represent 'the truth'? Theroux is also quite clear that 'I have altered my memories in the way we all do -- simplified them, improved them, made them more orderly' (Fresh-Air Fiend 7). And he illustrates that 'the books are also, incidentally, the adventures of individuals. Ella Mailart's Forbidden Journey is exactly the same trip as Peter Flemming's in News From Tartary, since they were travelling companions. But the books read like different trips, as anyone who compares them will see. (Hers is clear-sighted and down to earth; his is often facetious.)' (Fresh-Air Fiend 38).        As another fellow travel writer and friend of Theroux's, Jonathan Raban, puts it:                 In all my books, with the exception of Foreign Land, which very clearly sits in the category called 'novel,' I'm interested in the generic edge, the boundary between what is roughly called nonfiction and what is called fiction. I always want to remind people that the word fiction doesn't come from some imaginary Latin verb meaning I make things up as I go along. It actually comes from a real Latin verb which means I give shape to. The essence of fiction is shaping, patterning, and plotting, using symbols, handling narrative, all those things.                     In a recent article in the South African Sunday Times newspaper, about the Bessie Head Fellowship Award for 'narrative nonfiction', the reporter says:                      Looking for a way to hook readers into the human scale workings of the system and arrive at truth rather than only facts, [David] Simon took a year off to shadow a group of Baltimore homicide detectives at work and at play. Then he sat down and wrote a book. Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets… In the 21st century it is the challenge of nonfiction writers to make their real-life stories read like novels.              But this of course also raises the issue of the practice in modern media of creative juxtaposition and editing. As Gary Carter, former Executive Director of a large international television company observed soberingly:                 Consider thirty-two seconds of footage of a child dying of AIDs somewhere in my native South Africa which flickers onto your screen at dinner time, while you eat your evening meal. Those thirty two seconds were part of a much longer sequence filmed by one of our famous objective journalists, who may film but not interfere in the child's plight, a notion so weird that it doesn't bear thinking about too closely. This sequence was transmitted back to London electronically at a cost which would have fed the child for the rest of its life by the standards of its own country. Back at the broadcaster, it was considered and edited by several people eating doughnuts, trying to establish which bits to show and for how long, to hold your attention for the maximum amount of time before some other attention grabbing symbol can be hurled at you in order to stop you flicking channels away from some advert.         Do you think that these thirty seconds represent reality as the child experiences it?         From the point of view of the child, is your life real?              There is no doubt that many of the views expressed by -- and even the experiences of -- Andre Parent, the narrator of My Secret History, are those of Theroux, echoed in his travel book Fresh-Air Fiend. But I suspect that Andre Parent would agree with Theroux that 'fiction gives us the second chance that life denies us' (Fresh-Air Fiend 5). In the final section of My Secret History entitled Two of Everything -- in which Parent describes his arrival at the airport with just a book, no luggage and 'nothing to declare' because he has a house, a toothbrush, and a woman in both London (wife) and Cape Cod (mistress) -- he concludes:                 But this rainy morning passing through Hounslow I saw there was a third person. He was the observer, the witness to all this… This third man was the one who stood aside and made the notes and wrote the books. His life was lived within himself…     He took long solitary walks. He made excuses about urgent meetings and hurried away from demanding friends to eat fish and chips in the park and feed the leavings to the ducks… He was a letter-writer. He killed time at the movies. He went to museums. He sat alone in concerts. He loitered in libraries… If there was a fight on the street, or an argument in the next room, or a crossed line, or someone punishing a child, he was transfixed, and he listened. He was alert, he was alive – not an actor waiting in the wings for a cue that would bring him onstage. This was his real existence, and there was no time to waste, because his life was passing and it was no more than a bubble the size of a seed pearl rising to break at the surface of the liquid in a tumbler, and then it would be over.              But perhaps the final word should go to Paul Theroux 'himself', from his essay Memory and Creation:                 That is why it is often better to look at the past, or at the reality around us, through the window of fiction. A nation's literature is a truer repository of thought and experience, or reality and time, than the fickle and forgettable words of politicians. Anyone who wishes to be strong need only remember. Memory is power. I said earlier that in choosing to be a writer I felt that I was on the right road – but a narrow and lonely one. I remember most of the way, and now I see that it has been the long road home. (Fresh-Air Fiend 21)                         References         Carter, Gary.

"2002","Familiarity breeds Contentment","                                      Every now and then we read an article that encapsulates a particular aspect of some cultural phenomenon, and becomes definitiveâ€”an article that is referred to often by many in subsequent years. This is not that article, but it comes close. It certainly has the content, and its method of delivery is neither pretentious nor patronising.            This article about evoking (terror) fear in film scoresâ€”a """"how"""" and """"why"""" pocket manualâ€”is revealing, educational and thorough. It is obvious the author has had first-hand experience in evoking terror through the use of sound in film and the examples given are uncomplicated and credible. The author's grasp of the fundamental premise that """"sounds are more frightening than visual images"""" underscores the entire approach to creating terror in film music. The explanations of this psychological phenomenon, in terms such as """"we feel sound in our bones, making it difficult to distance ourselves from them"""", are perceptive and enlightening.            The author begins by looking at the psychological, emotional and physiological nature of fear and our reactions to sound and visual stimuliâ€”in particular the brain mechanisms involved with fear responses. Here, the choice of the word """"confusion"""", used to describe the effect of the lack of literal connection between visual and auditory sources, is perhaps not the most appropriateâ€”""""bewilderment"""" might make more sense in this context. The author then points out that fear is usually associated with unfamiliar circumstances and therefore it is difficult to express fear using conventional music structures. Apart from the traditional use of leitmotiv, where a repeated musical theme becomes associated with a terrifying character, the most effective way to induce fear is by use of sound itselfâ€”by variation of what the author calls secondary or non-culturally derived characteristics such as pace, loudness, timbre and pitch height. Our evolutionary fear of certain sounds, such as low-pitched sounds indicating aggression or high-pitched screeches indicating alarm-calls, has been with us for thousands of years. Today, while we are essentially free of the naturally occurring circumstances that would invoke fear such as the likelihood of attack from wild animals or exposure to the elements, we actively seek a group experience of fear to cement our group solidarity and social cohesion.            The fundamental premise behind fearâ€”unfamiliarityâ€”is demonstrated by reference to a wide diversity of circumstances. But a problem arises with today's proliferation of film and television entertainment, a problem that is not addressed completely here. The task of writing successful film music becomes increasingly difficult as fear-inducing sounds become more familiar and what were once effective musical devices lose their punch. This highlights a continuing problem for the film music composer working to induce fear as distinct from merely providing appropriate musicâ€”how to avoid familiarity. At least knowing what is already familiar and having a broad understanding of musical techniques gives a strong foundation towards developing an individual and effective style.

"2002","Umberto Eco Would Have Made a Bad Fauve","                                                               """"The eye altering, alters all.""""              - Blake                       In his essay """"How Culture Conditions the Colours We See,"""" Umberto Eco claims that chromatic perception is determined by language. Regarding language as the primary modeling system, Eco argues for linguistic predominance over visual experience: """". . . the puzzle we are faced with is neither a psychological one nor an aesthetic one: it is a cultural one, and as such is filtered through a linguistic system"""" (159). Eco goes on to explain that he is 'very confused' about chromatic effect, and his arguments do a fine job of illustrating that confusion. To Eco's claim that color perception is determined by language, one can readily point out that both babies and animals, sans language, experience--and respond to--color perception. How then can color be only a cultural matter?            Eco attempts to make a connection between the """"negative concept"""" of a geopolitical unit (e.g., Holland or Italy defined by what is not Holland or Italy) and a chromatic system in which """"units are defined not in themselves but in terms of opposition and position in relation to other units"""" (171). Culture, however, is not the only determinant in the opposition that defines certain colors: It is a physiological phenomenon that the eye, after staring at one color (for example, red) for a long time, will see that color's complement, its opposite (green), on a white background.            Language is a frustrating tool when discussing color: languages throughout the world have only a limited number of words for the myriad color-sensations experienced by the average eye. Though language training and tradition have an undoubtedly profound effect on our color sense, our words for color constitute only one part of the color expression and not always the most important one. In his Remarks on Colour (1950-51), Wittgenstein observed: 'When we're asked 'What do the words 'red', 'blue', 'black', 'white' mean?' we can, of course, immediately point to things which have these colours,--but our ability to explain the meanings of these words goes no further!' (I-68). We can never say with complete certainly that what this writer meant by this color (we are already in trouble) is understood by this reader (the woods are now officially burning).            A brief foray into the world of color perception discloses that, first and foremost, a physiological process, not a cultural one, takes place when a person sees colors. In his lively Art &amp; Physics (1991), Leonard Shlain observes that """"Color is the subjective perception in our brains of an objective feature of light's specific wavelengths. Each aspect is inseparable from the other"""" (170). In his 1898 play To Damascus I, August Strindberg indicated specifically in a stage direction that the Mourners and Pallbearers were to be dressed in brown, while allowing the characters to defy what the audience saw and claim that they were wearing black. In what may well be the first instance of such dramatic toying with an audience's perception, Strindberg forces us to ask where colors exist: In the subject's eye or in the perceived object?            In no other feature of the world does such an interplay exist between subject and object. Shlain notes that color """"is both a subjective opinion and an objective feature of the world and is both an energy and an entity"""" (171). In the science of imaging (the transfer of one color digital image from one technology to another) recent research has suggested that human vision may be the best model for this process. Human vision is spatial: it views colors also as sensations involving relationships within an entire image. This phenomenon is part of the process of seeing and unique to the way humans see.            In some ways color terms illustrate Roland Barthes's arguments (in S/Z) that connotation actually precedes denotation in language--possibly even produces what we normally consider a word's denotation. Barthes refers to denotation as 'the last of connotations' (9). Look up 'red' in the American Heritage Dictionary and the first definition you find is a comparison to 'blood.' Blood carries with it (or the reader brings to it) a number of connotations that have long inspired a tradition of associating red with life, sex, energy, etc. Perhaps the closest objective denotation for red is the mention of 'the long wavelength end of the spectrum,' which basically tells us nothing about experiencing the color red. Instead, the connotations of red, many of them based on previous perceptual experience, constitute our first encounter with the word 'red.' I would not be so inclined to apply Barthes's connotational hierarchy when one sees red in, say, a painting--an experience in which some of the subjectivity one brings to a color is more limited by the actual physical appearance of the hue chosen by the artist.            Also, though Barthes talks about linguistic associations, colors are more inclined to inspire emotional associations which sometimes cannot be expressed in language. As Gaston Bachelard wrote in Air and Dreams: An Essay on the Imagination of Movement: 'The word blue designates, but it does not render' (162). Still, the 'pluralism' Barthes argues for in reading seems particularly present in the reader's encounter with color terms and their constant play of objectivity/subjectivity.            In painting color was first released from the confines of form by the Post-Impressionists Cézanne, Gauguin, and van Gogh, who allowed the color of the paint, the very marks on the canvas, to carry the power of expression. Following their lead, the French Fauve painters, under the auspices of Matisse, took the power of color another step further. Perhaps the greatest colorist of the twentieth century, Matisse understood that colors possess a harmony all their own--that colors call out for their complements; he used this knowledge to paint some of the most harmonious canvases in the history of art. 'I use the simplest colors,' Matisse wrote in 'The Path of Color' (1947). 'I don't transform them myself, it is the relationships that take care of that' (178). When he painted the Red Studio, for example, the real walls were actually a blue-gray; he later said that he 'felt red' in the room--and so he painted red (what he felt), leaving the observer to see red (what she feels). Other than its descriptive function, what does language have to do with any of this? It is a matter of perception and emotion.            At a 1998 Seattle art gallery exhibit of predominantly monochromatic sculptures featuring icy white glass objects, I asked the artist why he had employed so little color in his work (there were two small pieces in colored glass and they were not as successful). He replied that """"color has a tendency to get away from you,"""" and so he had avoided it as much as possible. The fact that color has a power all its own, that the effects of chromaticism depend partially on how colors function beyond the associations applied to them, has long been acknowledged by more expressionistic artists. Writing to Emile Bernard in 1888, van Gogh proclaimed: 'I couldn't care less what the colors are in reality.'            The pieces of the color puzzle which Umberto Eco wishes to dismiss, the psychological and the aesthetic, actually serve as the thrust of most pictorial and literary uses of color spaces. Toward the end of his essay, Eco bows to Klee, Mondrian, and Kandinsky (including even the poetry of Virgil) and their """"artistic activity,"""" which he views as working """"against social codes and collective categorization"""" (175). Perhaps these artists and writers retrieved color from the deadening and sometimes restrictive effects of culture. Committed to the notion that the main function of color is expression, Matisse liberated color to abolish the sense of distance between the observer and the painting. His innovations are still baffling theorists: In Reconfiguring Modernism: Exploring the Relationship between Modern Art and Modern Literature, Daniel R. Schwarz bemoans the difficulty in viewing Matisse's decorative productions in 'hermeneutical patterns' (149). Like Eco, Schwarz wants to replace perception and emotion with language and narrativity.            Language may determine how we express the experience of color, but Eco places the cart before the horse if he actually believes that language 'determines' chromatic experience. Eco is not alone: the Cambridge linguist John Lyons, observing that color is 'not grammaticalised across the languages of the world as fully or centrally as shape, size, space, time' (223), concludes that colors are the product of language under the influence of culture. One is reminded of Goethe's remark that """"the ox becomes furious if a red cloth is shown to him; but the philosopher, who speaks of color only in a general way, begins to rave"""" (xli).

The compilers of the Folio Society's lavish and expensive Book of the 100 Greatest Paintings believe that some works are so overexposed and have been reproduced so often that they can no longer be viewed with a fresh eye.             The Independent, 24.8.2001.                         Sometimes the day just falls down on you.            One day they'll measure the weight of a day. One day science will be able to measure the density of 24 hours. And then I can claim the burden of getting through a day as part of my fitness programme.            She imagined filling in her exercise diary.            Lifted three fallen days from shoulders. Pumped up biceps, triceps, amassed muscle gain in legs. Strengthened heart tissue. Deepened lung capacity.            She shouldn't joke about it. But of course she did. Sometimes it was how she coped. She'd tried not joking, joking, paying attention, ignoring, running away from, facing head on, talking, not talking, sharing, selfishly selflessly, hopefully hopelessly, alone and in company. Of course some methods of dealing with it were more fun than others. She used to have sex a lot when she felt most depressed. What she'd liked most about the sex was the feeling of being what she called underneath, somewhere darker, more primal. Crawling around on the inside of things. That was how she eventually looked at it. As if it was a special sort of art she had created, woven through the threads of her brain cells and tendrils of her nerve endings. Sometimes profoundly scary, sometimes just a cheap thrill.            Why can't you just be happy? she'd heard people ask. People who cared and those who didn't particularly. As if she had willed it upon herself and could just as easily will herself out of it.             I choose. Or I do not choose, she might say. Either way it remains because I have understood it ultimately is not a matter of choice. I will be happy when happiness comes around again. Just the same as the sunshine comes out after the rain clouds disappear. It is a cycle and I am part of its nature. And I haven't yet learnt to control the weather.            Of course shamans could do it. Certain sorts of yogis. Witches. Tap into energy flows and seismic quivers. Even then it was not a matter of controlling shifts in temperature but rather surrendering to it. Making them not just observers of natural phenomena. But participants. Adding their own energy to the natural energy. Bringing about change through focus and attention rather than resistance and will. It would be hard to stay that sensitive in the city. Too hard with all the relentless metal, the swabs of smoke and smog blinding the eyes, the clang and grrrs of the smashing traffic, all the urban thoughts circling your brain like gangs out for some kicks.            She made herself scarce when the days fell like this one. Right on top of her like a mountain of collapsing ash. Even though the others had what always seemed a grudging respect for it. As if she limped. Or was blind in one eye. They sensed its genetic implications. And almost admired the way she wore it like a piece of dark, sombre clothing. Instead of letting it wear her.                                     Still             These dark days.             These black moods.             Like a monstrous pet             She had to walk             Endlessly through the city streets             Until it had walked off             Its rage.                         She closed her eyes. Somewhere in the distance she could faintly detect the scent of a certain sort of coffee, which she craved. She opened her eyes and headed up King St, peering into cafes as she passed, twitching her nostrils like a sniffer dog, nosing out the secret stash of illicit nectar that would, of course, be the momentary answer to all her problems.            She walked past Café Bleu. Too stark, too gloomy. Past El Bache. Too fluorescent, too sugary. Straight past CITRUS. Too friendly, too trendy. Criss-crossed King St to Macro Whole Foods. Too positive, too pure. Back over the other side to the Marleborough Hotel. Oh no, too desperate before midday. Turned left, walked down past the hospital, briefly thought about their cafeteria. But no, way too hopeless and pessimistic. Back onto City Road, past the Uni. Way too cool and know it all. Across Broadway, past IKU. Same problem as Macro, and almost up to Badde Manors. Eek! Way, way too hip.            She got herself back down almost to Paramatta Road and stopped. She briefly wondered whether she should go back to Essential Energies and see the Clairvoyant. But she was sick at the idea of handing over forty bucks for someone to tell her that everything, even depression, eventually had to pass. She may as well go up to a complete stranger on the street and ask them: Tell me what to do, please tell me what to do.            In certain cultures she was sure this would work. Older, more spiritual ethnicities, which had long ago given up the idea that human beings could control everything that happened in life. They'd even laugh at the concept. They might say something ancient and wise and comforting. Something about death and rebirth and transformation and illness being a sign of health and everything the other way round.            But here, pioneer's children, building, growing, planning, committing, grasping, holding on, they'd tell her to pull herself together and get on with it.            If you'd just tell me what IT was, maybe I'd be able to get on with it. She might answer them if she was in the mood for a conversation.            But of course she wasn't going to accost anyone. Not today. Not in Glebe. Not just down the road from Gleebooks. Too literary, too secure.             She bought some Turkish bread from the Lebanese place next door, intending to feed the ducks in City Park, but slipped back inside Essential Energies, with the bread tucked under her arm, just to stand for a few moments near the oil burner. The scents were Orange, Marjoram and Lavender, a soothing combination, the sign said, to calm the troubled mind and open the third eye.            Jesus, she thought to herself, suddenly laughing out loud, on days like this I'm lucky if I can keep one good eye open. Let alone two.            Without realizing it, she'd been making a racket. Aware of the shop assistant staring disapprovingly at her, she backed out the door, chattering to herself like a madwoman, fleetingly remembering how being in a church always seemed to create the same sense of misadventure as being in a New Age Shop. Too clean, too quiet, too affluent, too aromatic.            Back on Paramatta Road she felt like crying.            Some days that was all she felt like doing, tears gathering inside her, not like great thunderstorms about to explode, but grey sheets of drizzle with their slow, maddening incessant drip drip drip on the brain.            She remembered Emerald Green telling her that depression would be the Super Disease of the Millennium. Sometimes she wondered how she would last that long.            If you chart your course through it, you'll mark the map for others, Emerald had told her. Maybe the true pioneers of tomorrow are those with the courage to go out alone into the most forbidding terrain and return intact.            It sounded encouraging when Emerald said it, but it never helped when she was standing at crossroads such as these wondering which way to go.            Walk down Broadway into Chinatown. Wolf down a Laksa for lunch. Burn her mouth and body back to life.            Halfway down Broadway she stopped as she always did, at the Broadway Framers. They'd taken down the Whitely that had been in the window for ages, and replaced it with the usual assortment of famous and popular prints, framed unnecessarily, she'd always thought, in ostentatious gold. Matisse's Blue Nude, Picasso's Harlequin from his Rose period and Van Gogh's Sunflowers.            When she was younger and more easily impressed, her post modernist friends had told her painting was dead and that figurative art was bogus. They seemed so sure of everything, she'd never been sure of anything and so she'd been almost ashamed to admit that one of her favourite pictures was Sunflowers.            She'd never analyzed why she liked it. If pressed to give an intelligent answer it would have been something along the lines of the visceral textures of the flowers, still so apparently immediate even in the hundreds of flat prints that had crowded the waiting rooms of her life since she was a little girl. It would have had something to do with the extravagance with which the stems were stuffed into the case, the overloaded slightly bedraggled, lushness of nature crammed by the artist into the humble little pot on which he'd scrawled his name. It could have been the energy of the brush strokes, which seem to thrust the flowers towards you with such force, as if Vincent is saying to you personally: LOOK LOOK. Have you ever seen anything so beautiful?            He was just doing his job, Painter Bob had said, the job that artists do. To make us look at things that mostly we're too distracted, too busy, too depressed to see. The stars in the sky at night. Swirling clouds. The sloping downwards of a face and all the stories which that particular angle tells.             She thought of Van Gogh whenever she saw that picture. On his lonely road to pure painting, too crazy, to stubborn to do anything else. Painter Bob had said he'd been a shaman, a channel through which his subjects passed in order to be delivered onto paper so that  … we, the rest of the world, us, the rest of history, decade after decade of casual and not so casual observers of art, could see, feel, absorb through the nerve endings in our eyes the essence of what is was, not just to see the sunflowers but to be the sunflowers.            Yellow, she thought. And amber. Orange. Bits of gold. They've always made me feel so happy.             It couldn't be that simple, she thought.            To have the courage to cross the gap that separates the subject from the object. To become the thing which you see. To empathize. To inhabit. To break down the disconnection between matter.            Plump, healthy flowers, slightly past their prime. Still, she thought, they'd cost a packet at the florists.            She liked sunflowers. Despite their larger than life, exotic qualities they'd always seemed to her to be completely and utterly ordinary.            ..in the end only someone who suffered deeply could see the radiance in such simple things             Painter Bob was right. He was after all an expert in such things. Sometimes she felt as if she didn't know much about anything at all. Here she was looking at reproductions through plate glass windows, while above her the sun was almost coming out.            Feeling hopeful, she put on her sunglasses.

Love, love will tear us apart again.             Love, love will tear us apart again.             Ian Curtis (1980) [in Curtis 1995:170-71]           Watching the film 24 Hour Party People (2002), I remembered how much I used to love the bleak and danceable music that came from Manchester, England in the 1970s and 1980s. The early part of the film focuses on the aftermath of the Sex Pistols’ first visit to Manchester in 1976 and depicts the creation of Factory Records by Tony Wilson and the formation of Joy Division, one of the label’s most promising bands. Most of the band members were part a small group of people who were present at the Sex Pistols’ concert. The film shows the rise of the band and the strange allure of singer Ian Curtis, who killed himself in 1980 days before the band was set to embark on its first tour of the United States. After his death, Curtis became a figure of cult adoration and fascination. He remains so today.            One of Joy Division’s most popular songs is “Love Will Tear Us Apart” (1980), reputedly about the dissolution of Curtis’s marriage (for more on this relationship, see the memoir of Curtis’s wife [1995]). In his brief life, Curtis’s recorded vocals were more announced than sung. In a dark, distant baritone, his lyrics sounded almost android-like, hinting at melody without indulging in the maudlin excess of the pop song. His distance from love song sentimentality often moved to a near yell that revealed painful sadness instead of irony (as in the lyrics and style of Morrissey of The Smiths, for example). Unlike the angry manic vocals that had already become a cliché in punk following Sex Pistols Johnny Lydon’s nasal wailing, Curtis offered the disturbing chest voice of melancholia. The band’s sound, as it began to evolve from three-chord punk to a more complicated and innovative collaboration of elements, included syncopated drum beats, a prominent bass line that flirted with funk rhythm, and a dirge-like guitar. In some songs, such as “Love Will Tear Us Apart,” a synthesizer was included, repeating and harmonizing to the repeated chorus. Such an embellishment was unheard of in guitar-oriented rock music at the time. Thus “Love” succeeds on three levels: it is an anthem of the “doom element” in relationships; it is musically adventuresome, and at the same time it is a dance song, played ad infinitum in the new wave dance halls of the 1980s. (Later, New Order, a band created in the wake of Curtis’s death and also on Factory Records, had an even bigger dance hit with the song “Blue Monday,” depicting another kind of failed romance.)            To suggest an interpretation of the song lyrics: the couple’s love is all but doomed. Set in a depressing Northern England, there is no way for love to succeed: there is no room for “something so good”. Curtis doesn’t blame the failure of the relationship on either himself or the beloved in the song; there are traditions at work that cause the closeness of the relationship to dissolve into distance. In the song, it is suggested that the protagonist is unable to satisfy his lover, and yet the couple are unable to speak about it and the beloved turns away. Thus, he and his lover inherit a scenario that sets a mechanism to work against them. They cannot conquer their silences. Romeo and Juliet had the visible force of warring clans to defeat their love. In Curtis’s song, however, there are invisible social forces and the inadequacy of communication itself working against the couple. That their love is doomed is not so new. What makes the song sad is not that love tears them apart; the sadness is that love tears them apart again. Even though they have been through this torment before, there is no way to avoid its return. Without knowing it, they have called upon Love to bring it back.            Of course, romantic love is often – if not usually – the province of popular song, from the ballad to the contemporary dance song. Disco, for example, perpetuated two sides of this fixation on love. One was the declaration of the ecstasy and spirituality of sexual love heard in Donna Summer’s “I Feel Love” (1977) or Sylvester’s “You Make Me Feel Mighty Real” (1979); the other was the manifesto of outliving the heartbreak caused by a deceitful lover (Gloria Gaynor’s “I Will Survive” [1978] or more recently, Whitney Houston’s “Its Not Right But Its Okay” [1999]). Love could be a savior to a lonely soul, providing the singer (and by extension, the dancing listener) with bodily pleasure. When disco singers, (usually female, usually black) sang of love’s demise, it was due to a lowly, no-good man revealing his true self. Yet in these tales, the failure of love sparked the ability of a smart, able woman to live an honorable life – even if she must do it on her own and find a divinity in herself. In disco, Love flirted with religion.            Punk rock, at its inception, turned away from love as subject matter. For example, John Lydon, lead singer of the Sex Pistols (then known as Johnny Rotten) was quoted as saying that love was something felt for a cat or a dog. In a setting squeezed dry of spirituality and sexual bliss, for him love was illusionary and diversionary. Punk seemed to invest itself in other emotions, such as anger, and screamed about institutions, leaders, traditions—including the traditions of pop music itself. Yet love quickly returned as subject matter to punk music. The Buzzcocks, unlike the polemically political band The Clash, turned to romance and sex as subject matter. They debuted as the opening act at the Sex Pistols’ second visit to Manchester, and became known for bittersweet, uptempo love songs such as “What Do I Get?” (1978) and “Ever Fallen In Love With Someone (You Shouldn't've Fallen In Love With)?” (1978). Even “Orgasm Addict” (1977) tells the tale of a Casanova of sorts. The beloved in a Buzzcocks’ song was gender ambiguous, and the lyrics’ tone was ironic – if not sarcastic – about love’s misery. The band matched buzzsaw guitar with catchy melodies; the Buzzcocks wrote breakneck love songs you could dance to, even if the dancing was a bit of a flail. Singer Pete Shelley may seem to suffer from near-abject rejection, but he did so with abundant energy.            Even John Lydon, in his later incarnation as the singer of Public Image Limited (PiL), penned the lyrics to the song “This is Not a Love Song (1983).” He screeched the words in the title over and over, and hence suggested that as much as the song was anti-romance, there was no way around Love. It returns endlessly, even if love was – as concept, as reality – to be rejected as part of a political conspiracy to turn one into a duped consumer of sounds, images, and stories. Love was inevitable. You are just going to end up feeling something for somebody. To rephrase a million pop songs (as done in the film Moulin Rouge (2001) in its medley of “silly love songs”): love is going to get you, it lifts you up where you belong, but it doesn’t live here anymore, although it may come back when you least expect it, you can’t hurry it…            We, as listeners, let the song’s sentiment substitute for what we cannot say. Songs are emotional surrogates for the couple as well as the single in recovery. Regardless, we search the airwaves for our song. “Love Will Tear Us Apart” was this song in 1980, perfect for the failed romantic who dressed in dark colors, drew up lists of things s/he hated, and was prone to mourn a relationship even as it was beginning. As such this song was perfect for me back then, especially since it had a good beat and I could dance to its timely and timeless sadness.            The pop song, then, is a site of endless, popular philosophizing on the nature of Love. Many of these songs, when they don’t blame the world for not letting love last, depict Love as if were a force, or an entity out there in the universe. When it enters our atmosphere (via Cupid?), it wreaks havoc and produces harmony, however fleeting. This metaphysical story of love, however, is far from the psychoanalytic tale of the origins of love.            For psychoanalyst Melanie Klein, love is no mystery. It’s a production process. The baby learns to love through its relationship with the mother and, in particular – at least at first – with the mother’s breast. The mother’s breast provides nourishment for the hungry infant as well as sensuality and security. Through this activity the infant learns to love, for love is made through these intimate connections. Also for Klein, the ability to hate is created when the mother does not provide for her child. The dynamics of this relationship enable fantasy on the part of the child. Melanie Klein writes in “Love, Guilt, and Reparation” that “the baby who feels a craving for his mother’s breast when it is not there may imagine it to be there, i.e. he may imagine the satisfaction which he derives from it” (60).            Thus, even as an infant, one is given to flights of fantasy, imagining all sorts of sources of nourishment and sensuality. One can surmise that since every child has to grow up and lose the intensity of this first connection, one can see that love becomes affiliated with loss. All sorts of complaints toward parents, and later, lovers, are unavoidable – blame it on our psyches which are factories of fantasy and embedded remembrances. We have to grow up and move from a succession of psychic and real homes. No wonder everyone worries about the beloved leaving, for each of us has been left before.            The story of love that Klein tells does, though, have a tentative happy ending, for we are not entirely prisoners of our experiences: “If we have become able, deep in our unconscious minds, to clear our feelings to some extent towards our parents of grievances, and have forgiven them for the frustrations we had to bear, then we can be at peace with ourselves and are able to love others in the true sense of the word” (119). But no doubt, it is a big “if” that begins her sentence. Importantly, in Klein’s view, love is not an external, or otherworldly force; it is made via the needs and interactions of the infantile and maternal body. Equally importantly, though, this process necessitates separation and hence the psychoanalytic love story is one in which the protagonist is taught to love and lose in rapid succession – and requires reparation. Love is both inescapable and impossible. With such a sad narrative lodged in our unconscious, one can understand the reasons why songwriters resort to the metaphysics and divinity of love.            Even though love hurts in its endings, as Curtis suggests, we have a history of trying it all over again. No listener ever believed Dionne Warwick when she sang the Burt Bacharach/Hal David song “I’ll Never Fall in Love Again” (1969). Dionne probably picked up the pieces of her broken heart and found the next guy who she knew in the back of her mind was all wrong for her. As Freud insists, we are compelled to repeat behavior patterns that do not always result in pleasure. This is not because all humans are born masochists. Rather, as Freud argues in Beyond the Pleasure Principle (1961), humans have “an instinct for mastery” that requires repetition. (10).            Freud discovered this “instinct” through observing a child playing a game with a wooden reel and a piece of string when his mother leaves him alone. In the game, the child holds onto the string and throws the reel over the edge of the bed. He narrates his action by saying “fort” (gone) and then “da” (there). Freud reads this game as a kind of allegory for the loss he feels with his mother’s sporadic disappearances. The good doctor wonders why a child would replicate such a hurtful experience. He suggests that this game gives the child a compensatory sense of power over the inability to control the actions of his mother. Freud deems the child’s game “a cultural achievement” and an “instinctual renunciation” (of satisfaction).            Contemporary readers may well be wary of Freud’s use of the word “instinct.” But I suggest that the will to continue to find love is not only due to a desire to find’s one soul-mate (or to put it more mundanely, “life partner”) although this desire is indeed a crucial impetus for the renewed search. We persevere in this almost futile endeavor to find the perfect romantic love in part due to a compulsion to repeat. The love song, even when it pontificates about remorse and pain in pseudo-abstract terms, is often a grown up version of the child’s “fort-da” game. The sad love song is a social device for coping with pain by restating it in a narrated and sung form. That’s why some of the best tunes are the most woeful ones. And “Love Will Tear Us Apart” is one of the best—it provokes many a listener to sing along with the song’s sorrow while dancing in brooding near-abandon.

"2002","Evoking terror in film scores","                                      It is peculiar that we so urgently seek out the emotion of fear in film. We have a thirst for fear, and we go to elaborate means to experience it. It would be convenient if we could invoke the experience of fear without the apparatus of a cinema, but such intermediaries are necessary. We cannot will ourselves to be afraid. To evoke an emotion, we must organize our environment -- or invoke mental images of such an environment -- which then triggers the emotion.            One of the great discoveries of the 20th century was the powerful effect of combining film with musical representations of emotion. It is possible to combine these two media in a way that reflects no naturally occurring visual-auditory correlation, such as the correlation between the sight and sound of a person running.            That two such distinct media should combine so readily may seem puzzling. Background music is not part of the diegesis of the film and has the potential to create confusion (Cohen, 2). This potential was illustrated in Mel Brooks' comedy Blazing Saddles (1974). A sheriff rides in the desert set to suitable background music, but then meets the Count Basie Band performing the now foreground music. The music, initially interpreted on a subconscious or emotional level, is unexpectedly thrust into the fictional component of the film and processed on a conscious level.            Such exceptions aside, there is usually no such confusion because film and music are integrated on an emotional rather than an analytic level. Fear responses do not require brain structures needed for consciousness and analytic thought but can be processed without conscious awareness by subcortical structures (i.e., the amygdala). A frightening score that is not part of the diegesis of the film combines with visual information at sub-cortical levels to create a unified experience of fear, with no sense that there are two sources of emotional meaning -- fictional and musical. The lack of literal connection between visual and auditory sources is not confusing. We do not question the logic of musicians playing triumphant music at every battle in Star Wars, or sentimental music inside the police station on Hill Street Blues.            The combination of film and music is exceptionally potent because both are highly influential media. Economic activity reflects their influence (Huron, 3). In the United States, the largest export sector is entertainment, led by music and film. Film makers are so confident that they invest billions of dollars in them. In 1999 the average budget for a single Hollywood film was 76 million. The prevalence of music in industrialized society is also massive: the music industry is larger than the pharmaceutical industry.            As a film composer, I've learned that I can induce fear most readily by turning my attention away from conventional music structures. In an important sense, writing fearful music should not involve composition in the usual sense of the term. Rather, one may rely on the fact that sound is inherently frightening when stripped of the comforting structuring properties of language and music.            It is difficult to express fear using conventional forms. Fear is sometimes expressed in Opera but using unconventional forms. Fear is also associated with the bhayanaka rasa in Classical Indian music, but evidence suggests that sensitivity to rasas is related to basic acoustic properties such as pace, loudness, and complexity (Balkwill &amp; Thompson, 1). The major and minor modes in Western music are associated with happiness and sadness, but the evocation of fear seems antithetical to such conventions. When music is recognizable, as in a melody with a traditional harmonic accompaniment, we experience reassurance. Conventional music evokes a comforting feeling that we are """"among our own"""" and there is safety in numbers. The possibility of fear arises when familiar music structures are removed.            It is certainly possible to create a creepy atmosphere using traditional forms by repeatedly pairing a musical segment with a frightening image or event. Such learned associations are used in the practice of leitmotiv, in which a musical theme is paired repeatedly with a character until it comes to represent that character. Consider Mike Oldfield's circular melody in The Exorcist or Beethoven's ninth symphony in A Clockwork Orange. Through learned association, both scores created extremely disturbing atmospheres.            The most effective way to induce terror, however, is to manipulate basic acoustic properties, also called secondary musical parameters. Primary parameters include melody and harmony: aspects of music that are culturally shaped and recognizable as traditional forms. Secondary parameters include pace, loudness, timbre, and pitch height: elements of sound that are perceived similarly across cultures. The use of musical convention is deeply connected with one's emotional intention. We create fear most powerfully by stripping music of conventional forms.            Composers aiming to design a fearful score often import and embed frightening sounds into traditional compositional structures, such as a melody with harmonic accompaniment. They do this as a musical challenge or out of concern that their score might otherwise be perceived as unsophisticated. What evokes fear, however, are not those recognizable conventions of composition but rather, elements of the score that are unrelated to conventional structures. We fear surprising or unfamiliar sounds: sudden changes in loudness, jittery sounds, deep hollow textures, and unpredictable pitch combinations or movement.            Sounds are more frightening than visual images, and hence soundtracks are essential to thriller flicks. Visual images are experienced as """"out there"""" and emotionally distant. We've learned to detach ourselves emotionally from visual images by habituating to the continuous stream of horrifying TV and film images. When we actually witness a terrifying event, it seems """"like a movie.""""            Sounds are experienced as both outside and inside our heads. We feel sound in our bones, making it difficult to distance ourselves from them. They are less easily localized than visual images, creating nervousness about possible escape routes. Their sources are not always identifiable, creating uncertainty. Prey rely heavily on sounds to alert them of predators, linking sound to fear. The fear centre of the brain -- the amygdala -- lies deep inside the temporal lobe, which processes sound (LeDoux, 4).            From an evolutionary standpoint, we can assume that humans, like all animals, evolved a sensitivity to the potential dangers associated with sounds. Brain systems that generate fear are highly conserved throughout evolutionary history, suggesting that fear responses in modern brains are similar to fear responses in early hominids. Large, aggressive, or unfamiliar animals are potentially life-threatening and it is adaptive for us to fear them. Low pitches are associated with large sound-producing cavities and hence, animals with big mouths. Loud low-pitched sounds signal aggression. High-pitched screeches are perceived as alarm calls. During the stabbing scene in the film Psycho, repeated screeching sounds or """"alarm-calls"""" combine with the visual scene to induce excruciating fear.            In industrialized society, fear of predation is largely non-existent, replaced with a fear of our own technology: car and airplane accidents, nuclear disasters, weapons. But fear responses today are the result of adaptive pressures that took place thousands of years ago when predation was a constant threat. We are acutely sensitive to alarm calls and predatory sounds. When predators of humans are portrayed in film, as in Jaws or Jurassic Park, the experience of fear is unbearable.            Why do we so urgently seek out this unpleasant emotion? One possibility relates to social cohesion. Group solidarity is enhanced when there is a common enemy. The object of fear in film distinguishes """"us against them"""" and secures a bond between those experiencing the terror. The representation of fear identifies an enemy (the object of fear) to enhance solidarity. Teenagers -- who have the greatest need for social bonding and self definition -- are voracious consumers of terror films.            Shared experiences of film-induced fear are extremely widespread. In the week ending May 28th, 2000, there were over 3,100 screening of Gladiator in the United States. America dominates the world market in film and music (only India has resisted this domination). For better or worse, Hollywood emotions are globally shared. People from Japan, China, Italy, Spain, and Brazil have a common bond on the basis of having seen The Matrix or The Exorcist.            Fear in film also performs another function. Films are externalized representations of cultural memory, and of culturally significant or meaningful experiences. They are a mechanism for accumulating and transmitting knowledge of the environment, preparing ourselves for circumstances in which we might find ourselves. Terror films stimulate the development of cognitive strategies for coping with challenging circumstances.            All of us -- teenagers especially -- feel a need to prepare ourselves for hostile environments. Terror films not only nurture social bonding, they motivate the refinement of an essential human trait: courage. By situating ourselves within an environment that presents various hypothetical sources of terror, we test our courage, and we activate the development of important strategies for coping with the very real fears with which we will inevitably be confronted.

"2002","'Mind the Gap'","                           The structuring of a film's plot as the trajectory of the goals and desires of a single protagonist can be seen as the most critical development in cinematic narrative. In addition to its commodity implications via the star system and its centrality to a range of important film theories about fantasy and pleasure, the single protagonist is the linchpin of the cinema's ability to transmit messages that confirm the most basic myths about the power of the individual in society. While Hollywood's use of the single protagonist as a model for the self is particularly detrimental in the United States, the international dominance of American cinema means that this narrative convention can affect the formation of the self around the world.            As a result, the single protagonist is the element that is most often critiqued by filmmakers and theorists who want cinema to be more politically engaged. In fact, one way of identifying a film that is aggressively political is to examine its treatment of the protagonist function. In Potemkin, for example, Sergei Eisenstein substitutes a group protagonist for Hollywood's individual so that he can demonstrate the unity of the people against their oppressors. Roberto Rossellini's neo-realist films Roma città aperta and Paisà likewise contain structures that are meant to undermine traditional Hollywood modes of narration since both films use what I call a serial protagonist. These strategies have become noticeably common, as multi-protagonist films have appeared in France, Hong Kong, and in the United States. As is typical, however, a cinematic strategy that trumpets political engagement in Europe is reduced to a stylish ornament in Hollywood. In American multi-protagonist films, the single protagonist is jettisoned, not to make a political statement, but in order to emphasise emotion over intellect, to encourage the audience not to think, but to feel. The two main strategies for accomplishing this goal are narrative fragmentation and disrupted character attachment.            There are basically two kinds of multi-protagonist films. Margrit Tröhler calls them """"group films"""" and """"mosaic films."""" Group films feature an ensemble, a single large group such as a family or a gang whose stories are linked spatially to some central meeting place. Mosaic films, on the other hand, present a number of small groups, couples, or single characters. Initially, these people are linked only insofar as they happen to live in the same city at the same time, though eventually, as the narrative goes on, their stories become enmeshed, largely through coincidence. As a further breakdown, I would separate the """"mosaic films"""" into action films and emotive films. Amores Perros and Go would be examples of multi-protagonist action films, where the most intense episodes in the film are active and violent; Magnolia and Happiness are examples of multi-protagonist emotive films, films in which the moments of greatest intensity are reactive and emotional. These intense moments, which occur as a series rather than as the result of cause-and-effect, are assumed to provide the major source of pleasure for spectators.            Magnolia, directed by Paul Thomas Anderson in 1999, is perhaps the most striking of all the recent group of American multi-protagonist emotive films. Like Pulp Fiction and American Beauty, Magnolia was meant to bridge the gap between independent film and mainstream studio production. From its inception, Magnolia was planned as a quality production, and Anderson sold himself to New Line as their entrée into the prestige market. New Line, """"the only major studio that has never had an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture"""" (Hirschberg 55), thought that Anderson would be their Quentin Tarantino and gave him total creative control. Michael De Luca, head of production at New Line, agrees with Anderson that there is a link between films like Magnolia and the films of the New American Cinema on the 1970s: """"People who grew up on the 70s movies now have power around town"""" (Hirschberg 55), explaining why we are seeing so many experimental and edgy films since the turn of the century. The other thing that these people grew up on was TV, and narrative forms developed explicitly for television have become increasingly common in mainstream American cinema. Classic film theory analysed the spectator/protagonist relationship as one based on identification and resulting in momentary coherence and empowerment. Because the viewing practices associated with television are so different from those supported by classic cinema, these new TV-influenced films can be expected to create a different model for the self.            The narrative structure that these millennial multi-protagonist films most closely resemble is that of the American daytime soap opera. Ironically, despite the low esteem in which soap operas are held, their episodic narrative structure and emphasis on emotions rather than logic directly shape much of cinematic storytelling today. Also ironically, whenever a non-soap opera text adopts soap practices, that text is seen as doing something daring. For example, TV series like Hill St. Blues that adopted soap operas' ensemble casts and arc narrative structure were labeled """"quality television"""" (Feuer et al.). In a similar way, the fragmented narratives of multi-protagonist films like Magnolia are seen as stylish and experimental. However, the strategy is risky, since adoption of these narrative structures disrupts the strong bond that the single protagonist is expected to secure and may undermine viewers' pleasure in the film if they are not accustomed to soap-opera conventions.            Whether it is a segment, a day's episode, or the entire run of the programme, the most striking aspect of soap-opera narrative is the fact it begins and ends in medias res. Emphasis on the middle of a story means that less attention is given to its beginning and end. Another way to say this is that soap operas focus most of their attention on the present. The focus on the present means that, although the characters in Magnolia clearly have pasts, they do not have histories. We do not know why Jimmy Gator molested his daughter, why Earl Partridge deserted his dying wife and 14-year-old son, what has happened to Stanley's mother, whether his father is successful in his career, or why Jim Kurring has become a cop. This lack of history makes it difficult to make moral judgements about them. The single character in Magnolia who explicitly attempts to create a history for himself is Frank Mackey, the male-empowerment guru played by Tom Cruise. Mackey says that a focus on the past is an excuse for not progressing in the present, further thematising the importance of the present.            Soap narratives are created specifically for a viewing situation that incorporates a range of institutionally required ruptures -- commercials, promos, and other imbedded messages. As a result, soaps incorporate devices designed to sustain interest during these enforced breaks. The most typical of these strategies is the narrative gap created by an interrupted action or an unanswered question. On a daytime soap, we may only have to wait five minutes or so before returning to a particular narrative thread, but films with longer running times often extend that period considerably. For example, Gwenovier asks Frank why he would lie about the facts of his background. We do not return to Frank for over thirteen minutes. Soap-opera viewers are comfortable with these often silly narrative breaks because they know that the narrative line will eventually pick up exactly where it left off. That is not always the case in these films, however, and, indeed, Frank changes the subject. These lengthy interruptions clearly pose a challenge to active spectatorship as well as to audience tolerance.            Since soap operas are eternal middles, the end of a story is always construed as a new beginning. Happy couples are presumed to be boring, and so no relationship is coded as permanent and impregnable. This pressure to resist closure creates a problem for narrative construction in multi-protagonist films, many of which have to go to great lengths to create anything like an ending. Generally chance or coincidence must be involved, a break with an important classical convention of narrative construction. Robert Altman needed an earthquake in Short Cuts, and P. T. Anderson needed frogs to rain down from the skies in order to begin to end Magnolia. Interestingly, while the open ending has been linked to the importance of the sequel in the New Hollywood, none of these multi-protagonist films has been the basis of a sequel.            Soap operas have huge casts, and often characters will not appear every day. As a result, soaps are marked by diffuse viewer-character attachment. To ensure that the viewer will stay involved with the widest range of characters, the most effective soap stories present events from the perspectives of all parties to a conflict. As a result, on most soaps, while characters may do bad things from time to time, they are rarely represented as out-and-out villains. Like daytime soap operas, there are no villains in multi-protagonist emotive films. The wickedest character in Magnolia is the beloved game-show host who may have abused his young daughter. The film tries to ameliorate our sense of disgust by withholding this information until near the end of the film, focusing our attention instead on the facts that he is dying of cancer and that his daughter, a shrill and unattractive cocaine addict, cannot stand the sight of him.            As a result, characters are not obviously coded in ways that make it easy for us to make moral judgments about them. Moreover, while the characters are single-mindedly going about their business, we are continually distracted and directed toward someone else's story. Far from being victims relentlessly carried along by the plot, the characters in these films burst into and disrupt the narratives of others, demanding our attention. The spectator must therefore contend not only with narrative ruptures but also with the need to reacquaint him- or herself with the characters and to continually renegotiate his or her relationship with them. This relationship will be affected not only by what the character was doing when we last met him or her, but on what kind of experience we have had during the intervening action.            Two of the most useful ways of conceptualising the process by which we interact with characters in film -- those of Murray Smith and Carl Plantinga -- are put at a disadvantage by the multi-protagonist film. Both of these cognitive approaches describe the stages that spectators go through in deciding who the characters are and how we feel about what they do, and both reject psychoanalytic identification as part of their model. Although I ordinarily find their approaches highly useful, studying the multi-protagonist film leads me to conclude that their approaches are applicable to these films only with great difficulty.            Both Smith and Plantinga ground their analyses on the conscious, intellectual, and voluntary conclusions that we make about the personalities and activities of the characters in films. Both men emphasise the power that narrative has in the formation of these emotional responses, and both minimise the involuntary and autonomic responses that derive from cinematic techniques rather than from the narrative. However, the fragmented nature of the narrative in the multi-protagonist film, the difficulty that characters have in dominating either our consciousness or their own worlds, and the diffusion of interest keep the process from working as Smith and Plantinga describe.            For example, Murray Smith suggests that character attachment occurs in three stages: recognition, alignment, and allegiance. Each of these stages is compromised in the experience of viewing a multi-protagonist film. Recognition is the name given to the stage in which we notice various traits of the character and arrange them into some kind of coherent personality, much as we do when we meet people in real life. Magnolia takes advantage of this process to set traps for us: since the characters have no histories, if we stereotype them, we will fall into a trap. For example, Phil Parma, the male nurse, includes several sex magazines in his grocery order. While we might assume that Phil wants the magazines only to """"read the articles,"""" he uses them to get in touch with Frank, who advertises in them. However, since we know nothing of Phil's history, we cannot exonerate him: he may have remembered seeing Frank's ad in a previous issue of the magazine, or his seeing the advertisement now could simply be the kind of serendipitous accident thematised by the film.            Alignment, the next phase in the character-attachment process, is likewise compromised by the multi-protagonist film. A film's investment in aligning us to a character is seen as a function of the quantity of time we spend with the character, of the degree of narrative restriction, of the representational strategies used with the character, and of the degree of access that we are given to that character's mental and emotional states. Unlike films with single protagonists, no character dominates screen time or narration in a multi-protagonist film. Nor is one character particularly favored cinematically: all the main characters are given close-ups, camera movements, and compositional prominence. In Magnolia, Jim the cop could be said to dominate the narrative since the primary action of the film begins and ends with him, he is presented as the film's moral centre, and a voiceover allows us access to his thoughts. But, as a figure representing law and order, and thus as a vehicle for the imposition of narrative control, he is a failure. He loses his gun, never realises that Claudia is high on cocaine, and allows Donnie to return the money that he stole from the furniture store where he used to work. Moreover, the narrational authority of Jim's voiceover is undermined: voiceover shots segue seamlessly into shots in which he is shown clearly talking out loud to himself. While this is a common soap-opera technique, it is uncommon in cinema and is likely to make us wonder whether Jim is OK.            Finally, allegiance occurs when we weigh everything that we know about the character against his or her actions and make a moral judgment about him or her. Smith calls this """"the structure of sympathy"""" and sees our feelings as falling along a continuum from sympathy to antipathy. Since there are no villains, it is likely that, with the exception of Jimmy Gator, we have a certain amount of sympathy for all the characters in Magnolia. That said, it is unlikely that we really like any of them either.            Thus, I would argue that, if one does derive pleasure from the experience of seeing a multi-protagonist film like Magnolia, empathy is likely to be one's primary response. Both Plantinga and Smith marginalise empathy since both see it as an involuntary response to the film's cinematic techniques rather than as a product of the conscious processing of a film's narrative. However, it is for that very reason that I see empathy as the desired response in the multi-protagonist film. The fragmented narrative and the difficulties that it causes for character attachment make any other response problematic. Like the characters in the film, we are not supposed to think, just to feel.            These films (and the daytime soaps) thematise several key aspects of life as we live it now: First, the plenitude of these films is such that they cannot be brought to an ending in the classical Hollywood sense; they do not end, they simply stop, and their stopping place is construed as a new beginning. Second, like the characters in Magnolia, our real lives are ruled by chance in ways that Hollywood used to deny. Second, even though the past remains an important narrative element -- three different voices in Magnolia say that """"We may think we're done with the past, but the past is not done with us"""" -- the intensity of the emotions expressed by the characters tells us that the tensions of the present moment are really all that matter.            Multi-protagonist films present several advantages to their producers and creators (e.g., the role of chance makes plot construction easier, a star doesn't have to carry the entire picture, the film can appeal to a broader demographic, the structure is critically marked as daring), but they also compromise the film's ability to represent the power of the individual, the theme that is central in all mainstream American films. Unfortunately, the American multi-protagonist film does not interrogate that theme or even address its absence directly. By presenting the spectator with a string of narrative fragments, these films create a series of sensational episodes in which people's emotions explode instead of buildings. The emotive blockbuster supports rather than critiques the view of the self as isolated, solipsistic, and focused on personal rather than social distress.

"2003","That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore","                           Michael Smith, the Martian of Robert Heinlein's 1961 novel Stranger in a Strange Land is having a lot of difficulty in understanding what makes up that strange creature he has just encountered for the first time, the """"human."""" A trip to the local zoo and a cage of monkeys provides the answer for him. There, a peanut is thrown to a small monkey who takes it eagerly. This monkey is immediately bowled over by a larger monkey, and the peanut is stolen from him. The small monkey runs away howling, until it tracks down an even smaller monkey to beat the daylights out of. The rest of the monkeys choose to ignore the entire incident altogether. At this, Michael begins to laugh uncontrollably, so hard that he is unable to stop for hours. A revelatory moment, at last the Martian has understood (in his idiolect, he has """"grokked"""") that fundamental secret of what it is to be human:                          """"I've found out why people laugh. They laugh because it hurts-because it's the only thing that'll make it stop hurting-of course it wasn't funny; it was tragic. That's why I had to laugh. I looked at a cage full of monkeys and suddenly I saw all the mean and cruel and utterly unexplainable things I've seen and heard and read about - and suddenly it hurt so much I found myself laughing"""" (Heinlein 289).                        Slovoj Zizek's Lacanian psychoanalytic writings are often based around this same fundamental insight into the human condition: that one should remain aware of the utterly strange and paradoxical chasm that lies at the centre of our psychic make-up. Zizek would consider Michael's laughter at the monkeys an example of concealment of primal trauma via the safety gauge of laughter, for this act of jouissance, as Flieger puts is (taking her cue from Freud): """"breaks laws and re-establishes them simultaneously, but avoids tragic conflict by re-routing deadly hostile impulses along a route of substitutive conciliation"""" (Flieger 65). Behind this jouissance lies the Real,which must be understood as that crucial X factor behind existence, that chaotic """"inruption of non-sense"""" (as Eagleton paraphrases) into the carefully-constructed orders of the Symbolic and the Imaginary (42). At this point, then, we might suppose that laughter is a purely beneficial and therapeutic act, halting probable psychosis. This perhaps explains why Zizek is so interested in the cynical strain he has identified as one of modern society's greatest afflictions, which he identifies as a kind of jouissance without the Real.             Cynicism is one of the recurring bugbears of Zizek's recent work,stretching back to his first major work in English, The Sublime Object of Ideology (1989). His theory is grounded in Peter Sloterdijk's Critique of Cynical Reason (first published in 1983), in which cynicism is defined as """"enlightened false consciousness. It is that modernised, unhappy consciousness, on which Enlightenment has laboured-well-off and miserable at the same time"""" (5). Sloterdijk interprets the period of the Enlightenment as the formative period for the development of our modern subjectivity, and Zizek adds (following Lacan) that this is because this period saw the birth of the Cartesian """"subject"""". The performative act of becoming a subject, Zizek indicates, is another way of evading the Real: """"subjectivization is a way to elude the void which """"is"""" the subject, it is ultimately a defense mechanism against the subject"""" (Enjoy 186). The historicity of this cynical attitude is a point that Zizek continually reiterates-the """"false consciousness"""" of cynicism developed because """"the Enlightenment project has gone wrong"""" (136). Such a historicist view points to the finitude of the cynical split. The optimistic obverse of this focus on the past is that one day there may be the possibility for suture. But as for contemporary society, Zizek negates the paranoiac Adornian conclusion that our modern age is a post-ideological one. Instead, he asserts that we are in fact so entrenched in ideology that it is difficult to even distinguish its parameters. There is a breakdown in the relationship between the 'knowledge' and the 'act': """"the cynical subject is quite aware of the distance between the ideological mask and the social reality, but he nonetheless still insists upon the mask"""" (Subject 29). A problem is still raised, for while emphasising that cynicism is a much more insidious kind of masked ideology, he also emphasises the absolute necessity of every ideological foundation. The danger lies because the """"true"""" face is kept hidden from view:                          """"the illusion is not on the side of knowledge, it is already on the side of reality itself, of what the people are doing. What they do not know is that their social reality itself, their activity, is guided by an illusion, by a fetishistic inversion. What they [i.e. cynical people] overlook, what they misrecognise, is not the reality but the illusion which is structuring their reality, their real social activity"""" (Subject 32)                        One of the strategies of cynical consciousness is the """"kynical"""", the attitude to constantly critique society, coined by Sloterdijk) (Subject 29). In recent comedy, one of the chief examplars of """"kynical"""", understated, humour would have to be Jerry Seinfeld's observational style of standup comedy that become so popular during the nineties (i.e. """"what's the deal with-airports/queues/etc.""""). Seinfeld avoids the overtly political in his comedy, but his usual focus on the banalities of the quotidian (as he calls it, the """"minutiae"""") can be interpreted as an attack on aspects of Western consumer culture. The very act of asking the question """"what's the deal?"""" implies a certain dissatisfaction with the status quo of consumer culture, it poses the question """"why is our society so strange?"""" In response to such a question, the audience laughs because it recognises the particular aspect of society that Seinfeld aims to deconstruct. At the same time, an economy of desire is constructed around the act of the laughter itself.             For Zizek, cynicism is a self-gratifying gesture that follows the fetishistic logic of """"I know very well the truth of this statement, but in the meantime."""" There is jouissance in the act of recognition (or false consciousness), which of course deflects the original impulse that we presume to be social critique. This """"kynicism"""" performs the opposite effect of Victor Shklovsky's concept of ostraneniye, the method of """"making strange"""" the symbolic language, which Zizek would interpret as the """"philosophical experience of 'wondering'"""" Enjoy 53). Seinfeld's comedy skips over that moment of comprehension, that breakdown to the shock of the Real. In other words, Seinfeld's cynicism yada yada yadas over the point de capiton. Therefore, cynicism is another attempt to reposition the symbolic as the primary level of experience, to usurp the Real with """"reality.""""However, in the turbulent days that followed September 11, we find a counter at least to this """"kynical"""" style of humour (the kind of comedy exemplified in Australia by such TV shows as The Glass House and the now-defunct Good News Week). The satirical show Politically Incorrect was pulled from the air on the American ABC network, after its host, Bill Maher, disputed President Bush's statement that the World Trade Centre terrorists were """"cowardly."""" On the show airing on the seventeenth of September, Maher made the following statement: """"we have been the cowards lobbing cruise missiles from two thousand miles away. That's cowardly-staying in the airplane when it hits the building, say what you want about it, it's not cowardly. """"             Au contraire to the show's title, this was perhaps one of the most politically correct statements ever made on American television, and it cost Maher his television show. Politically Incorrect was immediately pulled from the air in many American states (including Washington DC), and the show, crippled by public criticism and the loss of advertising money, was axed soon after. Maher normally utilised a """"kynical"""" standpoint to throw stones at the big Other (i.e. the US political system), and as we have already seen with the example of Seinfeld, the jolting """"Real"""" moment of the humour never seems to happen. Was Maher's September 11 comment one of the sublime instances of the letter """"reaching its destination"""" to the American public? The jolting ostraneniye of this comedy is precisely that here there is no joke, no consoling sedative of jouissance, and the shock that followed in this humour deficit was one of denial and anger. One may argue that this instance provided a more """"Real"""" moment for the American public than the media spectacle surrounding September 11 itself. Zizek writes in """"Welcome to the Desert of the Real"""" (posted on the internet on the same day as that episode of Politically Incorrect), that Americans have libidinally invested in images of catastrophe for years. Catastrophe is one of the healthiest signs of the persistence of the symbolic order. By saying """"we are the cowards!"""", Maher was essentially telling his public """"we are the enemy!"""" or """"we are the Symbolic!"""", and for a short time he dissolved the force of the non-existent Big Other. It is no wonder that he was ejected from this symbolic order at lightning speed. Here, I can't help being reminded of Guy Debord's axiom in The Society of the Spectacle, that """"in a world which really is topsy-turvy, the true is a moment of the false"""". In Zizek's cynical society, it seems to be strange but true that when the joke isn't funny anymore is really when it breaks the most societal taboos.

"2003","Problems with the Attitudinal Endorsement Theory of Joke Appreciation","                           Michael Smith, the Martian of Robert Heinlein's 1961 novel Stranger in a Strange Land is having a lot of difficulty in understanding what makes up that strange creature he has just encountered for the first time, the """"human."""" A trip to the local zoo and a cage of monkeys provides the answer for him. There, a peanut is thrown to a small monkey who takes it eagerly. This monkey is immediately bowled over by a larger monkey, and the peanut is stolen from him. The small monkey runs away howling, until it tracks down an even smaller monkey to beat the daylights out of. The rest of the monkeys choose to ignore the entire incident altogether. At this, Michael begins to laugh uncontrollably, so hard that he is unable to stop for hours. A revelatory moment, at last the Martian has understood (in his idiolect, he has """"grokked"""") that fundamental secret of what it is to be human:                          """"I've found out why people laugh. They laugh because it hurts-because it's the only thing that'll make it stop hurting-of course it wasn't funny; it was tragic. That's why I had to laugh. I looked at a cage full of monkeys and suddenly I saw all the mean and cruel and utterly unexplainable things I've seen and heard and read about - and suddenly it hurt so much I found myself laughing"""" (Heinlein 289).                        Slovoj Zizek's Lacanian psychoanalytic writings are often based around this same fundamental insight into the human condition: that one should remain aware of the utterly strange and paradoxical chasm that lies at the centre of our psychic make-up. Zizek would consider Michael's laughter at the monkeys an example of concealment of primal trauma via the safety gauge of laughter, for this act of jouissance, as Flieger puts is (taking her cue from Freud): """"breaks laws and re-establishes them simultaneously, but avoids tragic conflict by re-routing deadly hostile impulses along a route of substitutive conciliation"""" (Flieger 65). Behind this jouissance lies the Real,which must be understood as that crucial X factor behind existence, that chaotic """"inruption of non-sense"""" (as Eagleton paraphrases) into the carefully-constructed orders of the Symbolic and the Imaginary (42). At this point, then, we might suppose that laughter is a purely beneficial and therapeutic act, halting probable psychosis. This perhaps explains why Zizek is so interested in the cynical strain he has identified as one of modern society's greatest afflictions, which he identifies as a kind of jouissance without the Real.             Cynicism is one of the recurring bugbears of Zizek's recent work,stretching back to his first major work in English, The Sublime Object of Ideology (1989). His theory is grounded in Peter Sloterdijk's Critique of Cynical Reason (first published in 1983), in which cynicism is defined as """"enlightened false consciousness. It is that modernised, unhappy consciousness, on which Enlightenment has laboured-well-off and miserable at the same time"""" (5). Sloterdijk interprets the period of the Enlightenment as the formative period for the development of our modern subjectivity, and Zizek adds (following Lacan) that this is because this period saw the birth of the Cartesian """"subject"""". The performative act of becoming a subject, Zizek indicates, is another way of evading the Real: """"subjectivization is a way to elude the void which """"is"""" the subject, it is ultimately a defense mechanism against the subject"""" (Enjoy 186). The historicity of this cynical attitude is a point that Zizek continually reiterates-the """"false consciousness"""" of cynicism developed because """"the Enlightenment project has gone wrong"""" (136). Such a historicist view points to the finitude of the cynical split. The optimistic obverse of this focus on the past is that one day there may be the possibility for suture. But as for contemporary society, Zizek negates the paranoiac Adornian conclusion that our modern age is a post-ideological one. Instead, he asserts that we are in fact so entrenched in ideology that it is difficult to even distinguish its parameters. There is a breakdown in the relationship between the 'knowledge' and the 'act': """"the cynical subject is quite aware of the distance between the ideological mask and the social reality, but he nonetheless still insists upon the mask"""" (Subject 29). A problem is still raised, for while emphasising that cynicism is a much more insidious kind of masked ideology, he also emphasises the absolute necessity of every ideological foundation. The danger lies because the """"true"""" face is kept hidden from view:                          """"the illusion is not on the side of knowledge, it is already on the side of reality itself, of what the people are doing. What they do not know is that their social reality itself, their activity, is guided by an illusion, by a fetishistic inversion. What they [i.e. cynical people] overlook, what they misrecognise, is not the reality but the illusion which is structuring their reality, their real social activity"""" (Subject 32)                        One of the strategies of cynical consciousness is the """"kynical"""", the attitude to constantly critique society, coined by Sloterdijk) (Subject 29). In recent comedy, one of the chief examplars of """"kynical"""", understated, humour would have to be Jerry Seinfeld's observational style of standup comedy that become so popular during the nineties (i.e. """"what's the deal with-airports/queues/etc.""""). Seinfeld avoids the overtly political in his comedy, but his usual focus on the banalities of the quotidian (as he calls it, the """"minutiae"""") can be interpreted as an attack on aspects of Western consumer culture. The very act of asking the question """"what's the deal?"""" implies a certain dissatisfaction with the status quo of consumer culture, it poses the question """"why is our society so strange?"""" In response to such a question, the audience laughs because it recognises the particular aspect of society that Seinfeld aims to deconstruct. At the same time, an economy of desire is constructed around the act of the laughter itself.             For Zizek, cynicism is a self-gratifying gesture that follows the fetishistic logic of """"I know very well the truth of this statement, but in the meantime."""" There is jouissance in the act of recognition (or false consciousness), which of course deflects the original impulse that we presume to be social critique. This """"kynicism"""" performs the opposite effect of Victor Shklovsky's concept of ostraneniye, the method of """"making strange"""" the symbolic language, which Zizek would interpret as the """"philosophical experience of 'wondering'"""" Enjoy 53). Seinfeld's comedy skips over that moment of comprehension, that breakdown to the shock of the Real. In other words, Seinfeld's cynicism yada yada yadas over the point de capiton. Therefore, cynicism is another attempt to reposition the symbolic as the primary level of experience, to usurp the Real with """"reality.""""However, in the turbulent days that followed September 11, we find a counter at least to this """"kynical"""" style of humour (the kind of comedy exemplified in Australia by such TV shows as The Glass House and the now-defunct Good News Week). The satirical show Politically Incorrect was pulled from the air on the American ABC network, after its host, Bill Maher, disputed President Bush's statement that the World Trade Centre terrorists were """"cowardly."""" On the show airing on the seventeenth of September, Maher made the following statement: """"we have been the cowards lobbing cruise missiles from two thousand miles away. That's cowardly-staying in the airplane when it hits the building, say what you want about it, it's not cowardly. """"             Au contraire to the show's title, this was perhaps one of the most politically correct statements ever made on American television, and it cost Maher his television show. Politically Incorrect was immediately pulled from the air in many American states (including Washington DC), and the show, crippled by public criticism and the loss of advertising money, was axed soon after. Maher normally utilised a """"kynical"""" standpoint to throw stones at the big Other (i.e. the US political system), and as we have already seen with the example of Seinfeld, the jolting """"Real"""" moment of the humour never seems to happen. Was Maher's September 11 comment one of the sublime instances of the letter """"reaching its destination"""" to the American public? The jolting ostraneniye of this comedy is precisely that here there is no joke, no consoling sedative of jouissance, and the shock that followed in this humour deficit was one of denial and anger. One may argue that this instance provided a more """"Real"""" moment for the American public than the media spectacle surrounding September 11 itself. Zizek writes in """"Welcome to the Desert of the Real"""" (posted on the internet on the same day as that episode of Politically Incorrect), that Americans have libidinally invested in images of catastrophe for years. Catastrophe is one of the healthiest signs of the persistence of the symbolic order. By saying """"we are the cowards!"""", Maher was essentially telling his public """"we are the enemy!"""" or """"we are the Symbolic!"""", and for a short time he dissolved the force of the non-existent Big Other. It is no wonder that he was ejected from this symbolic order at lightning speed. Here, I can't help being reminded of Guy Debord's axiom in The Society of the Spectacle, that """"in a world which really is topsy-turvy, the true is a moment of the false"""". In Zizek's cynical society, it seems to be strange but true that when the joke isn't funny anymore is really when it breaks the most societal taboos.

Everyday life is a key area of cultural study today and this argument presented here, developed through a reading of several texts of Derrida, Heidegger and other thinkers, attempts to go beyond naive, unphilosophical claims about the everyday as an object of inquiry - often based on a naive narturalistic notion of the everyday. In doing so it shows how a detailed engagement with deconstruction might lead to a productive rethinking of what is taken for granted about the supposed immediacy of experience.","",""

"2005","Eye of the Beholden","&#x0D;         &#x0D; &#x0D;  There is a scene near the beginning of the Mel Brooks movie The History of the World, Part I, in which the ‘first artist’ makes his appearance, completing a cave painting of a hunting scene or some such. Immediately following this, a bearskin-clad man steps forward and urinates on the wall. This individual, we are told (by the disembodied voice of Orson Welles, no less), is the ‘first critic’. &#x0D; &#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  Fair or unfair, this is, in many cases, the popular image of the reviewer. Fans of The Simpsons will doubtless remember ‘Guess Who’s Coming to Criticize Dinner?’ a 1999 episode in which Homer Simpson becomes a restaurant critic. At first, he loves everything and can’t believe his good fortune in getting so much free food. Gradually, however, peer pressure from other critics forces him to become increasingly negative, until he finally alienates family and friends and winds up unable to enjoy even the most elaborate meals. The episode ends with him escaping from enraged restaurant owners.&#x0D; &#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  Controversy and negative criticism are, as many reviewers will attest, the keys to getting work read and discussed. The desire of reviewers to push the bounds of propriety as far as possible is frequently in evidence. The most-read ‘events’ article on the partner site to this journal, M/C Reviews is entitled, somewhat provocatively, ‘Cunt Get Enough of The Vagina Monologues’. This is, in every way, a fine review which examines the material well and provides a balanced view of the production, but one cannot help wondering how much of the popularity of this particular piece – the site statistics give 11724 readers as of 4 August, 2005 – depends on the title, the first point of contact for the reader.&#x0D; &#x0D;  Critics themselves are motivated by various factors, not all of which are generally explicitly stated to the reader. Aside from the desire to be read, they may have a vested interest in an event, or in being allowed to continue to attend events, for example, and one is often forced to wonder whether or not a critic might have been harsher should they not care about getting future tickets. There is an illuminating article by Quentin Letts from the New Statesman in which he describes the negative reaction of fellow critics to his actually paying for a ticket, attending and reviewing a play before the ‘official’ review night. They were more concerned with his having upset precedent and the free ticket tradition than with his actual review, and he quotes the Daily Telegraph’s Charles Spencer as stating that he was """"wrecking a perfectly good system"""". &#x0D; &#x0D;  That being said, who are reviewers? For whom do they write and why is their opinion more important than that of the general public? A ‘professional’ reviewer may not necessarily get paid, or may only be paid in event tickets, but their work goes through some sort of formal review process of its own and is subsequently published, generally in a journal, magazine, newspaper or website. Anyone can write a review, but getting it published is harder, and the more respected the publication, the more difficult it is to get into print. &#x0D; &#x0D;  This does not mean that all reviewers are experts on the topic that they discuss, although the admission of this is generally left up to the discretion of the individual writer. Given the diversity of critical opinions, perhaps the only general characteristic that the majority of professional reviewers could be said to share is an ability to express their thoughts clearly and in a readable manner. Reviewers are sometimes highly qualified, but not always, and the opinions of a few can create a sort of cultural oligarchy, which might be considered far from ideal. Should reviews be ingenuous or informed? This very issue is addressed in ironic terms in the 1981 painting The Innocent Eye Test by the American artist Mark Tansey. &#x0D; &#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  Here, we have a cow, the ‘innocent eye’ of the title, examining a painting of cows. Does the cow have a special perspective? Is it an objective audience? Does it recognise the images on the canvas as such at all? The answer to these questions would appear to be awaited with eager anticipation by the gathered watchers, although the futility of their efforts is immediately obvious to the observer of the painting. The chain of perception does not stop here, however. It is merely part of a post-structural signifier play. Consider, for example, the following photograph, which features an observer commenting on his perception of the painting to a group of what one might term ‘secondary’ observers, in turn seen through the lens of the present discussion and further transformed by the experience and reaction of you, the reader (and so on, ad infinitum):&#x0D; &#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  If reviews are themselves reviewed before publication, the reader is the (momentary) endpoint in the aforementioned complex chain of perception. These issues have been discussed recently by Jordan et. al. in a recent issue of Communication Studies in which they argue persuasively that the ideas of the reviewers of reviews impart a type of imprint on what is being written as criticism. The present article has, itself, been through a ‘peer-review’ process and was revised as a result – some new content was added, some taken away, all according to ideas which are not necessarily those of the original author.&#x0D; &#x0D;  Different publications usually offer a different style of review depending on their demographic. Generally speaking, the more specialised the publication, the more specialised the review. Academic journals cater to an informed, highly educated audience who expect a degree of precision, referencing and analysis, which might be lacking in more general newspaper reviews. The latter tend to be short and give a brief overview and opinion, reflecting the essentially ephemeral nature of a daily paper. Magazine reviews are often more substantial in both length and depth of discussion, but are, again, usually aimed at a non-specialist audience, although this can depend on the primary focus of the magazine itself. Professional website reviews tend not to suffer from space constraints, but are limited more by the desire of the reviewer to keep their observations digestible to whoever their ‘ideal reader’ might be. All such media, however, rely on the views of a select (and selected) few.&#x0D; &#x0D;  There are a number of websites that cater for those members of the public who seek a more democratic model. In the case of cinema, the Internet Movie Database allows registered users to rate and review movies. The resulting ratings are averaged to give an overall idea of the popular reaction to the movie, and those who wish to explore further can read the numerous ‘user comments’, or mini-reviews on the site. A similar phenomenon is featured at the online store Amazon, where customers can rate a book, CD or movie and write their own summary. Several other sites offer an averaging of published reviews in major papers, journals, magazines and websites. Rotten Tomatoes offers a statistical summary of the positive or negative opinions cited in such reviews in the form of the ‘tomatometer’, which gives a percentage rating to a given movie. Yahoo! Movies goes one step further and allows users to submit their own reviews, which are then averaged and can be compared to the aggregate media rating. Generally, these are close, although it is interesting to note that a brief scan suggests that Yahoo! users generally rate movies lower than the professional critics.  &#x0D; &#x0D;  Does this mean, therefore, that the role of the professional reviewer is becoming less relevant in these days of digital egalitarianism? Certainly, opinions can be disseminated worldwide with greater ease than ever before, but the problem with this is one of quality control. When reading an online review, one often has no way of knowing the motives or, indeed, veracity of the author. On IMDB, for example, users often complain that other reviewers have not even seen the movie in question, which is a criticism that arises only very rarely in the world of professional criticism. It is likely that the division between the professional and the general public will become even more sharply defined with the rise of the internet medium, and that both will have their own audiences. It is significant that none of the aforementioned sites make any attempt to merge the ‘professional’ and ‘open’ content, but keep the boundary between the two clearly defined.&#x0D; &#x0D;  It is probable that critical theorists and reviewers themselves will continue to review the culture of reviewing. As R.P. Hart noted in 1976 (70), “the refusal by any field of inquiry to launch periodic, self-reflective examinations is surely a very special kind of arrogance”. Naturally, the desire to discuss one’s profession and, thus, give it the additional lustre of being considered an academic pursuit is also a motivation. That said, such probing is unlikely to change review culture itself. Harry Haskell’s overview of musical criticism, The Attentive Listener, contains sufficient examples to show that the same primary elements that exist in contemporary arts reviews have been in frequent use since at least the beginning of the eighteenth century, for example. We cannot quantify intent meaningfully, and can only discuss the ramifications of individual reviews in the broadest possible terms – perhaps critics are much less significant individually than they would like to believe, especially in a culture of increasingly globalised information exchange. Poor old jesting Pilate – when he asked (rhetorically) “what is truth?”, what would he have thought to be told that it was, arguably, merely a sociological statistical aggregate?&#x0D; &#x0D;   References&#x0D; &#x0D;   Hart, R.

"2005","The Getaway","&#x0D;         &#x0D; &#x0D;  From an interview with “Mr A”, executive producer and co-creator of the Getaway in Stockholm (GiS) films:&#x0D; &#x0D;    Mr A: Yeah, when I tell my girlfriend, ‘You should watch this, it’s good, it’s a classic, it’s an old movie’ and she thinks it’s, like, the worst. And when I actually look at it and it is the worst, it is just a car chase … [Laughs] But you have to look a lot harder, to how it is filmed, you have to learn … Because, you can’t watch car racing for instance, because they are lousy at filming; you get no sensation of speed. If you watch the World Rally Championship it looks like they go two miles an hour. The hardest thing [of the whole thing] is capturing the speed … &#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  I want to engage with the notion of “speed” in terms of the necessary affects of automobility, but first I will give some brief background information on the Getaway in Stockholm series of films. Most of the information on the films is derived from the interview with Mr A carried out over dinner in Stockholm, October 2004. Contact was made via e-mail and I organised with the editors of Autosalon Magazine for an edited transcription to be published as an incentive to participate in the interview.&#x0D; &#x0D;  Mr A’s “Tarantino-style” name is necessary because the films he makes with Mr X (co-creator) and a small unnamed group of others involve filming highly illegal acts: one or two cars racing through the streets of Stockholm evading police at sustained speeds well over 200 km/h. Due to a quirk in Swedish traffic law, unless they are caught within a certain time frame of committing driving offences or they actually admit to the driving offences, then they cannot be charged. The Swedish police are so keen to capture these renegade film makers that when they appeared on Efterlyst (pron: ef-de-list; the equivalent of “Sweden’s Most Wanted”) instead of the normal toll-free 1-800 number that viewers could phone to give tips, the number on the screen was the direct line to the chief of Stockholm’s traffic unit. &#x0D; &#x0D;  The original GiS film (2000) was made as a dare. Mr A and some friends had just watched Claude Lelouch’s 1976 film C’était un Rendez-vous. Rumour has it that Lelouch had a ten-minute film cartridge and had seen how a gyro stabilised camera worked on a recent film. He decided to make use of it with his Ferrari. He mounted the camera to the bonnet and raced through the streets of Paris. In typical Parisian style at the end of the short nine minute film the driver parks and jumps from the Ferrari to embrace a waiting woman for their “rendezvous”. Shortly after watching the film someone said to Mr A, “you don’t do that sort of thing in Stockholm”. Mr A and Mr X set out to prove him wrong. Nearly all the equipment used in the filming of the first GiS film was either borrowed or stolen. The Porsche used in the film (like all the cars in the films) was lent to them. The film equipment consisted of, in Mr A’s words, a “big ass” television broadcast camera and a smaller “lipstick” camera stolen from the set of the world’s first “interactive” reality TV show called The Bar. (The Bar followed a group of people who all lived together in an apartment and also worked together in a bar. The bar was a “real” bar and served actual customers.)&#x0D; &#x0D;  The first film was made for fun, but after Mr A and his associates received several requests for copies they decided to ramp up production to commercial levels. Mr A has a “real job” working in advertising; making the GiS films once a year is his main job with his advertising job being on a self-employed, casual basis. As a production team it is a good example of amateurs becoming semi-professionals within the culture industries. The GiS production team distributes one film per year under the guise of being a “documentary” which allows them to escape the wrath of Swedish authorities due to further legal quirks. Although they still sell DVDs from their Website, the main source of income comes from the sale of the worldwide distribution rights to British “powersports” specialist media company Duke Video. Duke also sells a digitally remastered DVD version of Rendezvous on their Website. As well as these legitimate distribution methods, copies of all six GiS films and Rendezvous are available on the internet through various peer-to-peer file-sharing networks. Mr A says there isn’t much he can do about online file sharing besides asking people to support the franchise if they like the films by buying the DVDs. &#x0D; &#x0D;  There are a number of groups making films for car enthusiast using similar guerilla film production methods. However, most of the films are one-offs or do not involve cars driven at such radical speeds. An exception was another Swedish film maker who called himself “Ghostrider” and who produced similar films using a motorbike. Police apprehended a man who they alleged is “Ghostrider” in mid-2004 within the requisite timeframe of an offence that had been allegedly committed. The GiS films alongside these others exist within the automotive cultural industry. The automotive cultural industry is a term I am using to describe the overlap between the automotive industry and the cultural industries of popular culture. The films tap in to a niche market of car enthusiasts. There are many different types of car enthusiasts, everything from petite-bourgeois vintage-car restorers to moral panic-inducing street racers. &#x0D; &#x0D;  Obviously the GiS films are targeted more towards the street racing end of the spectrum, which is not surprising because Sweden has a very developed underground street racing scene. A good example is the Stockholm-based “Birka Cup”: a quasi-professional multi-round underground street-racing tournament with 60,000 SEK (approx. AUD$11,000) prize money. The rules and rankings for the tournament are found on the tournament Website. To give some indication of what goes on at these events a short teaser video clip for the 2003 Birka Cup DVD is also available for download from the Website. &#x0D; &#x0D;  The GiS films have an element of the exotic European-Other about them, not only because of the street-racing pedigree exemplified by the Birka Cup and similar underground social institutions (such as another event for “import” street racers called the “Stockholm Open”), but because they capture an excess within European car culture normally associated with exotic supercars or the extravagant speeds of cars driven on German autobahns or Italian autostradas. For example, the phrase “European Styling” is often used in Australia to sell European designed “inner-city” cars, such as the GM Holden Barina, a.k.a. the Vauxhall Corsa or the Opel Corsa. Cars from other regional manufacturing zones often do not receive such a specific regional identification; for example, cars built in Asian countries are described as “fully imported” rather than “Asian styling”. Tom O’Dell has noted that dominant conception of automobility in Sweden is different to that of the US. That is, “automobility” needs to be qualified with a national or local context and I assume that other national contexts in Europe would equally be just as different. However, in non-European, mainly post-colonial contexts, such as Australia, the term “European” is an affectation signaling something special. &#x0D; &#x0D;  On a different axis, “excess” is directly expressed in the way the police are “captured” in the GiS films. Throughout the GiS series there is a strongly antagonist relation to the police. The initial pre-commercial version of the first GiS film had NWA’s “Fuck the Police” playing over the opening credits. Subsequent commercially-released versions of the film had to change the opening title music due to copyright infringement issues. The “bonus footage” material of subsequent DVDs in the series represents the police as impotent and foolish. Mr A describes it as a kind of “prank” played on police. His rationale is that they live out the fantasy that “everyone” wishes they could do to the police when they are pulled over for speeding and the like; as he puts it, “flipping the bird and driving off”. The police are rendered foolish and captured on film, which is an inversion of the normative traffic-cop-versus-traffic-infringer power relation. Mr A specifies the excess of European modernity to something specific to automobility, which is the near-universal condition of urbanity in most developed nations. &#x0D; &#x0D;  The antagonism between the GiS drivers and the police is figured as a duel. The speed of the car(s) obviously exceeds what is socially and legally acceptable and therefore places the drivers in direct conflict with police. The speed captured on film is in part a product of this tension and gives speed a qualitative cultural dimension beyond a simple notion from rectilinear physics of speed as a rate of motion. The qualitative dimension of speed as been noted by Peter Wollen:&#x0D; &#x0D;    Speed is not simply thrilling in itself, once sufficiently accelerated, but also enables us to enter exposed and unfamiliar situations, far removed from the zones of safety and normality – to travel into space, for instance, beyond the frontiers of the known. (106)&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  Knowledge is subsumed by the dialect of road safety: “safety” versus “speed”. Knowledge takes on many forms and it is here that speed gains its complexity. In the high-school physics of rectilinear motion speed refers to a rate. Mr A discusses speed as a sensation (“thrill” in the language of Wollen) in the quote at the beginning of the essay. If the body develops sensations from affects and percepts (Deleuze and Guattari 179-83), then what are the affects and percepts that are developed by the body into the sensation of speed? &#x0D; &#x0D;  The catchphrase for the GiS films is “Reality Beats Fiction By Far!” The “reality” at stake here is not only the actuality of cars traveling at high speeds within urban spaces, which in the vernacular of automotive popular culture is more “real” than Hollywood representations, but the “reality” of automobilised bodies engaging with and “getting away” from the police. Important here is that the police serve as the symbolic representatives of the governmental institutions and authorities that regulate and discipline populations to be automobilised road users. The police are principally symbolic because one’s road-user body is policed, to a large degree, by one’s self; that is, by the perceptual apparatus that enables us to judge traffic’s rates of movement and gestures of negotiation that are indoctrinated into habit. We do this unthinkingly as part of everyday life. What I want to suggest is that the GiS films tap into the part of our respective bodily perceptual and affective configurations that allow us to exist as road users. To explain this I need to go on a brief detour through “traffic” and its relation to “speed”.&#x0D; &#x0D;  Speed serves a functional role within automobilised societies. Contrary to the dominant line from the road safety industry, the “speed limit” we encounter everyday on the road is not so much a limit, but a guide for the self-organisation of traffic. To think the “speed limit” as a limit allows authorities to imagine a particular movement-based threshold of perception and action that bestows upon drivers the ability to negotiate the various everyday hazard-events that constitute the road environment. This is a negative way to look at traffic and is typical of the (post)modernist preoccupation with incorporating contingency (“the accident”) into behavioural protocol and technical design (Lyotard 65-8). It is not surprising that the road safety industry is an exemplary institution of what Gilles Deleuze called the “control society”. The business of the road safety industry is the perpetual modulation of road user populations in a paradoxical attempt to both capture (forecast and study) the social mechanics of the accident-event while postponing its actualisation.&#x0D; &#x0D;  Another way to look at traffic is to understand it as a self-organising system. Ilya Prigogine and Robert Herman modeled vehicle traffic as two flows – collective and individual – as a function of the concentration and speed of vehicles. At a certain tipping point the concentration of traffic is such that individual mobility is subsumed by the collective. Speed plays an important role both in the abstract sense of a legislated “speed limit” and as the emergent consistency of mobile road users distributed in traffic. That is, automotive traffic does not move at a constant speed, but nominally moves at a consistent speed. &#x0D; &#x0D;  The rate and rhythms of traffic have a consistency that we all must become familiar with to successfully negotiate the everyday system of automobility. For example, someone simply walking becomes a “pedestrian” in the duration of automobilised time-space. Pedestrians must embody a similar sense of the rate of traffic as that perceived by drivers in the cars that constitute traffic. The pedestrian uses this sense of speed when negotiating traffic so as to cross the road, while the driver uses it to maintain a safe distance from the car in front and so on. The shared sense of speed demands an affective complicity of road-user bodies to allow them to seamlessly incorporate themselves into the larger body of traffic on a number of different registers. When road users do not comply with this shared sense of speed that underpins traffic they are met with horn blasts, rude figure gestures, abuse, violence and so on. The affects of traffic are accelerated in the body and developed by the body into the sensations and emotions of “road rage”. Road users must performatively incorporate the necessary dispositions for participating with other road users in traffic otherwise they disrupt the affective script (“habits”) for the production of traffic.&#x0D; &#x0D;  When I screened the first GiS film in a seminar in Sweden the room was filled with the sound of horrified gasps. Afterwards someone suggested to me that they (the Swedes) were more shocked than I (an Australian) about the film. Why? Is it because I am a “hoon”? We had all watched the same images heard the same sounds, yet, the “speeds” were not equal. They had experienced the streets in the film as a part of traffic. Their bodies knew just how slow the car was meant to be going. The film captured and transmitted the affects of a different automobilised body. Audiences follow the driver “getting away” from those universally entrusted (at least on a symbolic level) with the governance of traffic – the police – while, for a short period, becoming a new body that gets away from the “practiced perception” (Massumi 189) of habits that normatively enable the production of traffic. What is captured in the film – the event of the getaway – has the potential to develop in the body of the spectator as the sensation of “speed” and trigger a getaway of the body.&#x0D; &#x0D;  Acknowledgement&#x0D; &#x0D;  I would like to acknowledge the generous funding from the Centre for Cultural Research and the College of Arts, Education and Social Sciences, University of Western Sydney, in awarding me the 2004 CCR CAESS Postgraduate International Scholarship, and the support from my colleagues at the Advanced Cultural Studies Institute of Sweden where I carried out this research as a doctoral exchange student.&#x0D; &#x0D;   References&#x0D; &#x0D;   Deleuze, Gilles. “Postscript on Control Societies”.

"2005","Doubling","&#x0D;         &#x0D; &#x0D;     ‘Artists are replicants who have found the secret of their obsolescence.’ (Brian Massumi)&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  The critical reception to British writer Iain Sinclair’s most recent novel Dining on Stones (or, the Middle Ground) frequently focused on the British writer’s predilection for intertextual quotation and allusion, and more specifically, on his proclivity for integrating material from his own backlist. A survey of Dining on Stones reveals the following textual duplication: an entire short story, “View from My Window”, which was published in 2003; excerpts from a 2002 collection of poetry and prose, White Goods; material from his 1999 collaboration with artist Rachel Lichtenstein, Rodinsky’s Room; a paragraph lifted from Dark Lanthorns: Rodinsky’s A to Z, also from 1999; and scenes from 1971’s The Kodak Mantra Diaries. Moreover, the name of the narrator, Andrew Norton, is copied from an earlier Sinclair work, Slow Chocolate Autopsy. Of the six aforementioned inter-texts, only Rodinsky’s Room has had wide commercial release. The remainder are small press publications, often limited edition, difficult to find and read, which leads to the charge that Sinclair is relying on the inaccessibility of earlier texts to obscure his acts of autoplagiarism in the mass market Dining on Stones. Whatever Sinclair’s motives, his textual methodology locates a point of departure for an interrogation of textual doubling within the context of late era capitalism. &#x0D; &#x0D;  At first approximation, Dining on Stones appears to belong to a postmodern literature which treats a text’s confluence, or dissonance of innumerable signifiers and systems of signification as axiomatic and intra-textually draws attention to this circumstance. Thematically, the heteroglot narrative of Dining on Stones frequently returns to the duplication of textual material. The book’s primary narrator is haunted by doubles, not least because Andrew Norton periodically functions as a textual doppelganger for Sinclair.  Norton’s biography constitutes a cut-up of episodes copied from Sinclair’s personal history and experience as it is presented in his non-fiction and quasi-autobiographical poetry and prose like Lights Out for the Territory and London Orbital. Like his creator, Norton is ontologically troubled by a fetch, or two, who may or may not be the products of his writer’s imagination. He claims that someone is ‘stealing my material. He impersonated me with a flair I couldn’t hope to equal, this thief. Trickster.’ (218) A ‘disturbing’ encounter with ‘Grays’, an uncannily familiar short story by another writer Marina Fountain, reveals a second textual poacher copying Norton’s work. &#x0D; &#x0D;    She hadn’t written it without help, obviously. The tone was masculine, sure of itself, its pretensions; grammatically suspect, lexicologically challenged, topographically slapdash. A slash-and-burn stylist. But haunted: by missing fathers – Bram Stoker, S. Freud and Joseph Conrad. Clunky hints… about writing and stalking, literary bloodsucking, gender, disguise. … But it was the Conrad aspect that pricked me. Fountain had somehow got wind of my researched (incomplete, unpublished) essay on Conrad in Hackney. Her exaggerated prose, its shotgun sarcasm, jump-cuts, psychotic syntax, was an offensive parody of a manner of composition I’d left behind. (167)&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  When ‘Grays’ is later reprinted in full in the novel (141-65), it is a renamed double of a previous Sinclair piece, ‘In Train for the Estuary’ (Sinclair, White Goods, 57-75). This doubling is replicated with another Sinclair story ‘View from My Window’ also being attributed to Fountain (313-341). Neither the style, nor the content of Sinclair’s previous works have been discarded: they have been reproduced and incorporated in Dining on Stones’ retrospective of Sinclair’s earlier work. Thus, Norton’s review of Fountain’s writing as ‘a manner of composition I’d left behind’ doubles as Sinclair’s self-conscious recognition of the text as an artefact produced from diverse inter-texts – including his own. &#x0D; &#x0D;  In contrast to Sinclair’s dialogic doubling, Fountain’s double is of a monologic disposition. It is mechanical ‘echopraxis,’ a neologism coined in Dining on Stones which is defined as the ‘mindless repetition of another person’s moves and gestures.’ (192) Its mercenary dimension, enacted without regard for the integrity of the inter-text, is underscored with the epithet ‘slash-and-burn stylist.’ The monologic double possesses the text, drains it of its vitality. It entails necrosis, mortification. Fountain’s appropriation of Norton’s story is close to Fredric Jameson’s characterisation of pastiche which, he says, shuts down communication between texts (202). For Jameson, pastiche is the exemplary postmodern literary ‘style’. It is inert, static, a textual aporia. Jameson’s verdict is harsh: pastiche is cannibalism, text devouring text with an appetite that corresponds to the cupidity of consumer culture. Textual cannibalism vanquishes dialogism. It is the negation of the textual Other because cannibalism is only possible when the Other no longer exists. &#x0D; &#x0D;  So how does Sinclair distinguish his doubling of his own text from Fountain’s monologic doubling as it is depicted in the novel’s narrative? A clue can be detected in one of the stories stolen by Fountain.  ‘In Train for the Estuary’ is a re-writing of Dracula, and takes its cue from Karl Marx’s famous analogy between capitalism and vampirism: ‘capital is dead labour, which, vampire-like, lives only by sucking living labour, and lives the more, the more labour it sucks.’ (342) Sinclair’s vampire doubles as an academic (or is it the other way round?) who obsessively and compulsively stalks her quarry/object of study, Joseph Conrad. &#x0D; &#x0D;    First, she had learnt Polish. Then she tracked down the letters and initiated the slow, painstaking, much-revised process of translation. She travelled. Validated herself. Being alone in an unknown city, visiting libraries, enduring and enjoying bureaucratic obfuscation, sitting in bars, going to the cinema, allowed her to try on a new identity. She initiated correspondence with people she never met. She lied. She stole from Conrad. (Sinclair, White Goods, 58)&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  The woman’s identity is leeched from the work of Conrad. Sinclair describes unethical activity in appropriating text: lying, stealing, sucking the blood from the corpus of Conrad. A compulsive need to maintain the ‘validation’ of this poached identity emerges, manifesting itself as addiction. The addict is an extreme embodiment of the (ir)rationality of consumption: consumed by the need to consume. The woman’s lust for text is commensurate with the twin desires—blood and real estate—of her precursor, Bram Stoker’s Dracula. Sinclair’s narrative of addiction doubles as a meta-critique on the compulsive desire to reproduce text and image that characterizes postmodern textualities as well as the apparatuses that produce them. &#x0D; &#x0D;  The textual doubling in Dining on Stones, which is published by the multinational Penguin, seems to enact a reterritorialisation of a deterritorialised minor literature. However, Sinclair’s allegorical rewriting of the vampire legend and its subsequent inclusion in the mainstream novel’s narrative, reveal that capitalism’s doubles are simulacra in the Aristotelian sense because they are copies for which there is no original. The ostensible ‘original’ is the product of different material conditions and thus cannot be duplicated by the machinery of capitalism. The capitalist reproduction of text produced within an alternative cultural economy is an uncanny double (with an infinite capacity to be doubled over and over again) whose existence, like that of Sinclair’s academic in White Goods, is parasitical. The capitalist simulacrum necessitates that the original be destroyed, or at the very least, theorised out of existence so that restrictions based on its own premise of individual property rights can be circumvented. &#x0D; &#x0D;  Postmodernism’s attendant theory is an over-determined repetition of poststructuralist tenets such as the instability of texts, the polysemous signifier and the impossibility of self as empirical subject. Images and meaning are no longer anchored, and free to be reproduced. Paradoxically, this proliferation of signification has the effect of constricting the originary text, compressing it under the burden of competing meanings, so that it is almost undetectable. Writes Brian Massumi (doubling Jean Baudrillard), ‘postmodernism stutters. In the absence of any gravitational pull to ground them, images accelerate and tend to run together. They become interchangeable. Any term can be substituted for any other: utter indetermination.’ The postmodern project’s effacement of the centred subject and the self has as its consequence, according to Jameson, a ‘waning of affect’ which is superseded ‘by a peculiar kind of euphoria.’ (200) The euphoria to which Jameson refers is not that of the poststructuralist textasy. Instead, it is postmodernism’s return to the idealism of Hegelian dialects, a euphoria achieved from the fusion of contradictions. Postmodernism’s doubles are a utopian attempt to synthesize antinomy and unity in a simultaneity that assimilates the fragmentation of modernity and the modern subject, with the cohesion of the commodity and its closed system of cultural logic. As such, the postmodern double is a rejection of modernist engagements with technical reproducibility. Modernism’s literary assemblages are, in Victor Shlovsky’s words, the laying bare of the device,  an exposition of the seams through techniques such as collage, bricolage and montage. These linguistic (and at times visual) conjunctures of disparate elements do not attempt to elide material and thematic disjuncture. As Walter Benjamin stresses, this type of textual methodology has the potential, through the disruption of spatial and temporal logic and the creation of anachrony, to rupture the linear representations and formations of order favoured by capitalist political economies (Benjamin, ‘On the concept of history’).&#x0D; &#x0D;  Postmodernism, which doubles (following Jameson’s formulation) as the cultural logic of late capitalism, reiterates that texts can be undone, and then reassembled, rearticulated anew, rendered useful to a commodity culture over and over again. Consequently, postmodernism’s copies are analogous, at the level of cultural production, to capitalism’s ceaseless appropriation of discourse, practice, and production. This is the alchemical project of capitalism. It strives to transform everything that it has doubled into the gold of the commodity. The inherent dangers of unrestrained reproduction are for Jameson exemplified in the treatment of Van Gogh’s Pair of Shoes (1885):&#x0D; &#x0D;    If this copiously reproduced image is not to sink to the level of sheer decoration, it requires us to reconstruct some initial situation out of which the finished work emerges. Unless that situation—which has vanished into the past—is somehow mentally restored, the painting will remain an inert object, a reified end-product, and be unable to be grasped as a symbolic act in its own right, as praxis and as production. (194)&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  Jameson’s reading of Van Gogh’s shoes reminds us of the fate of Alberto Korda’s 1960 photograph of revolutionary Che Guevara. Appropriated by the media, inscribed on T-shirts, mugs, even door mats, Che’s portrait is an emblem of the degradation Jameson describes. Like Van Gogh’s painting, Korda’s photograph was once a ‘symbolic act in its own right, as praxis and as production,’ saturated with the potential and spirit of revolution. Over time, the iconic image has leaked meaning. The signifying chain that anchored it to its original significance is broken each time it is reproduced and decontextualised through the process of commodification, until Che’s image is unrecognisable, a mere ornament. &#x0D; &#x0D;  Refuting Benjamin’s concerns in ‘The Work of Art in its Age of Technical Reproducibility’ postmodern theory argues that technologies enabling reproducibility have led to a democratisation of text and textual production, and by extension, have liberated the multitude from a hierarchy of value that privileges the singular. Mass reproduction and the accompanying pressure for texts to be accessible results in altered attitudes regarding the preservation of intellectual property rights and ‘fair use’. In an economy of signs where use-value has become synonymous with exchange-value, then the text which has no exchange value due to it being ‘freely’ available—‘free’ in its double sense, as something exempt from restriction, or cost—can be copied without economic or ethical restraint, without permission. The quotation marks can be scrapped. According to postmodern logic, the double is a transposition with a legitimacy equalling, even rivalling the original. Clearly, Jameson’s lament that postmodernism represents ‘the end of the distinctive individual brushstroke (as symbolized by the emergent primacy of mechanical reproduction)’ cannot escape an association with elitism because technical reproducibility indubitably enables greater access. However, the utility of technologies of reproduction to the capitalist empire of structures and signs cannot be underestimated.  It enables the ceaseless reproduction of ideologemes inscribed with the logic of capitalism; in other words, it enables capitalism to reproduce itself relentlessly. &#x0D; &#x0D;  Postmodern cultural production is self-aware; it acknowledges its role as commodity and reproduces the ideology of the commodity form in its material form. In this manner, it functions as an ideologeme. Sinclair’s doubles cannot be understood according to the schema of postmodernism because he subverts postmodernism’s political and aesthetic symbiosis with capitalism. Moreover, the double in Sinclair travels beyond rehearsing a self-conscious hyphology (Barthes, 39). He defies postmodernism’s occultation of the author through his reiteration of the author’s authority over their own work. In contrast to the reductive manner postmodern texts duplicate other texts, Sinclair’s texts propose a typology of the double which advocates a dialogic duplication. Sinclair’s doubling refuses postmodernism’s return to the idealism of Hegelian dialects, and its synthesis of contradictions in the service of its unified material and aesthetic program: the commodification of literature. Consequently, Dining on Stones’ textual doubling is a critique of the epistemic shift to the monologic double which Jameson claims typifies a large portion of contemporary textual duplication.&#x0D; &#x0D;   References&#x0D; &#x0D;   Barthes, Roland. “Theory of the Text.” Untying the Text: A Post-Structuralist Reader.

"2005","Reviewing Symbolic Capital","&#x0D;         &#x0D; &#x0D;  Reviews are an integral aspect of creating economic capital through avenues of establishing and increasing the other forms of capital outlined by Pierre Bourdieu across his extensive body of work.  The economic importance of reviews can be identified on the majority of film trailers, posters and DVD covers, where quotations attempt to convince potential audiences of the film’s credentials.  Although economic capital is the obvious aim for both the film publicists and the reviewers, this article outlines the creation of symbolic capital through the assertion of cultural and social capital.  Examples from recent film reviews demonstrate how lexical choices establish educational and linguistic capital, whilst the creation of cultural capital is illustrated in disparaging attitudes towards Titanic (US, 1997, Cameron). The language and treatment of a text combine to produce a hegemonic relationship between reviewer and consumer.&#x0D; &#x0D;  The term ‘reviewer’ is being used here in accordance with the ‘macro-institution’ of film criticism which David Bordwell labels as journalism (19-20).  Although Bordwell categorises the British magazine Sight and Sound into the separate macro-institution of essayist criticism, it is primarily the journalistic reviews that feature towards the rear of the magazine with which this article is concerned. The performance, or demonstration, of linguistic competence might disguise the magazine’s fundamentally journalistic intent. Through the utilisation of a prestigious register, and rhetorical devices, Sight and Sound strives to create symbolic capital in the same way as lower brow publications.  Andrew Caine comments that:&#x0D; &#x0D;    the operation of cultural tastes is inseparable from the material conditions of the critical commentator.  To understand the particular angle adopted by a specific critic, it becomes necessary not only to understand the socio-cultural context in which that reviewer worked, but also this task demands information about the preferences of particular publications and their readership. (Caine 16)&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  Published by the British Film Institute, Sight and Sound is constructed as a highbrow magazine, with connotations of sophistication and, vitally, a greater appreciation for film.  Consuming, or advertising the consumption of the magazine articulates a mastery over film that others supposedly do not possess.  This is a clear manifestation of Bourdieu’s core thesis, which he empirically demonstrates in Distinction. Before discussing Bourdieu’s thesis about the classification of taste in relation to Titanic, the linguistic creation of symbolic capital needs to be addressed.&#x0D; &#x0D;  Another British film magazine, Empire (marketed as the “The UK’s No.1 Movie Magazine”), is aimed at a different audience.  Although the design of Sight and Sound may appear more formal than the glossy, sexualised imagery within Empire, there are many stylistic similarities.  Both publications use French phrases (succès de scandale in S&amp;S, and tête-a-têtes within Empire) within their reviews of The Last Mitterrand (Fr, 2005, R. Guédiguian). (Empire spells ‘Mitterrand’ with one ‘r’ – S&amp;S uses two.)  Both magazines are creating symbolic capital based upon the cultural capital of the phrase, capitalising upon the linguistic and symbolic capital of multilingualism (Talbot et al. 257). In Language and Symbolic Power, Bourdieu explains how linguistic exchanges establish “a particular relation of power between a producer, endowed with a certain linguistic capital, and a consumer (a market), and which is capable of procuring a certain material or symbolic profit” (66).  A symbolic relationship is established between producer and receiver, hegemonic in that the latter is encouraged to remain in this healthy relationship of intellectual superiority through continued purchase or, minimally, consumption of the magazine.&#x0D; &#x0D;  Attitudes towards linguistic competence are closely related to other areas of cultural appropriation and appreciation (67), areas which are more overtly expressed within film reviews. In Distinction, Bourdieu asserts that the “consumption or non-consumption of popular cultural artefacts is a means by which individuals in a society define for themselves and others their social position, their status” (Lubin 7).  This thesis can be applied to our current discussion in numerous capacities.  The film reviewer articulates the status of the consumer: the films chosen for inclusion, the appreciation or denunciation of its aesthetics contribute to the creation of symbolic capital.  The inclusion of a technical register, consisting of expressions such as mise-en-scene and genre, assert distinctions through their connections to educational capital owing to their appearance in media and film studies (primarily sub-undergraduate) syllabuses.  Establishing knowledge as part of the educational system, as Bourdieu explains, legitimises it and greatly increases its symbolic capital. This register expresses cultural capital in price formation in the same way as the earlier example concerning French phrases.  &#x0D; &#x0D;  The symbolic relationship is reinforced through the exhibition of other forms of cultural capital.  Reviewers in the two magazines being discussed here regularly refer back to previous films and directors, demonstrating a proficiency of knowledge of the subject about which they are commenting.  The consumer is subjected to either a subordinate position in which their cultural capital is inferior, or where they are interpolated into the symbolic relationship; a hegemonic relationship in which the process of consuming is gratifying.  In the Sight and Sound review of The Last Mitterrand, mentioned above, Ginette Vincendeau (a Warwick academic) integrates the director and an earlier work into his opening paragraph.  This correlates to Bourdieu’s empirical research in Distinctions, in which he observed that knowledge about film directors is consecrated into legitimate culture (27), and its relation to educational capital.  References to actors are restricted to within parenthesis following the character’s names, reflecting the lower cultural capital of actors. The next section comments upon how the representation of actors in other media has a detrimental effect upon the symbolic capital of the film text, and a positive effect upon the symbolic capital of the reviewer and their publication.&#x0D; &#x0D;  The Sinking of Titanic&#x0D; &#x0D;  A hegemonic relationship through the establishment of symbolic capital within film reviews is not new.  Andrew Caine, whilst discussing the attitudes of critics against the British pop film of the 1950s and 60s, expands upon the core debates expressed within this brief article. Crucially, he remarks that:&#x0D; &#x0D;    Through their writings, film and music critics/journalists not only reflected their own position and status in society, but also the place of their publications within the cultural sphere… [the] writer’s tastes coincided with their reader’s values, or at least had to adapt to achieve some form of mutual co-existence. (Caine 16)&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  This co-existence was demonstrated in the coverage of James Cameron’s Titanic, which began its commercial life packaged as a reverential historical epic: a genre with a respected genesis closely associated with a biblical narrative.  However, the film lost much of this reverence as it became phenomenally popular and its two main stars became associated with teenage magazines and the tabloid press after an emphasis was placed upon the romance plot rather than historical issues.  (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet received saturated, inevitably sexualised, attention in the tabloid media.)&#x0D; &#x0D;  Interestingly, Empire, which classifies film releases using a reductive five-star rating system, reduced Titanic’s rating from the maximum five stars and an enthusiastic review (February 1998, 30) to four stars (November 1998, 132), with a less positive review in the later edition, adjusted to accommodate its readers’ tastes. The first review was written (and, to a large extent, published) before the film and its stars had become indelibly associated with popular culture. The phenomenon of Titanic contributes a useful demonstration of Bourdieu’s theory of distinction and the arbitrariness of cultural values. The cultural capital of the text was appropriated differently in response to the dynamics of its audiences. The reported activities of the film’s fans (such as multiple viewings) is far removed from the symbolic capital of multilingualism and educational capital.&#x0D; &#x0D;  David M. Lubin reports in his BFI monograph about the film that few of the people he knows “had seen it – or at least were willing to admit they had” (1999: 7). Addressing Bourdieu’s theory of distinction, Lubin summarises that “refusing to see Titanic, or, if seeing it, refusing to be taken in by it… became a way of asserting one’s independence from all the journalistic gush” (7-8).  In US reviewer Kenneth Turan’s unforgiving criticisms, Lubin identifies a similar trend concerning forces of material production to what Caine discusses about pop and rock movies.  Where attitudes against the pop film are a partial reaction to “juvenile delinquency, the Teddy Boys and perceived immorality” (43), Lubin identifies that “the enemy here [concerning the onslaught against Titanic] appears to be contemporary popular taste, mass culture, the McDonaldization of sensibility… [and] market-driven film making” (9).  All items on that list have elitist oppositions, which the reviewer is constructing for the consumer. &#x0D; &#x0D;  Reviewers and magazines operate within the same forces of material production as the mass culture products being ostracised.  Ironically, dismissing Titanic’s screenplay as clichéd has become a cliché.  Criticisms of anachronisms and other factual inaccuracies (such as Murdoch’s suicide) have become as repetitive and obvious as the tabloid coverage about its two main stars. They do, however, have the symbolic capital, the gratification, of being able to correct an Oscar-winning Hollywood director, in the same way that a horror audience assumes superiority through guessing when a ‘jump moment‘ will occur.  This provides film fans (or students) with the sense that they have equal or superior competence in the field to a professional director.&#x0D; &#x0D;  Conclusion&#x0D; &#x0D;  This article provides an overview of how the construction of symbolic capital establishes and condones the hegemonic relationship between reviewer and consumer.  Crucially, the consumer experiences substantial gratification when awarded the symbolic capital by the reviewer.  Symbolic capital is created and retained by the reviewer, who awards consumers with superiority over other consumers of the form – and, vitally, over non-consumers of that magazine.  The article is not suggesting that these reductive binary oppositions manifest themselves in society: rather, the institutional conditions of publications mean that symbolic violence is exercised to generate economic capital.  Lexical choices (mise-en-scene, etc.) establish group membership, sociability and a sense of prestige.  Legitimate culture is constructed through the connections of discourse to educational capital. This status is further supported by other areas of high linguistic capital, such as multi-syllabic words, and phrases in foreign languages.&#x0D; &#x0D;  In order to retain the symbolic capital upon which the products (magazines and the consumer’s face) rely, it is essential to attack the symbolic capital of others. This explains the phenomenon against Titanic, and, previously, against the body of work Caine discusses.  Such criticism perpetuates the distinctions between high and low culture, and, thus, relevant positions and status in society.  Ironically, although highbrow criticisms against mass culture are concerned with commercialism, it is the “material conditions of the critical commentator” (Caine 16) that proliferate such criticisms.&#x0D; &#x0D;   References&#x0D; &#x0D;   Bordwell, D.

"2005","Schools of Thought","&#x0D;         &#x0D; &#x0D;  The epigraph to the call for papers for this issue of M/C Journal is taken from Act 2 Scene II of William Shakespeare’s Hamlet Prince of Denmark. As it appears in the call for papers, the referenced fragment of Hamlet’s speech, ‘for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so’ (Shakespeare 75), could lead a reader to suspect that morality derives from reasoned thought in the play and that, according to the speaker, the object of moral judgment is neither good nor bad prior to such thought. Spoken in the context of a disagreement between Hamlet and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern about whether Denmark is a prison, the epigraph supports this reading; Hamlet believes that Denmark is a prison, and the two courtiers do not. However, consideration of the entire passage from which the epigraph is taken suggests a subtlely different interpretation. In response to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern’s assertion that Denmark is not a prison, Hamlet remarks:&#x0D; &#x0D;    Why, then ‘tis none to you, for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison. (Shakespeare 75)&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  Rather than prompting the previous interpretation, a reading of the entire passage reveals Hamlet describing a sort of relativism. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern have their point of view, and Hamlet has his. Hamlet labels neither point of view good or bad here. So why does he introduce the language of morality at all? Why doesn’t he say, ‘Why, then, ‘tis none to you: to me it is a prison,’ instead, omitting the fragment that comprises the epigraph entirely? What function does the epigraphic fragment perform? Addressing these questions in the context of the discussion occurring in Hamlet can provide insight into the contemporary intellectual concerns posed by this call for papers, in particular, the cultural cost of employing a hierarchical or bureaucratic morality to guide determinations, especially consensual ones, about pursuing or discarding specific lines of inquiry. &#x0D; &#x0D;  Scene II follows Hamlet’s encounter with his father’s ghost, an event that coincides with the onset of the Prince’s perceived madness. Unsure of its true cause, the King and Queen enlist Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to visit Hamlet and to discover the reason for his recent, strange behavior. The King and Queen promise the two friends money, social recognition, and public appreciation in exchange for their detective work. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern agree to this plan; in fact, once they contract with the crown, they are obligated to carry it out. Their conversation with Hamlet not only fails to produce the desired result but also makes some turns that actually undermine the King and Queen’s purpose. Not only does Hamlet appear more rational than the King and Queen suspect but he also seems quite willing to perform madness, thus meeting the expectations of his audience, in order to speak in an uncensored and unmannerly fashion. In addition, Hamlet only mentions ‘bad’ once, following the passage cited above, in reference to his recent dreams, which Guildenstern notes, whether good or bad, ‘indeed are ambition’ (Shakespeare 75). Their conversation with Hamlet produces other associations, however, between moral judgment and ambition, ambition and dreams, dreams and shadows, and shadows and social relations. This chain of associations builds connection between the worth, and rightness, of any given judgment and the social role of the judging individual.&#x0D; &#x0D;  The passage cited above, which embeds the epigraph to this call for papers, is constructed in such a way that it is unclear whether significance attaches to the moral conclusion resulting from thought or the process of thinking itself, which ends up supplanting a thing’s neutral, objective existence with a subjectively-derived judgment of a thing’s worth. In either case, who thinks matters. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are not authoritative; Hamlet, although considered mad, is. When he closes the passage under consideration with ‘to me it is a prison’ (Shakespeare 75), he makes this assertion confident that what Denmark is to him carries more weight than what Rosencrantz and Guildenstern deem it. In part, his confidence derives from knowing that, as outsiders and employees of the crown, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are not in the position to make a public statement of this sort. Additionally, Hamlet’s words are empowered, worthy as words to hear and to heed, even if mad, worthy because he speaks them, and worthy for the moral judgments they convey.&#x0D; &#x0D;  As set up in Act 2 Scene II of the play, the rhetorical situation presents a dialectical communication act that exposes the tension between Rosencrantz and Guildenstern’s dialogue, which conforms to the constraints of unauthoritative, but purchased, speech, and Hamlet’s, which represents the allowable excesses of authoritative, though suspiciously irrational, speech. The former must presume the literalness of language; for instance, Denmark is not a prison, if prison refers to the physical space of incarceration. The latter, unbound to the literalness of language, can use language figuratively. Denmark is a prison to Hamlet, not in the restrictive sense to which Rosencrantz and Guildenstern refer, but metaphorically. Hamlet’s figurative play, connected to his authoritative role and to the permission his role affords him to go crazy without threat of ending up in prison, leads to an interpretive moment, which would have undone the conventions of this rhetorical situation had Hamlet not cut it short. If he had conceded that beggars comprise the social body, and therefore speak with authority, and that monarchs exist in their shadow, guided by the linguistic precedents beggars either perform or circulate, rather than insisting that such an idea exemplifies his inability to reason, Hamlet would have not only justified his own deauthorization but also given up his rights both to perform madness and to use language metaphorically. In other words, if Hamlet had permitted himself to push his own interpretation a bit farther, he would have disclosed the artificiality of the socio-rhetorical conventions that guarantee his words an audience, a disclosure he absolutely refuses to put into words – that is, literally.&#x0D; &#x0D;  To use metaphorical language, then, although a privilege that follows from social status and the authority that status affords, permits the speaker to avoid accountability of the sort that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern must demonstrate, specifically, to the King and the Queen. Hamlet, for instance, does not have to admit that his authority is an accident of birth; however, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern and the audience for the play know that it is his inheritance. Hamlet does not have to say to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern that he is a thinker, and they are not; although he does, in effect, when he utters the fragment that is the epigraph to this call for papers. Subordinated to the phrase that begins with ‘Why, then ’tis none to you,’ the epigraph might be rewritten as: ‘when you think, you think badly and come to the wrong conclusions.’ In other words, Hamlet does not trust Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to say anything other than what they are literally expected to say, what is conventional for them to say, and what they are paid by the King and Queen to say. Hamlet’s thinking, while apparently mad, still functions, authoritatively, yet there is no evidence provided in the play for the audience to know, without a doubt, that Denmark is or is not a prison. The truth, which must be interpreted, and therefore becomes a product of thinking, strictly follows from the rank of the speaker. The truth of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern’s speech derives from the extent to which it suits their station and their role and from the extent to which is satisfies the contractual situation compelling it; the truth does not follow from the content of their words. Rather, since they are paid to discover the source of Hamlet’s madness, their words must serve this economic purpose. The truth of Hamlet’s speech is also measured by its fit to his role. However, his role insures that an audience will attend to and interpret the meaning of the words he speaks. The truth of the rhetorical situation represented in Act 2 Scene II, then, is that the speech following from Hamlet’s position matters more than that uttered by paid courtiers; in fact, his is the only speech that means anything at all beyond simply marking social location or fulfilling an economic transaction.&#x0D; &#x0D;  The epigraph suggests, then, not that there is a method for discriminating between good and bad ideas as such, but that an audience receives all ideas relative to the social role of the speaker. Those spoken by actors who use language in ways unfitting their social roles are unimaginable in Hamlet, unless, of course, they have inherited authority, as Hamlet has, and are thought mad. Consequently, speakers act responsibly toward their audiences, playing their parts, speaking their scripted lines. Clearly, Act 2 Scene II teaches readers that the objective or moral quality of any particular idea has less significance than does the recognised authority of the speaker and his or her adherence to socio-rhetorical conventions delimiting language exchange in particular contexts.&#x0D; &#x0D;  The world in 2005 bears little or no resemblance to the world that Shakespeare inhabited; however, this lesson still holds true. Today, the free exchange of intellectual ideas—thought to be the primary activity, for instance, of professors and students on college and university campuses—is constrained in ways similar to those on display in Act 2 Scene II. Those who have less authority might pursue lines of inquiry, both in classrooms and in scholarship, that follow up on, apply, or restate authoritative positions. They are at less risk for receiving a low grade, for being rejected or criticised by their colleagues, and for losing their jobs if they do so. This type of teaching and learning, writing and research creates a sort of consensus, sometimes referred to as schools of thought, that at their best challenge and at their worst prohibit imagination. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern could not imagine uttering the words, ‘Denmark is a prison.’ Their language and their structures of imagination are restricted by their economic and their social roles and, because of both, the expectations of their audience. In 2005, those in all social positions can imagine speaking such a critique; however, some might elect not to, self-censoring solely for the purpose of achieving one personal goal or another—a grade, professional recognition, or promotion. Hamlet, unable to imagine Denmark as anything but a prison, takes on an historical burden, transferred to him by his father’s ghost, that requires a break with convention, and with the rhetorical expectations of someone occupying his role, hence his presumed madness. While to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, economic survival requires preserving consensual thinking; according to Hamlet, it will lead to the end of his life, to the demise of Denmark, to the conclusion of Danish history. It is Hamlet’s duty, then, and that of all contemporary intellectuals, to think therefore to imagine, at risk of being thought mad, beyond consensus to sustain the production of ideas and history, the moral ingredient of thoughtful exchange, and to prevent the alternative, that is, the fate of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. The interjection that is the epigraph to this call for papers conveys as much to a postmodern, intellectual audience. Ideas have power in Hamlet’s world, no less chaotic, violent, and presumptively immoral than the world in 2005. It is a bad idea, a sort of madness actually, to act, then as now, as if language primarily functions bureaucratically, for the connected purposes of enforcing consensus, or canonicity, as a morally good idea, and of consolidating personal gain, as the sole measure of ethical conduct.&#x0D; &#x0D;  Note&#x0D; &#x0D;  All quotations appearing in this essay have been taken from Act 2 Scene II of William Shakespeare’s Hamlet Prince of Denmark.

"2005","Iain Sinclair's Excremental Narratives","&#x0D;         &#x0D; &#x0D;  This consideration of British poet, novelist, and critic Iain Sinclair’s ‘bad’ writing begins at the summit of Beckton Alp, a pile of waste in London’s east that has been reconstituted as recreational space. For Sinclair, Beckton Alp functions as a totem signifying the pervasive regulatory influence of Panopticism in contemporary urban culture. It shares the Panopticon’s ‘see/being seen dyad’, which is delineated thus by Michel Foucault in Discipline and Punish: &#x0D; &#x0D;    In the peripheric ring [which in this case acts as an analogue for London] one is seen, without ever seeing; in the central tower [for our purposes, Beckton Alp], one sees everything without being seen. (201)&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  In his most recent novel, Dining on Stones (or, The Middle Ground), the prospect from Beckton Alp offers Sinclair the following image of London:&#x0D; &#x0D;    Leaning on a creosoted railing London makes sense. There is a pattern, a working design. And there’s a word for it too: Obscenery. Blight. Stuttering movement. The distant river. The time membrane dissolves, in such a way that the viewer becomes the thing he is looking at. (190)&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  The city, following Michel de Certeau, can be read as a text from Beckton Alp, one that appears intelligible, one that ‘makes sense’ (92). But what “sense” is the reader to make of Sinclair’s vision of London, a London characterised by this intriguing (and typically Sinclairean) neologism, obscenery? Obscenery’s etymological origins in the word ‘obscene’ suggest that it is indecent, unruly, offensive. It would seem to encompass everything that hegemonic culture would prefer to keep off-stage and unseen, everything that it considers ‘bad.’ Yet as Sinclair makes clear, it is hardly hidden—it can be seen from the Alp. By all accounts, obscenery proves to be the completely visible manifestation of what is normally segregated, managed and disposed of by disciplinary apparatuses, such as the Panoptic schema, which organise and supervise urban space. In summary, obscenery contends the regulatory power of Panopticism by being visible, obscenely so. &#x0D; &#x0D;  Sinclair is careful to avoid a dialectic positing obscenery as the disordered antinomy to the pattern of hegemonic order. Instead, obscenery problematises the differentiations demarcating ‘good’ and ‘bad’ culture. Sinclair’s poiesis also blurs the boundaries between divergent spheres of culture as it oscillates between small press publishing and the mass market. His mimeographed chapbooks and limited edition hardcovers have for the major part of his career been conceived, produced, and disseminated outside the parameters of mainstream culture. An affiliation with the avant-garde British Poetry Revival indicates Sinclair’s dedication to alternative publishing, as does the existence of his own imprints: the punningly named horz commerz, and the Albion Village Press.&#x0D; &#x0D;  But his mainstream publications (including Dining on Stones, which was released by multinational publishing house Penguin) complicate this position because although he is published and circulated within the sights of hegemonic literary culture, and therefore subject to the gaze of the Panopticon, Sinclair rejects hegemonic expectations about what comprises literature. He exploits written language, a tool licensed by the Panopticon, for unlicensed praxis. Identifying Sinclair’s cultural production as a type of textual obscenery, or ‘bad’ writing proposes an alternative model of cultural production, one that enables the creative practitioner to loosen the panoptic bonds with which Foucault pinions the individual and productively negotiate the archetypal struggle faced in a capitalist political economy: the conflict between artistic integrity and commercial imperative. &#x0D; &#x0D;  In a sense, Sinclair and his circle of collaborators constitute a modern day la bohème—a league of artistic and literary putschists conspiring against the established order of cultural production, distribution, and consumption. As Sinclair commented in an interview: &#x0D; &#x0D;    There’s no anxiety. Most of the stuff I have done didn’t have to win anybody’s approval. For me, there wasn’t that question of ‘How do I get published?’ that seems to preoccupy writers now. I used to publish myself. (Jeffries)&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  For Sinclair, hegemonic culture is marching acquiescently, mindlessly to the ‘military/industrial two-step. That old standard… YES was the word.’ (Sinclair, London Orbital 4) If ‘yes’ is the mantra of this type of (false) consciousness, then Sinclair’s contrary creations are asserting a politics of ‘no.’ Sinclair’s refusal to accede to hegemonic attitudes regarding what is ‘good’ writing points to a deliberate decision to preserve what Herbert Marcuse terms ‘artistic alienation’ (Sinclair 63). According to Marcuse, artistic alienation, as distinct from traditional Marxist notions of alienation, should be encouraged in order to preserve the integrity of the work of art as something that has the power to rupture reality. In late era capitalism, reality is the totality of commodity culture, thus art must remain antagonistic to the ubiquity of the commodity form. Or, in Marcuse’s words, ‘art has …magic power only as the power of negation. It can speak its own language only as long as the images are alive which refuse and refute the established order’ (65). Within the panoptic schema, the disciplinary apparatus of capitalism, refusal, or refuse, is equivalent to obscenery. Like raw sewage washing up on the beach, or a split garbage bag lying uncollected in the street, Sinclair’s writing is matter out-of-place.&#x0D; &#x0D;  If Panopticism, as Foucault theorises, is to efficiently and effectively implement discipline via real and imagined networks of surveillance that shift constantly between operations extrinsic and intrinsic to the subject, it does not necessarily prevent heterogeneous, transgressive, or subversive practice from emerging.  However, it will, by means of this surveillance, draw attention to these practices, classify and segregate them, apply pejorative labels such as ‘bad’, ‘useless’, ‘harmful’, and relegate them to a social or spatial sphere outside the realm of the normative tastes and standards. In this process lies the Panopticon’s vast potential to devise, standardise, and regulate patterns of production and consumption. Practices and production that do not conform to hegemonic conventions are deemed aberrant, and rendered invisible. In a capitalist political economy, where governing institutions and operations function as extensions of systems predicated upon the fetishism of commodities, regulating patterns of consumption—by deciding what can and can’t be seen—imposes control. According to the logic of scopophilic culture, to be ‘unseen,’ by choice or otherwise, necessarily restricts consumption. In this manner, the Panopticon reinforces its role as arbiter of public taste. Obscenery’s visibility, however, rejects panoptic classification. It resists the panoptic systems that police cultural production, not by remaining hidden, or Other, but by declaring its presence. Unlike the commodity, which in its conformity is seamlessly assimilated into consumer culture, obscenery draws attention. Beckton Alp, a sanitised pile of waste rendered useful, palatable, is, in contrast, an example of obscenery averted (see endnote). &#x0D; &#x0D;  As Marx explains, for a product to exist fully it must be consumed (91). A book becomes a product only when it is read. Writing that is designed to refuse the act of reading is perverse according to any schema of cultural logic, but particularly according to the logic of an economy driven by consumption. This refusal resonates with particular force within a capitalist schema of cultural production because it is fundamentally contrary to the process of commodification. Sinclair’s texts deny easy, uncritical consumption and subsequently cause a blockage in the process of commodification. In this manner, Sinclair contends the logos of capitalist alchemy. A book that resists being easily read, but is still visible to mainstream culture, constitutes a type of obscenery. Situating Sinclair’s poiesis within the domain of obscenery enables an understanding of why his texts have been judged by some critics and readers as ‘bad,’ difficult, inaccessible, impenetrable, even ‘unreadable’. Practitioners of counter-cultural and sub-cultural art and literature traditionally protect their minoritarian status and restrict access to their work by consciously constructing texts which might be considered ‘shit’; in other words, creating something that is deemed excremental, or ‘bad’ according to hegemonic tastes and standards. They create something that inhibits smooth digestion, something that causes a malfunction in the order of consumption. &#x0D; &#x0D;  Stylistically, Sinclair employs a number of linguistic and formal devices to repulse the reader. Unrelenting verbiage and extreme parataxis are two such contrivances, as this exemplary excerpt from Dining on Stones illustrates:&#x0D; &#x0D;    HEALTHY BOWELS? No problem in that department. Quite the reverse. Eyes: like looking out of week-old milk bottles. Ears clogged and sticky nose broken. But bowels ticked like a German motor: Stephen X, age unknown: writer. Marine exile.&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;    His walk, the colonnade. Wet suits for scuba divers. Yellowed wedding dresses. Black god franchises. Fast food. NO CASH KEPT ON PREMISES. The shops, beneath the hulk of the Ocean Queen flats, dealt in negatives, prohibitions – fear. They kept no stock beyond instantly forgotten memorabilia, concrete floors. Stephen releases a clutch of bad wind.  (Sinclair 308)&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  Sinclair’s writing constructs linguistic heterotopias that ‘desiccate speech, stop words in their tracks, contest the very possibility of grammar’ (Foucault, Archaeology xix). His language is clipped, elliptical, arrhythmic. In fact, Sinclair’s prose often doesn’t resemble prose; formally and syntactically, it is more aligned with poetry. It is peppered with paradoxical conceits—‘forgotten memorabilia’—which negate meaning and amplify the inscrutability of his words. His imagery is unexpected, discordant, frequently unsettling, as is his unpredictable register which veers from colloquialisms (‘No problem in that department’; Sinclair 308) to more formal, literary modes of expression (‘Stephen X, age unknown: writer’; Sinclair 308).&#x0D; &#x0D;  Sinclair also alienates the reader through the use of digressive narrative, which in its Blakean insistence on cyclical shapes resists the linear structure associated with the shape of rational imagination. In terms of the economy of a teleological narrative, Sinclair’s storytelling in novels like Dining on Stones is wasteful in its diversions. His fictions and non-fictions contain characters and events that are incidental to what only occasionally resembles a plot. The apotheosis of the urge to contend linear forms of narrative is chronicled in Sinclair’s 2002 book London Orbital, a navigation of the M25 that as a circuitous journey has neither defined point of origin nor a locatable terminus. &#x0D; &#x0D;  Sinclair’s novels, criticism, poetry, films constitute a hermeneutic circle, insisting that you have a working knowledge of the other texts in order to decipher the single text, and the body of work gives meaning to each discrete text. Acquiring Sinclair’s recondite code—which those who are cognisant with his style are well aware—is not a task for the uncommitted. The reader must assume the role of detective tracking down his poetry in second-hand bookshops. Obscure references that saturate the page must be researched. To read and understand Sinclair requires what sociologist Pierre Bourdieu has called ‘cultural competence’ (2). Bourdieu’s ideas on taste and consumption provide a framework for understanding Sinclair’s textual allegiances, his affinity for other types of textual obscenery—unsanctioned graffiti, small magazine poetry—which are also derided as ‘shit’, as ‘bad’ writing by those who have not acquired the cultural competence necessary to understand their coded information. &#x0D; &#x0D;  There is a self-reflexive joke contained in the title Dining on Stones. After all, it is a novel that constantly urges the reader to swallow indigestible text and unsavoury subject matter. Sinclair’s writing continually forces our attentions back to the purlieus of urban culture, to everything that the centrifugal forces of Panopticism have driven to the periphery: social inequality, marginal spatial practice, refuse, shit. Sinclair’s textual obscenery is perceived as ‘bad’, as excremental because it denies mainstream literary audiences the satisfaction of uncomplicated, uncritical consumption. According to the restrictive logic of late era capitalism, Sinclair’s slippery, complex, inaccessible narratives are perverse. But they are also the source of perverse pleasure for those who refuse the inhibitions of conformity.&#x0D; &#x0D;  Endnote&#x0D; &#x0D;  Visual technology in the service of surveillance has been steadily integrated into the everyday, and, by virtue of its ubiquity, has become ‘unseen.’ Similar to the panoptic technologies described by Foucault, Beckton Alp, ‘a considerable event that nobody notices,’ (Sinclair, Dining on Stones, 179) is also assimilated into the urban landscape. &#x0D; &#x0D;   References&#x0D; &#x0D;   Bourdieu, Pierre.

"2005","Diary of a Film Reviewer","&#x0D;         &#x0D; &#x0D;    All critics declare not only their judgment of the work but also their claim to the right to talk about it and judge it. In short, they take part in a struggle for the monopoly of legitimate discourse about the work of art, and consequently in the production of the value of the work of art. (Pierre Bourdieu 36).&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;    As it becomes blindingly obvious that ‘cultural production’, including the cinema, now underpins an economy every bit as brutal in its nascent state as the Industrial Revolution was for its victims 200 years ago, both critique and cinephilia seem faded and useless to me. (Meaghan Morris 700).&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  The music’s loud, the lights are low. I’m at a party and somebody’s shouting at me. “How many films do you see every week?” “Do you really get in for free?” “So what should I see next Saturday night?” These are the questions that shape the small talk of my life. After seven years of reviewing movies you’d think I’d have ready answers and sparkling rehearsed tip-offs to scatter at the slightest quiver of interest. And yet I feel anxious when I’m asked to predict some stranger’s enjoyment – their 15-odd bucks worth of dark velvet pleasure. Who am I to say what they’ll enjoy? Who am I to judge what’s worthwhile? &#x0D; &#x0D;  As editor of the film pages of The Big Issue magazine (Australian edition), I make such value judgments every day, sifting through hundreds of press releases, invitations and interview offers. I choose just three films and three DVDs to be reviewed each fortnight, and one film to form the subject of a feature article or interview. The film pages are a very small part of an independent magazine that exists to provide an income for the homeless and long-term unemployed people who sell it on the streets of Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. And no, homeless people don’t go to the movies very often but our relatively educated and affluent city-dwelling readers do. &#x0D; &#x0D;  The letters page of the magazine suggests that readers’ favourite pages are the Vendor Portraits – the extraordinary and sobering photographs and life stories of the people who are out there on the streets selling the magazine. Yet the editorial policy is to maintain a certain lightness of touch amidst the serious business. Thus, the entertainment pages (music, books, film, TV and humour) have no specific social justice agenda. But if there’s a new Australian film out there that deals with the topic of homelessness, it seems imperative to at least consider the story.&#x0D; &#x0D;  Rather than offering in-depth analysis of particular films and the ways I go about judging them, the following diary excerpts instead offer a sketch of the practical process of editorial decision-making. Why review this film and not that one? Why interview this actor or that film director? And how do these choices fit within the broad goals of a social justice publication? Created randomly, from a quick scan of the last twelve months, the diary is a scribbled attempt to justify, or in Bourdieu’s terms, “legitimate” the critical role I play, and to try and explain how that role can never be fully defined by an aesthetic that is divorced from social and political realities. &#x0D; &#x0D;  August 2004&#x0D; &#x0D;  My editor calls me and asks if I’ve seen Tom White, the new low-budget Australian film by Alkinos Tsilimidos. I have, and I hated it. Starring Colin Friels, the film follows the journey of a middle-aged middle-class man who walks out of his life and onto the streets. It’s a grimy, frustrating film, supported by only the barest bones of narrative. I was bored and infuriated by the central character, and I know it’s the kind of under-developed story that’s keeping Australian audiences away from our own films. And yet … it’s a local film that actually dares to tackle issues of homelessness and mental illness, and it’s a story that presents a truth about homelessness that’s borne out by many of our vendors: that any one of us could, except by the grace of God or luck, find ourselves sleeping rough.&#x0D; &#x0D;  My editor wants me to interview Colin Friels, who will appear on the cover of the magazine. I don’t want to touch the film, and I prefer interviewing people whose work genuinely interests and excites me. But there are other factors to be considered. The film’s exhibitor, Palace Films, is offering to hold charity screenings for our benefit, and they are regular advertising supporters of The Big Issue. My editor, a passionate and informed film lover himself, understands the quandary. We are in no way beholden to Palace, he assures me, and we can tread the fine line with this film, using it to highlight the important issues at hand, without necessarily recommending the film to audiences. It’s tricky and uncomfortable; a simple example of the way in which political and aesthetic values do not always dance so gracefully together. Nevertheless, I find a way to write the story without dishonesty.&#x0D; &#x0D;  September 2004&#x0D; &#x0D;  There’s no denying the pleasure of writing (or reading) a scathing film review that leaves you in stitches of laughter over the dismembered corpse of a bad movie. But when space is limited, I’d rather choose the best three films every fortnight for review and recommendation. In an ideal world I’d attend every preview and take my pick. They’d be an excitingly diverse mix. Say, one provocative documentary (maybe Mike Moore or Errol Morris), one big-budget event movie (from the likes of Scorsese or Tarantino), and one local or art-house gem. In the real world, it’s a scramble for deadlines. Time is short and some of the best films only screen in one or two states, making it impossible for us to cover them for our national audience. Nevertheless, we do our best to keep the mix as interesting and timely as possible. For our second edition this month I review the brilliant documentary Metallica: Some Kind of Monster (Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky), while I send other reviewers to rate Spielberg’s The Terminal (only one and a half stars out of five), and Cate Shortland’s captivating debut Australian feature Somersault (four stars).&#x0D; &#x0D;  For the DVD review page we look at a boxed set of The Adventures of Tintin, together with the strange sombre drama House of Sand and Fog (Vadim Perelman), and the gripping documentary One Day in September (Kevin MacDonald) about the terrorist attacks at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. As editor, I try to match up films with the writers who’ll best appreciate them. With a 200-word limit we know that we’re humble ‘reviewers’ rather than lofty ‘critics’, and that we can only offer the briefest subjective response to a work. Yet the goal remains to be entertaining and fair, and to try and evaluate films on their own terms. Is this particular movie an original and effective example of the schlocky teen horror thriller? If so, let’s give it the thumbs up. Is this ‘worthy’ anti-globalisation documentary just a boring preachy sermon with bad hand-held camera work? Then we say so.&#x0D; &#x0D;  For our film feature article this edition, I write up an interview with Italian director Luigi Falorni, whose simple little film The Weeping Camel has been reducing audiences to tears. It’s a strange quiet film, a ‘narrative documentary’ set in the Gobi desert, about a mother camel that refuses to give milk to her newborn baby. There’s nothing political or radical about it. It’s just beautiful and interesting and odd. And that’s enough to make it worthy of attention. &#x0D; &#x0D;  November 2004&#x0D; &#x0D;  When we choose to do a ‘celebrity’ cover, we find pretty people with serious minds and interesting causes. This month two gorgeous film stars, Natalie Portman and Gael Garcia Bernal find their way onto our covers. Portman’s promoting the quirky coming of age film, Garden State (Zach Braff), but the story we run focuses mainly on her status as ambassador for the Foundation of International Community Assistance (FINCA), which offers loans to deprived women to help them start their own businesses. Gabriel Garcia Bernal, the Mexican star of Walter Salle’s The Motorcycle Diaries appears on our cover and talks about his role as the young Che Guevara, the ultimate idealist and symbol of rebellion. We hope this appeals to those radicals who are prepared to stop in the street, speak to a homeless person, and shell out four dollars for an independent magazine – and also to all those shallow people who want to see more pictures of the hot-eyed Latin lad. &#x0D; &#x0D;  April 2005&#x0D; &#x0D;  Three Dollars is Robert Connelly’s adaptation of Elliot Perlman’s best-selling novel about economic rationalism and its effect on an average Australian family. I loved the book, and the film isn’t bad either, despite some unevenness in the script and performances. I interview Frances O’Connor, who plays opposite David Wenham as his depressed underemployed wife. O’Connor makes a beautiful cover-girl, and talks about the seemingly universal experience of depression. We run the interview alongside one with Connelly, who knows just how to pitch his film to an audience interested in homelessness. He gives great quotes about John Howard’s heartless Australia, and the way we’ve become an economy rather than a society. It’s almost too easy.&#x0D; &#x0D;  In the reviews section of the magazine we pan two other Australian films, Paul Cox’s Human Touch, and the Jimeoin comedy-vehicle The Extra. I’d rather ignore bad Australian films and focus on good films from elsewhere, or big-budget stinkers that need to be brought down a peg. But I’d lined up reviews for these local ones, expecting them to be good, and so we run with the negativity. Some films are practically critic-proof, but small niche films, like most Australian titles, aren’t among these Teflon giants. As Joel Pearlman, Managing Director of Roadshow Films has said, “There are certain types of films that are somewhat critic-proof. They’ve either got a built-in audience, are part of a successful franchise, like The Matrix or Bond films, or have a popular star. It’s films without the multimillion-dollar ad campaigns and the big names where critics are far more influential” ( Pearlman in Bolles 19). Sometimes I’m glad that I’m just a small fish in the film critic pond, and that my bad reviews can’t really destroy someone’s livelihood. It’s well known that a caning from reviewers like David Stratton and Margaret Pomeranz (ABC, At the Movies), or the Melbourne Age’s Jim Schembri can practically destroy the prospects of a small local film, and I’m not sure I have the bravery or conviction of the value of my own tastes to bear such responsibility. Admittedly, that’s just gutless tender-heartedness for, as reviewers, our responsibility is to the audience not to the filmmaker. But when you’ve met with cash-strapped filmmakers, and heard their stories and their struggles, it’s sometimes hard to put personal compassion aside and see the film as the punter will. But you must. &#x0D; &#x0D;  August 2005&#x0D; &#x0D;  It’s a busy time with the Melbourne International Film Festival just finishing up. Hordes of film directors accompany their films to the festival, promoting them here ahead of a later national release schedule, and making themselves available for rare face-to face interviews. This year I find a bunch of goodies that seem like they were tailor-made for our readership. There are winning local films like Sarah Watt’s life-affirming debut Look Both Ways; and Rowan Woods’ gritty addiction-drama Little Fish. There’s my personal favourite, Bahman Ghobadi’s stunning and devastating Kurdish/Iranian feature Turtles Can Fly; and Avi Lewis’s inspiring documentary The Take, about Argentine factory workers who unite to revive their bankrupt workplaces.&#x0D; &#x0D;  It’s when I see films like this, and get to talk to the people who bring them into existence, that I realize how much I value writing about films for a publication that doesn’t exist just to make a profit or fill space between advertisements. As the great American critic Jonathan Rosenbaum has eloquently argued, most of the worldwide media coverage concerning film is merely a variation on the ‘corporate stories’ that film studios feed us as part of their advertising. To be able to provide some small resistance to that juggernaut is a wonderful privilege.&#x0D; &#x0D;  I love to be lost in the dark, studying films frame by frame, and with reference only to some magical internal universe of ‘cinema’ and its endless references to itself. But as the real world outside falls apart, such airless cinephilia feels just plain wrong. As a writer whose subject is films, what I’m compelled to do is to come out of the cinema and try to use my words to convey the best of what I’ve seen to my friends and readers, pointing them towards small treasures they may have overlooked amidst the hype. So maybe I’m not a ‘pure’ critic, and maybe there’s no shame in that. The films I’ll gravitate towards share an almost indefinable quality – to use Jauss’s phrase, they reconstruct and expand my “horizon of expectation” (28). Sometimes these films are overtly committed to a cause, but often they’re just beautiful and strange and fresh. Always they expand me, open me, make me feel that there’s more to the world than expected, and make me want more too – more information, more freedom, more compassion, more equality, more beauty. And, after all these years in the dark, I still want more films like that.&#x0D; &#x0D;  Endnotes&#x0D; &#x0D;  As of August 2005, the role of DVD editor of The Big Issue has been filled by Anthony Morris.&#x0D; &#x0D;  According the latest Morgan Poll, readers of The Big Issue are likely to be young (18-39), urban, educated, and affluent professionals.

We know that ideas can adapt; sometimes even institutions can adapt. Or not. Various papers in this issue attest in exciting ways to precisely such adaptations and maladaptations. (See, for example, the articles in this issue by Lelia Green, Leesa Bonniface, and Tami McMahon, by Lexey A. Bartlett, and by Debra Ferreday.) Adaptation is a part of nature and culture, but it’s the latter alone that interests me here. (However, see the article by Hutcheon and Bortolotti for a discussion of nature and culture together.) It’s no news to anyone that not only adaptations, but all art is bred of other art, though sometimes artists seem to get carried away. My favourite example of excess of association or attribution can be found in the acknowledgements page to a verse drama called Beatrice Chancy by the self-defined “maximalist” (not minimalist) poet, novelist, librettist, and critic, George Elliot Clarke.  His selected list of the incarnations of the story of Beatrice Cenci, a sixteenth-century Italian noblewoman put to death for the murder of her father, includes dramas, romances, chronicles, screenplays, parodies, sculptures, photographs, and operas:&#x0D; &#x0D;    dramas by Vincenzo Pieracci (1816), Percy Bysshe Shelley (1819), Juliusz Slowacki (1843), Waldter Landor (1851), Antonin Artaud (1935) and Alberto Moravia (1958); the romances by Francesco Guerrazi (1854), Henri Pierangeli (1933), Philip Lindsay (1940), Frederic Prokosch (1955) and Susanne Kircher (1976); the chronicles by Stendhal (1839), Mary Shelley (1839), Alexandre Dumas, père (1939-40), Robert Browning (1864), Charles Swinburne (1883), Corrado Ricci (1923), Sir Lionel Cust (1929), Kurt Pfister (1946) and Irene Mitchell (1991); the film/screenplay by Bertrand Tavernier and Colo O’Hagan (1988); the parody by Kathy Acker (1993); the sculpture by Harriet Hosmer (1857); the photograph by Julia Ward Cameron (1866); and the operas by Guido Pannain (1942), Berthold Goldschmidt (1951, 1995) and Havergal Brian (1962). (Beatrice Chancy, 152)&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  He concludes the list with: “These creators have dallied with Beatrice Cenci, but I have committed indiscretions” (152). An “intertextual feast”, by Clarke’s own admission, this rewriting of Beatrice’s story—especially Percy Bysshe Shelley’s own verse play, The Cenci—illustrates brilliantly what Northrop Frye offered as the first principle of the production of literature: “literature can only derive its form from itself” (15).&#x0D; &#x0D;  But in the last several decades, what has come to be called intertextuality theory has shifted thinking away from looking at this phenomenon from the point of view of authorial influences on the writing of literature (and works like Harold Bloom’s famous study of the Anxiety of Influence) and toward considering our readerly associations with literature, the connections we (not the author) make—as we read. We, the readers, have become “empowered”, as we say, and we’ve become the object of academic study in our own right. Among the many associations we inevitably make, as readers, is with adaptations of the literature we read, be it of Jane Austin novels or Beowulf. Some of us may have seen the 2006 rock opera of Beowulf done by the Irish Repertory Theatre; others await the new Neil Gaiman animated film. Some may have played the Beowulf videogame. I personally plan to miss the upcoming updated version that makes Beowulf into the son of an African explorer. But I did see Sturla Gunnarsson’s Beowulf and Grendel film, and yearned to see the comic opera at the Lincoln Centre Festival in 2006 called Grendel, the Transcendence of the Great Big Bad. I am not really interested in whether these adaptations—all in the last year or so—signify Hollywood’s need for a new “monster of the week” or are just the sign of a desire to cash in on the success of The Lord of the Rings. For all I know they might well act as an ethical reminder of the human in the alien in a time of global strife (see McGee, A4). What interests me is the impact these multiple adaptations can have on the reader of literature as well as on the production of literature.&#x0D; &#x0D;  Literature, like painting, is usually thought of as what Nelson Goodman (114) calls a one-stage art form: what we read (like what we see on a canvas) is what is put there by the originating artist. Several major consequences follow from this view. First, the implication is that the work is thus an original and new creation by that artist. However, even the most original of novelists—like Salman Rushdie—are the first to tell you that stories get told and retold over and over. Indeed his controversial novel, The Satanic Verses, takes this as a major theme. Works like the Thousand and One Nights are crucial references in all of his work. As he writes in Haroun and the Sea of Stories: “no story comes from nowhere; new stories are born of old” (86). &#x0D; &#x0D;  But illusion of originality is only one of the implications of seeing literature as a one-stage art form. Another is the assumption that what the writer put on paper is what we read. But entire doctoral programs in literary production and book history have been set up to study how this is not the case, in fact. Editors influence, even change, what authors want to write. Designers control how we literally see the work of literature. Beatrice Chancy’s bookend maps of historical Acadia  literally frame how we read the historical story of the title’s mixed-race offspring of an African slave and a white slave owner in colonial Nova Scotia in 1801. Media interest or fashion or academic ideological focus may provoke a publisher to foreground in the physical presentation different elements of a text like this—its stress on race, or gender, or sexuality. The fact that its author won Canada’s Governor General’s Award for poetry might mean that the fact that this is a verse play is emphasised. If the book goes into a second edition, will a new preface get added, changing the framework for the reader once again? As Katherine Larson has convincingly shown, the paratextual elements that surround a work of literature like this one become a major site of meaning generation.&#x0D; &#x0D;  What if literature were not a one-stage an art form at all? What if it were, rather, what Goodman calls “two-stage” (114)? What if we accept that other artists, other creators, are needed to bring it to life—editors, publishers, and indeed readers? In a very real and literal sense, from our (audience) point of view, there may be no such thing as a one-stage art work. Just as the experience of literature is made possible for readers by the writer, in conjunction with a team of professional and creative people, so, arguably all art needs its audience to be art; the un-interpreted, un-experienced art work is not worth calling art.&#x0D; &#x0D;  Goodman resists this move to considering literature a two-stage art, not at all sure that readings are end products the way that performance works are (114). Plays, films, television shows, or operas would be his prime examples of two-stage arts. In each of these, a text (a playtext, a screenplay, a score, a libretto) is moved from page to stage or screen and given life, by an entire team of creative individuals: directors, actors, designers, musicians, and so on. Literary adaptations to the screen or stage are usually considered as yet another form of this kind of transcription or transposition of a written text to a performance medium. But the verbal move from the “book” to the diminutive “libretto” (in Italian, little book or booklet) is indicative of a view that sees adaptation as a step downward, a move away from a primary literary “source”. In fact, an entire negative rhetoric of “infidelity” has developed in both journalistic reviewing and academic discourse about adaptations, and it is a morally loaded rhetoric that I find surprising in its intensity. Here is the wonderfully critical description of that rhetoric by the king of film adaptation critics, Robert Stam:&#x0D; &#x0D;    Terms like “infidelity,” “betrayal,” “deformation,” “violation,” “bastardisation,” “vulgarisation,” and “desecration” proliferate in adaptation discourse, each word carrying its specific charge of opprobrium. “Infidelity” carries overtones of Victorian prudishness; “betrayal” evokes ethical perfidy; “bastardisation” connotes illegitimacy; “deformation” implies aesthetic disgust and monstrosity; “violation” calls to mind sexual violence; “vulgarisation” conjures up class degradation; and “desecration” intimates religious sacrilege and blasphemy. (3)&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  I join many others today, like Stam, in challenging the persistence of this fidelity discourse in adaptation studies, thereby providing yet another example of what, in his article here called “The Persistence of Fidelity: Adaptation Theory Today,” John Connor has called the “fidelity reflex”—the call to end an obsession with fidelity as the sole criterion for judging the success of an adaptation. But here I want to come at this same issue of the relation of adaptation to the adapted text from another angle.&#x0D; &#x0D;  When considering an adaptation of a literary work, there are other reasons why the literary “source” text might be privileged. Literature has historical priority as an art form, Stam claims, and so in some people’s eyes will always be superior to other forms. But does it actually have priority? What about even earlier performative forms like ritual and song? Or to look forward, instead of back, as Tim Barker urges us to do in his article here, what about the new media’s additions to our repertoire with the advent of electronic technology? How can we retain this hierarchy of artistic forms—with literature inevitably on top—in a world like ours today? How can both the Romantic ideology of original genius and the capitalist notion of individual authorship hold up in the face of the complex reality of the production of literature today (as well as in the past)? (In “Amen to That: Sampling and Adapting the Past”, Steve Collins shows how digital technology has changed the possibilities of musical creativity in adapting/sampling.)&#x0D; &#x0D;  Like many other ages before our own, adaptation is rampant today, as director Spike Jonze and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman clearly realised in creating Adaptation, their meta-cinematic illustration-as-send-up film about adaptation. But rarely has a culture denigrated the adapter as a secondary and derivative creator as much as we do the screenwriter today—as Jonze explores with great irony. Michelle McMerrin and Sergio Rizzo helpfully explain in their pieces here that one of the reasons for this is the strength of auteur theory in film criticism. But we live in a world in which works of literature have been turned into more than films. We now have literary adaptations in the forms of interactive new media works and videogames; we have theme parks; and of course, we have the more common television series, radio and stage plays, musicals, dance works, and operas. And, of course, we now have novelisations of films—and they are not given the respect that originary novels are given: it is the adaptation as adaptation that is denigrated, as Deborah Allison shows in “Film/Print: Novelisations and Capricorn One”. &#x0D; &#x0D;  Adaptations across media are inevitably fraught, and for complex and multiple reasons. The financing and distribution issues of these widely different media alone inevitably challenge older capitalist models. The need or desire to appeal to a global market has consequences for adaptations of literature, especially with regard to its regional and historical specificities. These particularities are what usually get adapted or “indigenised” for new audiences—be they the particularities of the Spanish gypsy Carmen (see Ioana Furnica, “Subverting the ‘Good, Old Tune’”), those of the Japanese samurai genre (see Kevin P. Eubanks, “Becoming-Samurai: Samurai [Films], Kung-Fu [Flicks] and Hip-Hop [Soundtracks]”), of American hip hop graffiti (see Kara-Jane Lombard, “‘To Us Writers, the Differences Are Obvious’: The Adaptation of Hip Hop Graffiti to an Australian Context”) or of Jane Austen’s fiction (see Suchitra Mathur, “From British ‘Pride’ to Indian ‘Bride’: Mapping the Contours of a Globalised (Post?)Colonialism”).&#x0D; &#x0D;  What happens to the literary text that is being adapted, often multiple times? Rather than being displaced by the adaptation (as is often feared), it most frequently gets a new life: new editions of the book appear, with stills from the movie adaptation on its cover. But if I buy and read the book after seeing the movie, I read it differently than I would have before I had seen the film: in effect, the book, not the adaptation, has become the second and even secondary text for me. And as I read, I can only “see” characters as imagined by the director of the film; the cinematic version has taken over, has even colonised, my reader’s imagination. The literary “source” text, in my readerly, experiential terms, becomes the secondary work. It exists on an experiential continuum, in other words, with its adaptations. It may have been created before, but I only came to know it after. &#x0D; &#x0D;  What if I have read the literary work first, and then see the movie? In my imagination, I have already cast the characters: I know what Gabriel and Gretta Conroy of James Joyce’s story, “The Dead,” look and sound like—in my imagination, at least. Then along comes John Huston’s lush period piece cinematic adaptation and the director superimposes his vision upon mine; his forcibly replaces mine. But, in this particular case, Huston still arguably needs my imagination, or at least my memory—though he may not have realised it fully in making the film. When, in a central scene in the narrative, Gabriel watches his wife listening, moved, to the singing of the Irish song, “The Lass of Aughrim,” what we see on screen is a concerned, intrigued, but in the end rather blank face: Gabriel doesn’t alter his expression as he listens and watches. His expression may not change—but I know exactly what he is thinking. Huston does not tell us; indeed, without the use of voice-over, he cannot. And since the song itself is important, voice-over is impossible. But I know exactly what he is thinking: I’ve read the book. I fill in the blank, so to speak. Gabriel looks at Gretta and thinks:&#x0D; &#x0D;    There was grace and mystery in her attitude as if she were a symbol of something. He asked himself what is a woman standing on the stairs in the shadow, listening to distant music, a symbol of. If he were a painter he would paint her in that attitude. … Distant Music he would call the picture if he were a painter. (210)&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  A few pages later the narrator will tell us:&#x0D; &#x0D;    At last she turned towards them and Gabriel saw that there was colour on her cheeks and that her eyes were shining. A sudden tide of joy went leaping out of his heart. (212)&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  This joy, of course, puts him in a very different—disastrously different—state of mind than his wife, who (we later learn) is remembering a young man who sang that song to her when she was a girl—and who died, for love of her. I know this—because I’ve read the book. Watching the movie, I interpret Gabriel’s blank expression in this knowledge.&#x0D; &#x0D;  Just as the director’s vision can colonise my visual and aural imagination, so too can I, as reader, supplement the film’s silence with the literary text’s inner knowledge. The question, of course, is: should I have to do so? Because I have read the book, I will. But what if I haven’t read the book? Will I substitute my own ideas, from what I’ve seen in the rest of the film, or from what I’ve experienced in my own life? Filmmakers always have to deal with this problem, of course, since the camera is resolutely externalising, and actors must reveal their inner worlds through bodily gesture or facial expression for the camera to record and for the spectator to witness and comprehend. But film is not only a visual medium: it uses music and sound, and it also uses words—spoken words within the dramatic situation, words overheard on the street, on television, but also voice-over words, spoken by a narrating figure. Stephen Dedalus escapes from Ireland at the end of Joseph Strick’s 1978 adaptation of Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man with the same words as he does in the novel, where they appear as Stephen’s diary entry:&#x0D; &#x0D;    Amen. So be it. Welcome, O life! I go to encounter for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race. … Old father, old artificer, stand me now and ever in good stead. (253)&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  The words from the novel also belong to the film as film, with its very different story, less about an artist than about a young Irishman finally able to escape his family, his religion and his country. What’s deliberately NOT in the movie is the irony of Joyce’s final, benign-looking textual signal to his reader: &#x0D; &#x0D;    Dublin, 1904&#x0D; Trieste, 1914&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  The first date is the time of Stephen’s leaving Dublin—and the time of his return, as we know from the novel Ulysses, the sequel, if you like, to this novel. The escape was short-lived! Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man has an ironic structure that has primed its readers to expect not escape and triumph but something else. Each chapter of the novel has ended on this kind of personal triumphant high; the next has ironically opened with Stephen mired in the mundane and in failure. Stephen’s final words in both film and novel remind us that he really is an Icarus figure, following his “Old father, old artificer”, his namesake, Daedalus. And Icarus, we recall, takes a tumble. In the novel version, we are reminded that this is the portrait of the artist “as a young man”—later, in 1914, from the distance of Trieste (to which he has escaped) Joyce, writing this story, could take some ironic distance from his earlier persona. There is no such distance in the film version. However, it stands alone, on its own; Joyce’s irony is not appropriate in Strick’s vision. His is a different work, with its own message and its own, considerably more romantic and less ironic power.&#x0D; &#x0D;  Literary adaptations are their own things—inspired by, based on an adapted text but something different, something other. I want to argue that these works adapted from literature are now part of our readerly experience of that literature, and for that reason deserve the same attention we give to the literary, and not only the same attention, but also the same respect. I am a literarily trained person. People like me who love words, already love plays, but shouldn’t we also love films—and operas, and musicals, and even videogames? There is no need to denigrate words that are heard (and visualised) in order to privilege words that are read. Works of literature can have afterlives in their adaptations and translations, just as they have pre-lives, in terms of influences and models, as George Eliot Clarke openly allows in those acknowledgements to Beatrice Chancy.&#x0D; &#x0D;  I want to return to that Canadian work, because it raises for me many of the issues about adaptation and language that I see at the core of our literary distrust of the move away from the written, printed text. I ended my recent book on adaptation with a brief examination of this work, but I didn’t deal with this particular issue of language. So I want to return to it, as to unfinished business. Clarke is, by the way, clear in the verse drama as well as in articles and interviews that among the many intertexts to Beatrice Chancy, the most important are slave narratives, especially one called Celia, a Slave, and Shelley’s play, The Cenci. Both are stories of mistreated and subordinated women who fight back. Since Clarke himself has written at length about the slave narratives, I’m going to concentrate here on Shelley’s The Cenci. The distance from Shelley’s verse play to Clarke’s verse play is a temporal one, but it is also geographic and ideological one: from the old to the new world, and from a European to what Clarke calls an “Africadian” (African Canadian/African Acadian) perspective. Yet both poets were writing political protest plays against unjust authority and despotic power. And they have both become plays that are more read than performed—a sad fate, according to Clarke, for two works that are so concerned with voice. We know that Shelley sought to calibrate the stylistic registers of his work with various dramatic characters and effects to create a modern “mixed” style that was both a return to the ancients and offered a new drama of great range and flexibility where the expression fits what is being expressed (see Bruhn). His polemic against eighteenth-century European dramatic conventions has been seen as leading the way for realist drama later in the nineteenth century, with what has been called its “mixed style mimesis” (Bruhn)&#x0D; &#x0D;  Clarke’s adaptation does not aim for Shelley’s perfect linguistic decorum. It mixes the elevated and the biblical with the idiomatic and the sensual—even the vulgar—the lushly poetic with the coarsely powerful. But perhaps Shelley’s idea of appropriate language fits, after all: Beatrice Chancy is a woman of mixed blood—the child of a slave woman and her slave owner; she has been educated by her white father in a convent school. Sometimes that educated, elevated discourse is heard; at other times, she uses the variety of discourses operative within slave society—from religious to colloquial. But all the time, words count—as in all printed and oral literature.&#x0D; &#x0D;  Clarke’s verse drama was given a staged reading in Toronto in 1997, but the story’s, if not the book’s, real second life came when it was used as the basis for an opera libretto. Actually the libretto commission came first (from Queen of Puddings Theatre in Toronto), and Clarke started writing what was to be his first of many opera texts. Constantly frustrated by the art form’s demands for concision, he found himself writing two texts at once—a short libretto and a longer, five-act tragic verse play to be published separately. Since it takes considerably longer to sing than to speak (or read) a line of text, the composer James Rolfe keep asking for cuts—in the name of economy (too many singers), because of clarity of action for audience comprehension, or because of sheer length. Opera audiences have to sit in a theatre for a fixed length of time, unlike readers who can put a book down and return to it later. However, what was never sacrificed to length or to the demands of the music was the language. In fact, the double impact of the powerful mixed language and the equally potent music, increases the impact of the literary text when performed in its operatic adaptation. Here is the verse play version of the scene after Beatrice’s rape by her own father, Francis Chancey:&#x0D; &#x0D;    I was black but comely. Don’t glance&#x0D; Upon me. This flesh is crumbling&#x0D; Like proved lies. I’m perfumed, ruddied&#x0D; Carrion. Assassinated.&#x0D; Screams of mucking juncos scrawled&#x0D; Over the chapel and my nerves,&#x0D; A stickiness, as when he finished&#x0D; Maculating my thighs and dress.&#x0D; My eyes seep pus; I can’t walk: the floors&#x0D; Are tizzy, dented by stout mauling.&#x0D; Suddenly I would like poison.&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;    The flesh limps from my spine. My inlets crimp.&#x0D; Vultures flutter, ghastly, without meaning.&#x0D; I can see lice swarming the air.&#x0D; …&#x0D; His scythe went shick shick shick and slashed&#x0D; My flowers; they lay, murdered, in heaps. (90)&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  The biblical and the violent meet in the texture of the language. And none of that power gets lost in the opera adaptation, despite cuts and alterations for easier aural comprehension.&#x0D; &#x0D;    I was black but comely. Don’t look&#x0D; Upon me: this flesh is dying.&#x0D; I’m perfumed, bleeding carrion,&#x0D; My eyes weep pus, my womb’s sopping&#x0D; With tears; I can hardly walk: the floors &#x0D; Are tizzy, the sick walls tumbling,&#x0D; Crumbling like proved lies.&#x0D; His scythe went shick shick shick and cut &#x0D; My flowers; they lay in heaps, murdered. (95)&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  Clarke has said that he feels the libretto is less “literary” in his words than the verse play, for it removes the lines of French, Latin, Spanish and Italian that pepper the play as part of the author’s critique of the highly educated planter class in Nova Scotia: their education did not guarantee ethical behaviour (“Adaptation” 14).&#x0D; &#x0D;  I have not concentrated on the music of the opera, because I wanted to keep the focus on the language. But I should say that the Rolfe’s score is as historically grounded as Clarke’s libretto: it is rooted in African Canadian music (from ring shouts to spirituals to blues) and in Scottish fiddle music and local reels of the time, not to mention bel canto Italian opera. However, the music consciously links black and white traditions in a way that Clarke’s words and story refuse: they remain stubbornly separate, set in deliberate tension with the music’s resolution. Beatrice will murder her father, and, at the very moment that Nova Scotia slaves are liberated, she and her co-conspirators will be hanged for that murder.&#x0D; &#x0D;  Unlike the printed verse drama, the shorter opera libretto functions like a screenplay, if you will. It is not so much an autonomous work unto itself, but it points toward a potential enactment or embodiment in performance. Yet, even there, Clarke cannot resist the lure of words—even though they are words that no audience will ever hear. The stage directions for Act 3, scene 2 of the opera read: “The garden. Slaves, sunflowers, stars, sparks” (98). The printed verse play is full of these poetic associative stage directions, suggesting that despite his protestations to the contrary, Clarke may have thought of that version as one meant to be read by the eye. After Beatrice’s rape, the stage directions read: “A violin mopes. Invisible shovelsful of dirt thud upon the scene—as if those present were being buried alive—like ourselves” (91). Our imaginations—and emotions—go to work, assisted by the poet’s associations. There are many such textual helpers—epigraphs, photographs, notes—that we do not have when we watch and listen to the opera.  We do have the music, the staged drama, the colours and sounds as well as the words of the text. As Clarke puts the difference: “as a chamber opera, Beatrice Chancy has ascended to television broadcast. But as a closet drama, it play only within the reader’s head” (“Adaptation” 14).&#x0D; &#x0D;  Clarke’s work of literature, his verse drama, is a “situated utterance, produced in one medium and in one historical and social context,” to use Robert Stam’s terms. In the opera version, it was transformed into another “equally situated utterance, produced in a different context and relayed through a different medium” (45-6). I want to argue that both are worthy of study and respect by wordsmiths, by people like me. I realise I’ve loaded the dice: here neither the verse play nor the libretto is primary; neither is really the “source” text, for they were written at the same time and by the same person. But for readers and audiences (my focus and interest here), they exist on a continuum—depending on which we happen to experience first. As Ilana Shiloh explores here, the same is true about the short story and film of Memento.&#x0D; &#x0D;  I am not alone in wanting to mount a defence of adaptations. Julie Sanders ends her new book called Adaptation and Appropriation with these words: “Adaptation and appropriation … are, endlessly and wonderfully, about seeing things come back to us in as many forms as possible” (160). The storytelling imagination is an adaptive mechanism—whether manifesting itself in print or on stage or on screen. The study of the production of literature should, I would like to argue, include those other forms taken by that storytelling drive. If I can be forgiven a move to the amusing—but still serious—in concluding, Terry Pratchett puts it beautifully in his fantasy story, Witches Abroad: “Stories, great flapping ribbons of shaped space-time, have been blowing and uncoiling around the universe since the beginning of time. And they have evolved. The weakest have died and the strongest have survived and they have grown fat on the retelling.” In biology as in culture, adaptations reign.&#x0D; &#x0D;   References&#x0D; &#x0D;   Bloom, Harold.

Many adequate and moving words were also spoken at the memorial.All of them capture Roger – or at least aspects of him.What is most difficult to convey, however, is what made him so special.Words, as Woolf went on to show, are wild and unteachable.They do not necessarily represent what we truly feel or think – they simply cannot represent someone like Roger. But words are our best attempt at that kind of representation. What I will try to communicate in the following few paragraphs – in words – is how Roger himself was a master of words. Because his words came very close to representing at the same time his intellectual ideals and himself as a person in all his humanity. He was a master of words, because he was a master of living what he preached.The example I want to give is Roger’s networking activity.1 In this, too, he was a master, but for the same reasons. ‘Congruity’ is the (inadequate) term I want to use to describe this ability and activity. In telling this story I am simply adding another narrative to the long list of stories that can be – but also need to be – told about Roger (as Caroline Bassett so rightly points out in her contribution to this issue of","",""

A chronological perspective is deployed in order to shed light on how the concept of clusters has evolved. Given the increasing interest in clusters as knowledge repositories, and the apparent conviction among policymakers of the manageability of clusters, lessons learned from knowledge management (KM) practices in organizations might well be applied to the many policy efforts aimed at governing clusters. We argue that introducing KM initiatives on a regional level should be accompanied by an understanding of the possible downfalls that are associated with KM failures.","",""
"2008","Remembering Things","In an attempt to listen to things, and to unpack the dynamics and particularities of the role of things in constituting memory (and the role of memory in constituting things), we argue four points: that relations between things are crucial; that things provide us with markers of time, place, purpose, and identity; that these markers are historically obdurate; and that things actin ways that transcend semiotics. Each of these four—relations, markers, obduracy, and actions—are significant for and constitutive of memory. The argument is thus antirepresentational, suggesting that the world is perfectly capable of representing itself, and that our understanding of the world is immanent in the world and its relations.","",""

"2010","Independent People","There is an old Danish fable that says that the Devil was watching when God created the earth, and that, as the creation progressed, he became increasingly agitated over the wondrous achievements he was made to witness. At the end of it all, the Devil turned to God, and said, ‘Now, watch this.’  He created Iceland.  It’s a vision of the country that resembles my own. I have always thought of Iceland as the island apart. The place that came last in the earth’s construction, whoever the engineer, and so remains forever distant. Perhaps that’s because, for me, Iceland is a home far from home. It is the country that I am from, and the place to which I am always tending—in my reading, my travels, and my thoughts. But since we left when I was ten, I am only ever in Iceland for mere glimpses of the Devil’s work, and always leave wanting more, some kind of deeper involvement. Perhaps all of his temptations are like that.  Iceland’s is an inverted landscape, stuck like a plug on the roof of the Earth, revealing all the violence and destruction of the layers beneath. The island expands as the tectonic plates beneath it move. It grows by ten centimetres a year, but in two different directions—one towards the States, and the other towards Europe. I have noticed something similar happening to me. Each year, the fissure is a little wider. I come to be more like a visitor, and less like the one returning to his birthplace.  I last visited in February just gone, to see whether Iceland was still drifting away from me and, indeed, from the rest of the world. I was doing research in Germany, and set aside an extra week for Reykjavík, to visit friends and family, and to see whether things were really as bad as they appeared to be from Brisbane, where I have lived for most of my life. I had read countless bleak reports of financial ruin and social unrest, and yet I couldn’t suppress the thought that Iceland was probably just being Iceland. The same country that had fought three wars over cod; that offered asylum to Bobby Fischer when no-one else would take him; and that allowed Yoko Ono to occupy a small island near Reykjavík with a peace sculpture made of light. Wasn’t it always the country stuck out on its own, with a people who claimed their independent spirit, and self-reliance, as their most-prized values? No doubt, things were bad. But did Iceland really mean to tie itself closer to Europe as a way out of the economic crisis? And what would this mean for its much-cherished sense of apartness?  I spent a week of clear, cold days talking to those who made up my Iceland. They all told me what I most wanted to hear—that nothing much had changed since the financial collapse in 2008. Yes, the value of the currency had halved, and this made it harder to travel abroad. Yes, there was some unemployment now, whereas before there had been none. And, certainly, those who had over-extended on their mortgages were struggling to keep their homes. But wasn’t this the case everywhere? If it wasn’t for Icesave, they said, no-one would spare a thought for Iceland.  They were referring to the disastrous internet bank, a wing of the National Bank of Iceland, which had captured and then lost billions in British and Dutch savings. The result was an earthquake in the nation’s financial sector, which in recent years had come to challenge fishing and hot springs as the nation’s chief source of wealth. In a couple of months in late 2008, this sector all but disappeared, or was nationalised as part of the Icelandic government’s scrambling efforts to salvage the economy. Meanwhile, the British and Dutch governments insisted on their citizens’ interests, and issued such a wealth of abuse towards Iceland that the country must have wondered whether it wasn’t still seen, in some quarters, as the Devil’s work. At one point, the National Bank—my bank in Iceland—was even listed by the British as a terrorist organization.  I asked whether people were angry with the entrepreneurs who caused all this trouble, the bankers behind Icesave, and so on. The reply was that they were all still in London. ‘They wouldn’t dare show their faces in Reykjavík.’ Well, that was new, I thought. It sounded like a different kind of anger, much more bitter than the usual, fisherman’s jealous awareness of his neighbours’ harvests. Different, too, from the gossip, a national addiction which nevertheless always struck me as being rather homely and forgiving. In Iceland, just about everyone is related, and the thirty or so bankers who have caused the nation’s bankruptcy are well-known to all. But somehow they have gone too far, and their exile is suspended only by their appearances in the newspapers, the law courts, or on the satirical T-shirts sold in main street Laugavegur.  There, too, you saw the other side of the currency collapse. The place was buzzing with tourists, unusual at this dark time of year. Iceland was half-price, they had been told, and it was true—anything made locally was affordable, for so long unthinkable in Iceland. This was a country that had always prided itself on being hopelessly expensive. So perhaps what was being lost in the local value of the economy would be recouped through the waves of extra tourists? Certainly, the sudden cheapness of Iceland had affected my decision to come, and to stay in a hotel downtown rather than with friends.  On my last full day, a Saturday, I joined my namesake Kári for a drive into the country. For a while, our conversation was taken up with the crisis: the President, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, had recently declined to sign a bill that ensured that Iceland repaid its debts to the British and Dutch governments. His refusal meant a referendum on the bill in the coming March. No-one doubted that the nation would say no. The terms were unfair. And yet it was felt that Iceland’s entry into the EU, and its adoption of the Euro in place of the failed krónur, were conditional on its acceptance of the blame apportioned by international investors, and Britain in particular. Britain, one recalled, was the enemy in the Cod Wars, when Iceland had last entered the international press. Iceland had won that war. Why not this one, as well?  That Iceland should suddenly need the forgiveness and assistance of its neighbours was no surprise to them. The Danes and others had long been warning Icelandic bankers that the finance sector was massively over-leveraged and bound for failure at the first sign of trouble in the international economy. I remember being in Iceland at the time of these warnings, in May 2007. It was Eurovision Song Contest month, and there was great local consternation at Iceland’s dismal showing that year. Amid the outpouring of Eurovision grief, and accusations against the rest of Europe that it was block-voting small countries like Iceland out of the contest, the dire economic warnings from the Danes seemed small news.  ‘They just didn’t like the útrásarvíkingar,’ said Kári. That is, the Danes were simply upset that their former colonial children had produced offspring of their own who were capable of taking over shops, football clubs, and even banks in main streets of Copenhagen, Amsterdam and London. With interests as glamorous as West Ham United, Hamleys, and Karen Millen, it is not surprising that the útrásarvíkingar, or ‘Viking raiders’, were fast attaining the status of national heroes.  Today, it’s a term of abuse rather than pride. The entrepreneurs are exiled in the countries they once sought to raid, and the modern Viking achievement, rather like the one a thousand years before, is a victim of negative press. All that raiding suddenly seems vain and greedy, and the ships that bore the raiders—private jets that for a while were a common sight over the skies of Reykjavík—have found new homes in foreign lands.  The Danes were right about the Icelandic economy, just as they’d been right about the Devil’s landscaping efforts. But hundreds of years of colonial rule and only six decades of independence made it difficult for the Icelanders to listen. To curtail the flight of the new Vikings went against the Icelandic project, which from the very beginning was about independence.  A thousand years before, in the 870s, Iceland had been a refuge. The medieval stories—known collectively as the sagas—tell us that the island was settled by Norwegian chieftains who were driven out of the fjordlands of their ancestors by the ruthless King Harald the Fair-Haired, who demanded total control of Norway. They refused to humble themselves before the king, and instead took the risk of a new life on a remote, inhospitable island.  Icelandic independence, which was lost in the 1260s, was only regained in full in 1944, after Denmark had fallen under German occupation. Ten years later, with the war over and Iceland in the full stride of its independence, Denmark began returning the medieval Icelandic manuscripts that it had acquired during the colonial era. At that point, says the common wisdom, Icelanders forgave the Danes for centuries of poor governance. Although the strict commercial laws of the colonial period had made it all but impossible for Icelanders to rise out of economic hardship, the Danes had, at least, given the sagas back. National sovereignty was returned, and so too the literature that dated back to the time the country had last stood on its own.  But, most powerfully, being Icelandic meant being independent of one’s immediate neighbours. Halldór Laxness, the nation’s Nobel Laureate, would satirize this national characteristic in his most enduring masterpiece, Sjálfstætt fólk, or Independent People. It is also what the dominant political party of the independence period, Sjálfstæðisflokkurinn, The Independence Party, has long treasured as a political ideal. To be Icelandic means being free of interference. And in a country of independent people, who would want to stop the bankers on their raids into Europe? Or, for that matter, who was now going to admit that it was time to join Europe instead of emphasizing one’s apartness from it?  Kári and I turned off the south road out of Reykjavík and climbed into the heath. From here, the wounds of the country’s geological past still dominated the surface of the land. Little wonder that Jules Verne claimed that the journey to the centre of the world began on Snæfellsnes, a peninsula of volcanoes, lava, and ice caps on a long arm of land that extends desperately from the west of the island, as if forever in hope of reaching America, or at the very least Greenland.  It was from Snæfellsnes that Eirík the Red began his Viking voyages westwards, and from where his famous son Leif would reach Vínland, the Land of Vines, most probably Newfoundland. Eight hundred years later, during the worst of the nation’s hardships—when the famines and natural disasters of the late eighteenth century reduced the nation almost to extinction—thousands of Icelanders followed in Leif’s footsteps, across the ‘whale road’, as the Vikings called it, to Canada, and mainly Winnipeg, where they recreated Iceland in an environment arguably even more hostile than the one they’d left.  At least there weren’t any volcanoes in Winnipeg. In Iceland, you could never escape the feeling that the world was still evolving, and that the Devil’s work was ongoing. Even the national Assembly was established on one of the island’s most visible outward signs of the deep rift beneath—where a lake had cracked off the heath around it, which now surrounded it as a scar-scape of broken rocks and torn cliffs. The Almannagjá, or People’s Gorge, which is the most dramatic part of the rift, stands, or rather falls apart, as the ultimate symbol of Icelandic national unity.  That is Iceland, an island on the edge of Europe, and forever on the edge of itself, too, a place where unity is defined by constant points of separation, not only in the landscape as it crunches itself apart and pushes through at the weak points, but also in a persistently small social world—the population is only 320,000—that is so closely related that it has had little choice but to emphasise the differences that do exist.   After a slow drive through the low hills near Thingvellir, we reached the national park, and followed the dirt roads down to the lake. It’s an exclusive place for summerhouses, many of which now seem to stand as reminders of the excesses of the past ten years: the haphazardly-constructed huts that once made the summerhouse experience a bit of an adventure were replaced by two-storey buildings with satellite dishes, spa baths, and the ubiquitous black Range Rovers parked outside—the latter are now known as ‘Game Overs’. Like so much that has been sold off to pay the debts, the luxury houses seem ‘very 2007,’ the local term for anything unsustainable.  But even the opulent summerhouses of the Viking raiders don’t diminish the landscape of Thingvellir, and a lake that was frozen from the shore to about fifty metres out. At the shoreline, lapping water had crystallized into blue, translucent ice-waves that formed in lines of dark and light water. Then we left the black beach for the site of the old Assembly. It was a place that had witnessed many encounters, not least the love matches that were formed when young Icelanders returned from their Viking raids and visits to the courts of Scandinavia, Scotland, Ireland, and England.  On this particular day, though, the site was occupied by only five Dutchmen in bright, orange coats. They were throwing stones into Öxará, the river that runs off the heath into the Thingvellir lake, and looked up guiltily as we passed. I’m not sure what they felt bad about—throwing stones in the river was surely the most natural thing to do.  On my last night, I barely slept. The Saturday night street noise was too much, and my thoughts were taken with the ever-apart Iceland, and with the anticipation of my returning to Brisbane the next day. Reykjavík the party town certainly hadn’t changed with the financial crisis, and nor had my mixed feelings about living so far away. The broken glass and obscenities of a night out didn’t ease until 5am, when it was time for me to board the Flybus to Keflavík Airport. I made my way through the screams and drunken stumblers, and into the quiet of the dark bus, where, in the back, I could just make out the five Dutchmen who, the day before, Kári and I had seen at Thingvellir, and who were now fast asleep and emitting a perfume of vodka and tobacco smoke that made it all the way to the front.  It had all seemed too familiar not to be true—the relentless Icelandic optimism around its independence, the sense that it would always be an up-and-down sort of a place anyway, and the jagged volcanoes and lava fields that formed the distant shadows of the half-hour drive to the airport. The people, like the landscape, were fixed on separation, and I doubted that the difficulties with Europe would force them in any other direction.  And I, too, was on my way back, as uncertain as ever about Iceland and my place in it. I returned to the clinging heat and my own separation from home, which, as before, I also recognized as my homecoming to Brisbane. Isn’t that in the nature of split affinities, to always be nearly there but never quite there?  In the weeks since my return, the Icelanders have voted by referendum to reject the deal made for the repayment of the Icesave debts, and a fresh round of negotiations with the British and Dutch governments begins. For the time being, Iceland retains its right to independence, at least as expressed by the right to sidestep the consequences of its unhappy raids into Europe. Pinning down the Devil, it seems, is just as hard as ever.","",""
"2010","Learning to do Action Research for Social Change","Action research provides an alternative approach to bringing about changes in knowledge, policy, and practice. But to be effective and inclusive, taking into account complex dynamics of power and participation, action research requires capable facilitators with particular skills—such as the ability to give attention to personal and collective processes of reflection and action. This article explores the challenges of learning to do this kind of action research that are faced by practitioners and activists working for social change in diverse contexts around the world. The article reviews these challenges, offering insights and lessons from an innovative new master’s degree program called the MA in Participation, Power and Social Change, which uses action research and reflective practice as the basis of its approach to learning. Conventional views of policymaking usually see “research” as a specialized activity which makes objective data and analysis available to rational decision-makers, with the assumption that good knowledge will lead to better policies, and from there, to improved practices and outcomes. Action research, broadly defined, starts with a very different view of what knowledge is, where it comes from, and how it contributes to change. Most action research approaches involve a range of actors throughout the inquiry process—shaping the questions to be asked, gathering and analyzing different kinds of “data,” reflecting on experiences and assumptions, and experimenting with new kinds of action. Knowledge, policy, and practice are co-created through an emergent process of action and learning, often including some form of critical reflection and reappraisal of the norms, values, and assumptions by which we make sense of things, as well as an understanding of how these are shaped by power. In a world in which the challenges we face are increasingly complex and inter-related, and where universal solutions appear to have reached their limits, action research can lead to more context-sensitive, adaptive, and innovative understandings and responses. Action research provides a way of representing the perspectives and subjectivities of diverse actors (including those leading the research process) in all their complexity. It can highlight differences, commonalities, and underlying assumptions, rather than assuming that there is a singular, “objective” version of things. Those who facilitate action research try to take dynamics of power into account to ensure that the concerns and forms of knowledge held by less powerful people are not excluded—and that these people can mobilize their knowledge to effect change.","",""

Data were collected from three graduate classes over a two–month period at an American university in the southwest.  Besides linguistic ability, other factors, such as goal orientation and sense of self in classroom discussion, were also identified as emergent themes in international students’ experiences. The results indicate the mediating power of classroom instructors and classmates as the participants negotiated their way through the learning experience. Additionally, the instructors and classmates served as mirrors, reflecting an image to the international students regarding their roles and who they are as participants in the seminar classroom.","",""

"2017","Between North-South Civil War and East-West Manifest Destiny: Herman Melville’s “I and My Chimney” as Geo-Historical Allegory","Literary critics have mainly read Herman Melville’s short story “I and My Chimney” (1856) as allegory. This article elaborates on the tradition of interpreting Melville’s text allegorically by relating it to Fredric Jameson’s post-structural reinterpretation of allegory. In doing so, it argues that the story is not a simple example of allegory but rather an auto-reflexive engagement with allegory that reflects the cultural and historical ambivalences of the time in which Melville was writing. The suggestion is that Melville deliberately used signifiers (or the lack thereof) of directionality and place to reframe the overt context of his allegory (Civil War divisions of North and South) through teasing reference to the contemporaneous emergence of Manifest Destiny as an East-West historical spatialization. To this extent, from a literary-historical perspective, Melville’s text presents as an enquiry into the relationship between the obvious allegorical elements of a text and the literal or material elements that may either support or, as in this case, problematize traditional allegorical modes. In some ways, Melville’s story faintly anticipates Jameson’s post-structural theory of allegory as produced over a century later. “I and My Chimney” may also be linked to later texts, such as Jack Kerouac’s On the Road, which shift the directionality of American Literary History, in a definite way, from a North-South to an East-West axis. Laura Ingalls Wilder’s Little House books may also be mentioned here. While, in recent years, some literary critics have produced readings of Melville’s story that depart from the traditional emphasis on its allegorical nature, this article claims to be the first to engage with “I and My Chimney” from within an allegorical perspective also informed by post-structural thinking. To do this, it focuses on the setting or directionality of the story, and on the orientating details of the titular chimney.Written and published shortly before the outbreak of the American Civil War (1861-1865), which pitted North against South, Melville’s story is told in the first person by a narrator with overweening affection for the chimney he sees as an image of himself: “I and my chimney, two gray-headed old smokers, reside in the country. We are, I may say, old settlers here; particularly my old chimney, which settles more and more every day” (327). Within the merged identity of narrator and chimney, however, the latter takes precedence, almost completely, over the former: “though I always say, I and my chimney, as Cardinal Wolsey used to say, I and my King, yet this egotistic way of speaking, wherein I take precedence of my chimney, is hardly borne out by the facts; in everything, except the above phrase, my chimney taking precedence of me” (327). Immediately, this sentence underscores a disjunction between words (“the above phrase”) and material circumstances (“the facts”) that will become crucial in my later consideration of Melville’s story as post-structural allegory.Detailed architectural and architectonic descriptions manifesting the chimney as “the one great domineering object” of the narrator’s house characterize the opening pages of the story (328). Intermingled with these descriptions, the narrator recounts the various interpersonal and business-related stratagems he has been forced to adopt in order to protect his chimney from the “Northern influences” that would threaten it. Numbered in this company are his mortgagee, the narrator’s own wife and daughters, and Mr. Hiram Scribe—“a rough sort of architect” (341). The key subplot implicated with the narrator’s fears for his chimney concerns its provenance. The narrator’s “late kinsman, Captain Julian Dacres” built the house, along with its stupendous chimney, and upon his death a rumour developed concerning supposed “concealed treasure” in the chimney (346). Once the architect Scribe insinuates, in correspondence to the chimney’s alter ego (the narrator), “that there is architectural cause to conjecture that somewhere concealed in your chimney is a reserved space, hermetically closed, in short, a secret chamber, or rather closet” the narrator’s wife and daughter use Scribe’s suggestion of a possible connection to Dacres’s alleged hidden treasure to reiterate their calls for the chimney’s destruction (345):Although they had never before dreamed of such a revelation as Mr. Scribe’s, yet upon the first suggestion they instinctively saw the extreme likelihood of it. In corroboration, they cited first my kinsman, and second, my chimney; alleging that the profound mystery involving the former, and the equally profound masonry involving the latter, though both acknowledged facts, were alike preposterous on any other supposition than the secret closet. (347)To protect his chimney, the narrator bribes Mr. Scribe, inviting him to produce a “‘little certificate—something, say, like a steam-boat certificate, certifying that you, a competent surveyor, have surveyed my chimney, and found no reason to believe any unsoundness; in short, any—any secret closet in it’” (351). Having enticed Scribe to scribe words against himself, the narrator concludes his tale triumphantly: “I am simply standing guard over my mossy old chimney; for it is resolved between me and my chimney, that I and my chimney will never surrender” (354).Despite its inherent interest, literary critics have largely overlooked “I and My Chimney”. Katja Kanzler observes that “together with much of [Melville’s] other short fiction, and his uncollected magazine pieces in particular, it has never really come out of the shadow of the more epic texts long considered his masterpieces” (583). To the extent that critics have engaged the story, they have mainly read it as traditional allegory (Chatfield; Emery; Sealts; Sowder). Further, the allegorical trend in the reception of Melville’s text clusters within the period from the early 1940s to the early 1980s. More recently, other critics have explored new ways of reading Melville’s story, but none, to my knowledge, have re-investigated its dominant allegorical mode of reception in the light of the post-structural engagements with allegory captured succinctly in Fredric Jameson’s work (Allison; Kanzler; Wilson). This article acknowledges the perspicacity of the mid-twentieth-century tradition of the allegorical interpretation of Melville’s story, while nuancing its insights through greater attention to the spatialized materiality of the text, its “geomorphic” nature, and its broader historical contexts.E. Hale Chatfield argues that “I and My Chimney” evidences one broad allegorical polarity of “Aristocratic Tradition vs. Innovation and Destruction” (164). This umbrella category is parsed by Sealts as an individualized allegory of besieged patriarchal identity and by Sowder as a national-level allegory of anxieties linked to the antebellum North-South relationship. Chatfield’s opposition works equally well for an individual or for communities of individuals. Thus, in this view, even as it structures our reception of Melville’s story, allegory remains unproblematized in itself through its internal interlocking. In turn, “I and My Chimney” provides fertile soil for critics to harvest an allegorical crop. Its very title inveigles the reader towards an allegorical attitude: the upstanding “I” of the title is associated with the architecture of the chimney, itself also upstanding. What is of the chimney is also, allegorically, of the “I”, and the vertical chimney, like the letter “I”, argues, as it were, a north-south axis, being “swung vertical to hit the meridian moon,” as Melville writes on his story’s first page (327). The narrator, or “I”, is as north-south as is his narrated allegory.Herman Melville was a Northern resident with Southern predilections, at least to the extent that he co-opted “Southern-ness” to, in Katja Kanzler’s words, “articulate the anxiety of mid-nineteenth-century cultural elites about what they perceive as a cultural decline” (583). As Chatfield notes, the South stood for “Aristocratic Tradition”; the North, for “Innovation and Destruction” (164). Reflecting the conventional mid-twentieth-century view that “I and My Chimney” is a guileless allegory of North-South relations, William J. Sowder argues that itreveals allegorically an accurate history of Southern slavery from the latter part of the eighteenth century to the middle of the nineteenth—that critical period when the South spent most of its time and energy apologizing for the existence of slavery. It discloses the split which Northern liberals so ably effected between liberal and conservative forces in the South, and it lays bare the intransigence of the traditional South on the Negro question. Above everything, the story reveals that the South had little in common with the rest of the Union: the War between the States was inevitable. (129-30)Sowder goes into painstaking detail prosecuting his North-South allegorical reading of Melville’s text, to the extent of finding multiple correspondences between what is allegorizing and what is being allegorized within a single sentence. One example, with Sowder’s allegorical interpolations in square brackets, comes from a passage where Melville is writing about his narrator’s replaced “gable roof” (Melville 331): “‘it was replaced with a modern roof [the cotton gin], more fit for a railway woodhouse [an industrial society] than an old country gentleman’s abode’” (Sowder 137).Sowder’s argument is historically erudite, and utterly convincing overall, except in one crucial detail. That is, for a text supposedly so much about the South, and written so much from its perspective—Sowder labels the narrator a “bitter Old Southerner”—it is remarkable how the story is only very ambiguously set in the South (145). Sowder distances himself from an earlier generation of commentators who “generally assumed that the old man is Melville and that the country is the foothills of the Massachusetts Berkshires, where Melville lived from 1850 to 1863,” concluding, “in fact, I find it hard to picture the narrator as a Northerner at all: the country which he describes sounds too much like the Land of Cotton” (130).Quite obviously, the narrator of any literary text does not necessarily represent its author, and in the case of “I and My Chimney”, if the narrator is not inevitably coincident with the author, then it follows that the setting of the story is not necessarily coincident with “the foothills of the Massachusetts Berkshires.” That said, the position of critics prior to Sowder that the setting is Massachusetts, and by extension that the narrator is Melville (a Southern sympathizer displaced to the North), hints at an oversight in the traditional allegorical reading of Melville’s text—related to its spatializations—the implications of which Sowder misses.Think about it: “too much like the Land of Cotton” is an exceedingly odd phrase; “too much like” the South, but not conclusively like the South (Sowder 130)! A key characteristic of Melville’s story is the ambiguity of its setting and, by extension, of its directionality. For the text to operate (following Chatfield, Emery, Sealts and Sowder) as a straightforward allegory of the American North-South relationship, the terms “north” and “south” cannot afford to be problematized. Even so, whereas so much in the story reads as related to either the South or the North, as cultural locations, the notions of “south-ness” and “north-ness” themselves are made friable (in this article, the lower case broadly indicates the material domain, the upper case, the cultural). At its most fundamental allegorical level, the story undoes its own allegorical expressions; as I will be arguing, the materiality of its directionality deconstructs what everything else in the text strives (allegorically) to maintain.Remarkably, for a text purporting to allegorize the North as the South’s polar opposite, nowhere does the story definitively indicate where it is set. The absence of place names or other textual features which might place “I and My Chimney” in the South, is over-compensated for by an abundance of geographically distracting signifiers of “place-ness” that negatively emphasize the circumstance that the story is not set definitively where it is set suggestively. The narrator muses at one point that “in fact, I’ve often thought that the proper place for my old chimney is ivied old England” (332). Elsewhere, further destabilizing the geographical coordinates of the text, reference is made to “the garden of Versailles” (329). Again, the architect Hiram Scribe’s house is named New Petra. Rich as it is with cultural resonances, at base, Petra denominates a city in Jordan; New Petra, by contrast, is place-less.It would appear that something strange is going on with allegory in this deceptively straightforward allegory, and that this strangeness is linked to equally strange goings on with the geographical and directional relations of north and south, as sites of the historical and cultural American North and South that the story allegorizes so assiduously. As tensions between North and South would shortly lead to the Civil War, Melville writes an allegorical text clearly about these tensions, while simultaneously deconstructing the allegorical index of geographical north to cultural North and of geographical south to cultural South.Fredric Jameson’s work on allegory scaffolds the historically and materially nuanced reading I am proposing of “I and My Chimney”. Jameson writes:Our traditional conception of allegory—based, for instance, on stereotypes of Bunyan—is that of an elaborate set of figures and personifications to be read against some one-to-one table of equivalences: this is, so to speak, a one-dimensional view of this signifying process, which might only be set in motion and complexified were we willing to entertain the more alarming notion that such equivalences are themselves in constant change and transformation at each perpetual present of the text. (73)As American history undergoes transformation, Melville foreshadows Jameson’s transformation of allegory through his (Melville’s) own transformations of directionality and place. In a story about North and South, are we in the south or the north? Allegorical “equivalences are themselves in constant change and transformation at each perpetual present of the text” (Jameson 73). North-north equivalences falter; South-south equivalences falter.As noted above, the chimney of Melville’s story—“swung vertical to hit the meridian moon”—insists upon a north-south axis, much as, in an allegorical mode, the vertical “I” of the narrator structures a polarity of north and south (327). However, a closer reading shows that the chimney is no less complicit in the confusion of north and south than the environs of the house it occupies:In those houses which are strictly double houses—that is, where the hall is in the middle—the fire-places usually are on opposite sides; so that while one member of the household is warming himself at a fire built into a recess of the north wall, say another member, the former’s own brother, perhaps, may be holding his feet to the blaze before a hearth in the south wall—the two thus fairly sitting back to back. Is this well? (328)Here, Melville is directly allegorizing the “sulky” state of the American nation; the brothers are, as it were, North and South (328). However, just as the text’s signifiers of place problematize the notions of north and south (and thus the associated cultural resonances of capitalized North and South), this passage, in queering the axes of the chimneys, further upsets the primary allegory. The same chimney that structures Melville’s text along a north-south or up-down orientation, now defers to an east-west axis, for the back-to-back and (in cultural and allegorical terms) North-South brothers, sit at a 90-degree angle to their house’s chimneys, which thus logically manifest a cross-wise orientation of east-west (in cultural and allegorical terms, East-West). To this extent, there is something of an exquisite crossover and confusion of cultural North and South, as represented by the two brothers, and geographical/architectural/architectonic north and south (now vacillating between an east-west and a north-south orientation). The North-South cultural relationship of the brothers distorts the allegorical force of the narrator’s spine-like chimney (not to mention of the brother’s respective chimneys), thus enflaming Jameson’s allegorical equivalences. The promiscuous literality of the smokestack—Katja Kanzler notes the “astonishing materiality” of the chimney—subverts its main allegorical function; directionality both supports and disrupts allegory (591). Simply put, there is a disjunction between words and material circumstances; the “way of speaking… is hardly borne out by the facts” (Melville 327).The not unjustified critical focus on “I and My Chimney” as an allegory of North-South cultural (and shortly wartime) tensions, has not kept up with post-structural developments in allegorical theory as represented in Fredric Jameson’s work. In part, I suggest, this is because critics to date have missed the importance to Melville’s allegory of its extra-textual context. According to William J. Sowder, “Melville showed a lively interest in such contemporary social events as the gold rush, the French Revolution of 1848, and the activities of the English Chartists” (129). The pity is that readings of “I and My Chimney” have limited this “lively interest” to the Civil War. Melville’s attentiveness to “contemporary social events” should also encompass, I suggest, the East-West (east-west) dynamic of mid-nineteenth century American history, as much as the North-South (north-south) dynamic.The redialing of Melville’s allegory along another directional axis is thus accounted for. When “I and My Chimney” was published in 1856, there was, of course, at least one other major historical development in play besides the prospect of the Civil War, and the doctrine of Manifest Destiny ran, not to put it too finely, along an East-West (east-west) axis. Indeed, Manifest Destiny is at least as replete with a directional emphasis as the discourse of Civil War North-South opposition. As quoted in Frederick Merk’s Manifest Destiny and Mission in American History, Senator Daniel S. Dickinson states to the Senate, in 1848, “but the tide of emigration and the course of empire have since been westward” (Merk 29). Allied to this tradition, of course, is the well-known contemporaneous saying, “go West, young man, go West” (“Go West, Young Man”).To the extent that Melville’s text appears to anticipate Jameson’s post-structural theory of allegory, it may be linked, I suggest, to Melville’s sense of being at an intersection of American history. The meta-narrative of national history when “I and My Chimney” was produced had a spatial dimension to it: north-south directionality (culturally, North-South) was giving way to east-west directionality (culturally, East-West). Civil War would soon give way to Manifest Destiny; just as Melville’s texts themselves would, much later admittedly, give way to texts of Manifest Destiny in all its forms, including Jack Kerouac’s On the Road and Laura Ingalls Wilder’s Little House series. Equivalently, as much as the narrator’s wife represents Northern “progress” she might also be taken to signify Western “ambition”.However, it is not only that “I and My Chimney” is a switching-point text of geo-history (mediating relations, most obviously, between the tendencies of Southern Exceptionalism and of Western National Ambition) but that it operates as a potentially generalizable test case of the limits of allegory by setting up an all-too-simple allegory of North-South/north-south relations which is subsequently subtly problematized along the lines of East-West/east-west directionality. As I have argued, Melville’s “experimental allegory” continually diverts words (that is, the symbols allegory relies upon) through the turbulence of material circumstances.North, or north, is simultaneously a cultural and a geographical or directional coordinate of Melville’s text, and the chimney of “I and My Chimney” is both a signifier of the difference between N/north and S/south and also a portal to a 360-degrees all-encompassing engagement of (allegorical) writing with history in all its (spatialized) manifestations.ReferencesAllison, J. “Conservative Architecture: Hawthorne in Melville’s ‘I and My Chimney.’” South Central Review 13.1 (1996): 17-25.Chatfield, E.H. “Levels of Meaning in Melville’s ‘I and My Chimney.’” American Imago 19.2 (1962): 163-69.Emery, A.M. “The Political Significance of Melville’s Chimney.” The New England Quarterly 55.2 (1982): 201-28.“Go West, Young Man.” Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia 29 Sep. 2017. &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_West,_young_man&gt;.Jameson, F. “Third-World Literature in the Era of Multinational Capitalism.” Social Text 15 (1986): 65-88.Kanzler, K. “Architecture, Writing, and Vulnerable Signification in Herman Melville’s ‘I and My Chimney.’” American Studies 54.4 (2009): 583-601.Kerouac, J.

I became very friendly with one of the other fellows, Stevan Dedijer, a Serbian physicist who had, through a complicated history, became a sociologist of science policy, and who was at the time, and from then until his retirement, a professor of science policy at the University of Lund in Sweden. Steve had had considerable experience in radical politics in the United States; after finishing a Ph. D. in physics in the early Thirties he had edited a Communist Serbian language newspaper for steelworkers in Pittsburgh. He fought in WWII as a member of the U.S. 101st Airborne Division, and returned to Yugoslavia after the war, where he was head of the Belgrade Nuclear Institute. After the fall of Milovan Djilas, with whom his brother Vladimir had been closely associated, he found it expedient to leave Yugoslavia, and moved to Sweden and his new career as a sociologist of science.","",""

How do we account for the emergence, withdrawal, and stuttering attempted returns of Nuit Debout? Nuit Debout needs to be analyzed, and yet its existence confounds analysis. Its operational tactic (intense actions while up all night, then dispersal) defies usual characterization as a social movement. This was compounded by its overall timeline: a rapid upsurge followed by stunning disappearance. What conceptual tools do we have to make sense of the milieu out of which Nuit Debout emerged? And what do media ecologies have to do with it? This article undertakes such an analysis by developing a theoretical framework around social bodies, compositionism, and social reproduction. It draws from autonomist social theory to address what is, or was, Nuit Debout.","",""

It has long been argued that Brian O’Nolan, operating under the pseudonym of Flann O’Brien, is a disciple of James Joyce. This relationship remains a concern for scholars, and so our purpose here is to contribute some computational evidence to the discussion.

"2019","Out of Time: Time-Travel Tropes Write (through) Climate Change","“What is the point of stories in such a moment”, asks author and critic James Bradley, writing about climate extinction: Bradley emphasises that “climatologist James Hansen once said being a climate scientist was like screaming at people from behind a soundproof glass wall; being a writer concerned with these questions often feels frighteningly similar” (“Writing”). If the impact of climate change asks humans to think differently, to imagine differently, then surely writing—and reading—must change too? According to writer and geographer Samuel Miller-McDonald, “if you’re a writer, then you have to write about this”. But how are we to do that? Where might it be done already? Perhaps not in traditional (or even post-) Modernist modes. In the era of the Anthropocene I find myself turning to non-traditional, un-real models to write the slow violence and read the deep time that is where we can see our current climate catastrophe.At a “Writing in the Age of Extinction” workshop earlier this year Bradley and Jane Rawson advocated changing the language of “climate change”—rejecting such neutral terms—in the same way that I see the stories discussed here pushing against Modernity’s great narrative of progress.My research—as a reader and writer, is in the fantastic realm of speculative fiction; I have written in The Conversation about how this genre seems to be gaining literary popularity. There is no doubt that our current climate crisis has a part to play. As Margaret Atwood writes: “it’s not climate change, it’s everything change” (“Climate”). This “everything” must include literature. Kim Stanley Robinson is not the only one who sees “the models modern literary fiction has are so depleted, what they’re turning to now is our guys in disguise”. I am interested in two recent examples, which both use the strongly genre-associated time-travel trope, to consider how science-fiction concepts might work to re-imagine our “deranged” world (Ghosh), whether applied by genre writers or “our guys in disguise”. Can stories such as The Heavens by Sandra Newman and “Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom” by Ted Chiang—which apply time travel, whether as an expression of fatalism or free will—help us conceive the current collapse: understand how it has come to pass, and imagine ways we might move through it?The Popularity of Time TravelIt seems to me that time as a notion and the narrative device, is key to any idea of writing through climate change. “Through” as in via, if the highly contested “cli-fi” category is considered a theme; and “through” as entering into and coming out the other side of this ecological end-game. Might time travel offer readers more than the realist perspective of sweeping multi-generational sagas? Time-travel books pose puzzles; they are well suited to “wicked” problems. Time-travel tales are designed to analyse the world in a way that it is not usually analysed—in accordance with Tim Parks’s criterion for great novels (Walton), and in keeping with Darko Suvin’s conception of science fiction as a literature of “cognitive estrangement”. To read, and write, a character who travels in “spacetime” asks something more of us than the emotional engagement of many Modernist tales of interiority—whether they belong to the new “literary middlebrow’” (Driscoll), or China Miéville’s Booker Prize–winning realist “litfic” (Crown).Sometimes, it is true, they ask too much, and do not answer enough. But what resolution is possible is realistic, in the context of this literally existential threat?There are many recent and recommended time-travel novels: Kate Atkinson’s 2013 Life after Life and Jenny Erpenbeck’s 2014 End of Days have main characters who are continually “reset”, exploring the idea of righting history—the more literary experiment concluding less optimistically. For Erpenbeck “only the inevitable is possible”. In her New York Times review Francine Prose likens Life after Life to writing itself: “Atkinson sharpens our awareness of the apparently limitless choices and decisions that a novelist must make on every page, and of what is gained and lost when the consequences of these choices are, like life, singular and final”. Andrew Sean Greer’s 2013 The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells also centres on the WorldWar(s), a natural-enough site to imagine divergent timelines, though he draws a different parallel. In Elan Mastai’s 2017 debut All Our Wrong Todays the reality that is remembered—though ultimately not missed, is more dystopic than our own time, as is also the way with Joyce Carol Oates’s 2018 The Hazards of Time Travel. Oates’s rather slight contribution to the subgenre still makes a clear point: “America is founded upon amnesia” (Oates, Hazards). So, too, is our current environment. We are living in a time created by a previous generation; the environmental consequence of our own actions will not be felt until after we are gone. What better way to write such a riddle than through the loop of time travel?The Purpose of Thought ExperimentsThis list is not meant to be comprehensive. It is an indication of the increasing literary application of the “elaborate thought experiment” of time travel (Oates, “Science Fiction”). These fictional explorations, their political and philosophical considerations, are currently popular and potentially productive in a context where action is essential, and yet practically impossible. What can I do? What could possibly be the point? As well as characters that travel backwards, or forwards in time, these titles introduce visionaries who tell of other worlds. They re-present “not-exactly places, which are anywhere but nowhere, and which are both mappable locations and states of mind”: Margaret Atwood’s “Ustopias” (Atwood, “Road”). Incorporating both utopian and dystopian aspects, they (re)present our own time, in all its contradictory (un)reality.The once-novel, now-generic “novum” of time travel has become a metaphor—the best possible metaphor, I believe, for the climatic consequence of our in/action—in line with Joanna Russ’s wonderful conception of “The Wearing out of Genre Materials”. The new marvel first introduced by popular writers has been assimilated, adopted or “stolen” by the dominant mode. In this case, literary fiction. Angela Carter is not the only one to hope “the pressure of the new wine makes the old bottles explode”. This must be what Robinson expects: that Ken Gelder’s “big L” literature will be unable to contain the wine of “our guys”—even if it isn’t new. In the act of re-use, the time-travel cliché is remade anew.Two Cases to ConsiderTwo texts today seem to me to realise—in both senses of that word—the possibilities of the currently popular, but actually ancient, time-travel conceit. At the Melbourne Writers Festival last year Ted Chiang identified the oracle in The Odyssey as the first time traveller: they—the blind prophet Tiresias was transformed into a woman for seven years—have seen the future and report back in the form of prophecy. Chiang’s most recent short story, “Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom”, and Newman’s novel The Heavens, both of which came out this year, are original variations on this re-newed theme. Rather than a coherent, consistent, central character who travels and returns to their own time, these stories’ protagonists appear diversified in/between alternate worlds. These texts provide readers not with only one possible alternative but—via their creative application of the idea of temporal divergence—myriad alternatives within the same story. These works use the “characteristic gesture” of science fiction (Le Guin, “Le Guin Talks”), to inspire different, subversive, ways of thinking and seeing our own one-world experiment. The existential speculation of time-travel tropes is, today, more relevant than ever: how should we act when our actions may have no—or no positive, only negative—effect?Time and space travel are classic science fiction concerns. Chiang’s lecture unpacked how the philosophy of time travel speaks uniquely to questions of free will. A number of his stories explore this theme, including “The Alchemist’s Gate” (which the lecture was named after), where he makes his thinking clear: “past and future are the same, and we cannot change either, only know them more fully” (Chiang, Exhalation). In “Story of Your Life”, the novella that the film Arrival is based on, Chiang’s main character-narrator embraces a future that could be seen as dystopic while her partner walks away from it—and her, and his daughter—despite the happiness they will offer. Gary cannot accept the inevitable unhappiness that must accompany them. The suggestion is that if he had had Louise’s foreknowledge he might, like the free-willing protagonist in Looper, have taken steps to ensure that that life—that his daughter’s life itself—never eventuated. Whether he would have been successful is suspect: according to Chiang free will cannot foil fate.If the future cannot be changed, what is the role of free will? Louise wonders: “what if the experience of knowing the future changed a person? What if it evoked a sense of urgency, a sense of obligation to act precisely as she knew she would?” In his “story notes” Chiang says inspiration came from variational principles in physics (Chiang, Stories); I see the influence of climate calamity. Knowing the future must change us—how can it not evoke “a sense of urgency, a sense of obligation”? Even if events play out precisely as we know they will. In his talk Chiang differentiated between time-travel films which favour free will, like Looper, and those that conclude fatalistically, such as Twelve Monkeys. “Story of Your Life” explores the idea that these categories are not mutually exclusive: exercising free will might not change fate; fatalism may not preclude acts of free will.Utopic Free Will vs. Dystopic Fate?Newman’s latest novel is more obviously dystopic: the world in The Heavens is worse each time Kate wakes from her dreams of the past. In the end it has become positively post-apocalyptic. The overwhelming sadness of this book is one of its most unusual aspects, going far beyond that of The Time Traveler’s Wife—2003’s popular tale of love and loss. The Heavens feels fatalistic, even though its future is—unfortunately, in this instance—not set but continually altered by the main character’s attempts to “fix” it (in each sense of the word). Where Twelve Monkeys, Looper, and The Odyssey present every action as a foregone conclusion, The Heavens navigates the nightmare that—against our will—everything we do might have an adverse consequence. As in A Christmas Carol, where the vision of a possible future prompts the protagonist to change his ways and so prevent its coming to pass, it is Kate’s foresight—of our future—which inspires her to act. History doesn’t respond well to Kate’s interventions; she is unable to “correct” events and left more and more isolated by her own unique version of a tortuous Cassandra complex.These largely inexplicable consequences provide a direct connection between Newman’s latest work and James Tiptree Jr.’s 1972 “Forever to a Hudson Bay Blanket”. That tale’s conclusion makes no “real” sense either—when Dovy dies Loolie’s father’s advisers can only say that (time) paradoxes are proliferating—but The Heavens is not the intellectual play of Tiptree’s classic science fiction: the wine of time-travel has been poured into the “depleted” vessel of “big L” literature. The sorrow that seeps through this novel is profound; Newman apologises for it in her acknowledgements, linking it to the death of an ex-partner. I read it as a potent expression of “solastalgia”: nostalgia for a place that once provided solace, but doesn’t any more—a term coined by Australian philosopher Glen Albrecht to express the “psychic or existential distress caused by environmental change” (Albrecht et al.). It is Kate’s grief, for a world (she has) destroyed that drives her mad: “deranged”.The Serious Side of SpeculationIn The Great Derangement Ghosh laments the “smaller shadow” cast by climate change in the landscape of literary fiction. He echoes Miéville: “fiction that deals with climate change is almost by definition not the kind that is taken seriously by serious literary journals; the mere mention of the subject is often enough to relegate a novel or short story to the genre of science fiction” (Ghosh). Time-travel tales that pose the kind of questions handled by theologians before the Enlightenment and “big L” literature after—what does it mean to exist in time? How should we live? Who deserves to be happy?—may be a way for literary fiction to take climate change “seriously”: to write through it. Out-of-time narratives such as Chiang and Newman’s pose existential speculations that, rather than locating us in time, may help us imagine time itself differently. How are we to act if the future has already come to pass?“When we are faced with a world whose problems all seem ‘wicked’ and intractable, what is it that fiction can do?” (Uhlmann). At the very least, should writers not be working with “sombre realism”? Science fiction has a long and established tradition of exposing the background narratives of the political—and ecological—landscapes in which we work: the master narratives of Modernism. What Anthony Uhlmann describes here, as the “distancing technique” of fiction becomes outright “estrangement” in speculative hands. Stories such as Newman and Chiang’s reflect (on) what readers might be avoiding: that even though our future is fixed, we must act. We must behave as though our decisions matter, despite knowing the ways in which they do not.These works challenge Modernist concerns despite—or perhaps via—satisfying genre conventions, in direct contradiction to Roy Scranton’s conviction that “Narrative in the Anthropocene Is the Enemy”. In doing so they fit Miéville’s description of a “literature of estrangement” while also exemplifying a new, Anthropocene “literature of recognition” (Crown). These, then, are the stories of our life.What Is Not ExpectedChiang’s 2018 lecture was actually a PowerPoint presentation on how time travel could or would “really” work. His medium, as much as his message, clearly showed the author’s cross-disciplinary affiliations, which are relevant to this discussion of literary fiction’s “depleted” models. In August this year Xu Xi concluded a lecture on speculative fiction for the Vermont College of Fine Arts by encouraging attendees to read—and write—“other” languages, whether foreign forms or alien disciplines. She cited Chiang as someone who successfully raids the riches of non-literary traditions, to produce a new kind of literature. Writing that deals in physics, as much as characters, in philosophy, as much as narrative, presents new, “post-natural” (Bradley, “End”) retro-speculations that (in un- and super-natural generic traditions) offer a real alternative to Modernism’s narrative of inevitable—and inevitably positive—progress.In “What’s Expected of Us” Chiang imagines the possible consequence of comprehending that our actions, and not just their consequence, are predetermined. In what Oates describes as his distinctive, pared-back, “unironic” style (Oates, “Science Fiction”), Chiang concludes: “reality isn’t important: what’s important is your belief, and believing the lie is the only way to avoid a waking coma. Civilisation now depends on self-deception. Perhaps it always has”. The self-deception we need is not America’s amnesia, but the belief that what we do matters.ConclusionThe visions of her “paraself” that Nat sees in “Anxiety Is the Dizziness of Freedom” encourage her to change her behaviour. The “prism” that enables this perception—a kind of time-tripped iPad that “skypes” alternate temporal realities, activated by people acting in different ways at a crucial moment in their lives—does not always reflect the butterfly effect the protagonist, or reader, might expect. Some actions have dramatic consequences while others have minimal impact. While Nat does not see her future, what she spies inspires her to take the first steps towards becoming a different—read “better”—person. We expect this will lead to more positive outcomes for her self in the story’s “first” world. The device, and Chiang’s tale, illustrates both that our paths are predetermined and that they are not: “our inability to predict the consequences of our own predetermined actions offers a kind of freedom”. The freedom to act, freedom from the coma of inaction.“What’s the use of art on a dying planet? What’s the point, when humanity itself is facing an existential threat?” Alison Croggon asks, and answers herself: “it searches for the complex truth … . It can help us to see the world we have more clearly, and help us to imagine a better one”. In literary thought experiments like Newman and Chiang’s artful time-travel fictions we read complex, metaphoric truths that cannot be put into real(ist) words. In the time-honoured tradition of (speculative) fiction, Chiang and Newman deal in, and with, “what cannot be said in words … in words” (Le Guin, “Introduction”). These most recent time-slip speculations tell unpredictable stories about what is predicted, what is predictable, but what we must (still) believe may not necessarily be—if we are to be free.ReferencesArrival.

"2019","Innovation’s fairylands","In one of those this-is-water intellectual blindspots, it is both surprising and completely expected that we should have had to wait until the mid-2010s for a thorough, critical history of the concept of “innovation” to be published. Innovation has been an infrastructural substrate of the modern Western economy, reshaping fundamentals of society with a speed and effectiveness that is frankly shocking. How did we get here? Innovation scholars, it appears, have been happy to one-up each other in the theory-making game, laying out new optimistic rules for what might be called How Should an Innovation Be, but an exploration of how the cargo cult of innovation came to be has been missing until now. Benoit Godin, a Professor at the Institut national de la recherches scientifique in Montreal, Quebec, has led the “Science, Technology, and Innovation: Intellectual and conceptual histories” project since the early 2000s. In 2015, he published an English-language collection of his papers as Innovation Contested: The Idea of Innovation Over the Centuries. This work traces the intellectual history of the concept of innovation, reaching as far back as the ancient Greek word kainotomia, meaning “cutting fresh into; cutting new mines” (p. 19). As this temporal breadth might suggest Godin is interested in the study of innovation as a “synthetic concept” that evolves over a literal millennia across multiple fields: ancient 797088 NMS0010.1177/1461444818797088new media & societyBook Review Essay book-review2018","",""

However, research findings about the performance of such teams appear to be inconsistent, calling for more research to investigate the conditions under which distributed agile teams may thrive. Given that task coordination is particularly challenging when team members are not co-located, the present study investigates the roles of the two types of task interdependence, i.e., initiated versus received task interdependence. Survey results from 191 participants working in distributed agile teams within three companies in Norway confirm our hypotheses. Specifically, we show that high initiated task interdependence is associated with higher role clarity of others, while received task interdependence is associated with higher role clarity of self, and that both subsequently result in higher team performance in distributed agile teams. Thus, we argue that each type of task interdependence contributes in a unique way to team performance in distributed agile teams.","",""

"2024","Fertile Ground in Hostile Lands","In this article, I will examine screenwriter Alex Garland's approach to world-building, with a particular focus on his screenplays Sunshine and Annihilation, exploring how Garland writes thematically for ‘genre’ stories and reflecting on the evolution of his world-building in his writing for film and television. The phrase ‘world-building’ conjures up images of physical settings and tangible places, but in a literary sense compelling world-building requires that a writer master their craft to create a landing for their readers in surprising new emotional and thematic spaces. Richard argues that world-building allows writers to explore themes and ideas, while writer Rebecca F. Kuang states that world-building can be a “refracting prism to exaggerate, re-interpret, and interrogate particular elements” (Adeniyi 121) which the writer wants to explore, or metaphorise. Screenwriter and showrunner Javier Grillo-Marxuach argues that a unifying concept or question sits at the heart of world-building, utilising tropes to build a new milieu or genre. Garland writes intellectual ‘genre’ screenplays across an eclectic range of milieux, whether he is reviving the zombie-horror subgenre in 28 Days Later (Garland), exploring deep space in the hard science-fiction film Sunshine (Garland), or the “drug-fuelled, ultra-violent” (Fennessey, 00:01:45) cyberpunk feature Dredd (Garland &amp; Jock). “There's always a sense of trying to avoid what you just did and move against what you just did” (Fennessey, 00:02:01). Garland’s reactivity to his output informs his ever-changing choice of genre, but his screenplays also have commonality through the perspective of the adventure protagonist ur-genre (Edgar). The dramatic need of the protagonist in 28 Days Later is to save his surrogate family in post-apocolyptic Britain; the protagonist's goal in Sunshine is to save life on Earth by embarking on a journey to the Sun aboard the spacecraft Icarus 2; Annihilation’s protagonist embarks on a dangerous mission to discover what happened to her husband in the infected land of Area X; Dredd’s incorruptible police officer wants to impose law in a lawless tower block in the futuristic, post-apocolyptic Mega City One. Garland’s choice of milieu is not consistent but his recurring focus on a specific point of view and distinct setting is: strong, seemingly moral protagonists in a dramatic setting with a clear project that the viewer can empathise with. Roger Ebert described movies as empathy machines (“Roger Tribute”, 00:01:00); writers such as Garland are the engine of that machine, powering a cathartic process that allows readers and viewers to explore and relate to people outside their immediate experiences, through the protagonist’s dramatic journey through dangerous and strange lands that mirror our own anxieties and fears. Garland explains why he enjoys working within genre conventions: “what genre allows you to do is to use shorthand in lots of areas. That gets you a lot of mileage quite quickly, and then you’ve got space to subvert, do something strange, do something unsettling” (Howard). His subversiveness is apparent in his screenplay’s conceits, from his creation of running zombies in 28 Days Later (now ubiquitous in the zombie subgenre but novel at the time), to framing Sergei as the protagonist in Devs (Ep. 1) only to have him killed in the first episode: “all of that stuff is intentional, and some of it is just playful, some of it sometimes is a bit political actually, it's do with assumptions people make about protagonists” (O’Falt, 00:09:01). These twists on existing tropes shatter any sense of safety the reader might otherwise find from the familiar, and this technique hooks their interest and lures them into the world of the story (Simmonds). Communicating theme to the reader is vital for a screenplay’s success (McKenzie). As screenwriter and showrunner Javier Grillo-Marxuach argues, “the right thematic concern in the right hands can release an incredible amount of narrative power”. Writers often have thematic interests which recur in their writing. Garland is interested in questions of science and philosophy (Krauss). These influence the themes he explores within his work, “but it's not motivated by me trying to provoke questions in other people, it's more me trying to figure it out, and then my means ... of then sort of processing that becomes writing a story” (Krauss, 00:27:14). Garland has identified several different thematic interests he explored in Sunshine, including genre-specific, philosophical, and religious themes. As Lowenstein identifies in his analysis of filmmaker Ben Wheatley’s work, cinematic spaces and genre can be explicitly linked in the viewer's imagination, which creates fertile ground for subversion if a screenwriter chooses. Garland deftly establishes the milieu of Sunshine through his ‘short-hand’ (Howard) descriptions of the interior and exterior of the story's setting, the spaceship Icarus 2, creating a visual narrative focussing on the futuristic technology of the ship, easily allowing the audience to acclimate to the story’s science-fiction genre and set their expectations with the conventional visual and auditory narrative. Garland utilises this setting in tandem with the plot and dialogue to explore generic science-fiction themes, including “that what man finds in space is his subconscious” (Sunshine, vii). Garland exposes this through the conflicting reactions of the characters to their increasingly deadly situation as the story progresses past the first plot point. Capa’s pragmatic attitude to their chances of survival, summarised in his line of dialogue “I can live with not going home” (Garland, Sunshine, 59), is contrasted with another of Icarus’s crew, Harvey, who places his survival before the success of the mission (Garland, Sunshine, 81). This clichéd theme, survival of the individual versus the greater good, is ubiquitous to space-exploration science-fiction, so how does Garland subvert the reader's expectations? Utilising a surprising twist, Garland changes the theme from self-sacrifice for the greater good to the more ethically challenging theme of sacrificing others, with Icarus’s crew members voting to murder Trey to complete the mission: “what are you asking? We weigh the life of one against the future of mankind? [Beat.] Kill him” (Garland, Sunshine, 89). This plot point innovates on existing tropes, creates conflict between the characters which heightens the reader's tension, is shocking and intellectually stimulating, which creates a more challenging and engaging story. In his introduction to the screenplay, Garland identifies atheism as one of his key thematic interests, which he explores to differing degrees over different drafts. In draft V01 (Garland, Sunshine) the antagonist Pinbacker’s motivation for stopping the protagonist is philosophical rather than religious; Garland summarised Pinbacker’s belief as, """"if we save Earth now, all we’re doing is putting off this imminent horror of extinction to our great, great, great, great squared or whatever you want … grandchildren &amp; that's an act of cowardice”” (Krauss, 00:31:29). This earlier draft also drew clearer parallels between Searle’s transformation and Pinbacker's descent into madness by comparing the visual descriptions of the characters in the screenplay’s action: “that his face is like a much-advanced version of Searle’s. The skin is ravaged, cracked, split"""" (Garland, Sunshine, 53), and both Searle's and Pinbacker's use of sunglasses serves as a recurring visual motif which links the characters together in the reader's mind. However, the inclusion of Searle’s death scene in the final draft (Garland, Sunshine, 87) after Pinbacker’s scenes had been substantially redrafted and the similarities between them reduced, meant that these crucial character developments and scenes lost their impact. Perhaps within the editing process, the thematic focus changed, but the plot maintained its initial direction. In the final draft, Pinbacker embodies Garland’s thematic counterpoint to atheism, religion. Pinbacker’s character has been driven mad by his spiritual awakening and is fundamentally opposed to the protagonist's dramatic need: “we can’t go to Heaven if you won’t let us die” (Garland, Sunshine, 120). Garland describes Pinbacker’s character in disturbing and graphic detail, his “skin is so sun-damaged and eaten with melanomas” (Garland, Sunshine, 99), and alludes to hellish imagery through his choice of language, describing Pinbacker as a “surreal and demonic shape” (Garland, Sunshine, 103), whilst some parts of the action are reminiscent of descriptions of Hell: “tiny flames lick on the edges of crusts of skin, that glow like coal embers, or miniature lava streams” (Garland, Sunshine, 98). Garland uses this language to illuminate his thematic point and show the destructive effects of Pinbacker’s spiritual beliefs through his carefully constructed, deliberate use of disturbing and shocking imagery. Being able to master the words on the page to evoke an image in the reader's mind is a crucial skill for any screenwriter, especially in genre writing where readers have set expectations based on literary conventions. Reading Garland’s short, sharp descriptions of action creates a visual narrative that not only stirs the readers' imagination and evokes a sense of pace and tension, but also adds subtext to the scenes. As Sunshine’s plot progresses and Searle starts to lose his sanity, his skin becomes more sunburnt, “his face a patchwork of red and peeling skin” (Garland, Sunshine, 64). Garland begins to include religious references in Searle’s dialogue: “ashes to ashes, stardust to stardust” (Garland, Sunshine, 78), and “they had an epiphany. They saw the light” (Garland, Sunshine, 78). Garland mirrors the internal changes within the character with the external changes to his appearance, and through carefully chosen dialogue he uses religious imagery to build tension for the reader by creating connotations of death (‘ashes to ashes’) as the crew enters the abandoned Icarus 1, and revelations (‘epiphany’) as they discover the Icarus 1’s dead crew. In the final draft, religion is only explicitly referenced in dialogue in the final act. If Sunshine is meant to be about mankind's inclination to misunderstand natural forces as divine (Garland, Sunshine, vii), the denouement needs to communicate this more explicitly; Pinbacker's arguments are never challenged by the characters through dialogue or discourse, which is a missed opportunity for Garland to consolidate his theme. Garland admits that Sunshine’s themes weren’t communicated clearly to the viewer: “the film in that respect definitely failed, it was a wake-up call for me to start working a bit harder” (Krauss, 00:33:26); and is candid that theme and storyline in Sunshine diverged (Ashkanani et al.) and his attempts to fix the issues weren’t rigorous enough. Sunshine is a fascinating screenplay: Garland masters his tools and techniques to build a compelling and challenging emotional and intellectual world, populated by interesting characters with clear dramatic needs; however, the final act feels thematically disjointed from Sunshine’s first 2 acts, which never reference Garland’s religious theme in dialogue or plot. In Annihilation, Garland wanted to explore the theme of self-destruction: “it was about the ways in which people are self-destructive, the sort of hidden ways, and the obvious ways, and why it is that all of us are in some ways self-destructive” (Fennessey, 00:07:18). Annihilation’s concept provides ample opportunity for Garland to explore this theme, as protagonist Lena travels into the story's dangerous setting 'Area X' to discover why her husband went missing. Garland uses Annihilation’s setting, ‘Area X’, a stretch of coastline where everything is mysteriously mutating, to show the theme of self-destruction through the visual narrative; he uses thematic patterning and graphic medical language to describe a disease-like growth in Area X: “fat mounds of moss, flourishing like petri dish cultures” (Garland, Annihilation, 65), it first appears on the trees, then buildings, before the characters find a body from which “brightly coloured lichen tumors” (Garland, Annihilation, 78) have exploded. Kane’s team is revealed to have imploded in a flashback scene which Garland describes in the visual narrative with disturbing body-horror imagery (Garland, Annihilation, 72-75), heightening the suspense and amplifying the reader's revulsion through its graphic imagery. Garland cleverly uses his setting to externalise his theme of change, both through the horrific action within the scenes, his descriptions of the dilapidated dwellings, or the surreal imagery of the inhabitants turned into topiary; Garland’s use of his visual narrative to reinforce his theme makes Annihilation much more cohesive than Sunshine. Garland structures his story as a non-linear narrative, using expositional flashbacks to reveal Lena and Kane’s relationship, and that Lena was having an affair before Kane's disappearance (Garland, Annihilation, 103-106); withholding this from the reader until the end of act 2 causes them to reappraise the story, and the shock of the moment heightens the tension, while also developing Lena’s character, providing us with a greater understanding of both Lena and Kane’s decisions to enter Area X, building empathy and pathos. Garland uses expositional dialogue to reveal the affair is long-standing: “it's not exactly the first time I’ve been in your bed, or you in mine. Whenever he goes away, we find ourselves right here” (Garland, Annihilation, 104). Garland uses this subplot to pull his theme of self-destruction into sharp focus: his protagonist is self-sabotaging her marriage; her search for why her husband didn't return to her now becomes allegorical. Although the film’s plot is about a journey into an infected alien wilderness, it could also be read as a story about a faithless wife trying to discover if her husband left her because he had uncovered the truth. Garland’s stories often feel allegorical, particularly Annihilation, which weaves theme into the setting, subtext, plot, and character. In the surreal resolution of the final act, Lena confronts her alien doppelgänger (revealing Garland's recurring interest in the subconscious). On a subtextual level she has found that the destructive alien force in her life and marriage is herself. Terminally ill Ventress undergoes a horrific physical transformation in the climactic scene, which reflects her own body's cancerous self-destruction: “it will grow until it encompasses everything. Our bodies and minds will be fragmented into their smallest parts” (Garland, Annihilation, 128); whereas the passive Radek simply vanishes rather than confront the truth (Garland, Annihilation, 119), Garland inferring that she has become part of the scenery of Area X. Garland's theme becomes explicit in the plot. Garland structures his plot as a circular narrative. In the final scenes, Lena returns to where the story began at the Southern Reach, changed by her experiences, and shares her new understanding of the nature of the shimmer and Garland’s perspective on the theme of self-destruction. “It wasn’t destroying. It was changing everything. It was making something new” (Garland, Annihilation, 139). Garland provides the reader and characters with a cathartic moment as Lena and Kane are reunited and admit they’re not who they seem. Using concisely written action, Garland reveals the shimmer in both their eyes (Annihilation, 140), the visual motif of change within his screenplay. Pointedly, Kane's doppelgänger asks his wife: “are you Lena?” (Garland, Annihilation, 140). Garland exits the scene early, leaving the story's resolution open to interpretation to heighten the suspense and ensure the screenplay ends with this question present in the reader's mind. A decade after plot, theme, and characters diverged in Sunshine, Garland masterfully weaves them together to build an engaging, synergistic, and thematically coherent world in his “hallucinogenic, atmosphere piece” (Fennessey, 00:03:51) Annihilation. Putting his thematic issue at the heart of his character's dramatic needs, plot and setting allowed Garland to immerse the reader in his musings on the question of why ordinary people self-destruct. Garland’s evolving approach to world-building demonstrates that, to build new emotional and intellectual story worlds, screenwriters must structure plot around a clear thematic issue too, and master craft and techniques to interlink setting, characters, dramatic need, visual and auditory narratives. Javier Grillo Marxuach argues: “when creating a world, your most important question is, quite simply … ’What is my most important question?’”. In Sunshine, Alex Garland wrote a taut science-fiction adventure which asked too many questions and arguably failed to answer any satisfactorily. In Annihilation, a film singularly about self-destruction, Garland demonstrates a mastery of his craft in world-building and answers that most important question. References Adeniyi, I.

"2024","Vanessa Tomlinson's &lt;em&gt;Sonic Dreams&lt;/em&gt;"," Utopia is an ideal, something that should mobilize us, push us forward. Utopia is not prescriptive; it renders potential blueprints of a world not quite here, a horizon of possibility, not a fixed schema. It is productive to think about utopia as flux, a temporal disorganization, as a moment when the here and the now is transcended by a then and a there that could be and should be. (Muñoz 97, emphasis in original) Imagine the sound of … (Tomlinson, Sonic 2)  Utopian Beginnings One of the overall conceits of cultural theorist of colour José Esteban Muñoz’s Cruising Utopia is that hope forms an ineliminable part of any critical (and queer) utopianism. As Muñoz repeatedly emphasises (drawing extensively on the work of philosopher Ernst Bloch, particularly Principle), this modality of hope relates in no way to what he identifies as “banal optimism” (Muñoz 3), or optimism that pays heed to overworked ideas. Rather, hope, in Muñoz’s sense, emerges through the politics of the everyday and, in particular, the actions of its most minoritised participants: queer and trans peoples, peoples of colour, Indigenous peoples, and disabled peoples, among others. These actions are “the hopes of a collective, an emergent group, or even the solitary oddball who is the one who dreams for many” (Muñoz 3). Importantly, Muñoz characterises hope as “both a critical affect and a methodology” (4). To engage in the doing of hope—that is, in the work of hoping (something that Joshua Chambers-Letson, Tavia Nyong’o, and Ann Pellegrini remind us of in the Foreword to the tenth-anniversary edition of Cruising Utopia ix)—involves “a backward glance that enacts a future vision” (Muñoz 4). So, as a methodology, hope can become a tool for critical speculation. To feel hope, then, is commensurate with the perception of this future vision, or what Muñoz also calls the not-yet-conscious, many versions of which are invoked in the epigraph to this paper (e.g. “potential blueprints of a world not quite here”). The ongoing and escalating precarities of both the climate crisis and mass environmental destruction animate Muñoz’s formulation by foregrounding the need to mobilise in ways that counteract at once “the force of political pessimism” (Muñoz 4; e.g. the world-ending streak endemic to colonial climate narratives) and the prevalence of banal optimism (e.g. belief in elitist solutions, such as travelling to and colonising another planet). So too are the other bodies who are caught in these temporalities—for instance, nonhuman animals, geological formations, and the tiniest subatomic structures—present in Muñoz’s thinking, even if he does not explicitly mention them. Like their queer and Indigenous kin (among others), they hope in a particular way and, at other times, are the reasons for its manifestation. Ultimately, Muñoz’s call, which he reiterates in his later essay “Hope in the Face of Heartbreak”, is for us to hope—to practice it, feel it, share it, work at it, catalyse it, and struggle with both it and its antonym of disappointment—“in the face of obstacles that so often feel insurmountable … [and] in the face of an often heartbreaking reality” (207). The particular instantiation of hope in which I’m interested is what Muñoz (following Bloch; see Utopian) beautifully describes as the anticipatory illumination of art: “certain properties that can be detected in representational practices helping us to see the not-yet-conscious” (Muñoz 3). I locate such properties in Australian percussionist and improvisor Vanessa Tomlinson’s work Sonic Dreams—a structured improvisation (i.e. the musicians improvise according to a set of guidelines) in which performers are tasked with imagining the “lost and unknown sounds” of extinct and critically endangered species (Tomlinson, Sonic 1). My argument is that, against the grain of the supposedly knowable extinctive futures instantiated by colonial pessimism, Sonic Dreams entails a process of world-making that is “epistemologically and ontologically humble” (Muñoz 28, emphasis in original), insofar as it “strain[s] to activate the no-longer-conscious” (28) in order to glimpse (or speculate) a different and better futurity. In doing so, Sonic Dreams intervenes in the (hetero)normative framing of time as linear and beholden to the present and of the past as out of reach. This framework is what Muñoz (after cultural theorist Jack Halberstam) deems straight time, which “tells us that there is no future but the here and now of our everyday life” (Muñoz 22). In this temporal regime, legitimacy and what we might call a legitimate futurity are therefore crafted through “the spectacle of the state refurbishing its ranks through overt and subsidized acts of reproduction” (Muñoz 22; see also literary theorist Lee Edelman’s book-length critique of this spectacle). Put another way, for something to be valued as legitimate within this framework, it must accede to these narrow heteronormative criteria, which service a potently consumerist and forward-facing present. The past—and, for that matter, any alternative temporality—holds little currency in this neoliberal state of affairs. Sonic Dreams, then, is couched in questions of what counts as artificial. Not least is the question of whether the sounds co-produced by the performers and their instruments might be figured as artificial likenesses of the species in question. To be clear, I am not attempting to make any qualitative claims about artificiality, and indeed, we might altogether avoid ascribing the notion of the artificial in all its forms with a negative or positive valence. My suggestion is a different one entirely. I want to trouble the artificial/legitimate binary that can be overlaid onto Tomlinson’s work given its explicit turn towards the past, teasing out how the related ideas of artificiality and speculation are central to the work’s production of hope. Sonic Dreams Much of Tomlinson’s artistry comprises site-specific work (e.g. Beacons by Tomlinson and Australian composer Lawrence English). The descriptor “site-specific” indicates not just that the performance or composition is intended for a certain site but more so that it incorporates what composer and acoustic ecologist R. Murray Schafer would describe as the site’s soundscape: the sounds that make up the space and the multifarious relations in which they are entangled. Other notable site-specific work includes Australian improvisor Jim Denley’s album Through Fire, Crevice and the Hidden Valley, which was recorded in the Budawang Range. Especially pertinent in Tomlinson’s body of work is the practice that she calls sounding, which she describes as “the activation of a place or space by a musician that is both investigative—information seeking—and performative” (""""Intersecting"""" 23; e.g. Sounding the Condamine). In other words, sounding amounts to a committed and intentional orientation towards the nuances and politics of place and, overall, is focussed on producing “new knowledge, new relationships, and new experiences for performers and listeners … [along with] understanding of place” (Tomlinson, """"Soundings"""" 35). Sonic Dreams is a sounding of extinctions that have happened or may yet happen in various places and at various times, though this is the extent of its nature as a site-specific work—none of the versions of the work need to be realised at the places to which they correspond. The first version, which relates to the area around Boorloo (Perth), was commissioned by the contemporary music ensemble GreyWing, whom Tomlinson calls “sonic investigators” (Sonic 1). This description serves as an important hint in terms of the speculative nature of the work: in this case, imagining (much like hoping) is a kind of work—not a case of untethered daydreaming, but a situated and critical romp through eight no-longer-conscious sound worlds (more on these soon). As Tomlinson writes in the preparation notes, “practice for this piece may include improvising with the given sound worlds, research about the species in the piece, site visits/recordings, rehearsing how to move from one sonic state to the next. Or it may include going on stage and spontaneously playing from the instruction cards” (Sonic 1; each card details a sound world). This list of preparatory and investigative activities can be synthesised into something like an initial effort to make kin (to use feminist philosopher of science Donna Haraway’s language) or nurture intimacy with the work and, more importantly, each of the sound worlds and their occupying species. Tomlinson then provides an inexhaustive set of instructions for performing the work. Three points stand out. First is a general idea of how to approach each sound world: “move through the sequence of 8 imagined sound worlds in any order you like. These may last from 30 second[s] minimum per card, to as long as you like” (Tomlinson, Sonic 1). Second is a slightly more restrictive statement outlining how to approach the coda: “remember the order, and what you played. The coda is a recount of the sound worlds—5 seconds per imagination” (1). And third is what amounts to a gloss of the work: “together you are creating a series of fixed, repeatable, sonic memories—for that moment only” (1). Beyond the invocation of each sound world—all of which begin with “Imagine the sound of”—no indication is given as to what kinds of sounds might be made. After all, we are unable to know what some of these sound worlds (their pitch contents, rhythms, timbres, and so on) really are or were. Tomlinson’s method therefore aims at description, not prescription. Importantly, the instrumentation for the piece is open and for any number of performers—anyone, no matter the instrument they play or their proficiency, can participate. Nor is there any hierarchy between performers and listeners: as sound artist Nat Grant points out in relation to the majority of Tomlinson’s artistry, “it’s not about ego; it’s about simultaneously holding the very shared and very individual experience of listening” (para. 9). This shared, non-hierarchical experience speaks to collective imagining, collective resistance. At this point, I encourage the reader to pause their reading and view two performances of Sonic Dreams. First is a performance of the first version of the work, featuring Tomlinson, pianist Erik Griswold, and electronic musician John Ferguson. Note that the projection of images seen in this performance is not a requirement of the piece, yet it goes some way in augmenting its investigative and relational tenor. Second is a performance of Sonic Dreams (Stanthorpe), featuring Tomlinson and Griswold. In many ways, Sonic Dreams is what could be termed both a species-specific work and a time-specific work. It orients performers and listeners towards particular species, their histories, and their habitats, at times extending the notion of a soundscape to include no-longer-conscious sounds. In the first version of the piece, two of the species are “Pseudemydura umbrina [the Western swamp tortoise] coming up for breath” and “Dasyornis broadbenti litoralis [the Western rufous bristlebird] in the dawn chorus” (Tomlinson, Sonic 2). “In the case of Pseudemydura umbrina”, Tomlinson writes, “its habitat is now the Perth airport—its sound world totally transformed” (Sonic 1). This enterprise is not so different from that of American clarinettist David Rothenberg, who improvises with nonhuman animals such as humpback whales (see “Humpback whales”; see also “Interspecies”) in an attempt to cultivate more-than-human dialogue (see also Klotz). In Sonic Dreams, such dialogue gives way to speculation.  Fig. 1: Pseudemydura umbrina, Western swamp tortoises, or yarkiny to the Noongar People. Perth Zoo.  Fig. 2: Artist’s rendition of Dasyornis broadbenti litoralis or Western rufous bristlebirds. John Gould. This orientation to the past—or backwards-facing glance, as Muñoz would have it—amounts to something like Deep Listening to past extinctions. Composer and improvisor Pauline Oliveros’s practice of Deep Listening entails perception not only of sounds (in this case, no-longer-conscious sounds) but likewise the details of their manifold contexts. It is, above all, a process of learning. So, animating the residue of each species populating Sonic Dreams through Deep Listening in a present that is tainted by climate and environmental crises matters. What can we learn from listening to (the loss of) these species and their habitats that might inform the not-yet-conscious? To the (hetero)normative understandings of time that pervade the present and fuel its forward-facing tendencies, this past-oriented pursuit would no doubt lack legitimacy and seem far too speculative. Yet, this Deep Listening and this sounding nevertheless offer a chance to think differently about extinctions and their material possibilities. Sonic Hopes What, then, might we take away from Tomlinson’s Sonic Dreams? Commenting on the work of filmmaker and choreographer Jack Smith, particularly his manifesto “Capitalism of Lotusland”, Muñoz writes, “Smith’s manifesto was utopian, not so much because he dreamed of Xanadu but, more nearly, because he performed alternate realities. These realities were loosely based on fantasies of glimmering lost cityscapes like Atlantis. … And this conjured reality instructs us that the ‘here and now’ is simply not enough” (170–71). Smith’s performances, which would hardly be deemed legitimate according to heteronormative standards, reconfigured the past through cheap glitter and polyester in an effort not only to glimpse a not-yet-conscious but also engage with that potential future in the present. This is what could be called hope-full world-making, and it is what galvanises Tomlinson’s piece. Tomlinson dreams wildly; she speculates and asks us to do the same. These dreams resonate with “a critical impatience with the present”, something that Muñoz identifies in the gestures of performer Fred Herko (161), so they are not the stuff of disengaged, banal optimism. Instead, dreaming in Sonic Dreams translates to hoping, the underpinning of which is much-needed collective resistance in a time of despair. Tomlinson invites performers and audiences alike to bear witness to the emotional and political force of a no-longer-conscious: extinctions that are inextricable from the machinations of straight time but that have the potential to disrupt this logic and thus open on to a different and better not-yet-conscious. Her ultimate thesis is that listening is a crucial first step in this process. What we could call sonic hopes, then, may indeed offer new ways of thinking, approaching, and striving towards alternative futurities. References Bloch, Ernst. The Principle of Hope. Trans.

"2024","On the Use of the Term Philosophy","The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) beyond the sciences has not only ushered in a wave of controversy amongst the humanists but the humanities in general—more stridently than when Wittgenstein did it with his infamous Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. That language can ultimately be (pre)determined algorithmically (a notion, I am sure, that Wittgenstein himself would take no small pleasure in availing his interpretation of language as a calculus), wherein the essence behind the meaning of a word is simply a dictionary’s definition away from complete and total erasure. Indeed, “one can calculate whether a proposition belongs to logic”, as Wittgenstein puts it, “by calculating the logical properties of the symbol … . And this is what we do when we ‘prove’ a logical proposition. For, without bothering about sense or meaning, we construct the logical propositions out of others using only rules that deal with signs” (76-77). It remains to be seen whether or not consciousness can arise on this basis, as in a truly Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and by only using those same rules that seem to emerge from their own, inherent complexity; themselves just another form of statement, to recall Wittgenstein, and those statements caught “in an eternal relation to a proposition about a constituent of the complex” (15). But for me to even acknowledge Wittgenstein in some respects, and in some circles, is to contemplate the end of philosophy itself, or at the very least to dwell on the significance of the sense or meaning of the end. Karl Popper might have us refrain from stoking this fire altogether, although neither Popper, nor Wittgenstein for that matter, could have ever anticipated the extent to which the sciences, let alone the computer sciences, would eventually go on to ‘prove’ that a reductionist approach towards language does, in fact, work; in light of, and in spite of, Leibniz’s postulation of a giant brain the size of a windmill, fundamentally reducing the thinking and experiencing capacity of an individual to a series of cogs and wheels; Lawrence Davis’s duplication of the brain’s own synapses using telephone wires (no doubt an early precursor to neural networks and machine learning); Ned Block’s description of a Chinese brain (as being somehow different from any other brain); and finally John Searle’s Chinese room argument, perhaps the most recognisable variation of and to a thought experiment in which an individual is placed inside a room and asked to associate a symbol in Mandarin with another in English without knowing Mandarin, and in much the same way an input parses through a computer that is none the wiser about its output (Cole). The computer does not think, that is to say, about what any of these inputs or outputs are supposed to mean, least of all the use of the term philosophy. I, however, want to focus on the sense and meaning behind the use of this term, in particular, and for two main reasons. Firstly, because the sense and meaning of philosophy tends to differ from philosopher to philosopher, in as much as someone like Locke contiguously builds upon the likes of Descartes, and Descartes on Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, and their ideas. Secondly, because the difference between the one and the other philosopher is also demonstrative of a (con)temporality to language, especially when the use of the term philosophy itself does not strictly imply existentialism, or existential nihilism, or, as in the case of Wittgenstein, analytic philosophy, any more than it does phenomenology, or Socratic method, or film philosophy. Of course, if we were to define and differentiate these terms, like analytics from technics from aesthetics, say, well might we then go on to ‘prove’ their logical propositions as statements (analytics is this, technics is that, etc.), but that is entirely my point: in the absence of the presence of any logic, any curation, and without bothering about sense or meaning at all, well might LLMs then go on to construct their own predominantly English rooms out of rules that deal with only one philosophical statement to the exclusion of all others. Moreover, even if we were to curate such statements, well might these propositions lack the capacity (re: empathy) to sense or mean anything beyond the sign of the times in which they were produced—well might the affect of this time come into play as part of another, eternal relation to propositions about time and affect themselves as exponential functions in the arrangement of these terms caught in another eternal relation between their past and present meaning. Long have we outgrown Cartesian dualism, for example, with regard to Locke and Hume, but the philosophy of the one is meaningless without the other; instead, we should try to imagine the intelligence of a machine caught in an eternal relation between mind and body without body, and in light of a more than likely Christian interpretation of God, or, as is more popularly the case with the likes of James Barrat, a self-styled Busy Child that is just as omnipotent as it is superintelligent. Would the machine judge us on the basis of Cartesian dualism, or Locke’s social contract, or Hume’s empiricism, as they are understood and reflected upon now, or in the past—or, in the past of the future, which is become now? I must admit that Barrat’s rather hyperbolic use of language when it comes to AGI gets us little to no traction with the Ray Kurzweils of this world, which is why I think a much more innocuous consideration of the use of the term philosophy paves the way with a series of similarly good intentions. No philosopher, no good scientist, sets about in earnest to create a means by which to act against their own best interests, but then again: “here is this tendency to think that well-intentioned people create nice Ais [sic],” according to Eliezer Yudkowsky, “they themselves assume that if they are good-intentioned people the Ais [sic] they make are automatically good intentioned, and this is not true” (qtd. in Barrat, 53). Let us take, for example, Jianqiu Zhang’s article """"Should We Fear Large Language Models? A Structural Analysis of the Human Reasoning System for Elucidating LLM Capabilities and Risks through the Lens of Heidegger’s Philosophy"""". As well-intentioned though it may very well be, it begs the question: why Heidegger? What is it about Heidegger’s philosophy as opposed to Wittgenstein’s that someone like Derrida has not already elucidated through Writing and Difference about language through its meaning-making? “Heidegger’s framework illuminates the dual nature of entities; ‘ready-to-hand’ entities are appreciated for their practical utility”, according to Zhang, “while ‘present-at-hand’ entities are scrutinized for their intrinsic qualities from a scientific attitude. This duality forms the basis of what we term our Faculty of Knowledge, delineating the intricate structure by which we perceive and engage with our surroundings” (3). My emphasis on the use of the term duality here is that Zhang’s choice of Heidegger’s philosophy not only forms the basis for a convenient, if not computationally binary, interpretation of language, and by again calculating the logical properties of a symbol no less, this same scientific attitude would sooner relegate than ‘prove’ another logical kind of proposition algorithmically, away from the subjectivity of the ostensibly clunky rules that deal with signs, as well as the consequences of those rules, that have been up for debate across the humanities, and to a greater extent philosophically, since time immemorial. These properties, I might add, are in no way restricted to just Wittgenstein, or to just Heidegger, or even to just Derrida, but unlike Wittgenstein’s Tractatus, Heidegger’s framework—in Zhang’s case, Being and Time—is fraught with its own problems, the least of which concern its translation from German into English. By Heidegger’s own admission, he considers this framework a failure, and to such an extent that he abandons “the second half … . After a quarter of a century”, leaving Being and Time effectively unfinished (17). There are also the rather pragmatic, if not proto-fascistic, tendencies to these so-called ‘ready-to-hand’ entities that are only really being appreciated for their practicality in much the same way that a being might only be considered human in terms of their usefulness—at first to certain roles, to applications, and finally to society at large, in a slippery slope towards an abject (and utterly objective) utilitarianism that even now threatens to outmode swathes of the population under the guise of innovation, automation, and business agility (Baron). To Zhang’s credit, this utilitarian approach is clearly not what they intended when invoking someone like Heidegger, but, again, this is entirely my point: philosophy, as it is understood nowadays, can often be confused for, and conflated with, one’s own worldview not unlike a business philosophy. The goal of any business, any good business, and I use the term ‘good’ not in the sense of what is morally right or righteous, but effectively good for business, is to make a profit. Of course, there are going to be various businesses that would claim that their business philosophy, in particular, is more or less agile, sustainable—ethical—than others, but this only goes to show that the use of the term philosophy is itself up to interpretation. So, what philosophy means for us today, it may or may not mean for us tomorrow. “When we make something present by bringing it close from its ‘thence’ [seinem Dorther], the making-present forgets the ‘yonder’ [das Dort] and loses itself in itself. Thus it comes about that if ‘observation’ of entities within-the-world commences in such a making-present”, according to Heidegger, “the illusion arises that ‘at first’ only a Thing is present-at-hand, here of course, but indefinitely—in space in general” (421). In this sense, the ‘yonder’ constitutes a mix of that which is unknown and that which is unknowable about the future (usefulness or uselessness) of something, especially when it is only considered in the present, given moment. There is a tendency, in other words, for us to treat a Thing only in its nowness, as if the rules that deal with signs were not in some way prone to change by and of themselves (indefinitely), or influence (re: affect) those entities already within-the-world—this is the illusion of which Heidegger speaks, and why Heidegger himself tends to frame a Thing (a Being) in terms of its temporality, as if “the spatial in the Articulation of concepts and significations has its basis not in some specific power which space possesses”, as Heidegger puts it, “but in Dasein’s kind of Being. Temporality is essentially falling, and it loses itself in making present” (421). Words themselves can also be interpreted as falling, in that they, too, lose all meaning in the presence of being made into (and out of) data that needs to be continually scraped just to be able to keep up with the effective ‘observation’ of language in the real world. I will concede, however, that presently, or at the very least temporarily, something like ChatGPT’s identification with the philosophy of William James perfectly demonstrates how even our own Structural Analysis of the Human Reasoning System is conspicuously flawed, both in our assessment of, and association with, Heidegger’s Philosophy (see figs. 1-9). If the machine does not (or will not, it is hard to estimate the difference between the backend from the frontend of its development as a user) identify with that very ‘yonder’, even though we think it might or should identify this way or that, this only goes to show us that our own understanding of language still has a long ways to go yet. And we have known about this falling for as long as Derrida, according to Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, whose translation of Derrida from French into English bears with it its very own connotations of Searle’s Chinese room argument: “‘Being’ is the master-word that Heidegger crosses out. Derrida does not reject this. But his word is ‘trace’ (the French word carries strong implications of track, footprint, imprint)”, as Spivak puts it, “a word that cannot be a master-word, that presents itself as the mark of an anterior presence, origin, master. For ‘trace’ one can substitute ‘arche-writing’ (‘archi-écriture’), or ‘differance,’ or in fact quite a few other words that Derrida uses in the same way” (xv). What I am essentially trying to resolve with this article, then, is in some way making this ‘yonder’ forever ‘thence’, and not just as the mark of an anterior presence (of an absence of) meaning that would generally and presently be (mis)understood as the definition of a given word, but the exponential Articulation of these concepts as significations, and the very anteriority of this presence, and the affect of this time, as yet another, different kind of Being. This meaning is prone to change, yes, and this change in meaning is therefore not an objective, or even quantifiable subject now and for all time—such a Thing, I think, we often take for granted about language is that meaning oscillates, but that it also vacillates between instability and calm, historically speaking. The figurative distance between the input and the output of a given word, however, “is not the origin”, according to Derrida, “but that which takes its place; which is not, moreover, the opposite of an origin. It is not an absence instead of presence, but a trace which replaces a presence which has never been present, an origin by means of which nothing has begun” (372). Already there are signs that training LLMs on their own generated datasets thusly is affecting the quality of these outputs, mostly because language, like writing, “involves more than placing an existing document on an unreliable photocopier and pressing the Print button. It’s possible that, in the future”, according to Ted Chiang, the author behind Denis Villeneuve’s linguistic thriller Arrival (2016), “we will build an A.I. that is capable of writing good prose based on nothing but its own experience of the world. The day we achieve that will be momentous indeed—but that day lies far beyond our prediction horizon”. I would even go so far as to suggest that good prose, as a conceptual placeholder for the ‘observation’ of entities within-the-world, is not beyond our prediction horizon at all. It is that horizon place that constitutes an inherently affecto-temporal object, and one that Jean Baudrillard once referred to as “the generation by models of a real without origin or reality: a hyperreal” (1). A thought of Being without Being (and so without Body) that, while “Heidegger’s [crossed-out Being] might point at an inarticulable presence”, as Spivak puts it, “Derrida’s [crossed-out trace] is the mark of the absence of a presence, an always already absent present, of the lack of the origin that is condition of thought and experience” (xvii). Derrida’s is actually the mark of the necessity of the absence of a presence of a meaning to language so that new meanings can eventually take the place of old ones through our interpretation (and misinterpretation) of them.  Finally, I would like to conclude this article with a series of artificially generated comments from Giacomo Miceli’s experimental discussion, The Infinite Conversation, further demonstrating my point about AGIs, LLMs, and the use of the term philosophy in a rather self-reflexive way; comments that I merely chanced upon, but found to be extremely relevant on this topic. Entering the Website, Miceli greets visitors with a pop-up: “Welcome to the Infinite Conversation: an AI generated, never-ending discussion between Werner Herzog and Slavoj Žižek. Everything you hear is fully generated by a machine. The opinions and beliefs expressed do not represent anyone. They are the hallucinations of a slab of silicon”, including a button saying “Play audio” (Miceli). Clicking the button, the pop-up disappears, and the Infinite Conversation resumes—never at the same point in the Conversation, never on the same topic, sometimes starting with Žižek, other times Herzog. This time, Herzog opens the Conversation by stating: “No, no. I’m not a Marxist. I don’t believe much in theories. Not that I’m claiming to be a thoroughly skeptical philosopher, but I simply don’t believe much in theories and ideologies. I have my own way of looking at the world. It’s maybe similar to some Marxist views. But there’s no label for it. Yes, I’m not a Marxist” (fig. 10). Žižek counters, at first replying:  I heard rumors that you are sometimes designated by your critics as a kind of anti-Marxist. I was always a bit afraid of this because even in my writings there are some formulas for example, about how nature itself is the primordial form of class struggle which sound [sic] like a very nice metaphor but maybe are also used to mystify what goes on between people so that every natural catastrophe is then somehow denounced as part of the same struggle with primitive humanity. So I would prefer an open question mark instead of being called something. (Fig. 11).  Herzog concurs with Žižek on this last point, stating “there are no categories. Yes, I would rather have an open question mark” (fig. 12). Žižek agrees with Herzog, following up by saying: “the tendency of every ideology is to close the open question mark. With every new theory, each time we get a new ‘ism,’ we should resist it” (fig. 13). Even the chatbots are in agreement: substitute ideology for philosophy, categories for terms, and the open question mark for the affect of time and meaning disintegrates into theory, and those theories towards the closure of meaning-making altogether through the origin of the word. What are we to make of the use of Miceli’s own use of the term hallucination, then, verging on the cusp of an almost metaphenomenological questioning—at what point does the merely uncanny of the distinction between the actual and the virtual complicate our very understanding of what this language already no longer means to us?

Set in 1920s San Francisco, The Maltese Falcon is recognised as one of the earliest original noir classics. Sam Spade and Miles Archer, private investigators, are hired by a mysterious woman to follow her lover, Floyd Thursby. The next morning both Archer and Thursby are dead, and Spade is stuck in the middle. He soon realises that the true motive for both the killings and following Thursby revolved around a valuable statue, the Maltese falcon. This leads Spade on a hunt for the murderer of his ex-partner and the treasured statue. In his quest, Spade must contend with dangerous individuals also looking to acquire the falcon.   Detective Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart in the film adaptation) is drawn into the conflict related to finding and obtaining the artifact. Despite individuals with great skills being part of the chase, no individual can accomplish the task solely on their own. Thus, each character needs to gain information or support from multiple other competitors to be successful. This is not an easy task when a believed fortune is at stake and the trustworthiness of all players can be questioned. To gain advantage and progress toward ultimate victory, the characters in The Maltese Falcon need to use the power they have and engage in different strategies and tactics to gain needed information and ultimate control of the black bird. The success of these strategies varies significantly, as will be seen. In this article we will analyse the characters of The Maltese Falcon and their actions within the framework of bases of power and influence tactics, major concepts in the fields of management and psychology. This analysis method lets us better understand the intent of various characters in their actions and assess their effectiveness as well as their efforts to neutralise or reduce the impact of these bases and tactics. Bases of Power and Influence Tactics  In considering the events of The Maltese Falcon, the impact of power and how it is used is crucial to the narrative. Power, a major aspect of human society, can be viewed in sociological or political science in terms of groups of people and whole social systems (Martin 2), or in management or psychology terms as individuals influencing each other (French and Raven 151). Power can involve “power over” others due to position or role as well as “power to” collaboratively work with and influence others (Wrong).      In the fields of management and psychology, one major way of looking at the different types of power people possess is provided by French and Raven (151). They divide power into power bases that are position-based or personal-based. Position means power a person has due to the position, job, or role they have, a similar concept to the hierarchical power of the “power over” concept (Wrong). For example, a manager has recognised power to reward or punish subordinates, and in the United States the president also is recognised as the Commander-in-Chief of the military. Personal powers are more connected to someone’s personal characteristics. Thus, we can see them possessing these powers regardless of the role or position they hold. A person’s charisma or expertise falls into this category. We will review each of the specific power bases below and connect how they relate to particular characters and situations in the story.   Legitimate Power Legitimate power involves power that is recognised as coming with a particular job or role. A CEO or president is recognised as having certain authority or power that comes with that title. This allows them to influence relevant people or groups of people (French and Raven 151). The major characters in The Maltese Falcon generally lack legitimate power, at least as far as the premise of the book and movie are concerned. Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet) has legitimate power within his criminal organisation, perhaps, but lacks legitimate recognition of owning the Maltese Falcon or an official relevant job. Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) and Brigid O’Shaughnessy (Mary Astor) do not have jobs that come with particular power attached. No character has legitimate, recognised ownership of the Maltese Falcon. Thus, anyone who can seize the object has control of it. The one element of legitimate power we do see is Sam Spade in his role as detective. While Spade is not treated with ample respect by the police in the narrative, he is given more leeway than the other characters. As a detective, his role is recognised by the police as one that involves searching for information and at times interacting with nefarious characters (Hammett 25). This gives him greater ease of movement and ability to move around than the other characters. While he has no legitimate right to the falcon statue, his role as a detective makes his search for it more legitimate. Reward Power The next type of power is called reward power. Particular roles or people can have resources or things others value. Having the ability to give (or even offer) a valued commodity can give a person influence over another (French and Raven 152). Within The Maltese Falcon, different characters have access to rewards other characters could desire. Both Gutman and Cairo offer money to Spade for finding and handing over the falcon (Hammett 55), while O’Shaughnessy offers Spade love or just sex for his help (Hammett 267).  Coercive Power The third type of positional power is coercive power, and relates to the punishments or negative outcomes a person is believed capable of visiting on someone else: in other words, the perceived negative consequences if the demands of a person are not met (French and Raven 152). We see examples of this across the movie and book. In the film, Wilmer Cook almost exclusively uses threats to try to get what he wants out of Spade (Huston). Gutman uses a range of tactics and power types, such as ingratiation and rational persuasion, but is not above threatening negative consequences. Information Power Information power relates to the idea that a person’s role or position may give them access to information that is valuable to others (Raven et al. 308). In organisations this might be the right person to talk to for approval, the best process to use in a task, or the political dynamics in place. This could be information that is very valuable to have. When a person controls information, they have power over others in deciding who gets the information. Within The Maltese Falcon, knowledge related to the artifact is valuable. Gutman has significant knowledge of the history of the artifact and its true nature (Huston). Brigid O’Shaughnessy has information related to where the artifact is that others are desperate to possess (Hammett 110). While Spade begins the narrative with very little knowledge of the Maltese Falcon, he pretends to others that he knows a lot more than he does (Hammett 130). This leads characters to be influenced by him even though he does not have the information they need; the fact people believe he has information gives him power. This actually helps him to gain more information, as other characters give him information that they assume he already has. Referent Power The next two power bases relate to personal power, elements related to the person rather than their role. Referent power relates to the likeability or appealing nature of a person. If we feel positive toward a person, we are more likely to be influenced by them and help them (Atwater and Yammarino 5). Brigid O’Shaughnessy is a character who uses significant referent power. Her role as a noir femme fatale means that many men in the narrative want to be close to her. She uses that to her advantage to get people to do what she wants. She uses this as her main appeal to Spade, trying to use his attraction to her so that he helps her achieve her goals (even while often withholding crucial information). Thursby is a man who was previously in her sway, whom she discards when he stops being useful (Hammett 258).   Expert Power The last power base is called expert power and relates to the power a person gains from their skills and knowledge. The skills and knowledge a person has help them to be successful in situations and know what to do. This power is greater when others recognise the person as an expert, too. When others feel someone is an expert, they are likely to defer to their judgment and follow their advice (French and Raven 156). Within The Maltese Falcon, Gutman has significant knowledge on the artifact in question. Other characters recognise this, and it often allows him to lead the proceedings. Sam Spade meanwhile is recognised for his skills as a detective. Characters try to get Spade on their side because they believe he will be a significant help in securing the artifact. Influence Tactics While having potential power is helpful, how people try to influence others is just as important. Research by Kipnis et al. (440) started the examination of specific tactics people use to influence others. While a power base allows for the potential of influence, an individual may use a wide variety of different tactics across situations. Influence tactics have been found in meta-analytic examination to relate positively to work outcomes such as job performance, salary, and promotions (Higgins et al. 96). Most characters in The Maltese Falcon try multiple tactics to gain advantage and influence. We will define here a few major ones used. Pressure tactics build on the idea of coercive power, as they involve a person making demands and threats (Yukl and Falbe 133). Thus, pressure is put on a person to change their behaviour or opinion. While many characters use pressure at times, one major example is Spade with O’Shaughnessy. Spade threatens he will not help O’Shaughnessy unless she gives him more information on the situation (Hammett 49). This is pressure to make her provide him information that is useful to him, even if someone else having that information could lead to O’Shaughnessy being implicated in a crime or losing the Maltese Falcon.  Exchange tactics, on the other hand, use the reward side of power. When using an exchange tactic, a person offers a reward or benefit in exchange for compliance (Yukl and Falbe 133). Thus, the reason for someone changing their behaviour is to gain what is being offered. This is a common tactic used across The Maltese Falcon. O’Shaughnessy, in talking about getting first involved with the Maltese Falcon, says she was offered five hundred pounds if she helped obtain it (Hammett 105). So, the tactic is an offer of money in exchange for her relevant actions. Rational persuasion involves the use of logical arguments and factual evidence to try to convince another person to take a particular course of action (Yukl and Falbe 133). Thus, acting or thinking in a particular way is suggested to be a rational thing to do based on that person’s desires, regardless of the potential benefit to the person making the influence attempt. As Spade talks to Gutman about the need for a scapegoat, he gives reasoning and arguments why a scapegoat is needed and that a particular coherent story is necessary (Hammett 236). This is framed as being needed and rational, not as related to a particular person’s interest. Thus, the plan is argued as being “logical” in order to lead to compliance. Ingratiation is a tactic that involves getting another person to effect a favourable mood toward the influencer before a request is made (Yukl and Falbe 133). The idea here fits with referent power – if we like someone, we are more likely to do what they ask. In discussing how to deal with the police related to the murders in the plot, Gutman compliments Spade on how he is a “difficult person to get the best of” (Hammett 237). In complimenting Spade on his cleverness, Gutman is trying to make Spade feel more favourable toward him. This could mean Spade will be more influenced later by Gutman due to this feeling.  The last tactic we consider here is consultation when a person allows the influence tactic’s target input into a decision or plan (Yukl and Falbe 133). By allowing input the person may feel more positive toward the plan and be willing to go along with it. Within the discussion on how to deal with the police related to the murders that have happened, Spade allows Gutman and Cairo to have input (Hammett 236). By doing so, Spade hopes to better gain their compliance and focus their attention on elements that are beneficial to him rather than to take their own independent action. The potential for Spade to be arrested or hurt is much greater if any of them do not go along with the fall guy plan. By including them in this set-up, Spade tries to get them to commit to this course of action. Now that we have discussed the nature of power and influence tactics, we will highlight exactly how they play out in some key scenes from the story. The Plot as Seen through Power and Influence Sam Spade Gets Hired by “Miss Wonderly” O’Shaughnessy (claiming to be a ‘Miss Wonderly’) comes to hire Spade dressed well and in full make-up (Hammett 6). We can see this as her trying to look as attractive as possible, trying to create referent power over Spade to make him want to help her. O’Shaughnessy then presents the case as being related to her concern for her sister, who may have fallen in with bad company (Hammettt 6). This is a lie but is used to garner sympathy. Surveillance for the sake of her sister suggests some legitimate power in the situation – it is more legitimate of a person to be looking out for their sister than for them to be asking someone to engage in the surveillance of a stranger. O’Shaughnessy also offers reward power with an exchange tactic of offering two hundred dollars for the job, an amount Spade characterises as high enough for him to overlook the unbelievability in her story (Hammett 42). By paying a high enough rate for the job, she gains Spade’s willingness to accept the job. This early scene thus presents an uncomplicated situation of influence, with O’Shaughnessy using three tactics to help gain the compliance of Spade to take on this surveillance job.  First Spade and Cairo Meeting In the middle of our story, we find Sam Spade in his office, where he receives a visit from Joel Cairo. Cairo initially offers Spade five thousand dollars to find the statue of a black bird. After initially offering Spade the money, Cairo pulls out a pistol and demands to search the office. Despite this, Spade overpowers Cairo and knocks him unconscious (Huston). Cairo first tries an exchange tactic by offering money, trying to create reward power over Spade. Almost instantly we see Cairo switch to the tactic of pressure by pulling his gun. We see Spade react by using expert power in the form of self-defence by knocking Cairo unconscious. Thus, Spade neutralises the attempted pressure. After Cairo awakens, he tells Spade he had to hold him at gunpoint because of the high value of the black bird. Cairo’s appeal and complaint can be seen as legitimising a pressure tactic. Cairo agrees to pay Spade a two hundred-dollar retainer fee after a negotiation. Cairo tells Spade he believes that Spade knows where the statue is and or at least how to find it, which is another example of Spade's expert power. It also shows Cairo believes Spade has crucial information, giving Spade informational power. At the end of scene Cairo asks for his gun back, and when Spade complies he again points the gun at Spade. This scene shows that Cairo was willing to try three tactics: pressure, legitimating, and exchange. He uses pressure and exchange twice, which could be seen as the use of a fourth tactic, assertiveness. Spade and Gutman Meetings At the beginning of the second half of our story we are introduced to Kasper Gutman, who invites Spade to a meeting in a hotel room. Gutman proposes a toast to “plain speaking and clear understanding”, states that the two should get along well, and compliments Spade on his cleverness (Hammettt 128). These complimentary acts attempt to put Spade at ease, fitting with an ingratiation tactic. They also fit with the referent power base, as they work to make Gutman more likable. Spade, however, remains mostly unaffected and uninfluenced. He does use the appeal as an opportunity to probe Gutman for information about the black bird, which at the time he actually had little information about. In this first meeting Spade does not get the information he desires, but is called to a second meeting the same day. Gutman reveals the history and value of the Maltese Falcon, and uses the tactic of rational persuasion using factual evidence to prove the value of the statue before asking Spade to take the case (Hammettt 151). Gutman also uses these facts to try to convince Spade that there is a lack of clear ownership rights for the object. Gutman finally offers Spade twenty-five thousand dollars to retrieve the statue, heavily relying on reward power and the tactic of exchange in this scene to convince Spade to work for him. In these two scenes Gutman tries to use the tactics of ingratiation and the referent power base to learn what Spade knows about the Maltese Falcon. When that does not work, he switches to rational persuasion to prove the value of the statue. Finally, Gutman relies on reward power using the tactic of exchange to convince Spade to retrieve the Maltese Falcon. Spade is influenced by money but only agrees to take the case so that he can solve the murder of his ex-partner. Spade’s own clear goal helps keep him focussed and less influenced by others in the narrative (Hammett 265). Conclusion As we have shown through this article, the management and psychology ideas of power bases and influence tactics map closely on the action in The Maltese Falcon. The struggle for the Maltese Falcon offers an environment where no single character has control, and only through successfully influencing others is progress possible. Power bases and influence tactics help us to better understand and analyse the characters and their actions; therefore The Maltese Falcon could potentially also be used in the classroom as a tool for illustrating these concepts. While none of our characters ended up with the real black bird, we as the audiences have gained much value from this noir classic. References Atwater, Leanne E., and Francis J.
