"2012","Melissa Gregg, Work’s Intimacy","Labor issues in the network society have attracted tremendous attention recently. Rather than totalizing contemporary working experience, Work’s Intimacy by Melissa Gregg focuses on the complexities and contradictions of mid-rank professionals, previously defined as white-collar workers and later on as knowledge workers. It comes out as a long “overdue” and valuably nuanced account of the impact of mobile/online technologies on work, life, and social relations. Based upon three-year ethnographic studies on 26 professionals in Brisbane, Australia, Gregg’s book successfully fills the gap in the existing literature on digital labor, which is drastically divided by the claim of “super-exploitation” and the advocacy of producers’ creativity (see Bruns, 2008; Terranova, 2000).","",""
"2012","Digital labor is the new killer app"," Research on digital labor tends to fall into idealized, oppositional binaries that are judgmental rather than based on detailed analyses of the actual system or site. Our goal in this article is to provide a view on digital labor that is grounded less in speculation but in narratives from the producers of the platforms and content of the digital economy. To provide original perspectives on digital work we emphasize the agency of the producers and freelancers working at the global outsourcing firm Samasource and the cable television network Current TV. Our analyses of these two cases reveal important questions regarding 1) the values and organizational culture of firm founders and executives and 2) the mobility of freelance workers within the networks of digital labor. In conclusion we interrogate how wealth is distributed within the network. Across these questions, we introduce a research agenda that considers to bridge the ethical challenges of labor exploitation as well as the promises of social entrepreneurship in the digital economy.

"2015","The cultural work of microwork"," Crowdsourcing systems do more than get information work done. This paper argues that microwork systems produce the difference between “innovative” laborers and “menial” laborers, ameliorating resulting tensions in new media production cultures in turn. This paper focuses on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) as an emblematic case of microwork crowdsourcing. Ethical research on crowdsourcing has focused on questions of worker fairness and microlabor alienation. This paper focuses on the cultural work of AMT’s mediations: divisions of labor and software interfaces. This paper draws from infrastructure studies and feminist science and technology studies to examine Amazon Mechanical Turk labor practice, its methods of worker control, and the kinds of users it produces.

Drawing on literature from science and technology studies and media studies, we argue that there is an opportunity to move beyond discussions of technology as a ‘black box’ in order to deepen these entanglements and expose the frictions within these discourses. As a means of engaging with the ways in which the future of work is being imagined and opening up discussions around technology, we conducted a one-day participatory design workshop that uses a game in order to reveal the philosophies embedded in labour activism and technology. doi: 10.15307/fcj.26.189.2015 issue 26: Entanglements Activism and Technology","",""
"2016","Rebalancing interests and power structures on crowdworking platforms","Crowdwork on virtual platforms is developing into a recognisable employment and business model on the internet. Despite their many differences, the platforms that have emerged over the last few years have one thing in common: a crowd of individual producers and capabilities is mobilised – in the form of labour, accommodation or durable goods – onto the market in cooperation and competition with firms from traditional industries. This study analyses the factors crowdworkers consider relevant in their work and the measures they view as helpful in improving their working relationship with platforms. It is apparent that, in the best tradition of the peer economy, this new type of worker still considers learning and fun important factors for his or her engagement. Despite these effectively intrinsic factors, workers are quite aware of their situation, which does not put them on equal terms with the platform’s algorithms and customer focus. This awareness of power disparities does not lead them, however, to reconsider their effectiveness when it comes to renegotiating terms with the platform: when specifically asked about the role of unions, the majority of crowdworkers did not expect help in self-organisation from these institutions. Considering the difficulties in regulating the market for platforms, (self-) organisation of crowdworkers, however, is an important prerequisite in rebalancing the power structure dominated by platform owners and their customers. Selforganisation is something digital natives are quite familiar with and we have to assume that crowdworkers are perhaps overconfident in their abilities. And due to the novelty of this industry, this confidence has not been shaken yet by labour disputes or even by growing dissatisfaction with platforms.","",""
"2016","Metaphors of free labor: a typology of unpaid work in the media sector"," Over the last decade, free labor has emerged as a key analytical tool for understanding new or semi-new forms of labor in the contemporary digital economy. This article critiques and develops this concept, with specific reference to work in the media industries, by presenting a historically grounded typology of free labor that also highlights some of the analytical problems with the current use of the concept. Our typology presents seven metaphors of free labor based on historical instances of roles people have taken on when performing unpaid labor: those of The Slave, The Carer, The Apprentice, The Prospector, The Hobbyist, The Volunteer, and The Patsy. A key conclusion is that free labor is performed by different actors at either end of increasingly complex and temporally stretched out value chains. This necessitates a more fine-grained and historicized use of the concept of free labor. ","",""

"2017","Venture Labor| How Venture Labor Sheds Light on the Digital Platform Economy","I draw attention to the entrepreneurial ideology that underlies both venture labor and several manifestations of digital labor, defined as deskilled and underpaid/unpaid work performed for online platforms. If contemporary workers seem more willing to accept the burden of entrepreneurial risk or the hardships of underpaid undertakings, this is because they reinterpret value-producing tasks as aligned with their private goals. At the same time, both venture labor and “implicit” work on digital platforms raise issues of distributive justice connected to value capture and centralization, thus increasing the potential for social antagonism and conflict.","",""

"2017","Digital Mediation, Soft Cabs, and Spatial Labour","Abstract Critics of digitally mediated labour platforms (often called the “sharing” or “gig economy”) have focused on the character and extent of the control exerted by these platforms over both workers and customers, and in particular on the precarizing impact on the workers on whose labor the services depend. Less attention has been paid to the specifically spatial character of the forms of work targeted by mobile digital platforms. The production and maintenance of urban social space has always been dependent, to a large degree, on work that involves the crossing of spatial boundaries - particularly between public and private spaces, but also crossing spaces segregated by class, race, and gender. Delivery workers, cabdrivers, day labourers, home care providers, and similar boundary-crossers all perform spatial work: the work of moving between and connecting spaces physically, experientially, and through representation. Spatial work contributes to the production and reproduction of social space; it is also productive of three specific, though interrelated, products: physical movement from one place to another; the experience of this movement; and the articulation of these places, experiences, and movements with visions of society and of the social. Significantly, it is precisely such spatial work, and its products, which mobile digital platforms seek most urgently to transform. Drawing on several recent studies of “ridesharing” (or soft cab) labour platforms, I interrogate the impact of digital mediation on the actual practices involved in spatial work. I argue that the roll-out of digital labour platforms needs to be understood in terms of a struggle over the production of social space.","",""
"2017","The labor of online product promotion: Barriers to collective action","Theorists have suggested that precarity — an experience of risk and uncertainty — increasingly describes the work experiences of many different kinds of contractual workers: from highly paid freelancers to those who pick up odd jobs. Theorists have further suggested that this common experience of precarity might serve as the basis for collective action. I contribute to this discussion by attempting to understand how individuals who work online promoting products experience precarity in different ways. Based on interviews with professional bloggers and members of a group that I refer to as the flexibly unemployed, I describe the characteristics and work practices of these groups, as well as their interactions. I argue that bloggers’ exploitation of the flexibly unemployed, together with their ideologies toward labor, act as barriers to collective action. I conclude by suggesting that, rather than imagining that workers from different classes will find common ground, communication systems should be developed that allow workers to network and share information in ways that are isolated from members of other classes and outside of online work platforms that commoditize social relationships and interactions.","",""
"2017","The flow of digital labor"," Digital microwork is a type of labor that many—typically poorly paid—workers engage in. In our research, we focus on an experience-based model of digital labor and the nonmonetary benefits derived from such activities. Based on a survey of 701 workers at Amazon Mechanical Turk, we demonstrate that experiences during digital labor sequences generate flow-like states of immersion. We show that reaching flow-like states while performing microwork depends on certain work characteristics, such as the particular worker’s degree of autonomy, the extent to which a worker’s skills are utilized, and the apparent significance of and feedback derived from the task. The results both highlight the importance of flow-like immersion in explaining why individuals engage in digital labor projects and point to avenues that can lead to the design of better digital work experiences.

"2018","A New Women’s Work: Digital Interactions, Gender, and Social Network Sites","This research explores social network site interaction through digital and gendered labor. Due to enhanced interaction possibilities as well as mining and analytic techniques, all digital interaction is labor, at both the social and institutional level. Responses to a survey ( N  = 455) suggest that digital labor varies depending on the most-used social network site. In addition, women test higher in agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism, and contribute statistically more emotional labor online through liking and commenting. Women describe intricate processes of deciding whether they can or should socially interact, often fearing interpersonal conflict or being told they are stupid. Men, on the other hand, view social network sites as places for entertainment and base their emotional labor on some judged entertainment value. As such, this study illuminates how social network sites function as extensions of the home. Instead of being invited to contribute new cultural products, women are frequently led to support only those that already exist, arguably creating data that contain less use value and even  more  exchange and surplus value than other forms of digital labor.","",""
"2018","Crowdsourcing as a Platform for Digital Labor Unions","Global complex supply chains have made it difficult to know the realities in factories. This structure obfuscates the networks, channels, and flows of communication between employers, workers, nongovernmental organizations and other vested intermediaries, creating a lack of transparency. Factories operate far from the brands themselves, often in developing countries where labor is cheap and regulations are weak. However, the emergence of social media and mobile technology has drawn the world closer together. Specifically, crowdsourcing is being used in an innovative way to gather feedback from outsourced laborers with access to digital platforms. This article examines how crowdsourcing platforms are used for both gathering and sharing information to foster accountability. We critically assess how these tools enable dialogue between brands and factory workers, making workers part of the greater conversation. We argue that although there are challenges in designing and implementing these new monitoring systems, these platforms can pave the path for new forms of unionization and corporate social responsibility beyond just rebranding.","",""
"2018","A Crowded Future: Working against Abstraction on Turker Nation","This paper examines digital labor and community through an ethnography of a discussion board supporting short-term digital contract workers on the Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk). First, we give a thorough overview of mTurk, the crowdsourcing marketplace, and Turker Nation, a discussion board for workers on mTurk. We trace the experience of interacting with this infrastructure on mTurk as worker and employer. Following, we look at scholarship on software infrastructure and autonomous Marxist theorizations of contemporary work. We demonstrate how the labor of participating on the discussion board Turker Nation helps to counter the abstraction the infrastructure provides. We show how workers on Turker Nation use the platform to structure time, build socializing spaces at work and initiate collective organizing. In doing so, we argue that workers’ labor belies conventional class classification, such as white-collar and blue-collar labor and instead lays the groundwork for how to structure future digital workplaces. We argue that this laboring resists the assumed logic of capitalism for digital labor that subsumes and takes over workers’ lives and conclude by looking at the limitations of the community’s collective organizing in terms of agreeing on points to communicated to the public.","",""
"2018","Thrown under the bus and outrunning it! The logic of Didi and taxi drivers’ labour and activism in the on-demand economy"," This article examines how taxi drivers adapt to, manipulate and fight against the rise of ride-hailing platforms like Didi Chuxing in China (which purchased Uber China). Chinese taxi drivers entered the on-demand labour platforms before private car drivers. Based on a nationwide data survey, the article argues that the technological power of Didi took shape by reinforcing inequalities facing informally employed taxi drivers prior to the emergence of ride-hailing apps. Drivers, far from being passive app users, have counteracted the changes in the work environment that resulted from platformisation in new and evolving ways, from strikes to algorithmic activism. This study suggests that online platforms are contested spaces where digital labour politics penetrate beyond the purported algorithmic power of the technology. The article enriches researches on on-demand labour by deconstructing the distinction between taxi drivers and private gig drivers and by pointing to the unfolding new grounds for digital labour activism.

"2018","Between autonomy and control: Strategies of arbitrage in the “on-demand” economy"," The “on-demand” economy is built upon company strategies of arbitrage between worker autonomy and worker control. Using ethnographic and interview data, I show how these strategies undermine the economic theory that justifies the on-demand business model. The increased freedom and flexibility on offer to workers is countered by “softer” and less visible forms of workforce surveillance and control. These take hold through information asymmetries, which narrow workers’ decision-making capacities and thus undercut arguments for workers’ designation as independent contractors. However, I also show that these forms of control ultimately hinge on workers’ willingness to conform to the calculative rationalities that companies project onto them, and that workers’ motivations diverge from these company assumptions. I conclude by countering the notion of calculability with that of “qualculation,” an affective style of reasoning that workers employ in response to algorithmic workforce management and which highlights how on-the-job decisions are made within a shifting moral economy of work.

"2018","Trusted strangers: Carework platforms’ cultural entrepreneurship in the on-demand economy"," On-demand labor platforms offer many in-person services, from ride-hailing to childcare. However, scholars have focused on ride-hailing, leading to a model of “Uberization” that entails the informalization of work. We argue that online carework platforms that match nannies and babysitters to families show the limits of this narrative. Based on a discourse analysis of carework platforms and interviews with workers using them, we illustrate that these platforms seek to formalize employment relationships through technologies that increase visibility. We argue that carework platforms are “cultural entrepreneurs” that create and maintain cultural distinctions between populations of workers, and institutionalize those distinctions into platform features. Ultimately, the visibility created by platforms does not realize the formalization of employment relationships, but does serve the interests of platform companies and clients and exacerbate existing inequalities for workers. As one of the first analyses of carework platforms, this study also points to gendered bias in the scholarly literature about the on-demand economy. ","",""
"2019","BRIDGING, COACHING, AND BOUNDARY SPANNING: BROKERAGE AND INTERMEDIATION IN THE PHILIPPINE ONLINE PLATFORM LABOR ECONOMY","The increasing networked connectivity and affordability of technology facilitated the rise of digitally-mediated service work. Workers, mostly located in the Global South, can now directly obtain ‘gigs’ through online labor platforms and microwork intermediaries such as Upwork and Onlinejobs.ph. Within the Philippine digital labor economy, we see an emerging category of digital labor intermediaries—locally called peer mentors and coaches-- who are playing a significant role in the expansion and continued uptake of digital platform labor in the country. Building on and drawing connections between earlier works on the influencer economy (Abidin, 2015; Senft, 2013; and Marwick, 2013) and on labor migration brokerage literature (Shreshta &amp; Yeoh, 2018; Lin, Lindquist, Xiang, &amp; Yeoh, 2017), the paper conceptualizes digital labor brokerage arising within various ‘spaces of (labor) intermediation.’ Drawing from participant observation in online freelancing Facebook groups and interviews with these brokers and digital workers, we examine the transactional nature underlying the ‘producer-audience’ relationship of digital labor brokerage, the activation of trust and influence through mediated encounters, and the power dynamic underlying the digitally mediated symbolic and material power taking place between them and their respective teams. The paper seeks to contribute to the digital labor literature in two ways: 1) by characterizing the emergence of digital labor brokers in a digital labor supplying country in the global South, the role they play in the digital platform labor economy and the interventions that they engage; and 2) analyzing the structural conditions that facilitate the emergence of digital labor brokerage.","",""
"2019","LABOUR AND DIGITIZATION","In 2011, artist Andrew Norman Wilson was working as a subcontractor doing video work for Google at the Mountainview California Googleplex. He’d noticed that the workers entering and exiting the building next door had different working conditions to the majority of the workers at the site and discovered they were working on the Google Books mass digitization project. One day he took his camera down to film them leaving the building at the end of the shift and the next day he was fired. Wilson used the footage to create a video he calls “Workers Leaving the Googleplex” (2011), and projects such as Krissy Wilson’s “The Art of Google Books” destabilise the fictional veneer of smooth clean surfaces that the Google Books project projects into the world. The growing field of critical infrastructure studies helps us to unpack and understand the multiple dimensions operating This paper argues that notions of the particularities of digital labour of all kinds are central to developing a more comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted nature of digital cultural objects, both born-digital and digitised. The paper considers the often invisible, contingent, omitted or assumed labour involved in digitization projects, using thinking from critical infrastructure studies, new media, media archaeology and creative labour.","",""

It argues that LanguaSpeak, through both its interface and users’ communicative practice, unwittingly reinforces existing language ideologies, particularly around race. In making this argument, the article suggests the notion of “intersectional English(es)” as a means through which scholars can productively consider the ways in which race, nationality, and language intersect and are (re)enforced through online interfaces/interaction. Drawing on data collected from the profiles of English teachers from the United States and the Philippines, this article examines how language, nationality, and race intersect on LanguaSpeak. Key differences identified between the two countries’ teachers include price and marketing strategies. Specifically, White male American teachers are found to enjoy significant advantages over other teachers, reflecting dominant language ideologies. This has implications for English language teaching and language discrimination more broadly.","",""
"2020","Mobile social media as platforms in workers’ unionization","ABSTRACT This study explores the use of mobile social media in three successive campaigns to unionize workers (2012–2014) in Israel. We examine the workers’ efforts to initiate a union in their workplace as a sociomaterial process of organizing. An analysis of unionization-related Facebook pages and interviews with union activists reveals how the activists leveraged the portable-visibility afforded by social media networks (Facebook and WhatsApp) and mobile devices (Smartphones) to create and express their collective voice, achieving both mobilization of workers and recognition by management. The analysis traces how the activists tactically leveraged the portable-visibility of the media they used, fine-tuning visibility and manipulating portability during the covert and overt phases of their campaign. In the conclusion, we unpack the challenges involved in utilizing these neoliberal platforms in workers unionization efforts within the organizational setting and discuss the implications of these tensions for the study of both organizational resistance and mass protest.","",""
"2020","Delivering Edinburgh: uncovering the digital geography of platform labour in the city","ABSTRACT This article makes visible the unseen and obscured cycling routes of on-demand, app-based food couriers in Edinburgh, Scotland, drawing from qualitative research (twenty-five interviews with riders), original digital data gathered through smartphone apps, and a custom-made mapping workflow developed in collaboration with student researchers and used by Deliveroo riders to track and map their delivery work. Qualitative research among riders suggests the presence of ‘two Edinburghs,’ or a city divided not only by its physical geography but by the navigation of risks. Riders actively discuss the strategies they use to negotiate the city and stay safe while working, and the geolocalised digital data they produce reveal the ways in which such negotiations become collective navigations throughout the city. By exploring, visualising, and mapping these navigations, this article uses unique data to illustrate how on-demand food couriers create, modify, and reproduce social space in the city. We suggest that forms of urban platform hacking, when coupled with qualitative work, constitute a powerful instrument to challenge top-down urban narratives that foreground the integrated, optimised flow of resources and labour as a hegemonic vector in the city.","",""
"2020","The winners and the losers of the platform economy: who participates?","ABSTRACT The platform economy is rapidly transforming the dynamics of the labor market. Optimists argue platform work functions as a social equalizer, opening opportunities for additional earnings for those who need it most. Pessimists suggest that the platform economy widens earning disparities by providing additional income to people who already have good jobs. We contribute to this debate by examining who participates in the platform economy and their motivation for participation, using a US nationally representative sample. Our findings offer support for both perspectives. Those who participated in labor-exchange platforms were more likely to come from disadvantaged backgrounds. By contrast, those who participated in online selling platforms were more likely to come from more affluent backgrounds. When we further examined different types of platform work, we found that different types of platform work were performed by different demographic and social groups. In addition, participation in some platform work, such as rideshare driving and house/laundry cleaning, is motivated out of necessity, while other platform work, such as selling used goods and performing online tasks, is generally used to supplement incomes. Distinct occupations tend to benefit different social groups in different ways and, taken together, disadvantaged groups are less likely to perform types of platform work that would improve their economic position and reduce income disparities. This tends to offer more support for the pessimist’s perspective. We conclude that the platform economy is strongly segregated by occupation and it should be examined as a set of distinct occupations rather than a homogenous industry.","",""
"2020","Spatially shaped imaginaries of the digital economy","ABSTRACT This paper examines spatial imaginaries and their ability to circumscribe and legitimate economic practices mediated by digital technologies, specifically, the practices of digital entrepreneurship. The question is whether alternative imaginaries and typologies of digital entrepreneurship can be included in how we view digital entrepreneurship order to stimulate new practices and imagined futures. Our case studies of digital entrepreneurs in a number of African cities illustrate that popular and academic spatial imaginaries and discourses, for example those that cast the digital economy as borderless and accessible, do not correspond with the experience of many African entrepreneurs. Furthermore, enacting the metaphoric identities that coincide with these imaginaries and their discourses is a skillset that determines which (and how) actors can participate. They reflect the inherent coloniality of the digital, capitalist discourse. The tendency in the digital economy is to regard the entrepreneur persona, as realistic and global, rather than performative and particular to the Euro-American context in which these personas have originated. Our interviews of 186 digital entrepreneurs demonstrate that digital imaginaries and metaphors cannot be neutral and apolitical. In order to be inclusive, they should evoke a sense of multiplicity, heterogeneity and contingency.","",""

From being leased work force building the railway in the United States to constructing canal systems in Sweden, prisoners’ labor has been widespread as an important part of value production. Part of the labor conducted by incarcerated people is related to the production, repair, and maintenance of media devices and media infrastructures constituting what we call prison media work. In this article, we trace the changing logics of prison media work historically since the inception of the modern prison at the turn of the 20th century. Based on archival material, interviews, and field observations, we outline a shift from physical manual labor toward the work of being tracked that is constitutive of surveillance capitalism in- and outside of the prison. We argue that prison media work holds an ambiguous position combining elements of exploitation and rehabilitation, but most importantly it is a dystopian magnifying glass of media work under surveillance capitalism.

This article offers a typology of the injuries enacted by platform logistics, taking online retail as its focus and using Amazon as an exemplar. Cognitive Injury occurs when platforms act to conceal their operation from the awareness of users. Hidden Injury is enacted on the invisible labour that sustains platform functionality, a precarious workforce that labours under harsh conditions and within hostile spaces, somewhere below the cognisance of the user. Moral Injury speaks of the way that platform logistics, in concealing from awareness the conditions that sustain its operation, attacks the ability of users, or of a society at large, to act with responsibility. These injuries are shown to be at play in the processes that facilitate buying online and order fulfilment. It is argued that the speed of purchasing and delivery enacts an unconscious consumption, which dislocates users from the labour that delivers the goods, creating a kind of perceptual pollution that diminishes a sense of moral responsibility.

From a methodological approach via workers’ inquiry and content analysis, this paper aims to theoretically frame the effects (and affects) resulting from Amazon’s strategy of augmented despotism, which engenders new forms of domination mediated and augmented by digital tools. Through a content analysis of online video confessionals detailing the physical and mental experiences of worker burnout and breakdown, this paper aims to bring the voices of (ex)-workers at Amazon to the forefront of understanding Amazon’s integrated architectures of labour management, surveillance, and control. The focus of this content analysis will be on the experiences of “broken” Amazon workers interacting with Amazon’s technological media apparatus of augmented despotism, with a special focus on the company's virtual health clinic: Amazon Care. As worker confessionals on YouTube attest, Amazon Care is as much an architecture of managerial surveillance, control, and discipline as it is of “care.” While other wearable and trackable technologies haunt the Amazon worker during their shift, Amazon Care extends the company’s technological power beyond the confines of the fulfillment center. Drawing from political and technological theories of labour and care, this paper will look into how Amazon workers navigate (and often escape) the affective and embodied confines of Amazon's augmented despotism.","",""
"2020","PLATFORM COUNTERPUBLICS: GOSSIP &amp; CONTESTED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ONLINE   LABOR PLATFORMS","As commercial platforms mediate large swaths of online markets for information and services, scholars have shown how users resist, or work around these opaque digital environments. From content producers to Uber drivers, digital laborers are particularly adept at appropriating and gaming platforms like YouTube, and Uber (Chen 2017; Duffy 2017; Rosenblat 2018). Often described as “multi-sided markets,” platforms bring together many different kinds of stakeholders, including consumers, workers, advertisers, and regulators (Gillespie 2010; Lingel 2020). However, investigations of working alongside algorithms have so far focused on workers’ relationship to algorithms, and neglected other stakeholders. Extending counterpublics theories (Warner 2002; Fraser 1990), we examine over 3,000 online reviews of a labor platform, Care.com, finding that both workers and clients use gossip to create a $2 that constructs a counternarrative about platform business practices. While previous studies suggest that different platform stakeholders have conflicting interests, we find that platform counterpublics draw both workers and clients together to draw boundaries demarcating acceptable platform business practices. Second, we point to the implications of platform counterpublics for the investigation of platform labor and algorithms. Consumer reviews of platforms are absent from critical literature on labor platforms. By bringing together scholarship on counterpublics with critical literature on labor platforms, this paper offers a relational approach to platforms.","",""

How is data cleaning related to digitization work and AI training in prisons? This panel suggests bringing these diverse ways of laboring in the digital economies together by considering these practices as infrastructural labor that takes the shape of shadow work (Illich, 1981) and ghost labor (Gray &amp; Suri, 2019). Work and labor in modern, capitalist society imply power, authority and possibility for resistance, and these dimensions are crucial for understanding why and how infrastructures are realized and how they work. Infrastructure labor is ambiguous. It is both visible and invisible depending on the specific tasks and their inherent power relations (Leigh Star &amp; Strauss, 1999). It includes both manual and cognitive labor. It is geared towards innovation as well as repair, maintenance and servitude. The panel aims to paint the contours of infrastructural labor at the margins of digital economies pointing towards forms of alienation and resistance that have for long been part of labor relations, but that are renegotiated in the context of emerging technologies within digital economies that need human labor to be sustained and further innovated.","",""

Research on platform labor has been mostly done in the global north, as well as in relation to global platforms like Uber or Amazon (Rosenblat 2019; Scholz 2016). Thus, the panelists, moreover, explore how the lives of platform workers can be improved within the global platform economy by analyzing workers’ subjectivities in relation to platforms and the impact of technologies in job quality. To achieve this, this panel brings together scholars from global north and south countries that will map the complexities and subjectivities of platform workers in order to tame platform capitalism. We present a set of articles that address: (1) regulatory resistance that clarifies and redefines the rules that platforms need to abide by; (2) bottom-up resistance of platform workers who seek to organize, subvert, and build alternatives; (3) the ways that action research can support either of those initiatives to ultimately tame some of the worst excesses of platform capitalism.","",""
"2020","Digitizing freelance media labor: A class of workers negotiates entrepreneurialism and activism"," Due to economic instability and technological change in digital media industries, media organizations and educators have encouraged freelance media workers to see themselves as individual businesses rather than a class of workers that should collectively protect their rights and fair pay. This article examines how freelance media workers negotiate individualism and collectivism, producing a contradictory freelance class ideology. It is grounded in an exploratory critical political economy of communication and sociology of work approach. It is based on interviews with 21 freelance journalists and professional writers, considering how they discursively construct their work practices and coping strategies vis-à-vis their uses of digital technology and the structural factors that shape media industries. Through discourse, these workers produce a contradictory “e-lance” class ideology as both entrepreneurs who temporarily sell goods and services and activists who temporarily resist demands from clients that they give up their rights and pay.

Using ethnographic data, the study elucidated multiple facets of couriers’ temporality in their struggle to meet the exacting delivery time imposed by platforms while moving through biased urban spaces as marginalized temporal subjects. It is argued that a new temporal order, referred to as temporal arbitrage in this study, has been normalized in the recent platform economy. It shifts the customer’s cultural expectation to on-demand service at the expense of an increasingly hectic tempo for the workers. We demonstrate the mundane, and sometimes opportunistic, tactics deployed by workers to reconstruct their temporality. The article connects the workers’ temporality to the urban spaces, digital work process, and socioeconomic structures. It fills an important research gap by addressing the under-explored yet essential temporal dimensions in the expanding “just-in-time” labor force. ","",""
"2020","Brick-and-Platform: Listing Labor in the Digital Vintage Economy"," Vintage goods are valued for their nostalgic association with pre-digital modes of production, but their contemporary trafficking is increasingly organized by processes of platformization. The central component of what we call “listing labor in the digital vintage economy” is the online display of collectible merchandise, but listing labor also entails promoting sellers’ brands on social media and using sales platforms and other logistical media to manage inventory, process transactions, and handle shipments. Listing labor is performed by branded merchants and their employees alongside independent entrepreneurs. The digital vintage economy connects brick-and-mortar shops and resale supply chains organized around flea markets, thrift shops and charity bins, estate sales, and consigners, to online clearinghouses like eBay and Craigslist, and to social media and payment apps. In this article, we argue that listing labor in the digital vintage economy further develops the concept of “platform labor.” We focus on vintage clothes and vinyl records, dominated by women and men, respectively, to help us analyze divisions of listing labor organized by gender, race, age, and class. We draw upon 20 semi-structured interviews with shop owners and employees and on participant observation in independently owned clothing boutiques and record stores in several US cities. The digital vintage economy provides another angle for understanding how identity-based distinctions affect the opportunities associated with platform labor, and our account of listing labor highlights the need for studies of platformization that analyze its effects on specific local economies as well as on job markets and commercial sectors.

"2020","The Outsourcing of Online Dating: Investigating the Lived Experiences of Online Dating Assistants Working in the Contemporary Gig Economy"," A small cottage industry emerging within the larger gig economy is online dating assistant (ODA) companies that allow paying clients to outsource the labor associated with online dating, including profile development, date selection and matching, and even interaction (i.e., ODAs assume their clients’ identities to exchange messages with other [unsuspecting] daters to secure face-to-face dates). The newness of this industry presents an opportunity to investigate the lived experience of remote employees working in an up-and-coming virtual organization. Through interviews with six ODAs, we explored motivations, day-to-day workflow, and development of work identities. Analysis uncovered unique challenges ODAs faced when performing the “human-based” tasks of online dating, which differed starkly from other popular services being bought and sold in the gig economy (e.g., rideshare, food delivery). Findings also show how ODAs engage in pragmatic and critical sensemaking as they navigate the specific challenges associated with ODA labor, and those created by remote work and gig labor, more generally.

The article first problematizes labor marginality in the context of online freelance platform workers situated in the middle of competing narratives of precarity and opportunity. We then examine unique forms of solidarity emerging from social media groups formed by these geographically spread digital workers. Drawing from participant observation in online freelance Facebook groups, as well as interviews and focus groups with 31 online freelance workers located in the cities of Manila, Cebu, and Davao, we found that online Filipino freelancers maintain active social interaction and exchange that can be construed as “entrepreneurial solidarities.” These solidarities are characterized by competing discourses of ambiguity, precarity, opportunity, and adaptation that are articulated and visualized through ambient socialities. While we argue that these entrepreneurial solidarities do not reflect a passive and simplistic acceptance of neoliberal discourses about digital labor by digital workers, the solidarities forged in these groups also work to undermine their resistive potential such that these tend to reinforce rather than impose pressure toward critical structural changes that can improve the viability of digital labor conditions.

Through a case study of popular feminism, the article traces the ways in which glamour, defined as a beguiling affective force linked to promotional capitalist logics, suffuses digital content, metrics, and platforms. From the formal aesthetic codes of the ubiquitous beauty and lifestyle Instagram feeds that perpetuate the beguiling promise of popular feminism, to the enticing simplicity of online metrics and scores that promise transformative social connection and approbation, to the political economic drive for total information awareness and concomitant disciplining, predicting and optimizing of consumer-citizens, the article argues that the ambivalent aesthetic of glamour provides an apt descriptor and compelling heuristic for digital cultural production today.

In this article, I discuss some of the newer strategies of resistance gaining prominence among industrial workers, especially as they are mediated through digital media. Focusing on online self-work underpinning worker agitations, I argue that contemporary labor movement should devise creative strategies using new media tools, to which the millennial worker has unprecedented access, in addition to their traditional rank and file struggles, to counter contemporary challenges.

We analyze documents, fieldwork interviews from twenty-eight actors, and observation of events in Barcelona, Paris, and Berlin during 2015–2017. We find that there are three dominant ideological strands: “sharing economy,” “commons,” and “platform cooperativism,” within a spectrum that ranges from legitimizing neoliberalism and/or reasserting a reformist, more humane capitalism to more radical visions: cooperative society to commons-oriented production, and resisting privatization, through the recapturing of public space as commons. The actors we interviewed can be seen as part of an intermediate class, dependent on platforms for their survival, and who end up involuntary promoters of their own alienation and exploitation, consolidating the deterioration of the very digital labor conditions they seek to transform.

An area that exemplifies this opposition is the study of digital unionizing. Labor studies scholarship tends to focus on institutions while communication research often privileges the individual. This article extends these two approaches by outlining three key considerations in what shapes online collective action within working-class and worker struggles: context, class and community. I also conceptualize this methodological framework to study digital unionizing and labor organizing more broadly, which I refer to as the 3C Method. The empirical foundation for this methodological argument derives from existing literature, as well as select findings from a three-year digital organizing research project.","",""

Yet there has been a lack of systematic frameworks that could evaluate this type of labor against decent work standards, and inform consumers and others about relative adherence to those standards across platforms and sectors. In this article we report the development of the “Fairwork framework”, based on five decent work principles of fair pay, conditions, contracts, management, and representation. The framework and its associated methodology were first field-tested in South Africa and we report on its use to rate seven gig economy platforms. A league table of platforms was widely publicized and one platform was persuaded to improve working conditions. We reflect on the use and content of the framework, and its role in future action research on decent gig work.","",""
"2021","Digital labour: an empty signifier?"," Since the early 2000s, the expression ‘digital labour’ has identified an influential theoretical proposition in the Marxist critique of the political economy of digital media, which sees the leisure-driven, unpaid activities of social media users as unremunerated forms of work contributing to Internet companies’ profits. Over the years, however, this expression has evolved into an umbrella term, used to describe a variety of practices and instances concerning the broader relationship between labour and digital technology – including paid work – often with little or no relation to the original theory. Reflecting on this evolution, this article argues that ‘digital labour’ has become a kind of empty signifier, unable to serve a clearly distinguishable critical or analytical purpose. Focusing on the emergence of platform labour, it shows how ‘digital’ and ‘labour’ have come to be largely inseparable dimensions and discusses the related implications. ","",""

The analysis consider following dimensions: productive processes and work         organization, technological challenges and building platforms, use of social media to         communicate with and organize workers, and the future of worker-owned experiences. The         initiatives had very different trajectories. In Spain, some cooperatives were born from         union struggles. In France, we saw a strong relationship with CoopCycle, a federation of         delivery co-ops that provides its own software based on the principles of digital commons.         And in Brazil, small collectives and co-ops that still depend on social media platforms to         execute their work are emerging. Despite different contexts, there are commonalities, such         as the low number of workers, the central role of social media for communicating and         organizing work, and the emergence of cooperation among cooperatives, which shows that scale         does not need to be a standard in platform economies. The conclusions point out there is an         ongoing and emerging process that can be the beginning of a broader process of reinventing         local economic circuits of production and consumption that involves digital platforms for         the common good.","",""

Specifically, we focus on different types of platform-based temporal         control and their respective effects on (a) workers’ autonomy, (b) value of free time, and         (c) their social and political connectedness. Theoretically, we draw on the sociology of         time and normative time literature in political theory. Empirically, the framework is         informed by the synthesis of the literature about algorithms in the gig economy, with         particular attention to the methods of temporal control. Meanwhile, we draw insights from a         larger comparative project that examines algorithmic labor control and resistance across         ride-hailing platforms (Uber and Lyft), TaskRabbit, and delivery platforms (DoorDash, Uber         Eats, and Instacart) in the United States. The project interviewed 50 gig workers between         2017 and 2020. Through a systematic synthesis of primary and secondary materials, this paper         contributes to understanding temporalities and work autonomy in the gig economy, and more         broadly, flexible workplaces where the boundaries between work and non-work time become         blurred.","",""

AMT is an online         platform where workers perform low-paid services that cannot be efficiently automated. Since         2019, in the Group [Anonymized excerpt], at the University [Anonymized excerpt], we have         carried out projects where we approach these workers in an attempt to understand their         routines, desires and the future of work itself.

Also         we concluded that AMT help keeping the women labor power available for unpaid domestic         services and, at the same time, make it profitable for several companies. To understand more         about them, we conducted a survey with 53 women turkers and systematized their responses.

This terminology suggests a sense of novelty in the nature of jobs and the upending of hierarchies by technological processes. This panel aims at excavating the pre-existing power dynamics between customers, workers and intermediaries. Taxi driving, delivering food and providing domestic care services have long been informal forms of work segregated along lines of caste, religion, class and gender in urban India. What has the platformisation of this work meant for workers, their experiences of work and the opening up of this work? Has the involvement of technological intermediaries led to an opening up and the opening up of this work outside of its parochial considerations of class, caste, gender, religion?

This         project is interested in questions about gender, race, labor, and platforms and seeks to         examine how Etsy articulates new formations of raced and gendered labor directly tied to The         Great Recession. While scholars have analyzed Etsy’s relationship to historic craft         movements (Krugh 2014; Luckman 2013) and to fan handicrafting (Cherry 2016), there is still         relatively little published research on the platform. Situating Etsy within the literature         on postfeminism and media culture (Gill 2007; McRobbie 2004), gender and passionate work         (Duffy 2016; Duffy 2017; McRobbie 2018), and race and digital hustle economies (McMillan         Cottom 2020), I analyze products sold on Etsy that rhetorically engage gendered labor         dynamics and precarity through the language of hustling or entrepreneurship in ways that         center white femininities. Utilizing a cultural studies framing and critical discourse and         textual analysis, I identify three main threads: 1) White women on the platform have         co-opted Black vernacular to address how economic insecurity has pushed them into gig labor         2) These products romanticize precarity by positioning feminized grit and individualized         solutions to macro economic hurdles as female empowerment 3) The products discursively frame         entrepreneurship as aspirational, liberatory, and, most centrally, compatible with white,         domestic femininities. While hustling, and its new, white appearance, is celebrated on Etsy,         we must be mindful of how hustling is always raced, gendered, and precarious.","",""

The photographic profession is an ideal context in which to examine such questions due to the fragmentation of the workforce and the recent proliferation of platforms. The findings revealed that the level of worker engagement is explained by platform control over price, service and product quality, and relationship management.

In the company’s warehouses, barcodes allow commodities to be construed as information to be managed. Work is thus mediated and organized digitally, as algorithms assign tasks and surveil workers. But it would be futile to analyze the technical organization of labor without studying the authoritarian nature of work under capitalist relations. Interviews with workers and managers unearth the material and cultural infrastructures that underpin Amazon labor. Early Italian operaismo, or workerist theory, offers a framework to analyze digital capitalism’s strategies to secure workers’ cooperation with machinery.

Through a qualitative content analysis of profiles (n=60) sampled from the top and bottom search results in three different US zip codes, I find that visibility is often related to connectivity, response time, and positive reviews, and who is rendered visible mirrors preexisting inequalities. The language of “passion” for the job is common across top and bottom profiles, indicating a contradiction between the deemphasis on professionalization and the high level of connectivity and responsiveness present in top profiles.","",""

Building up on a theoretical framework to situate the concept of affordances, gendered affordances and cyberviolence within a platform economy context, I use UpWork as a relevant case study to assess how online platforms that intermediate labour transactions present gendered affordances contributing to cyberviolence against women. I analysed the discussions of female users and freelancers in UpWork in line with the digital methods approach, by conducting a qualitative digital ethnographic analysis. These discussions serve as a foundation for a subsequent critical analysis of UpWork terms of service, to gain a wider understanding of how the digital platform controls information flows and models interactions between different categories of users. The findings suggest that UpWork affordances are gendered affordances, as they allow male users different conducts, as opposed to female freelancers, entrepreneurs, or users. I conclude that, while UpWork core features are allegedly neutral, they enable gendered affordances widening the gender gap in digital market transactions by facilitating the occurrence of cyber violence against women.","",""

Changing perceptions of gig workers on Twitter in the onset of COVID-19","ABSTRACT While ride-hailing ridership declined in 2020 due to COVID-19 induced restrictions like stay-at-home orders, food/grocery delivery services became quasi-essential. This study investigates if and how public perceptions of gig work related to platform-based ride-hailing and food/grocery delivery services changed during the early stages of the pandemic. We collected a sample of 23,845 Twitter posts (‘tweets’) related to these platform-based services within two-week periods before and after the US COVID-19 emergency declaration. Sentiment analysis on tweets was conducted to investigate changes in public perception of gig work. Tweet content was analyzed by descriptively coding about 10% of the sample of tweets manually along ten different dimensions (e.g., personal experience, informative, and about driver); then we used thematic analysis to gain an understanding about the public’s views towards gig work/workers. We tested supervised machine learning methods to explore their potential to classify the rest of the sample along the ten descriptive dimensions. The number of tweets increased by approximately 150% after the emergency declaration and became more positive in sentiment. Qualitative results indicate that tweets about negative personal experiences with drivers/companies decreased during COVID-19, while tweets exhibiting a sense of community (e.g., sharing information) and concern towards gig workers increased. Findings can inform policy and workforce changes regarding platform-based service companies.","",""
"2022","Embedded reproduction in platform data work","ABSTRACT This paper focuses on the experiences of Latin American data workers who annotate data for machine learning algorithms through labor platforms. It introduces the notion of ‘embedded reproduction’: the relationship between embeddedness, the degree to which non-economic institutions and their social environment constrain socioeconomic activity, and social reproduction, or the activities that nurture, maintain, and regenerate the workforce. The analysis of 38 interviews with platform workers suggests they are situated in a highly disembedded market due to the lack of regulations on the data production process, giving free rein to platforms to set rules to their detriment. This article explores how this disembeddedness shapes social reproduction by studying three forms of collective social support received by workers: from family members, neighbors and local communities, and online groups. The support of these networks is primarily local, depends on high levels of trust, and is gendered. These findings suggest that platform data work is unsustainable from an embedded reproductive perspective since platform intermediation leads workers and local communities to carry out the social and economic risks associated with this form of gig work. This research invites a dialogue between the embeddedness framework with social reproduction as well as a consideration of the importance of nature and natural resources in the study of social environments.","",""
"2022","Beyond algorithmic control: flexibility, intermediaries, and paradox in the on-demand economy","ABSTRACT The existing literature on labor control of on-demand platforms primarily concentrates on algorithmic management. Based on the case study of Didi Chuxing, China’s ride-hailing giant, this article introduces some additional complexities into the dominant storyline by bringing two managerial elements to the fore, namely, labor intermediaries and communication technologies. Although both have long been integral to the control of flexible labor forces in the post-Fordist era, they remain underexplored in the context of the on-demand economy. I argue that labor intermediaries emerge as quick solutions to the indeterminacy of labor mobility power, a critical problem inherent in the just-in-time labor strategies that challenge on-demand platform companies. Communication technologies are crucial for the functioning of this mediated relationship, formulating a virtual space where daily managerial practices take place. Ultimately, I stress that, while the labor process of on-demand platforms represents a shift towards fluid workspace, it does not mean the elimination of the organization-based control that usually occurs in a physical and formal workspace. This case study urges scholars to understand labor control of on-demand platforms as a regime of hybridity that features both continuity and renewal of the various forms of managerial strategies common to flexible production.","",""

"2022","Agency and servitude in platform labour: a feminist analysis of blended cultures"," Digital labour platforms have become important sites of negotiation between expressions of micro-entrepreneurship, worker freedom and dignity of work. In the Global South, these negotiations are overlaid on an already fraught relationship mediated by the dynamics of caste and culture, to the usual politics of difference. Urban Company (UC), an app-based, on-demand platform in India that connects service providers offering home-based services to potential customers, lists professionalised services that have hitherto been considered part of a ‘culture of servitude’, performed by historically marginalised groups afforded little dignity of labour. Such platforms offer the possibility of disrupting the entrenched ‘master-servant’ relationship that exists in many traditional cultures in the Global South by their ostensibly professional approach. While service providers now have the opportunity for self-employment and gain ‘respectability’ by being associated with the platform, UC claims to have leveraged AI to automate discipline in everything the providers do. Using interviews with UC women service providers involved in beauty work and software development engineers, this paper explores the agency afforded to service partners in both professional and personal spheres. Further, we propose the term blended cultures to think about the ways in which algorithms and human cultures mutually (re)make each other. ","",""

Now more than ever – as storefront businesses have had to shift their inventories exclusively online – sellers’ homes and small shops act as warehouses and staging areas for photographing, packing, and shipping merchandise. Members of what we term the digital vintage economy, many of whom are women, navigate additional domestic and reproductive workloads at the same time they engage in new forms of home-based selling labor. Platform labor builds on a long history of inequalities and exploitation related to racial capitalism, and even if some consumer experiences can return to “normal” after shelterin-place orders end and the vaccine is distributed, many labor practices forged during this period will likely continue on as before. In many respects, the forms of labor described in these essays began before the pandemic and will continue to have reverberations in a post-Covid context.","",""

However, while these platforms may share governance strategies, labor platforms mediate employment relationships between workers and clients with different amounts of power. Based on a multistakeholder ethnography of carework labor platforms, online careworker forums, and interviews, this study describes scams on carework labor platforms. Labor platforms narrate workers into the role of technology consumers, constricting their own obligations to workers. Workers’ explanations of scams vary, with some contesting and others aligning with platform narratives. Some workers seek support in online forums, which remediate the harm of scams for some but also enroll workers in unpaid labor. These scams challenge the assumption of antagonism between the interests of workers and platform companies and highlight the consumerization of work. ","",""
"2022","Platform scams: Brazilian workers’ experiences of dishonest and uncertain algorithmic management"," This article discusses how Brazilian platform workers experience and respond to platform scams through three case studies. Drawing from digital ethnographic research, vlogs/interviews of workers, and literature review, we argue for a conceptualization of “platform scam” that focuses on multiple forms of platform dishonesty and uncertainty. We characterize scam as a structuring element of the algorithmic management enacted by platform labor. The first case engages with when platforms scam workers by discussing Uber drivers’ experiences with the illusive surge pricing. The second case discusses when workers (have to) scam platforms by focusing on Amazon Mechanical Turk microworkers’ experiences with faking their identities. The third case presents when platforms lead workers to scam third parties, by engaging with how Brazilian click farm platforms’ workers use bots/fake accounts to engage with social media. Our focus on “platform scams” thus highlights the particular dimensions of faking, fraud, and deception operating in platform labor. This notion of platform scam expands and complexifies the understanding of scam within platform labor studies. Departing from workers’ experiences, we engage with the asymmetries and unequal power relations present in the algorithmic management of labor. ","",""
"2023","Participation inequality in the gig economy","ABSTRACT In theory, the gig economy facilitates flexible, digitally mediated employment arrangements. Why do some people wind up doing gig work while others do not? We focus on how online participation inequalities, and Internet use experiences and skills, shape the composition of online gig workers. Specifically, we analyze a unique survey data set from a national sample of 1512 U.S. adults that includes information about background attributes and behaviors, detailed measures of Internet experiences and skills, as well as questions about whether study participants had completed specific steps necessary to becoming a task worker on two prominent gig economy platforms: Amazon Mechanical Turk and TaskRabbit. We use Bayesian regression to compare four stages of gig economy participation. Workers who participate in the gig economy tend to be younger, more highly educated, and more skilled Internet users. This implies that the gig economy increases labor market stratification and that digital participation inequalities compound labor inequalities.","",""

To understand how these imaginaries are spatially shaped and locally defined, we carried out in-depth qualitative research with fifty filmmakers in four regions of Ghana. Digital and platform technologies have long been optimistically celebrated as a way for marginalized creative entrepreneurs, particularly in Africa, to break into global markets and reach unprecedented levels of business success. However, far from being universally adopted by African creative entrepreneurs, these global techno-optimistic imaginaries are continually reworked, contested and subverted in practice. In this article, we show how Ghanaian filmmakers mobilized, deployed and resisted imaginaries of platform entrepreneurship in their efforts to make sense of their situated entrepreneurial practices and to imagine the future of their creative businesses. We found that rather than naïvely adhering to techno-optimist imaginaries, through their practices, Ghanaian filmmaking entrepreneurs challenged the power geometry of the current platform ecosystem dominated by major Silicon Valley players. We contribute empirically rich data on how filmmaking entrepreneurs use and imagine platform technologies, as is necessary when African digital entrepreneurs are surrounded by hype but inadequate data. We also contribute to the literature about how individual platforms and platform types have unique affordances and how these affordances are shaped by the location and socio-economic position of the entrepreneur.","",""
"2023","DIGITAL LABOR AND RENTIER PLATFORM CAPITALISM: REFORM OR REVOLUTION?","Digital labor has become an umbrella term for describing a range of digitally mediated practices from paid work in the gig economy (Srnicek 2017) to cultivating a personal brand online (Scolere, Pruchniewska, and Duffy 2018). This wellspring of activities now referred to as labor has muddied the waters, making digital labor an ambiguous concept at best (Gandini 2021; Goodwin 2022). This framing of user activity as labor also has limitations, as it necessarily produces reformist, rather than revolutionary, political ends.  Following Sadowski (2020), this paper challenges the conceptual framework of digital labor by re-theorizing the user/platform relation as rentier capitalism. Engels (1970) explained how tenants confront landlords not as sellers of labor-power but buyers of a commodity, and we argue that typical social media users confront platforms in an analogous way. Platforms thus only circulate existing value rather than create it, and this distinction matters in understanding their role in economic crises.  Because the digital labor concept misidentifies the user/platform relationship and concedes the commoditization of communication, reformist demands emerge from this discourse, like “Wages for Facebook” (Ptak 2014 as cited in Jung 2014) or data ownership as compensation (Chakravorti 2020). Capitalist data relations (Couldry and Mejias 2020) and the profit motive of corporate platforms cannot be addressed by renumerating users. As platforms attain infrastructural status (Plantin et al. 2018), our politics must reflect the need for their transformation into public utilities with democratic accountability, a revolutionary demand that has been displaced in the turn towards digital labor.","",""
"2023","DIGITAL LABOR UNDER THE STATE/CAPITALIST DUOPOLY: STATE LABOR AND PLAYFUL WORKAHOLICS IN CHINESE DIGITAL SPACE","With the rise of Multi-Channel Networks (MCNs), Chinese digital creative industries are no longer a realm of self-entrepreneurship but are dominated by professional service agencies and platforms. At the same time, the Chinese-style market economy and state-led platformization have spawned a unique platform ecology, shaping Chinese digital creative industries and labor subjectivity in its own unique way.  This study contributes to digital entrepreneurship in a non-Western context by exploring the characteristics and risks of Chinese digital laborers amid state-led platformization. Through a qualitative analysis of 203 recruitment advertisements of major MCNs in China, the finding reveals that Chinese digital laborers are trapped in a state/capitalist duopoly. On the surface, recruitment advertisements posted by MCNs create a low-threshold, flexible working environment. But in essence, they reflect the precarious working conditions of contemporary digital laborers under MCNs’ systematic business model. In a crude way, MCNs transformed digital entrepreneurs who previously relied on self-promotion into aesthetic laborers in front of the camera. At the same time, laborers behind the camera are a group of playful workaholics at great risk of being exploited for free. They are compelled to involuntarily internalize the pressures of hyper-productivity and undertake trivial emotional labor. Beyond the risks of the platformed digital economy, I argue that digital laborers of MCNs have become a form of state labor that is expected to contribute to national development agendas while embodying the national character that the state promotes.","",""
"2023","INEQUALITY AND DISCRIMINATION IN THE ONLINE LABOR MARKET: A SCOPING REVIEW","Online labor markets present opportunities to exchange work for money that require different resources and skills than the traditional labor market. Unlike other forms of participation in the realm of society that happens on and via the Internet, participating as an independent contractor in an online labor market does not only depend on individual access to technology, knowledge, motivation, and skills, but also on the preferences and biases of both the hiring party and the mediating platform. We conduct a scoping review to examine how the existing body of literature has approached inequality, discrimination, and bias with regards to paid online labor. Conceptualizing online participation as a multistage process, we build a model of participation and success in the online labor market as a pipeline. Based on a comprehensive set of studies collected via five academic databases, we map prior literature across the pipeline’s stages of becoming an independent contractor and find that most of the prior literature focuses on later stages, such as having been hired. Ultimately, we identify remaining puzzles and advocate for the importance of studying the precursors of online labor outcomes.","",""
"2023","Inequality and discrimination in the online labor market: A scoping review"," Based on a comprehensive set of studies collected via five academic databases, this scoping review examines how inequality and discrimination have been studied in the context of paid online labor. We identify three approaches in the literature that aim to (1) identify participation patterns in (national) survey data, (2) examine background characteristics of online contractors based on survey or digital trace data, and (3) reveal social biases in the hiring process using experimental data. Building on Shaw and Hargittai’s pipeline of participation, we present a multi-stage model of engagement in online labor. When we map the studies across the stages, it becomes clear that the literature focuses on later stages (i.e. having been hired and received payment). Based on this analysis, future research should examine barriers to participation in earlier stages. Furthermore, we advocate for research that examines participation across multiple pipeline stages as well as for analysis of platform-level biases. ","",""

However, while previous studies have answered the question of what platform time “isn’t,” most failed to go further in analyzing what “it is.” Based on the 6-month fieldwork, this study aims to re-construct the temporal politics of platform labor in the online food delivery industry in China. Specifically, we employ an inherently relational perspective to analyze three differential temporal themes constructed by heterogeneous actors, namely the “daily time” by third-party subcontractor, “event time” by platform, and “poaching time” by rider. In the investigation of multiple temporalities, this article also uncovers the asymmetrical “relational balancing” among heterogeneous actors in platform labor. ","",""

Drawing on research with platform co-ops under construction in Brazil, the article argues that, in Brazil, platform cooperativism does not necessarily present itself as either a cooperative or a platform. They are prototypes and experiments of worker-owned technologies anchored in local communities and their values. Instead of all these experiences being condensed and captured from Global North epistemic frameworks, there is the production of knowledge by the workers in search of autonomy. The article analyzes potentialities and critiques of platform cooperativism, especially from three dimensions of critique (economics, politics, and technology). It presents perspectives towards diversifying and expanding the meanings of technology in/from Latin America for understanding worker-owned technologies. It discusses two examples of worker-owned technologies: Senoritas Courier and the Homeless Worker Movement.","",""

Industry-oriented channels, bitter and precarious structure of feeling and worker solidarity in China"," This article explores the progressive potential of commercial industry-oriented channels (IoCs), an emerging form of media produced by and addressed to workers of specific industries, on China’s digital platforms. Juxtaposing textual analysis with worker-audience interviews and participant observation, I found that despite the collusion of state surveillance and platform governance, IoCs prove instrumental in fostering resistive labour subjects and collectives among ordinary workers. This is due to IoCs’ genre convention and discourses, but more importantly, to worker-audience’s bitter and precarious structure of feeling that mediates their collective reception processes. The findings complicate our understanding of the potential of media/cultural production for labour resistance, highlighting the role of worker-audience in the circuit of progressive labour culture and the potential of commercial media in fostering radical class subjects. Drawing on the analysis, I further advance a model of worker media as double articulation, to open up more hermeneutic and action space for cultural labour activism. ","",""
"2024","Deeply embedded wages: Navigating digital payments in data work"," Many workers worldwide rely on digital platforms for their income. In Venezuela, a nation grappling with extreme inflation and where most of the workforce is self-employed, data production platforms for machine learning have emerged as a viable opportunity for many to earn an income in US dollars. Data workers are deeply interconnected within a vast network of entities that act as intermediaries for wage payments in digital currencies. Past research on embeddedness has noted that being intertwined in multi-tiered socioeconomic networks of companies and individuals can offer significant rewards to social participants, while also connoting a particular set of limitations. This paper provides qualitative evidence regarding how this “deep embeddedness” impacts data workers in Venezuela. Given the backdrop of a national crisis and rampant hyperinflation, the perks of receiving wages through financial platforms include accessing more stable currencies and investment outside the national financial system. However, relying on numerous intermediaries often diminishes income due to transaction fees. Moreover, this introduces heightened financial risks, particularly due to the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrencies as an investment. This paper evaluates the effects of the platformization of wages and its effect on working conditions. The over-reliance on external financial platforms erodes worker autonomy through power dynamics that lean in favor of the platforms that set the transaction rules and prices. These findings present a multifaceted perspective on deep embeddedness in platform labor, highlighting how the rewards of financial intermediation often come at a substantial cost for the workers in precarious situations.

"2024","Designing for justice in freelancing: Testing platform interventions to minimise discrimination in online labour markets"," Online labour markets (OLMs) are a vital source of income for globally diverse and dispersed freelancers. Despite their promise of neutrality, OLMs are known to perpetuate hiring discrimination, vested in how OLMs are designed and what kinds of interactions they enable between freelancers and hirers. In this study, we go beyond understanding mechanisms of hiring discrimination in OLMs, to identifying platform design features that can minimise hiring discrimination. To do so, we draw on a methodology guided by the design justice ethos. Drawing on a survey on UK-based freelancers and interviews with a purposefully drawn sub-sample, we collaboratively identify five platform design interventions to minimise hiring discrimination in OLMs: community composition, identity-signalling flairs, text only reviews, union membership, and an antidiscrimination prompt. The core of our study is an innovative experiment conducted on a purpose-built, mock OLM, Mock-Freelancer.com. On this mock OLM, we experimentally test mechanisms of discrimination, including how these mechanisms fare under the five altered platform design interventions through a discrete-choice experiment. We find that both community and flairs were important in encouraging the hiring of women and non-White freelancers. We also establish that anonymity universally disadvantages freelancers. We conclude with recommendations to design OLMs that minimise labour market discrimination. ","",""
"2024","Delivery riders’ cultural production in Spain: A thematic analysis of their self-representation on YouTube"," This study analyses YouTube videos about delivery riders in Spain as well as the channels in which the videos were uploaded. The aim is to understand the ways that riders are represented in the videos and determine the labour imaginaries that emerge in the context of platformization, which includes work that depends on platforms that use computer architecture and automation systems to arrange exchanges between people, goods, and corporations, such as the work of delivery riders. This article shows how platformization of labour intersects with cultural production because delivery riders’ work has become a video theme in the YouTube platform. Moreover, in some cases riders (or aspiring ones) use YouTube and other social media to interact, share knowledge and organize their job. Based on a thematic analysis of delivery riders' YouTube videos ( n = 40) from 26 channels mined with YouTube Data Tools, this study presents a typology of channels in which riders appear. It also categorizes the main representations of riders as well as the imaginaries that emerge about this type of labour in YouTube videos. The analysis indicates that delivery riders’ work has a transitory nature, which is expressed in the analysed videos. Moreover, the study demonstrates that immigrants are the people who tend to do this type of work in Spain, and shows how being an immigrant plays a particular role in the way riders are represented or gain their social conceptions and aspirations about this kind of work.

We focus particularly on the use of humour in the stories that on-demand drivers (ride-hailing) share, as it was identified that humour is widely used within these groups. This article has three objectives: (1) to detect the types of stories shared by on-demand drivers in the Facebook groups; (2) to determine the relationships these stories have with the work of on-demand driving; and (3) to understand the dimensions of professional identity and negotiation of platform labour conditions. Therefore, three dimensions of the stories shared by on-demand drivers were identified: the relationships they establish with their clients, their relationships with the platforms (the affordances and limitations the platforms provide and represent), and the everyday work relationships among the drivers developed by establishing Facebook as a digital workspace. These dimensions lead to the formation and negotiation of their professional identity and reveal how they deal with precarity through humour. ","",""
"2024","Cooperative solidarity among crowdworkers? Social learning practices on a crowdtesting social media platform"," The paper analyzes social interactions among crowdworkers on Discord. The explored crowdtesting platform uses this social media platform to offer their crowdworkers various opportunities for work-related and private communication and to host events that encourage learning practices. The paper investigates to what extent the interactions on Discord can be analyzed as social learning practices and can be understood as a specific form of solidarity among crowdworkers. In an explorative online ethnographic study, two learning related channels of the platform company’s Discord server were observed: the question channel in which testers can ask for help, and the quiz channel in which a testing related quiz event takes place. Additionally, interviews with moderators and crowdtesters were conducted. The observation of learning practices on Discord makes clear that the social media tool is mostly used by testers for situational and functional information exchange like helping each other with bug classifications or solving technical problems. Testers mostly provide each other with brief information that can directly be applied in the work context. Further information are mainly shared by moderators that offer supplementary explanations as a possibility to self-help. The study highlights that a form of weak cooperative solidarity emerges among testers as they support each other via Discord to fulfill individual work tasks. This differs from resistant solidarity in other contexts of platform work, because in the observed case, platform workers’ solidarity is not directed against the platform company. ","",""
"2024","Partners or workers? Mexican app deliverers on YouTube and TikTok"," This article seeks to understand how app delivery workers construct their collective identity through the digital platforms of YouTube and TikTok. Said identity construction occurs in the context of the social controversy surrounding their status as workers without labor rights or as independent partners of digital platforms. To this end, we collected 977 videos and their metadata and analyzed them via cross-platform digital methods. The findings reveal that app delivery workers construct their collective identity through the interplay of two factors. The first is the identity narratives created by delivery workers as video bloggers. The second is the recognition narratives created by different associated actors, such as accountants, media, universities and research centers, and content creators. Through these interactions, the narrative of delivery workers as independent partners acquires more algorithmic strength and visibility than those that discuss their status as employees and their lack of labor rights. Audiovisual technology also works as an instrument to reach individual agency and face the precariousness of daily life. ","",""
"2024","Delivery workers’ visibility struggles: Weapons of the gig, (extra)ordinary social media, and strikes"," How do we interpret the extraordinary visibility and ordinariness of social media as delivery workers resist their precarious working lives? Drawing on fieldwork, interviews, photo elicitation, and digital data collection in Turkey with a focus on delivery workers’ strikes in early 2022, we argue that understanding the delivery workers’ movement requires not only considering spectacular strikes and social media protests but also workers’ everyday forms of resistance and their ordinary uses of social media as part of what we call weapons of the gig. Although not as visible as spectacular street action and social media campaigns, these weapons (motorcycle drivers’ solidarity, algorithmic resistance, and social media use for information sharing, as well as production of humor and resentment) enable the subtle formation of a movement. Our contribution lies in reframing social media use as both an ordinary and extraordinary weapon of delivery workers and approaching workers’ solidarity as a question of continuum. Enabling us to look beyond the antagonisms in the labor process and locate affective tensions in the everyday, this approach allows for seeing workers not only as economic but also as political and affective subjects demanding freedom and searching for meaningful connection in their lives.

"2024","Gig workers, critical visuality and humour in a digital context: The graphic representation of riders as a form of social criticism"," This article studies social perceptions of gig work and its conditions through the lenses of visual humour created and shared in digital environments. Food delivery services have thrived in cities, and riders – gig workers associated with such services – have become popular urban figures, easily recognisable through light means of transport and backpacks. These iconic elements have spread to forms of visual humour like memes and cartoons in social media. We aim to analyse the depiction of food delivery services and riders through graphic humour in digital environments, and its role as critical stances of gig work conditions. We draw from the literature on gig work, as well as critical humour in the workplace, approaching the phenomenon from the perspective of critical visualities and the memetic qualities of digital visual humour. Thus, we have conducted an analysis of rider memes, and carried out a focus group with Spanish cartoonists to better understand each form. From our analysis, we have observed that a) memes showcase less explicit critical stances but reflect a shared understanding of the hurdles associated to rider work; b) cartoons place riders in a contextualised, wider critique of platform economy and capitalism; c) while most graphic humour on riders takes an external, observational position, there is also an ‘inner look’ to the rider work, emphasising the promises and deceptions associated with the gig economy.

"2024","Social media and platform work: Stories, practices, and workers’ organisation"," This article introduces the special issue, ‘Social Media and Platform Work: Stories, Practices, and Workers’ Organisation’. In recent years, platform labour studies have increasingly focused on how the growing platformisation of labour has changed work activities, labour processes, work organising, identities, and collectivities. The literature has highlighted the role of media, communication, and social media in platform labour, but more research is needed on these interrelationships. Precisely, the analysis of platform work is necessary due to its complexity and interest in political, economic, social, cultural, and health terms. Throughout the special issue, different contributions are presented that analyse how the emergence of these new jobs brings a set of inequalities that complexify the notion of ‘work’ and dilute workers’ rights, leading to a precarious situation. The use of social media plays a crucial role in the platformisation of labour as it enables the creation of social relationships between workers but also opens the door to communicating, disseminating their work, and even learning informally and about their work. However, the use of social media can also lead to a precarious combination of platform work and content creation – or cultural production. In this regard, it is worth noting to analyse and approach the relationship between platform work and social networks precisely by addressing both perspectives, considering possible vulnerabilities derived from these situations and situations of precariousness.

"2024","An application of the ASOA framework in gig worker social media usage","The Attraction-Selection-Attrition (ASA) model, a major current model for organizational culture, has not been examined empirically for fit against the currently flourishing gig economy, an organizational style used by growing companies such as Uber and Lyft, which rely on app technology to pair consumers with organizational contractors to provide a service. Recent theoretical research suggests that an additional stage, organizing, is present within the ASA model for gig economy workers, thereby resulting in the AS(O)A model. Organizing is where contractors attempt to organize amongst themselves to improve working conditions to be able to stay in gig work rather than have attrition occur. A gap exists in the literature in examining empirically the nature of this step and how it plays out in gig work. In the present study, qualitative data were collected from six major online social media sites including Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Tiktok to examine how gig workers discuss their work. A criterion sample of128 posts were collected, of which 60 were relevant to the AS(O)A model. The data were coded for themes. The data suggests support for the organizing step in the ASA model for gig work as being meaningful in how gig workers discuss their work, especially through Instagram and Twitter. Results and implications for developing the ASA model into the AS(O)A model suggest that organizations need to understand that gig workers are organizing with each other and that such actions may lead to worker collective action or attrition from a particular gig site.","",""

My research encompasses in-depth interviews with 17 supermarket workers, including personal shoppers and dark store workers. I also draw upon corporate documents and media statements released during the pandemic, as well as insights gleaned through my work within Australia’s union movement. I argue that the transformations underway result in three major developments. First, the intensification of supermarket work to adhere to the temporal logics of the on-demand economy, enabled by the increasing use of digital devices. Second, the absorption of precarious workers via digital labour platforms into the traditional firm which may undermine existing job security. Third, a blurring distinction between retail and logistical spaces with consequences for union representation that may erode workplace conditions. Taken together, the supermarket becomes a powerful testing ground in which the logics of on-demand platforms are transforming conventional employment settings and practices. ","",""

We analyzed their experiences of mediatization along five dimensions: extension, substitution, amalgamation, accommodation, and datafication.

We also found respondents’ experiences clearly framed by the smaller size of the local, Swedish gig work companies.","",""

This article examines this ambivalent bargain of economic rehabilitation in Singapore where Grab is headquartered. Drawing from historical records, it first traces the relations of “platform” to “access,” demonstrating how the framework of curative intermediaries had historically shaped expectations around work. Access in the 1980s was envisioned as intermediating infrastructural connections that could provide disabled people with resources, transforming them from liabilities to productive personhoods. The second portion draws from interviews with disabled delivery workers to highlight the problems that constitute this investment in intermediaries and cure. Although accommodative platforms provide some degree of economic inclusion, these accommodations are often partial, resulting in precarity, attrition, and injury. “Curative platforms,” therefore, signals the investment and twinning of cure and violence that subject the disabled to a compromised existence.

The anonymity and granularity of such work is likely to cause alienation among workers. To date, we know little about how workers reconcile such potential feelings of alienation with their simultaneous commitment to the platform. Based on a longitudinal survey of 460 workers on a large microworking platform and a combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses, we show that (1) alienation is present in digital microwork. However, our study also finds that (2) workers’ commitment to the platform over time may alter their subjective perceptions of alienation. Drawing from qualitative statements, we show (3) how workers perform identity work that might help reconcile feelings of alienation with simultaneous platform commitment. Our findings contribute to solving the paradox of worker commitment to precarious platform labor, which is an issue frequently raised in the digital labor literature. ","",""

However, we present evidence to the contrary, demonstrating how hustling in the digital economy erodes resilience on a systemic level. For this purpose, we draw on an in-depth, ecological ethnography about Poshmark, a social commerce platform for predominantly female hustlers to sell clothes. We tell the story of a pattern set in motion by the rapid scaling of the platform, which requires hustlers to do more and more click-work to yield smaller and smaller sales.

Using Working Holiday Makers in Australia as an example, this article focuses on digital togetherness generated through new media. I argue that digital interactions on new media platforms not only change the spatial-temporal limit of temporary migrant workers, but also create digital togetherness and connect workers with different imagined others (customers, arriving migrant workers, and workers who are facing exploitation). This connection can become an everyday resistance strategy, a remedy to space–time limits, and potentially challenge asymmetrical power relations between workers and employers. ","",""

We contribute to constructing a mediated framework of affordances for association, for discourse and for mobilisation to examine the process of fostering worker solidarity. Increasingly under structural constraints of platform control and state surveillance on labour activism, this article discloses the theoretical puzzle of ‘solidarity in question’ by rooting the agential practices firmly in the analysis of workers’ gender, migratory status, work experience and critical media literacy, and how they intersect with the tactical appropriation of social media to create potential.

"2024","The poster boys of aspirational labor: parables of success and failure in The Viral Fever’s web shows","Abstract                Aspirational labor has been understood by scholars based in the Global North to encapsulate a form of labor undertaken by social media content creators that is mostly uncompensated for, but is, nonetheless, integral to the functioning of its economy. While this dominant theorization of aspirational labor is sometimes helpful for explaining the precarity of digital media labor in countries of the Global South, its uncritical application could also be severely limiting. I undertake a close textual analysis of select web shows created by the entertainment brand and YouTube content creators The Viral Fever (TVF) to demonstrate how it would be imprecise to see them as just victims of an exploitative economy. My article shows how TVF web shows consistently imagine elaborate cinematic narratives that valorize and embody the neoliberal values of aspiration and individual growth that in turn is complicit in the machinations of platform economy’s extractive affordances.","",""
"2025","Gendered inequalities of platform work in Africa: Findings from a multi-country analysis","Hopes that the growth of platform work in Africa will provide new opportunities for women's employment have not yet been matched by empirical research. Based on a five-country survey of workers on 18 platforms across four sectors (ride-hailing, delivery, professional, microtasks), the research reported here makes the first direct, systematic comparison of men's and women's experiences of platform work in multiple African countries. The paper finds an absence of specific gender differences across many core operational structures of platform work including general shortcomings related to social protection, contracts, human/algorithmic management and representation being experienced similarly by both men and women. However, the paper also finds that these processes occur within a wider gender-unequal context in which gendered norms skew the presence of men and women in different sectors, and in which wider exclusions encourage women into platform work but lead them to experience greater precarity and dependency than men on that work. For example, women on average earn less than men because they work demonstrably fewer hours. This also limits the purported flexibility of platform work for women workers and denies them a pay premium to reflect their generally higher levels of education. While experienced by only a minority of women workers surveyed, gender-discriminatory cancellations, complaints and abuse were reported. The paper ends with recommendations for actions to address gender inequalities in platform work, and reflections on future research.","",""
"2025","Navigating labour's labyrinth: Developing a typology of platform work in Sub-Saharan Africa","Platform-mediated labour is rapidly transforming African economies, expanding opportunities yet exacerbating precarity. This paper develops an empirical typology of heterogeneous platform worker experiences in Sub-Saharan Africa, grounded in interviews with 55 labourers across transportation, domestic services, IT and creative sectors in Rwanda, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Integrating neo-Marxist concepts of dispossession with postcolonial perspectives on enduring North-South domination reveals nuanced differences in autonomy constraints, income volatility, rating dependence and peripheral exclusion across five worker segments: high-skilled independents, low-skilled dependents, aspiring entrepreneurials, established entrepreneurials and discouraged peripherals. Findings show that high-skilled independents navigate autonomy and instability on global freelancing platforms while facing discrimination. Low-skilled dependents experience exploitative algorithms dictating terms of participation. Aspiring entrepreneurials leverage platforms strategically to launch startups. Established entrepreneurials transition from precarious work to launch equitable local platforms. Meanwhile, discouraged peripherals are denied access by opaque vetting. This typology provides traction to tailor protections addressing decent work deficits concentrated among particular groups.","",""
"2025","Labour super-exploitation in differential uberisation: A Latin American perspective on the platform economy","This article explores the dynamics of digital platforms for food delivery in Latin America, with a focus on empirical research conducted in Mexico City. The impact of gig and platform labour reveals significant divergences between the Global North and South, particularly in how these platforms disrupt social labour relations and subjective working conditions, suggesting to analyse in the frame of ‘differential uberisation’ of labour. Through interviews, the study examines the structural heterogeneity of labour realities in Latin America, while also highlighting key contributions from critical Latin American thought on labour. Furthermore, it discusses how conditions typical of peripheral economies, such as the super-exploitation of labour, are increasingly prevalent within the platform economy. These conditions are globalised through the worldwide operation of digital platforms. This article seeks to critically analyse this phenomenon from a Latin American perspective, drawing on long-term ethnographic research.","",""
"2025","Injustice by design: A critical technocultural discourse and Latina feminist analysis of Amazon's ACX audiobook labor platform","The commercial audiobook arena is a generative site for studying how the value laden designs of digital labor platforms are impacting workers along intersectional lines. Though a global multi-billion-dollar industry that can be traced back to Edison's invention of the phonograph, audiobooks remain relatively understudied, particularly as it relates to audiobook labor. If we are to construct an equitable and just digital labor future, it is critical that we understand how workers experience the work. Additionally, to develop worker protections and policies that are attune to the racialized and gendered dimensions of platform labor, we must be in conversation with diverse workers. This work takes a closer look at Amazon's Audiobook Creation Exchange (AXC) labor platform and centers the experiences of US-Latina audiobook narrators as Amazon has held a virtual monopoly of digital audiobooks. The lack of regulatory frameworks has allowed Amazon free rein to obfuscate and infuse unjust labor practices via the design of its platforms. This allows it to control and surveille the workers and the work, while keeping itself out of reach from accountability. I center U.S.-based Latinas in my analysis because they bring multidimensional perspectives that are critical to detangling how power is operationalized in the digital economy. And, while geographically located within the U.S., Latina voices are under-represented in media, policymaking, and digital/platform labor scholarship. Thus, the North/South binary does not offer a space but, instead, furthers US-Latina invisibility. By employing a braided Critical Technocultural Discourse Analysis (CTDA) and Latina Feminist approach, I surface the ways that an emphasis on Latinas furthers our understanding of platform work. While some of their experiences may not be unique to Latinas, centering these women brings to focus issues and practices embedded within labor platform design that may not be considered from white and/or single-axis perspectives.","",""
"2025","READY TO HACK: HOW BUG BOUNTY PLATFORMS CREATE THEIR WORKFORCE","Bug bounty platforms are becoming a standard solution for detecting vulnerabilities in an increasingly complex networked economy. Serving as intermediaries between organizations and ethical hackers, they crowdsource offensive information security and show significant improvements in the detection of vulnerabilities.  In some sense, they can be likened to platforms of the gig economy. However, they stand out in one major regard: they do not have a pre-existing workforce. While platforms of the gig economy can rely on unqualified, often migrant, workers eager to earn the little money it provides, bug hunting platforms require highly qualified workers in a field where formal training is often lacking. This pushes bug bounty platforms to not only serve as intermediaries, but to also actively create the workforce they need.  This paper discusses the efforts needed for the establishment of such a labor supply. Four key requirements are identified. First, the workers are required to undergo proper training. The platforms thus design educational tools aimed at ensuring a skilled workforce. Second, bug hunting must be routinised. A precise set of actions, as well as standard software is suggested that largely automate the job. This allows for efficient vulnerability detection. Third, platforms must ensure competition among bug hunters in order to secure a loyal workforce. To this end, they will design gamification schemes, made of rewards and rankings. Fourth, platforms seek to embed bug hunting into formal careers. By building alliances with the industry, higher education institutions, or the army, they make bug hunting economically appealing.","",""
"2025","FREELANCING IN THE DIGITAL AGE: UNDERSTANDING FIVERR WITHIN THE GIG ECONOMY","Platforms play an increasingly prominent role in today’s economy. As big tech companies like Alphabet, Meta and Alibaba leverage their size and access to large amounts of data to provide value for their users and shareholders, platforms have begun to emerge within the gig economy. The gig economy is where individuals rent out their labour, and has rapidly grown in recent years. This paper focuses on Fiverr, an online freelancing platform in the gig economy that allows individuals to sell their services to anyone who can access it. We undertake a longitudinal case study, exploring and analysing how Fiverr has developed its business to provide a number of services that facilitate the operation of the platform. We explain growth drivers, innovation strategies and show how they favour the buyer, which has created tensions in the operation of the platform. Additionally, we contextualize Fiverr, and online freelancing more generally, within two major socio-technical developments in recent years, namely the Covid-19 pandemic and the rise of generative AI, showing the turbulent times such platforms are currently facing.","",""
"2025","CONSTRUCTING THE DIGITAL: WORKING FROM THE GLOBAL SOUTH","The AoIR Flashpoint Symposium conducted in Hyderabad, India, explored multiple facets of digital labour–that which takes place through and on platforms, monitored or managed via digital interfaces, as well as forms of work that contribute to building, maintaining, and populating digital infrastructures. The discussions at the symposium proceeded from the recognition of the need for regulation with the consumer of technology as our main object of concern, while also attending to the humans at the center of the machinery of production–those who build the insides of the machines (coders, designers, annotators) as well as those who make the content that flows through it. This panel extends the discussions at the Symposium with five papers that attend to different types of digital/digitally-enabled work: content creation and curation, app-based services, infrastructuring through tech work, and advocacy for a just and open digital commons. Together, the papers intend to make visible how the everyday labour of those in the Global South undergirds the global network of digital goods, services, and infrastructures–both materially and discursively. We think of the digital economy and culture in planetary terms (Graham &amp; Ferrari, 2022), driven by technologies largely imagined in the West even as they are enabled in very specific ways by workers in the Global South. Much recent work in rapidly digitizing geographies in South Asia and Latin America has pointed to the embedded nature of the digital, as technology and as experience. Cultural creators on platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and Spotify speak to increasingly dispersed audiences, their content subject to a variety of regulatory regimes monitored and managed in algorithmically impenetrable ways . Gig workers find their work patterns are constrained and defined by interfaces driven by neo-colonial imaginaries that defy regulation yet prompt innovative forms of resistance. Public discourse veers between the celebratory and the cautionary, as in much of the globe, with states responding, in turn, with shut downs and penalties and sops and incentives. The papers in this panel while locating their arguments and their insights in the specific context of India, also speak to the need for imaginaries that are at once broad and contextual, that take from aspirational articulations while rejecting a universalising logic, whether in the realm of design, or use, or regulation.","",""
"2025","“Oh, <i>you’re watching me</i>”: Care workers’ experiences of surveillant assemblages on the platform and in the home"," Domestic workers have long been marginalized, even as they are made hypervisible to their employers. This is a process increasingly augmented by digital technologies. These technologies include care platforms, which have increasingly mediated the process of finding employment. This article reports on interviews with in-home childcare workers or “nannies” who shared experiences of scrutiny and surveillance across the labor process, both on and off the platform. This includes background checks, in-person monitoring, hidden cameras, and more. Although these practices might be legitimized as an extension of parental care or benign monitoring, workers’ negative afffects—fear, worry, anger—disrupt this normalization. Their stories make visible harm and hidden burdens from this hybridization of care and control. Through their accounts, a surveillant assemblage comes into view that intensifies uneven visibility regimes and reinstates the racialized and gendered power dynamics that have long defined domestic labor.

Based on a survey of 1189 microworkers and 17 in-depth interviews, the article explores the experiences of UK-based microworkers on three digital platforms: Prolific, Clickworker and Amazon Mechanical Turk. The article draws on the theoretical framework of self-determination theory to analyse workers’ motivations for performing microwork. It reveals that workers’ relatively high satisfaction with otherwise low-paying and low-status work was possible because workers conceptualised their activity as occupying an ambiguous space and time in their lives, blurring traditional distinctions between work and leisure. These findings contribute to our understanding of how microworkers experience their relationship to work in the United Kingdom. ","",""

Primarily, it focuses on the tension between design and local economic practices. Given the primacy of cash as an object of economic exchange, platforms facilitate cash payments. Platforms then delegate the task of cash administration to couriers. Labor control around this task is then institutionalized in the form of platform features. Furthermore, platform dependency to cover basic necessities shapes divergent experiences of the delegated task of cash administration. Conceptually, this article employs the Latourian concept of delegation to explore the human and nonhuman enrollments mobilized to adapt digital technologies to local environments. ","",""
"2025","Bearing the Unbearable: Double Controls and Disguised Precarity on China-Based Platforms","This article examines controls over platform laborers by platforms and states as well as the precarity of platform laborers. Adopting a multi-level approach, we put the spotlight on how states, platforms and laborers interact with each other when states and platforms impose their controls over overseas laborers. Drawing on 47 in-depth interviews, surveys and online data collected during 2018–2023 on ABCKID (pseudonym), a large China-based platform employing North American laborers, we unpack how state control directly affected the lives of laborers and indirectly impacted platform work through strengthening platform control over laborers. Our findings show that the state is not necessarily an ally with platform laborers but could be a major source of control over these laborers. We also document how the platform took advantage of laborers’ dependency on the platform and collaborated with them to get around state controls. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of disguised precarity and illustrate how laborers’ precarity became more disguised as double controls unfolded. We argue that double controls by platforms and the states can exacerbate platform laborers’ precarity even though their precarity may seem to be tolerable.","",""
"2025","Dynamics of Platform Architecture and Labor Unrest: Mobilizing and Contesting Solidarity in the 2021–2022 Foodpanda Delivery Rider Strikes in Hong Kong"," Weaving together relational approaches to collective action as well as the concepts of platform architecture and social media affordances, this qualitative study examines the manifestation and contestation of worker solidarity in the platform-mediated gig economy. Based on semi-structured interviews with 30 participants—including riders and labor rights group members involved in the 2021–2022 Foodpanda delivery rider strikes—this article offers a relational and processual view of how worker solidarity was formed, consolidated, and contested throughout the strikes in Hong Kong’s post-union era. The analysis reveals that riders’ grievances against Foodpanda emerged in response to the evolving platform architecture, while non-workplace factors such as the sociopolitical context further shaped riders’ repertoires of action. Riders strategically utilized interpersonal communication networks and various social media affordances to mobilize and strengthen solidarity. Worker solidarity, however, was contested due to internal conflicts among riders and the fear of police. Algorithmic control also serves as a repressive tool to demobilize workers. Thus, solidarity was fragmented and transient. This study theorizes the platform architecture as part of the dynamic process through which worker solidarity is mobilized and contested. It contributes to understanding the varieties of platform labor unrest by examining the relational dynamics of worker solidarity in the changing political context where labor power is likely to be weakened. As such, platform labor unrest is deeply embedded within a wider platform ecology and socio-political context, where workers mobilize among themselves and interact with their opponents, alliances, and other social actors.

"2025","Producing Value From Injury: Dashcam Platforms, Accidents, and Gig Work","This article uses the dashboard camera (commonly, dashcam) to consider platformed logics of injury. Installed in cars, dashcams are often purposed to arbitrate accidents. In Singapore, however, dashcams have fostered huge communities on social media, who regularly post and comment on dashcam footage. Furthermore, due to the nature of their work, food delivery riders also constitute common subjects of these footages. The article explores these relationships by revealing, first, how dashcams have historically coupled exploitation and justice. It has relied on the broken bodies of platform workers for consumer interest, but attached with the promise that the technology can also address the structural injustice of platformed work. This capitalization of injury continues into the present, with dashcams also serving as the key site for the visibility of structural injury among food delivery riders.","",""
"2025","Off-grid? Resistant media operations by delivery gig workers in response to app-based tracking"," Tracking by mobile media has become key to coordination and surveillance of delivery gig work. Through their daily app-based media operations, delivery gig workers contribute to the capitalisation and establishment of platform companies’ spatiotemporal regimes. But this app-based tracking has been a source of tension and conflict, particularly in the face of growing organised and unionised resistance by delivery gig workers in Germany. App-based tracking is evolving into an arena for negotiating resistance, conducting counter-surveillance and (temporarily) disrupting platform-based supply chains. These forms of labour resistance and counter-surveillance by individual riders, works councils or trade unions are either 1) directed against app-based tracking itself or 2) seek to operationalise resistance through the use of app-based tracking. Drawing on an empirical analysis of different forms of resistance, this article offers a critical media studies perspective on resistant mobile media operations in response to app-based tracking. Based on a digital ethnography of resistance by German delivery gig workers, it shows how different forms of resistance in delivery gig work are negotiated against and through app-based tracking. We present local and non-hegemonic perspectives on mobile media operations of spatiotemporal coordination and surveillance that enable a critical analysis of the (non-)human power and information asymmetries involved in gig work resistance.
