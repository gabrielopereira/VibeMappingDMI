This is particularly true in relation to his concept of 'bias'. This paper reconstructs this concept and places it in the context of Innis' uniquely non-Marxist dialectical materialist methodology. In so doing, the author emphasises ongoing debates concerning Innis' work and demonstrates its utility in relation to contemporary analyses of the Internet and related developments.","",""

"2010","Knowledge management and diplomacy: Reflections on the demise of the valedictory despatch in the context of an informational history of the British Diplomatic Service","In October 2009 the BBC aired a short series of radio programmes entitled Parting Shots. The programmes featured a series of final communications, called valedictory despatches, from British Ambassadors leaving their posts to take up duties elsewhere or retire from the Diplomatic Service. As opposed to being merely vehicles for conveying reflective and summary knowledge about countries for the benefit of successors as well as the Foreign Office in London, some despatches contained discourteous and injudicious comments about ambassadors’ host countries and their people. The sensitive nature of these types of despatches, combined with their ease of dissemination electronically, made inevitable the severe circulation restrictions that were placed on them in 2006, leading to their effective demise. Our new knowledge of the past existence of the valedictory despatch immediately raises the question of the history of diplomatic communication, including issues related to the mediation of diplomacy by technologies and techniques conducive to knowledge sharing. The article synthesises evidence from secondary sources on the history of British diplomacy that highlights its information and communication aspects. Primary sources are also exploited in the form of valedictory despatches from British ambassadors abroad and publications on diplomacy contemporaneous with the time being studied. The traditional, stereotypical image of the diplomat is that of gentlemanly intellectual, ‘bon viveur’ and adventurer, socially adept and thus skilled in the art of negotiation. However, an investigation of the history of diplomatic information and communication practices – from the era of manuscript and messenger through to the ages of the telegraph and telephone, and now that of the internet – reveals the diplomat less as gentlemanly negotiator than as knowledge manager, as a collector and conduit of information designed to enhance the knowledge of policy-makers. The historic knowledge-management role of the diplomat highlights the part technology has played in the world of diplomacy, including the relationship between the ambassador abroad and the political centre. It also offers a further perspective on the ways in which technologies open up new possibilities, intended and unintended, often fraught with ambiguity and potential for enhancement and disruption. In turn this offers lessons for further consideration of what can be termed the Dark Side of Knowledge Management, and for organizational communication in general.","",""

First, I argue that a market logic, masked by what could be referred to as “corporate libertarianism,” threatens major sectors of civil society, including educational institutions such as our own. As educators, we should understand ourselves to be part of a civil society complex worth defending. Second, communication scholars have a special role to play in linking with other civil society groups, both through various forms of activism and by critiquing corporate libertarianism’s paradigmatic underpinnings. Given that we possess a special purchase on the relationship between media and power, communication scholars should engage in policy struggles and intellectual battles that at first glance might not seem germane to our specific work-related problems.","",""

An Introduction","Fifty-seven famous professors from all over the world talk about their careers, from their beginning to today. The interviews start with family background, early days, and professional dreams, before moving into the world of ideas. They look back to dealing with decisions over which graduate school to attend, main academic teachers, and the state of the discipline at the time, and then continue with both the intellectual and the institutional steps which led to fame and recognition within and, in almost all cases, even outside the field. Last but not least, all interviewees were asked about the discipline itself: What is communication all about? Is there a kind of core, although the discipline is highly diverse in methods, theories, and objects of study (Stanfill, 2012)? What is the reputation of the subject today? Is communication still seen as an “academic Taiwan” (claiming all of China as its own tiny island; Peters, 1986, p. 544), or, similarly unfavorably, as a stepchild that is tolerated by U.S. university administrators only because it helps to pay the bill for the departments they really care about? What about the “rest” of the world, and what about the “big unknowns” (Sonia Livingstone), such as China, for example, where they seem to open a new university every week? These interviews are not only a source for future historians of the discipline and a blueprint for junior scholars that strive for a professorship, but also a document of the early 21st century: Where did communication come from? What does the worldwide landscape of this fast growing academic enterprise look like today? And where do we go from here—let’s say, until 2030?","",""

Arnett’s (2013) most recent text, Communication Ethics in Dark Times: Hannah Arendt’s Rhetoric of Warning and Hope, uses the work of Arendt to address the “failed social project” of modernity. Modernity’s threefold emphasis on progress, efficiency, and individual autonomy directs one’s attention away from the important act of contemplation. The love of doing is lost on an unending journey toward the unattainable. Through the lens of modernity, the shadows of distraction serve as blinders in one’s relationship with self, other, and context. Despite the illusions of “artificial light” cast by modernity, Arnett attends to the overwhelming “darkness” of this historical moment through a communication ethics framework. Drawing on 15 of Arendt’s major scholarly works, Arnett masterfully weaves Arendt’s personal narrative and theoretical concepts to illuminate the misleading values represented by modernity. The work of Arendt portrays a picture of hope, interwoven with periodic warnings, intended for a society overwhelmed by darkness—not too dissimilar from the current historical moment in which we find ourselves.","",""

"2013","Down with Dullness: Gaming the Academic Conference","It is a truism among academics that most of the creative work at a conference happens outside the formal sessions, at social gatherings. If this is so, why not drop the formal sessions entirely? In this article, I propose a method for making an entire conference into a formalized social gathering, with a structure that both encourages the exchange of ideas and also records the evolution of thought. In this method, named “Ludium,” games replace presentations as the unifying element. Theme-appropriate games unlock creative juices and allow for soft entry points for networking. A conference meta-game elicits common views about the standing of ideas. A rapid review session concludes the conference and summarizes major points. Past experience with conferences in this vein indicates that indeed a great deal of solid academic work gets done. Moreover, everyone has fun, and the results of the conference, the “sense of the group,” can easily and immediately be broadcast to the public. All of these outcomes stand in stark contrast to the outcome of typical academic conferences.","",""

Medical school students receive training in how to properly communicate with and evaluate patients. These types of studies view communication as the process through which information is transmitted to and from the patient. However, few studies have been initiated to examine how team members within medical clinics communicate with each other away from patients. Laura Ellingson’s Communicating in the Clinic is an ethnographic study that provides a richer understanding of how medical team members communicate. Her interpretive ethnographic approach challenges positivist thinking by advocating that qualitative research methods have a place in generating knowledge and understanding of communicative interaction. Thus her book promotes qualitative research as a viable approach for examining communication within medical clinics.","",""
"2015","Larry Gross & Jay Ruby (Eds.), The Complete Sol Worth","Sol Worth was a pioneer in the study of visual media as communication. His graduate course on visual communication theory and research may have been the first of its kind. Worth was an adventurous thinker, an innovative researcher, and the co-author of a book that can be described, without exaggeration, as a classic. He was also the founding editor of a journal that played a significant role in the early development of visual studies as a subfield of anthropology and communication. At the time of his death, in 1977, he was one of the best known and most influential scholars in visual communication, as well as in visual anthropology. His influence on visual anthropology has been long lasting, but today references to his work in publications on media studies are few and far between. Larry Gross and Jay Ruby’s new edition of Worth’s collected writings is a valuable reminder of Worth’s enduring relevance to a field that has largely forgotten him. In two important respects, the quality of visual communication research has suffered in the years since Worth’s passing from the scene. Gross and Ruby’s publication is a welcome reminder of what we have lost and may yet regain.","",""

Does adopting the words  difference  and  equity  in lieu of  tolerance, diversity , and  multiculturalism  help bring us to a place where racialized minorities are not just window dressing, the tokens that stave off allegations of racism? In this essay, I briefly trace various discourses surrounding tolerance, multiculturalism, and diversity, before moving to difference to think to equity. Linguistic change coincides with and can foment historical and political change, yet we do not need more or different words: We need more equitable universities. Interrogating the language around this potentially change-making word uncovers, in the words of Herman Gray, a politics of difference that is unutterable without demands for equity.","",""

My rethinking is inspired by deconstructive readings of Austin’s  How to Do Things With Words  and Lacan’s “Seminar on  The Purloined Letter .” In the end, I contend that miscommunication cannot be definitively separated from communication, indicating communication’s differential makeup.

We offer a critical-performative framework for critical scholars interested in studying politeness as a political, discursive, and embodied act. To develop this agenda, we first outline Brown and Levinson’s postpositivist theory of politeness. We then review three challenges to their use of intentionality, Grice’s cooperative principle, and Goffman’s concept of face. These challenges are located in interactional, traditional critical, and discursive understandings of politeness (respectively). Next, we show how a performative understanding of politeness both encompasses the three challenges and offers a way to understand the role of politeness in identity formation. We conclude by suggesting that ethnographic methods, informed by performance ethnography, provide analytical tools consistent with a performative understanding of politeness.","",""

The three include the celebrated information theorist Claude Shannon, the eighteenth century English statistician Thomas Bayes, and the Harvard statistical linguist George Zipf. Each promoted a foundational equation concerning human communication and the updating of beliefs based on new information. They discover that with some modest mathematical transformations they can demonstrate that each of the equations, although based on entirely distinct phenomena in physics, statistics, and linguistics, has the same basic structural form. The core of the analysis explores how such distinct phenomena share similar nonlinear structural properties, i.e., non-Gaussian distributions and why an understanding of these properties is important for communication research and the analysis of advanced information systems.","",""
