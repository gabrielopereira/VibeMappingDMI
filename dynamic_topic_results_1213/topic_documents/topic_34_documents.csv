"2012","Profile as promise: A framework for conceptualizing veracity in online dating self-presentations"," This research explores how users conceptualize misrepresentation (their own and others’) in a specific genre of online self-presentation: the online dating profile. Using qualitative data collected from 37 online dating participants, we explore user understandings of self-presentational practices, specifically how discrepancies between one’s online profile and offline presentation are constructed, assessed, and justified. Based on our analysis, we propose the profile as promise framework as an analytic lens that captures user understandings about profile-based representation through a qualitative analysis of their retrospective reflections.

"2013","The Rainbow Flag and the Green Carnation: Grindr in The Gay Village","This paper uses autoethnography to examine locative media — specifically, the location–based social network app Grindr — in the context of spatial practices. Because of the way it integrates the physical location of a user in the construction of a digital space, its curious political and logistical challenge to previously defined spatial arrangements such as gay villages, and the negotiation over interpersonal relations its use entails, Grindr poses a unique case to examine questions around space and locative media. I argue that Grindr harkens back to Pre–Stonewall modes of cruising and socializing through the manipulation of cues, codes, and symbols and disturbs the link between spatial arrangements based on co–presence and gay identity politics.","",""
"2015","Seeing and being seen: Co-situation and impression formation using Grindr, a location-aware gay dating app"," While online spaces and communities were once seen to transcend geography, the ubiquity of location-aware mobile devices means that today’s online interactions are deeply intertwined with offline places and relationships. Systems such as online dating applications for meeting nearby others provide novel social opportunities, but can also complicate interaction by aggregating or “co-situating” diverse sets of individuals. Often this aggregation occurs across traditional spatial or community boundaries that serve as cues for self-presentation and impression formation. This paper explores these issues through an interview study of Grindr users. Grindr is a location-aware real-time dating application for men who have sex with men. We argue that co-situation affects how and whether Grindr users and their behavior are visible to others, collapses or erases contextual cues about normative behavior, and introduces tensions in users’ self-presentation in terms of their identifiability and the cues their profile contains relative to their behavior.

"2016","How Sociocultural Context Matters in Self-Presentation: A Comparison of U.S. and Chinese Profiles on Jack’d, a Mobile Dating App for Men Who Have Sex With Men","Theorizing profiles on mobile dating applications (apps) as self-presentation, this study examines how men who have sex with men (MSM) presented themselves on Jack’d, a dating app tailored to this population. This research takes a cross-cultural perspective by comparing 204 profiles from the United States and 204 profiles from China. The results show that Chinese MSM were less likely to show their faces on Jack’d than American MSM because of the stronger stigma of homosexuality in China. In addition, the average number of relational goals mentioned by Chinese MSM was smaller than that mentioned by American MSM, supporting the low- and high-context cultural difference. However, more Chinese MSM mentioned looking for relationships specifically, suggesting that they seem to regard Jack’d as a non-romance-seeking platform and have to make their goals explicit. Sex was not often mentioned as the relational goal in both countries, implying “slut-shaming” is in force. This study demonstrates the value of examining online self-presentation of MSM to understand sociocultural differences between the United States and China regarding homosexuality.","",""
"2016","The players of micro-dating: Individual and gender differences in goal orientations toward micro-dating apps","Dating apps on smartphones have brought speed dating on the Internet to a new level. This exploratory investigation sought to determine what kinds of people use these apps, what their motivations are, and what precautions they take before meeting someone. One hundred and seventy-three non-users and 57 current users of dating apps were surveyed. The data suggest that the strongest motive for using dating apps is not for dating or sex, but for entertainment. On the other hand, the more frequent users of these apps are people whose personalities are predisposed towards varied sexual partners. These different motives may represent a disconnect between those who wish to kill time and those who are seeking sexual partners.","",""
"2016","Grindr casual hook-ups as interactional achievements"," One pervasive use of the Grindr mobile application is the initiation and accomplishment of pseudonymous sexual encounters between gay strangers based on location awareness. Not only are such encounters oriented towards quasi-immediate sexual gratification, but they are collaboratively done so as to preclude repeat encounters and relational development, with the protagonists supposedly left unaffected emotionally, relationally and socially by their meeting. This creates a rather special – and analytically interesting – interactional dilemma when Grindr users initiate a social contact with potential partners, usually through the chat function integrated into the mobile app. This article describes the way Grindr users have developed a particular ‘linguistic ideology’, which casts ordinary conversation as an interactional activity that is performed between (potential) friends and enables relational development. As such, it is unsuitable for one-time sexual encounters, the production of which is a distinctive and accountable interactional accomplishment. This article analyzes the special interactional practices based on profile-matching sequences which Grindr users have developed to circumvent the relational affordances of electronic conversation. These practices constitute Grindr users as a particular form of speech community, adjusted both to their orientation towards initiating ‘purely’ sexual encounters and to the socio-material design of the Grindr mobile application.

"2016","Departing glances: A sociotechnical account of ‘leaving’ Grindr"," Grindr is a popular location-based social networking application for smartphones, predominantly used by gay men. This study investigates why users leave Grindr. Drawing on interviews with 16 men who stopped using Grindr, this article reports on the varied definitions of leaving, focusing on what people report leaving, how they leave and what they say leaving means to them. We argue that leaving is not a singular moment, but a process involving layered social and technical acts – that understandings of and departures from location-based media are bound up with an individual’s location. Accounts of leaving Grindr destabilize normative definitions of both ‘Grindr’ and ‘leaving’, exposing a set of relational possibilities and spatial arrangements within and around which people move. We conclude with implications for the study of non-use and technological departure. ","",""

Same-Sex Attracted Young People’s Negotiations of Intimacy, Visibility, and Risk on Digital Hook-Up Apps"," This article draws on focus group interviews with same-sex attracted Australian men and women aged 18-29, to reflect on their accounts of the perceived risks and opportunities offered by hook-up apps such as Grindr, Blendr, and Hornet. Until recently, scholarly accounts of same-sex attracted men hooking up online have primarily focused on measuring the safety of sexual encounters in relation to HIV and “risky” sexual practices. This article extends previous health-related studies by considering the ways that the exchange of sexually explicit digital self-portraits (or selfies) feature within digital sexual negotiations and also exploring same-sex attracted women’s perceptions of safety and risk in relation to dating and hook-up apps and websites. It draws on recent scholarship on Grindr and other geo-locative hook-up apps to explore the material role that mobile phones and apps play in establishing a sense of safety, intimacy, and/or risk within flirtations and sexual interactions and the ways that young people’s “off-label” (or non-sexual) uses of hook-up apps might facilitate (and diminish) their sense of queer identity and visibility.

In the second half, we provide a discussion of the implications of the swipe logic through post-structural conceptual lenses interrogating the ironic disruption of intimacy of Tinder’s interface.

"2016","Social Media in Gay London: Tinder as an Alternative to Hook-Up Apps"," The article explores how the mobile app Tinder complements dating practices and the wider app ecosystem gay men use in London. Within the local gay community discourse, Tinder is said to be a site where the gay “nice guys” go, rendering the platform as a socially constructed environment where gay men behave in a diametrically opposed way to the normative hyper-sexualized behavior of widespread gay hook-up apps. The research question, therefore, is whether Tinder is in fact a place where these “nice guys” go and where one would find them. Through an ethnographic methodology conducted both online and offline, a case is built on how initial conceptions about the app cannot be fully studied or interpreted without understanding the place it holds among other social networks. Evidence is presented to support the case that gay users of Tinder do, in fact, curate the portrayal of their digital identity to present a considerably less sexualized persona with the hopes of finding dates or a relationship. This, however, does not mean that users refrain from using other platforms in parallel as a way of exploring different subject positions and motivations. Behavior and normativity on Tinder are largely explained both by context and also by the design of the platform, which imports and displays personal data from other social networks. Findings should be limited to the population and location proposed as the fieldsite. ","",""
"2016","Managing uncertainty in mobile dating applications: Goals, concerns of use, and information seeking in Grindr"," The current research used uncertainty management theory (UMT) as a framework to examine individuals’ experience of uncertainty within the context of Grindr, an all-male, location-based mobile dating application. In two studies, we first investigated the particular concerns associated with Grindr use. Results indicated that the unique affordances of Grindr generated six categories of user concerns associated with use of the mobile application. The second study confirmed that a specific set of user goals and concerns predicted daters’ desire for uncertainty, which in turn predicted information-seeking behavior. Findings clearly indicate that Grindr users’ responses to uncertainty were not limited to simple reduction strategies, but were dependent upon their desire for and tolerance of uncertainty in relation to their goals and concerns of application use. The current results also help to establish UMT’s predictive power and explanatory utility within the realm of interpersonal communication. ","",""

This article argues that it is in the negotiation of contact during hookups that college students creatively navigate their sexual identity. Using a mixed methodology, this research reveals that the cell phone, as both an object of communication and consumption, is essential to the formation of self, and, as such, it provides the means by which men and women can play with gender boundaries. And yet, the male dominated fraternity system at college restricts the ability of women to realize full agency within the hookup scene. ","",""
"2017","Dressing up Tinderella: interrogating authenticity claims on the mobile dating app Tinder","ABSTRACT Mobile dating applications (‘apps’) have increased in popularity over recent years, with Tinder among the first to break into the mainstream heterosexual market. Since mobile dating intensifies the need to confirm that potential dates are not misrepresenting themselves and are safe to meet in person, Tinder’s success indicates that it has allayed these concerns regarding the authenticity of its users. This article combines Giddens’ conceptualization of authenticity, as the ability to reference a coherent biographical narrative, with Callon’s sociology of translation to investigate Tinder’s framing of authenticity within mobile dating. Applying a walkthrough method that interrogates Tinder’s technological architecture, promotional materials, and related media, this hybrid theoretical framework is used to identify how Tinder configures an actor-network that establishes its app as the solution to users’ concerns, enrols individuals in using its features in authenticity claims, and popularizes Tinder’s framing across public discourse. This network of human and non-human actors frames authenticity as being established through one’s Facebook profile and adherence to normative standards relating to age, gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic status. However, user discourses on other social media identify and challenge negative outcomes of this framing, with normativity fostering discrimination and Facebook verification failing to prevent abusive behaviour. This case study of Tinder paves the way for future investigation into user responses to its framing. Furthermore, it demonstrates the efficacy and broader applicability of this theoretical approach for identifying both human and technological influences on the construction of authenticity with digital media.","",""
"2017","What are you doing on Tinder? Impression management on a matchmaking mobile app","ABSTRACT Mobile dating applications such as Tinder have exploded in popularity in recent years. On Tinder, impression management begins with a motivation to download the app, the choice of one’s profile photos and an assessment of the expectations of potential Tinder matches. These processes occur in a technologically mediated environment of reduced cues and increased control, local proximity and a reduced filtering process. My focus in this paper is this first stage of impression management, which consists of both impression motivation and impression construction. Specifically, what are the pre-match impression management practices of Tinder users? I present the results of interviews with Tinder users in the Netherlands. Participants were recruited via a Tinder profile that advertised the study using the University emblem and a brief description. Interview questions focused on user understandings of self-presentation practices and profile construction. The interviews also examined how users evaluated their potential matches. Results show users’ motivations for using Tinder range from entertainment to ego-boost to relationship seeking, and these motivations sometimes change over time. Profile photos are selected in an attempt to present an ideal yet authentic self, and chosen as an illustration of not only one’s desirability but also of other indicators such as education level. Tinder users ‘swipe’ not only in search of people they like, but also for clues as to how to present themselves in order to attract others like them. This research offers insight into user experiences and perceptions within the still under-researched area of inquiry.","",""
"2017","All I get is an emoji: dating on lesbian mobile phone app <i>Butterfly</i>"," Unlike mobile apps for gay men, lesbian dating apps have been slow to catch on as a habitual space to look for friends and lovers. This study adopted a qualitative approach to investigate the social expectations and romantic longings of Chinese lesbians and bisexual women aged 35 and above in establishing same-sex relationships using mobile media. In-depth interviews were conducted with 12 Chinese lesbians and bisexual women, and participant observation was carried out on the Hong Kong-based lesbian social networking site Butterfly. The aim of the study was to explore the social meanings of intimacy created, negotiated and changed among Chinese lesbians and bisexual women. I argue that although social media presents ample opportunities for love and intimacy, the prevailing conservative values and cultural norms surrounding dating and relationships in Hong Kong are often reinforced and played out in their choice of romantic engagement.

"2017","Data cultures of mobile dating and hook-up apps: Emerging issues for critical social science research","The ethical and social implications of data mining, algorithmic curation and automation in the context of social media have been of heightened concern for a range of researchers with interests in digital media in recent years, with particular concerns about privacy arising in the context of mobile and locative media. Despite their wide adoption and economic importance, mobile dating apps have received little scholarly attention from this perspective – but they are intense sites of data generation, algorithmic processing, and cross-platform data-sharing; bound up with competing cultures of production, exploitation and use. In this paper, we describe the ways various forms of data are incorporated into, and emerge from, hook-up apps’ business logics, socio-technical arrangements, and cultures of use to produce multiple and intersecting data cultures. We propose a multi-layered research agenda for critical and empirical inquiry into this field, and suggest appropriate conceptual and methodological frameworks for exploring the social and political challenges of data cultures.","",""
"2017","Where Dating Meets Data: Investigating Social and Institutional Privacy Concerns on Tinder"," The widespread diffusion of location-based real-time dating or mobile dating apps, such as Tinder and Grindr, is changing dating practices. The affordances of these dating apps differ from those of “old school” dating sites, for example, by privileging picture-based selection, minimizing room for textual self-description, and drawing upon existing Facebook profile data. They might also affect users’ privacy perceptions as these services are location based and often include personal conversations and data. Based on a survey collected via Mechanical Turk, we assess how Tinder users perceive privacy concerns. We find that the users are more concerned about institutional privacy than social privacy. Moreover, different motivations for using Tinder—hooking up, relationship, friendship, travel, self-validation, and entertainment—affect social privacy concerns more strongly than institutional concerns. Finally, loneliness significantly increases users’ social and institutional privacy concerns, while narcissism decreases them. ","",""
"2017","Love at first swipe? Explaining Tinder self-presentation and motives"," The emergence of location-based real-time dating (LBRTD) apps such as Tinder has introduced a new way for users to get to know potential partners nearby. The design of the apps represents a departure from “old-school” dating sites as it relies on the affordances of mobile media. This might change the way individuals portray themselves as their authentic or deceptive self. Based on survey data collected via Mechanical Turk and using structural equation modeling, we assess how Tinder users present themselves, exploring at the same time the impact of their personality characteristics, their demographics, and their motives of use. We find that self-esteem is the most important psychological predictor, fostering real self-presentation but decreasing deceptive self-presentation. The motives of use—hooking up/sex, friendship, relationship, traveling, self-validation, and entertainment—also affect the two forms of self-presentation. Demographic characteristics and psychological antecedents influence the motives for using Tinder, with gender differences being especially pronounced. Women use Tinder more for friendship and self-validation, while men use it more for hooking up/sex, traveling, and relationship seeking. We put the findings into context, discuss the limitations of our approach and provide avenues for future research into the topic. ","",""
"2018","Gay men's digital cultures beyond Gaydar and Grindr: LINE use in the gay Chinese diaspora of Australia","ABSTRACT Recent research on gay men's digital cultures has focused predominantly on Western, English-language-based sites and populations. In the case of Australia, a country with an official multiculturalism framework in place and against a backdrop of significant levels of Asian immigration over the past several decades, a more pluralistic approach is needed to critically interrogate the dialectic between platforms, users and wider sociocultural complexities. To this end, the current paper presents research in progress on the social chat application LINE and its use amongst the Chinese diaspora of gay men in Australia. Drawing on data from participant observation carried out over several months during late 2015 and early 2016 in an Australian-based LINE group for local Chinese gay men, we highlight here how LINE functions as an important intermediary for many Chinese men engaging with gay men's digital cultures in this context. In particular, we show how LINE plays a crucial role in Chinese gay men's engagements with gay men's digital culture in Australia by (1) mediating this group's navigations of new social and cultural environments and (2) remediating their experiences within other platforms central to the broader GLBT community.","",""
"2018","From swiping to casual sex and/or committed relationships: Exploring the experiences of Tinder users","ABSTRACT To better understand if and how the mechanics of the process Tinder imposes on its users (i.e., swiping, matching, and starting conversations) influences the resulting sexual or romantic interactions, we collected data from 1038 Belgian Tinder users. Our findings show that a user's swiping quantity does not guarantee a higher number of Tinder matches, women have generally more matches than men and men usually have to start a conversation on Tinder. Moreover, while conversations were positively associated with reported offline Tinder encounters, less than half of our sample reported having had an offline meeting with another Tinder user. Whereas more than one third of these offline encounters led to casual sex, more than a quarter resulted in the formation of a committed relationship. Such findings indicate that Tinder is not “just a hookup app”, as often assumed in public discourse. We argue it is plausible that sexual encounters will eventually lead to committed relationships in a society where initiation of relationship formation with dating has been replaced by hooking up.","",""
"2018","“I Shut the Door”: Interactions, tensions, and negotiations from a location-based social app"," Location-based social apps leverage mobile phones to provide face-to-face (FtF) social opportunities for physically proximate individuals, such as finding nearby people to socialize, date, or hook up. Prior work on dating and hookup apps has focused mostly on profiles and user goals, but this leaves open important questions of how, after constructing a profile, people use these apps to connect and realize their goals, and what these experiences are like. We report on 22 interviews with users of Grindr, a location-based social app for men who have sex with men. We examine interaction processes from viewing profiles to meeting up. Using the perspective of relational dialectics, we explore tensions around connecting with others, sharing information, and being predictable or novel. We find that profile presentations are flexible and subject to change, disinhibition challenges interaction and revealing goals, and social consequences increase through moving from profile browsing to meeting FtF.

"2018","Ambivalence in networked intimacy: Observations from gay men using mobile dating apps"," The increasing popularity of mobile dating apps in the past decade has transformed the ways in which gay men network with each other. Based on sociology and media studies literature, I contextualize this contemporary form of intimacy, which is known as networked intimacy, in relation to networked individualism and neoliberalism. Using a mixed-methods design with interviews ( N = 7) and a survey ( N = 245), this study explored how gay men experience intimacy on these platforms. Users reported ambivalence in establishing relationships, which is brought forth by the ambiguity of relationships, dominance of profiles, and over-abundance of connections on these apps. I conclude that these aspects of ambivalence are not at all exclusive to the private domain of gay men but are tightly intertwined with the neoliberal market and consumption practices. ","",""

Simultaneously, it carries notorious reputation for being home to hypersexual and toxic masculine expressions. This analysis examines Tinder Nightmares, an Instagram page featuring failed attempts at hooking up, as a site that promotes counter-disciplining the deliberate toxic masculine performances on Tinder. Through a Foucauldian lens, we argue that this page delimits the toxic masculine performances through the outward display of crude performances, the showcasing of witty responses from Tinder users, and the extension of counter-discipline through digital circulation practices on the page. Given that Tinder is a location-aware app, the discipline offered through Tinder Nightmares surfaces in interpersonal, physical, and networked spaces, as Tinder users become multiply implicated public subjects of shame across media platforms.

"2018","“Mr Right Now”: Temporality of relationship formation on gay mobile dating apps"," Mobile dating apps with geolocation function have gained popularity for fostering social, romantic, and sexual connections between nearby strangers. Through in-depth interviews and focus-group discussions with 74 users of gay mobile dating apps (Grindr and Jack’d) in Hong Kong, this study illustrates how the sociological concept of time can shed light on users’ experience of relationship formation through these apps. Specifically, the accelerated tempo of interactions facilitated by perpetual connectivity, mutual proximity awareness, and instant messaging was seen to entail instantaneous and ephemeral relationships. The interface design, which foregrounds profile photos and backgrounds textual self-descriptions, was perceived to structure the sequence of browsing and screening in favor of physical appearance and users seeking casual hook-ups. The findings suggest that the temporality of browsing and exchange on apps is incongruous with the temporal norms prescribing formation of friendship and long-term romance. Such incongruity affects the perceived quality and satisfaction of app use, frustrating users who seek more durable relationships. ","",""

Using a case study of Hong Kong lesbian app Butterfly, I explicate how and why users cosituate on and off the app within their context. By analyzing digital ethnography and offline interviews data, I argue that Butterfly provides a mobile communication infrastructure for users to meet their lesbian needs and desires of (in)visible self, relationships, and community. The spatiality and mobility of the app enable users to cosituate in (a) the online and offline public and private spaces, (b) the disclosure and concealment of lesbian identities, and (c) the individual lesbian fantasies and sociocultural, political, and religious contexts. However, users’ cosituation as tactical resistance to the heteronormative context does not come without a cost. ","",""
"2019","“I STILL WANT TO KNOW THEY’RE NOT TERRIBLE PEOPLE”: NEGOTIATING TRUST, PLEASURE AND QUEER ETHICS IN LGBTQ+ YOUNG PEOPLE’S DATING APP USE","Dating and hook-up apps constitute spaces of intense negotiation around issues of sex, identity and intimacy, in which norms are tested and reinforced. This paper examines discussions of ‘ideal app use’ which emerged in qualitative workshops conducted in 2018 with 23 LGBTQ+ app-users aged 18-35 in urban and regional New South Wales. We explore how a reading of in-app practices - such as messaging, picture-sharing and blocking - through a lens of queer ethics can inform LGBTQ+ young people’s ‘rules’ for app use. Participants were invited to create 'how-tos' for ideal app use, and describe the ways they distinguished ‘good’ (or trustworthy) profiles from ‘bad’ (untrustworthy) profiles via creative design activities. In their discussions, participants articulated their ‘rules’ for filtering matches in relation to particular design features of apps which enabled (sexed and gendered) cultures of accountability to others. As in Duguay’s (2017) research on queer women’s deployment of in-app affordances as ‘identity modulation’, participants interacted with other users and interpreted their profiles in relation not only to sexual desires, but also queer politics and identity. In many instances, this was expressed through a heightened sense of responsibility for self-knowledge and self-disclosure, and a need to connect with ‘good people’ with a shared political sensibility. At other times, participants acknowledged the challenges of negotiating politicised responsibility to others while simultaneously pursuing the kinds of pleasurable connections they sought on apps, and limiting their own self-disclosure as a means of guarding their physical and emotional safety.","",""
"2019","TRUST IN FRIENDSHIP: LGBTQ+ YOUNG PEOPLE AND HOOK-UP APP SAFETIES","Digital media research commonly explores the use of social media platforms and dating/hook-up apps separately, implying distance between social and sexual communication practices. By exploring how friendships enfold into LGBTQ+ young people’s use of dating/hook-up apps, this paper troubles that delineation. In 2018, we ran four workshops with LGBTQ+ young people (18-35 years) about negotiating safety in dating/hook-up apps. Discussion of friendship featured in all workshops, mostly related to four key themes: the safety of having mutual friends with prospective dates/hook-ups; friend-making through apps; friend-involvement in safety strategies; and friendship advice on app use. Through analysis of these data, we highlight how friendship is an organising force in LGBTQ+ young people’s dating/hook-up app practices, and argue for greater attention to the porousness of media sites commonly defined as social (e.g. Instagram) or sexual (e.g. Tinder). Participants demonstrate that trust in friendship is far greater that their trust in apps, and so this is called upon, at many levels, to negotiate app use. Notably mutual friends (‘mutuals’) offer greater feelings of safety. An overlap between friendship and sexual connections is also apparent in these data, as per discussion of 'sliding into DMs'. Participants who were not cisgender men had greater concern for safety, and thus more knowledge on how to negotiate apps (and dating) safely, particularly through friendship support networks.","",""
"2019","Dating gone mobile: Demographic and personality-based correlates of using smartphone-based dating applications among emerging adults"," Mobile dating is more common with an increasing number of smartphone applications coming to market that aim to facilitate dating. In the current study, we investigated how dating app use and motivations related to demographic identity variables (i.e. gender and sexual orientation) and personality-based variables among young adults. Nearly half of the sample used dating apps regularly, with Tinder being the most popular. Non-users were more likely to be heterosexual, high in dating anxiety, and low in sexual permissiveness than dating app users. Among app users, dating app motivations, that is, relational goal motivations (love, casual sex), intrapersonal goal motivations (self-worth validation, ease of communication), and entertainment goal motivations (thrill of excitement, trendiness), were meaningfully related to identity features, for example, sexual permissiveness was related to the casual sex motive. Our study underlines that users’ identity drives their motivations for and engagement in mobile dating. However, more research is needed to study how sexual orientation influences mobile dating.

This study analyzes talks about Tinder on Reddit (/r/Tinder), as part of Tinder culture where Tinder discourse and norms are established and shared in relation to broader youth pairing culture. Through a lens of feminist media scholarship, I show that an association between Tinder and hookups is couched in a gendered code of conduct, coolness.

People with a more anxious attachment orientation were more likely to report using dating apps than people lower in anxious attachment; people with a more avoidant attachment orientation were less likely to report using dating apps than people lower in avoidant attachment. Participants who used dating apps cited Tinder, OkCupid, and Plenty of Fish as those most commonly used. The most common reason people reported for using apps was to meet others, and the most common reason people reported for not using apps was difficulty trusting people online.

"2020","Calculating dating goals: data gaming and algorithmic sociality on Blued, a Chinese gay dating app","ABSTRACT Although studies on gay dating apps have shown the ways through which technical features intervene in sexual sociality, seldom do they shed light on the central feature that undergirds their use ‒ algorithms. This article examines Blued, China’s largest gay dating app, aiming to unfold the data structure and algorithms that navigate the use of its two prime functionalities: browsing and live streaming. Rather than seeing users as passive audiences that are subject to being measured and calculated based on algorithmically filtered information, this article argues that users can act on the data they provide to dating apps to influence and shape the algorithmic dating outcomes. For Blued browsing, gay men are datafied with numbers and tags for users to sort and filter. For Blued live, gay men are evaluated by the yanzhi algorithm, which literally means ‘value of a person’s face’, for users to pinpoint dating goals. By gaming the data and shaping their algorithmic outcomes, an algorithmic sociality is animated through the filter browsing and the yanzhi metric. In this way, algorithms have become ritual tools for gay sociality on Blued. This article ends by opening up critiques on the justification of social biases lurking inside this algorithmic sociality.","",""
"2020","Judging books by their covers – Tinder interface, usage and sociocultural implications","ABSTRACT Public discourse on Tinder depicts the dating app as marking the end of traditional – as well as healthy – notions of love and romance, permeating them with a logic of consumption and commodification. Our article offers a close reading of the Tinder user interface in order to inquire into how – and in how far – the contours of such commodity culture can be traced into the design and usage of the app. Guided by critical and Foucauldian theory, we indeed find strong objectifying tendencies built into the interface. However, these tendencies are riddled with contradictions and ambiguities. Thus, while the emphasis on the visual exacerbates pressures for users to meet bodily norms of beauty, it also reinvigorates embodied intuition and ‘gut feeling’, the loss of which has been critiqued in studies on more traditional forms of online dating. Furthermore, whereas the swipe gesture appears paradigmatic of a binary consume-and/or-discard attitude, Tinder’s monetising strategies indicate the users’ wish to amend and repair this attitude. Lastly, the aesthetics of the database feed a desire of ‘swiping on’ that is insatiable. However, building on existing research, we see the consequent flattening out of personal relations on Tinder to merely displace the longing for love and romance to a sphere beyond the app’s reach.","",""
"2020","Multiple uses and anti-purposefulness on Momo, a Chinese dating/social app","ABSTRACT Momo is becoming a popular mobile platform in China to date, hook up, and engage in social networking. Based on in-depth interviews with 35 dating app users and a survey of 250 current Momo users, I provide a detailed empirical account of the multiple uses of Momo. Momo users used Momo differently, with systematic gender differences and differences among people of various marital statuses. Furthermore, my informants used the notion of mudixing (purposefulness) to describe the direct, overt relationship-seeking practice prevalent on marriage websites, in matching by parents, and among some Momo users. They strongly objected to mudixing and believed Momo having less mudixing. This anti-mudixing may signal push-back against the increasing neoliberalization of Chinese intimacy that foregrounds material calculation and access to more partners. Nonetheless, Momo operates according to market principles. It is, therefore, hard to discern whether Momo is an alternative to the neoliberalization of intimacy in China.","",""
"2020","Social constructivist account of the world’s largest gay social app: Case study of Blued in China","Abstract Given China’s political conservativism and limited social acceptance of sexual minorities, it is paradoxical to find that Blued, a gay social app headquartered in Beijing, has become the largest app of this kind globally. Informed by the social construction of technology perspective and based on a yearlong ethnography, this article identifies three major factors that have shaped the developmental trajectory of Blued: (1) work with the Communist Party of China to employ Blued as a health education platform; (2) switch in orientation from a hookup app to a social app; and (3) push for the commercialization and internationalization of the app. This article spotlights that the voices of users were missing in the development process and argues that, for Blued to continue maintaining its success, it must stop relying on the “I-methodology” in its design and development. Lastly, it contributes to the SCOT scholarship and social app studies by deciphering the role of the state in app development in the Chinese context.","",""
"2020","You can’t use this app for that: Exploring off-label use through an investigation of Tinder","Abstract This article reconceptualizes the pharmacological term “off-label use” in the context of platforms and apps. It combines literature on technological appropriation with research on platforms’ sociotechnical arrangements to understand off-label use as platform appropriation. This conceptual work is applied to an investigation of Tinder, involving analysis of the platform, media articles, and interviews. Findings show that off-label use, such as marketing and campaigning, appropriates Tinder’s infrastructure and sociocultural meanings. Tinder also responds to disruptive off-label uses with changes in governance and infrastructure. This analysis shows how off-label use can locate user agency while uncovering shifting relations among users and platforms.","",""
"2020","Meet markets: Grindr and the politics of objectifying others","Critics have faulted Grindr and similar apps for commodifying social relations; instead of treating potential partners as ‘human beings’, Grindr users are thought to treat each other as objects to be consumed and disposed of at whim. Focusing on Tim Dean’s critique of online cruising in his book Unlimited Intimacy, this article interrogates the assumption that objectification is politically toxic and proposes that it may have something politically useful to offer. Inspired by the ‘antisocial thesis’ in queer theory, and in particular work by Leo Bersani, the article argues that being treated as an object usefully preserves a gap between oneself and one’s potential partner, thwarting the desire to know, speak for, and act in the interest of others – a tendency that may appear altruistic but has annihilative ends. The article frames this gap in terms of both mediation and market relations.","",""
"2020","Self-presentation and impressions of personality through text-based online dating profiles: A lens model analysis"," In online dating, the self-authored profile serves as the primary way for daters to introduce themselves to others and to learn more about potential partners. However, few studies have examined the extent to which daters’ self-authored profile content is consistent with the impressions that others actually form. This study applied the Brunswikian lens model (1956) to examine self-presentation and impression formation in the text-based “about me” portion of the online dating profile. Using the meaning extraction method, we analyzed 190 profiles. Consistent with the lexical approach to personality, daters were able to encode aspects of themselves through linguistic self-description (cue validity), and observers were able to decode profile information to form impressions (cue utilization). However, there were few significant associations between a dater’s self-presentation and observers’ judgments (functional achievement). Findings are interpreted in line with previous work examining self-presentation and impressions in online dating profiles. ","",""
"2020","Tinder’s lesbian digital imaginary: Investigating (im)permeable boundaries of sexual identity on a popular dating app"," Dating apps have received rapid uptake, with Tinder as one of the most popular apps in the heterosexual market. However, little research has investigated the experiences of women seeking women (WSW) on this app. This article combines two interview studies of WSW in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom to investigate their self-presentations of sexual identity on Tinder. By configuring settings to “seeking women,” participants perceived they were entering a space conducive to finding WSW. However, men, couples, and heterosexual women permeated this space, heightening the need for participants to signal non-heterosexual identity. Their signals fused references to lesbian and queer culture with Tinder’s infrastructure to evoke a digital imaginary, as a routinized set of practices imagined to resonate with a shared community. Although signals within this digital imaginary were sometimes playful and ambiguous, their default toward a recognizable lesbian identity often rendered other sexual or gender identities invisible.

"2020","Layers of Marginality: An Exploration of Visibility, Impressions, and Cultural Context on Geospatial Apps for Men Who Have Sex With Men in Mumbai, India"," Some social technologies can reduce marginality by enabling access to individuals and resources through increased visibility and opportunities for social connection, but visibility carries risks that may be outsized for some marginalized populations. This article reports on a study of location-based social apps (LBSA) used by men who have sex with men (MSM) in Mumbai, India, a legally and socially marginalized population. LBSAs, which facilitate interaction and social connection between physically proximate individuals would seem at first to be a valuable resource in reducing marginality for MSM by connecting otherwise isolated individuals with each other. We explored this from a socio-technical perspective through a qualitative study of MSM in Mumbai, India, who use LBSAs. Results suggest that, as in other contexts, using LBSAs presented formidable risks and challenges such as information security and identification by others, but also could serve as a valuable resource for connecting MSM to each other.

"2020","Looking for “interesting people”: Chinese gay men’s exploration of relationship development on dating apps"," Mobile dating applications play a prominent role in Chinese gay men’s social lives. Based on in-depth interviews with 21 participants, this study explores how urban gay singles in China develop social relationships on dating apps. It reveals that relationship development is often driven by casual conversations, which are not motivated by clear pragmatic purposes. Casual conversations tend to unfold around common hobbies or experiences, serving as a source of sociability, or satisfaction in socializing itself. In contrast to casual conversations, two forms of conversations are deemed highly instrumental and undesirable: one is the sex-oriented conversation aimed at immediate sexual encounters; the other is the interrogative conversation in which people ask private questions in a nonreciprocal and rigid way. Besides craving sociability, users “relationalize” casual sex by perceiving it as a form of social connection and endowing it with the potential to foster a relationship. This is also reflected in users’ preference for sexual partners with whom they can hold a conversation. Users also exploit the affordances of different media platforms and capture the relationship potential by platform switching. They switch to the mainstream media platform WeChat for more synchronous communication and to collect more identity cues from each other. Platform switching also signals willingness for relationship development and mutual trust. Nevertheless, users keep going back to dating apps for new possibilities for social relationships. ","",""
"2021","Mobile Dating Apps and Racial Preferencing Insights: Exploring Self-Reported Racial Preferences and Behavioral Racial Preferences Among Gay Men Using Jack’d","This study quantitatively explored racial preferencing behavior among American and Australian men on Jack’d, a gay dating app. Self-reported racial preferences found on users’ written profiles were compared with behavioral racial preferences accessed through the app’s “insight” feature, representing users’ actual behaviors. Data of 705 users from Los Angeles and 463 users from Sydney were collected. Findings show that while inclusionary racial preferencing was more prevalent than exclusionary racial preferencing, expressions of racial preference on profiles were uncommon overall. Looking at the behavioral data, the study reveals that Asian men were the most preferred mates among Asian and White users in both cities, whereas Black men were the most preferred among Black and Hispanic users in Los Angeles. Together, these findings suggest that some forms of racial hierarchies still operate in terms of actual behaviors on Jack'd. We argue that these findings have implications for the ways that gay dating apps approach the challenges of developing inclusive services.","",""
"2021","Negotiating gender scripts in mobile dating apps: between affordances, usage norms and practices","ABSTRACT The paper explores the perception and negotiation of gender representations and scripts among Italian dating app users. Adopting a gender perspective and a socio-technical framework, it describes how dating app affordances support the performance of gender scripts and explores how users negotiate gender scripts. We conducted 8 focus groups involving 39 dating app users from a variety of gender and sexual orientations. The results show how shared usage norms and practices disclose dominant gender scripts at play, and illustrate how some users try to subvert them. Participants are aware of a number of traditional and stereotypical gender scripts and broadly adhere to them; nevertheless, such scripts are partially reframed in the context of dating apps. Dating apps are mainly understood in terms of affordances, when participants highlight the ways in which they or their mates reduce the incidence of traditional scripts. On the other hand, dating apps’ constraints emerge when some users try to detach themselves from common scripts, or when they struggle to perform traditional scripts in a context they perceive as inadequate. Results highlight how dating app users negotiate gender scripts: affordances and constraints of dating apps shape user practices and influence the performance and ‘de-inscription’ of gender scripts, without directly fostering the adoption of alternative scripts.","",""
"2021","Tinder blue, mental flu? Exploring the associations between Tinder use and well-being","ABSTRACT While Tinder (i.e., a popular mobile dating app) has received quite some research attention, its effects on users’ well-being have rarely been addressed. The present study investigates the extent to which Tinder users’ compulsive use, motives, subjective online success and self-conscious social comparison are associated with their well-being (i.e., joviality, sadness, and anxiety). In total, 296 (39% females; 90% heterosexuals) emerging adults who were currently using Tinder completed an online survey. The results suggest that while using Tinder compulsively and for relationship seeking can increase joviality, they may trigger more negative than positive affect. Moreover, feeling unsuccessful on Tinder and making self-conscious social comparisons were positively associated with sadness and anxiety, and negatively associated with joviality. The results seem to imply that Tinder users need to be aware of their compulsive Tinder use, relationship seeking motive, unsuccessful feeling, and/or self-conscious social comparison tendency on Tinder to better understand the consequences of their Tinder use. Although the current study is based on cross-sectional data, the findings suggest an association between using Tinder and users’ well-being. Future research could extend these findings by utilizing a longitudinal research design and including other aspects of well-being and psychopathology such as life satisfaction and depression.","",""
"2021","On ‘never right-swipe whites’ and ‘only date whites’: gendered and racialised digital dating experiences of the Australian Chinese diaspora","ABSTRACT This paper examines the Australian Chinese diaspora’s digital dating experiences afforded by both Chinese-language and global English digital dating/hook-up services. Digital dating offers an interesting context for an analysis of the Australian Chinese diaspora’s interracial romantic and sexual engagements, through which we can examine how race, and its intersections with ethnicity, gender and sexuality is represented, consumed, and practised. We were able to reach three conclusions from the participant experiences presented in this article. First, digital dating and its constitutive norms play a role in maintaining certain tropes of cultural representation of racial subjects and securing cultural power within an overarching system of white racial entitlement. Second, we found that agency is key to understanding the female participants’ dating experiences. Third, the male participants tended to form negative and sometimes distorted social perceptions of white Australian women as a result of being neglected on English-language dating sites.","",""
"2021","Hooking up with friends: LGBTQ+ young people, dating apps, friendship and safety"," Research exploring digital intimate publics tends to consider social media platforms and dating/hook-up apps separately, implying distance between social and sexual communication practices. This paper troubles that delineation by drawing on LGBTQ+ young people’s accounts of negotiating safety and risk in dating/hook-up apps, in which friendship practices are significant. We explore four key themes of friendship that arose in our analysis of interviews and workshop discussions: sharing mutuals (or friends-in-common) with potential dates/hook-ups; making friends through apps; friends supporting app negotiations; and friends’ involvement in safety strategies. Through analysis of these data, we firstly argue that friendship is often both an outcome and an organising force of LGBTQ+ young people’s uses of dating/hook-up apps, and secondly, that media sites commonly defined as social (e.g. Instagram) or sexual (e.g. Tinder) are imbricated, with friendship contouring queer sex and dating practices.

"2021","Domesticating dating apps: Non-single Chinese gay men’s dating app use and negotiations of relational boundaries"," Dating app use is prevalent among non-single Chinese gay men. Applying domestication theory, this study explores how dating apps can be accepted in gay romantic relationships. The author argues that the domestication of technological artifacts unfolds on four dimensions: the practical, the symbolic, the cognitive, and the relational. Findings show that dating apps serve a dual role: a pool of sexual or romantic alternatives and a channel to the gay community. Although the former constitutes a threat to monogamy, the latter leaves room for a couple’s negotiation for acceptable but restricted uses. This negotiation is in tandem with the negotiation of relational boundaries, which leads to either the reinforcement of monogamy or the embrace of non-monogamy. Meanwhile, one can perceive dating apps to be as unremarkable as other social media platforms. This is achieved through a cognitive process where gay men learn to debunk the arbitrary association between dating apps and infidelity. Monogamous or not, they put faith in user agency, not perceiving dating apps as a real threat to romantic relationships. ","",""

In this paper, we argue that the mystique surrounding Tinder’s         algorithms is as productive for the dating app industry as the actual technical operations         they perform. We seek to understand how actors in the dating industry construct matchmaking         algorithms as strategic unknowns that can be harnessed to reach commercial objectives. To do         so, we mobilize the notion of ‘algorithmic blackboxing’ – how actors strategically construct         algorithms as black boxes to reach certain goals – to analyze a corpus of 48 online dating         guides that offer ‘best advice’ to exploit Tinder’s matchmaking algorithms. Our analysis         shows that dating guides overwhelmingly construct Tinder’s algorithms as black boxes whose         secrets must be unlocked for users to generate matches and, therefore, find love. The         alleged unintelligibility and opacity of Tinder’s algorithms allow self-proclaimed ‘dating         experts’ to sell their advice or services in the context of a speculative dating economy. To         obtain more matches, dating guides promote a common injunction: to hack Tinder. They invite         users to modulate their behaviors and practices to become more algorithmically recognizable.         Dating guides also readily invoke rhetorical arguments that draw on statistical data         produced by Tinder, which highlights the emergence of new ‘regimes of truth’ within the         matchmaking industry that enact a dataist ideology. We conclude by advocating for the         importance of critically examining the increasing algorithmic mediation of dating cultures         at the intersection of Internet, gender, and sexuality studies.","",""

The first finding shows that respondents began         using dating apps like Tinder and Bumble because they wanted to engage in dialogical         exchanges to get to know their matches, something they felt the elaborate essays on OkCupid         rendered redundant. The second finding shows that the intimate exchanges they sought on         dating apps were hard to find. Instead of intimacy, they encountered anxious text games         exacerbated by the widespread practice of ghosting. These findings indicate how the distinct         algorithms employed by OkCupid, Tinder, and Bumble cultivate particular feelings, moods, and         modes of subjectivity. While OkCupid’s algorithm cultivated entrepreneurs of themselves         seeking to optimize their intimate relationships, dating apps cultivate the digital unbored:         users compelled to swipe away the angst-inducing boredom of waiting for texts that always         may never come. Dating apps render searches for intimacy fraught with anxiety and         substantial connections hard to find. But they are well calibrated to the exigencies of         platform capitalism, where social relations are as likely to be sold as things, especially         when they vanish as quickly as they appear – like ghosts.","",""

Men in our study — which sought to better understand the aspects of app use that make young people feel safer or less safe — offered affectively loaded accounts of app use, which featured racialized and gendered experiences of ‘awkwardness’, shame, and contempt. Our analysis engages with Bollen and McInnes’ concept of ‘sexual choreographies’, which focused on the inter-affective and embodied aspects of cis gay men’s sexual learning practices as a means of reframing our thinking around the ways cis men who date women engage with dating app technologies and cultures. Drawing on Elspeth Probyn’s theorization of shame as a pedagogically productive affect, we argue that the affect-response of shame-humiliation can be turned to a productive, self-reflexive opportunity for improving gendered experiences of app use.","",""

We hypothesized that the quality of alternatives, investments, and satisfaction with the online dating relationship would mediate the association between online dating intensity and commitment, which, in turn, would predict the intention to terminate an account. The analyses revealed that online dating intensity was associated with greater commitment and a lower likelihood of account termination. There were also specific indirect effects on commitment through the quality of alternatives, investments, and satisfaction, and on termination through investments. Responses to an open-ended question provided more information about users’ decisions to quit online dating. These results point to ways online dating may facilitate the desire for commitment while potentially undermining the long-term stability of relationships. ","",""

With an increase in their use, these applications may serve as vectors for experiencing cybervictimization. Limited research has examined the implications that application usage has on individual experiences with cybervictimization, particularly cyberstalking, cyberharassment, image-based abuse, and identity deception. Using a sample of college students ( N = 324; 73% female), and concentrating primarily on Tinder users, this study examines the correlates of experiencing these forms of cybervictimization, concentrating on the influence that application infrastructure and profile features (e.g., Global Positioning System [GPS] functionality) have on the likelihood of cybervictimization. Results indicate inconsistent and largely insignificant effects, suggesting that opting into the use of safety features and protective measures cannot guarantee protection from application-based forms of cybervictimization. As such, policy implications and directions for future research are discussed. ","",""
"2021","From “Oh, you’re Chinese . . . ” to “No bats, thx!”: Racialized Experiences of Australian-Based Chinese Queer Women in the Mobile Dating Context"," This article explores racial exclusion, bias, and prejudice in the context of same-sex mobile dating, focusing on the experiences of a group of Australian-based Chinese queer women. Semi-structured in-depth interviews and participant observation were used to examine participants’ racialized experiences. The findings indicate that Western dating apps, such as Tinder, Bumble, and HER, served as crucial channels of these women’s interracial and intercultural encounters while living in Australia. However, they largely perceived these apps, and HER in particular, as White-dominated and ill-suited to their dating practices, thus reinforcing their sense of exclusion and ostracism. Although the participants frequently encountered subtle prejudice on dating apps, they experienced more blatant and aggressive forms of racism triggered by the COVID-19 outbreak. Multiple factors, including their language capability, the COVID-19 pandemic, and their racial, ethnic, and diasporic identities, played an intersectional role in these women’s racialized experiences. Correspondingly, the participants developed diverse interpretations of and responses to their racialized experiences. This study reveals how the anti-Asian racism in the global West permeates the realm of queer women in the context of mobile dating. It contributes to understanding the digital dating practices and racialized experiences of queer women and the broader Chinese diaspora. ","",""

Drawing on feminist approaches and technological affordances, we examine how heterosexual cisgender women and men experience this “empowerment” and contrast it to other mobile dating app use. We used a multimethod approach to conducting app walkthroughs, focus groups, and interviews to contrast the mobile dating apps, Tinder and Bumble. The findings reveal that perceptions of free choice and action determine empowerment experiences. Our study reveals that the “forced empowerment” on Bumble was still strongly shaped by heterosexual gender norms that encouraged “good” girls and guys to use the app to look for long-term relationships but continue to use Tinder to hook up, despite the popular misogyny on Tinder identified by both men and women in our study. We conclude by discussing the empowerment paradox of dating apps through popular feminism and misogyny. ","",""
"2021","Constructing Sexual Fields: Chinese Gay Men’s Dating Practices Among Pluralized Dating Apps"," In this study, we draw on sexual field theory to examine the structural nature of metropolitan Chinese gay men’s mobile dating practices in a polymedia environment where one can access an array of dating apps. We define structures of desire in the sexual field as not only the transpersonal valuations of desirability but also the dominance of particular desires that coordinate actors’ expectations and practices. Based on interviews with 52 urban Chinese gay men, we discuss the differing structures of desire hosted by four dating apps: Aloha, Blued, Grindr, and Tinder. Our analysis indicates that factors such as design features of dating apps, marketing strategies of app companies, and internet regulations have shaped the structures of desire by unevenly distributing the platform access to users across social classes and territorial divisions and (dis)enabling particular communicative practices in collective sexual life to different extents. The distance-sorted display of nearby users contributes to the predominance of immediate hook-ups on Blued and Grindr, while the matching mechanism of Aloha and Tinder functions as a “speed bump” and nourishes users’ expectations for lasting connections. As Blued is the most popular gay dating app on the heavily guarded Chinese internet market, the diversity of its users drives away many metropolitan middle-class gay men who only desire their own kind. In comparison, Aloha, Grindr, and Tinder, with smaller user bases, are more specialized sexual sites where the dominant currency of sexual capital reflects the middle-class standard for “quality.” ","",""

By inviting WOC Tinder users into an ethnographic study, I show the instability of race that mediates their lived experiences in line with gender in the culture of sexual intimacy. I focus on two female study participants living in the United States: Greek–Black biracial Betty and Korean-Asian Rose. By examining their processes of revisiting their Tinder episodes and developing their conclusive stories vis-à-vis their identities, I argue that they perform their race processed through ongoing negotiation with the social systems and their personal lived experiences, to respond to racialization, gendering, and sexualization in the pairing culture, mediated by the image-centered dating app, Tinder.","",""
"2022","Compulsory interracial intimacy: Why does removing the ethnicity filter on dating apps not benefit racial minorities?"," This paper reflects on the impact of dating apps’ removal of ethnicity filters on racial minority users. Many scholars, mass media, and dating app users believe that ethnicity filters mark an institutional endorsement of racism which is embedded in digital infrastructure. Accordingly, they have called for the removal of these filters. This advocacy is based on the assumption that expressions of racial preference are inherently racist. In the summer of 2020, many dating apps removed ethnicity filters to show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. However, I argue that racial minorities often express intra-racial desires through ethnicity filters to valorize their own sexual capital, evade discrimination or fetishization, and gain sexual opportunities. Consequently, removing the ethnicity filter makes it harder for racial minorities to connect. Even worse, it creates a culture of compulsory interracial intimacy, exposing minority users to more vulnerability and racial trauma. Moreover, the lack of discussion on whether to remove filters other than ethnicity reveals the negligence of intersecting oppressions on dating apps. Thus, this paper highlights the need to be more attentive to racial minorities’ alternative uses of filters for self-empowerment, and to intersectional oppressions that should be tackled in designing inclusive dating apps.

Queer women in this research expressed concerns about being cheated by low quality( suzhi) lovers, swindlers, and married women.

"2022","Shades of digital deception: Self-presentation among men seeking men on locative dating apps"," In recent years, location-based real-time dating apps like Grindr and Tinder have assumed an increasingly pivotal role in brokering socio-sexual relations between men seeking men and have proven to be fertile ground for the study of identity negotiation and impression management. However, current research has given insufficient consideration to how various contextual elements of technology use interact with one another to shape self-presentation behaviour. Through analysis of interview data, we found impression construction on these apps reflects tensions between authentic depiction of the self-concept and self-enhancement via deception. Whether and the extent to which one engages in deception depends on how a number of technological affordances, platform-specific community norms and userbase characteristics interact with each other. Self-presentational choices were a result of a combination of deception facilitators, for example, belief in the normalcy of lying, and constraining determinants, for example, the expectation of brokering physical connection. Impression construction determinants also interact in ways where the influence of any one element is dependent on others. This was most plainly evidenced in the interactions between stigma management concerns, the affordances of audience visibility/control and locatability and common ground reinforcing social hierarchy.

This is captured in the concept intimacy collapse of which I examine three types: one between immediacy and foresight, another between organic and representational pleasure objects, and a third between personal and social acts of looking. The analysis demonstrates that intimacy collapses in hook-up apps produce new (in)visibilities, anxieties and opportunities that are distributed unevenly across the disparate online cultures and identities that make up gay culture.","",""

Drawing on material from individual interviews with adult British women about their experiences of hetero-sexting, the article develops an understanding of women’s hetero-sexting practices as a form of female-conducted ‘mediated intimacy work’, constituted by a constant negotiation of female risk taking and male trustworthiness. In doing so, it shows how the women relied on and made active use of the sexting-related risk of digital image abuse as a means to establish and enhance trust and, as such, stress the significance of their hetero-sexting activities as performances of intimacy. Sexting-induced vulnerability was therefore both drawn on and dismissed within the very same accounts of hetero-sexting, as it was applied as a means to perform a new form of normative femininity, namely that of the agentic intimacy worker.

"2022","“Someone Else Is Behind The Screen”: Visibility, Privacy, and Trust on Geosocial Networking Apps in India"," Queer people increasingly use geosocial networking apps (GSNAs), such as Grindr and Blued, to find connections. These apps play a particularly important role in countries such as India, where being visibly queer can carry social stigma, and same-sex intercourse was criminalized until 2018. A key challenge on these apps is self-disclosing enough information to appear authentic and build trust with other users, without drawing unwanted attention, stigma, and safety threats. Careful consideration of when to share information and what to share is critical, but we have a limited understanding of how users make these decisions. Drawing upon in-depth interviews with 36 queer men in 4 smaller urban environments in and near the state of Maharashtra, India, we sought to understand how queer men think about their visibility while using GSNAs. We find that they are primarily concerned with the visibility of the actual GSNA on their phone, especially given many users in this context live with their families and assumptions common in the West, such as one person per device, may not hold. They also worry about the information they disclose on the app itself given this visibility can lead to dangerous situations. We detail how participants try to resolve the tensions around visibility and discuss our findings in relation to conceptualizations of privacy and signaling theory. We conclude with practical guidelines related to the use of these apps in the Indian context. ","",""
"2022","Towards an Entrepreneurial Ethics of Desire? LGBTQ Location-based Dating/Hook-up Apps and the Configurations of Sexual-affective Relationships Among Gay Men in Brazil","This article aims to reflect on how changes in digital sociability practices influence on the affective and sexual relationships among gay men in Northeast Brazil. We argue some of these changes are associated with an entrepreneurial ethics of desire, which is a set of desiring and sociability practices influenced by neoliberal imperatives, such as free competition, high selectiveness, meritocracy, economic rationale, utilitarianism, and self-entrepreneurship. In a mediatised reality under platform capitalism, we wonder: by taking on market-oriented practices, how do individuals constitute themselves as differentiated desiring subjects? We seek to elucidate this point by analysing seven in-depth interviews conducted with gay men whose affective-sexual trajectories have been impacted by communication technologies’ transformations in the last three decades. All respondents were gay men between 25-34 years old, residents in Recife’s metropolitan area and were contacted via Grindr. Focused on cultural scripts for sex mediated by digital media and on self-presentation in profiles, we investigate how these individuals negotiate homoerotic sociabilities simultaneously on different social platforms. In an attempt to constitute themselves as “desirable” subjects in digital spheres, these individuals experience several tensions that are triggered by social markers of desire, such as race, class, gender performativity and physicality. Based on an intersectional approach, we aim to identify aspects of what we define as an entrepreneurial ethics of desire. We also propose to investigate whether, in terms of resistance and indiscipline, we can think of an alternative sexual-affective ethics for sociability and desiring practices – namely a queer ethics of desire.","",""

Drawing on interviews with young adults, I rely on an existential media analysis, exploring struggles with and around mobile dating apps. I argue that the datafication of intimacy is a particular way of experiencing intimacy, going beyond the socio-technological functions of mobile dating apps. I show how the datafication of intimacy is a mathematical mind-set characterized by commercialization and rationalization (predictability, controllability, convenience), building a relationship of interdependency between a data economy and intimacy.

"2022","The Tinder Games: Collective mobile dating app use and gender conforming behavior"," Mobile dating apps like Tinder became very popular among young adults, and, in contrast to mobile dating websites, they were designed to create a more game-like experience. While it is well documented that seeking entertainment is one core motivation for mobile dating app use, the social nature of entertainment has garnered less attention. Therefore, in this paper we draw on research on entertainment in dating apps and the socio-physical contexts of use to identify patterned behaviors of heterosexual users. To do this, we employed a qualitative multi-phase research approach. First, we conducted 20 interviews with mobile dating app users. Based on the findings from that study, we conducted gender-specific focus groups and a discourse analysis to explore the social phenomena identified in phase one. Our findings suggest the fun of mobile dating is not just interacting with potential matches through the apps, but the use of the apps among one’s friends. These “dating games” are entertaining, but importantly mitigate potential social or physical risks of mobile dating. Unsurprisingly, notions of “play” across the interview, focus group, and discourse analyses reflect highly gendered practices surrounding mobile dating apps and different risks associated with such games.

"2023","“ARE WE DATING THE SAME GUY?”: COLLECTIVE SENSEMAKING AS A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY IN FACEBOOK GROUPS","Hinge to happily ever after is an arduous process in which dating apps place the burden of risk management on users. Women across the U.S. have joined regional “Are We Dating the Same Guy?” private Facebook groups to manage the ambiguities of dating, crowdsource information on men, and provide social support to other women experiencing the tribulations of modern dating. Using discourse analysis, this study analyzes the collective sensemaking practices of AWDTSG groups in relation to constructing knowledge, managing privacy boundaries, content moderation, and providing social support. Preliminary analysis reveals three major findings: Facebook groups provide a space of empowerment, however anticipated acts of moderation shape how knowledge claims are formed and legitimized. Second, group level moderation enacted by admins is understood by members as a means of community protection against platform interventions and interpersonal conflict with the outgroup. Third, social support is an integral part of knowledge creation, resisting cultural logics that socialize women to see each other as competitors in the dating sphere. These findings contribute to our understanding of how ICTs may be used in the service reclaiming gossip as a mode of resistance through the act of collective sensemaking.","",""

Consequently, queer people have been at the forefront of internet technologies such as hook-up apps, namely $2 . Rural hook-up app use is under-researched, and queer visibility may be more carefully negotiated in rural areas than in cities.  We carried out a qualitative study to establish whether location and/or technology use shaped social, sexual and romantic network creation and/or quality. Thirty-eight participants in cities and rural areas across the UK took part.  We found hook-up apps to be the only source of local queer connection for some rural participants. Users speak of being drawn to these technologies when lonely, yet find they can contribute to feelings of isolation. Being visible, which the pictorial logic of some hook-up apps demands, can be difficult in rurality due to partial ‘outness’ about sexuality. Some fear meeting other app users in public in rural areas due to potential homophobia, yet lack access to private spaces. Some users find innovative ways to meet goals of friendship and community beyond the perceived affordances of sexual hook-ups, such as forming friendship and community groups via or beyond apps.  This demonstrates that hook-up apps are inadequately-tailored tools for participants’ queerness, which extends beyond visible sexuality to negotiated communities and relationships of trust. This contributes to wider understanding of technology’s role in shaping social cohesion across diverse geographies and groups and the demands of visibility of such technologies on users.","",""
"2023","DARK DESIGN PATTERNS AND GAMIFICATION AS THE HEART OF DATING APPLICATIONS’ BUSINESS MODELS","Dating applications represent a paradox: on the one hand, they provide a monetized platform for people to form relationships, yet on the other hand, the more people who find partners, the less revenue goes to the company. With this paradox as a backdrop, this extended abstract examines the business model of dating applications by address the following research question: What characterizes the business models of dating applications? To provide a nuanced picture of this, we conducted a 2022-study combining data about dating apps and app users: (A) 22 in-depth interviews with current and previous users (aged 24–49 years) of Norwegian dating applications users; (B) a systematic analysis of 30 serious dating apps in Google Play and Apple’s App Store; and (C) a diary study of four of the 30 dating applications. The findings reveals that dating apps follows a business model that creates revenue through a mix of an in-app purchase-model and subscription fees. The apps typically market themselves as free, yet they use several dark design and gamification features to create and spark emotional curiosity and engagement that in turn brings in revenue to dating app companies. Several of the users stated that they have experienced the apps as manipulative, emotionally exhausting and that they created the same kind of “addiction” or “cravings” they experienced in social media. Clearly, design is not only power, design gives the dating app companies power where designing for emotional engagement is a key value-creating element in their business models.","",""
"2023","‘WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?’: SEXUAL IMAGINARIES AND AFFORDANCES ON GRINDR AND SCRUFF","For queer men, sexual imaginaries have come to accomodate hybrid physical and digital location-based cultures (Miles, 2017). In short, what is possible in terms of intimate connections with other queer men has opened up in exciting, sometimes scary, and radical ways. However, this expanded imaginary of what is possible can also lead to an existential questioning of what an individual person wants—simply and nothing more than sex, a fleeting summer fling, a new group of friends, to fall in love? More? Less? A combination of all of these things at different moments in time? In the face of such uncertainty, we argue that queer men develop a range of practices as they negotiate their shifting relationships to sex and romance as mediated through virtual intimacies (McGlotten, 2013).  In this study, we explore how queer men learn about, interpret, and reproduce sexual and romantic norms on two dating and hookup platforms, Grindr and Scruff. Our approach builds on Sharif Mowlabowcus’s (2016, pg. 60) notion of cybercarnality concerning the “erotic economy of gay male corporeality” and Pym et al. (2021, pg. 399) study of queer community “imagined as an affective sense of shared ethics” on intimate platforms.

"2023","A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN: QUEER CHRISTIANS &amp; DATING APPS","Dating apps pose particular challenges for queer Christians, reproducing oppressions and experiences of dispossession in the context of seeking intimate relationships. Queer Christians using dating apps complicates an already sensitive combination of social and cultural commitments, values, and beliefs. Dating apps position themselves in the dating market in a variety of ways, however all function to help people meet other people for dates. Some apps are known for facilitating hookups or catering to queer populations, others are used more broadly and aim to facilitate long-term relationships. Dating apps, along with other social media sites, independently create and control the categories users interact with. On dating apps, users expect the app interface to enable them to represent their unique identities. However, dating apps are often designed with dominant populations in mind and end up excluding those who do not fit the model of their ideal user. Ultimately, my analysis reveals how queer Christians know and express gender and religious identities on dating apps but dating apps do not allow for this complexity to be easily visible or searchable. Queer Christians wrestle with dominant narratives, deviate from social scripts, and resist condemnation to a life without hope for loving partnerships. Dating apps offer fine-grained means of seeking and finding a match made in heaven while simultaneously constructing a hellhole of exclusionary, discriminatory, and oppressive binary categories. Still, queer Christians depend on dating apps, both to do queer identity work and to help them seek and find their match made in heaven.","",""
"2023","‘We went from the anonymity of the internet into my private WhatsApp’: Rituals of transition among dating app users in Berlin"," This article focusses on the courtship rituals and practices of intimacy among young dating app users, aged between 20 and 33, in Berlin. Dating app users participate in ‘rituals of transition’ as they signal mutual interest and heightened intimacy by moving conversations from dating apps to social media messaging platforms such as WhatsApp. These rituals of transition play a far more prominent role in signalling romantic interest than the matching-mechanisms inherent in the design of dating apps. Drawing on ethnographic data incorporating 36 semistructured interviews and 45 chat interviews across three popular dating apps, Tinder, Bumble and OkCupid, the study finds that users code the apps installed on their smartphones as hosting spheres of varying intimacy. These spheres are substantiated through the infrastructure of notifications on users’ devices. Rather than drastically altering how users communicate across different apps, rituals of transition are a key moment of communication in themselves. ","",""
"2023","Transgressive Play and the Inherent Limits of Business Growth for China’s LGBTQ Platforms: The Case of a Social Game in Aloha"," Since 2016, China’s online LGBTQ platforms, such as Blued and Aloha, have been seeking to increase user acquisition and retention by introducing new functionalities to their interfaces. Although these attempts were promising at first, most of their endeavors proved unsustainable, largely due to the condition in which their businesses operate: a niche audience segment in a winner-take-all mobile market and a highly regulatory market in which LGBTQ content is often made a site for the execution of power. This article investigates the now-defunct role-playing social game Werewolf embedded in Aloha, one of the popular dating apps for queer men in China. By bringing together scholarship on game studies and queer media studies, it is argued that social games embedded in dating apps foster a new form of sexual sociality in which desires become increasingly gamified and intimacy networked, which are essential for queer social media to retain users. Although Werewolf was ultimately closed due to Aloha’s budgetary controls, queer players have emerged as a promising market for their unique engagement in social games. LGBTQ platforms, however, are not the main beneficiary of the queer gaming market because of the winner-take-all mobile ecosystem. The article highlights the inherent limits of “outward” expansion of China’s LGBTQ platforms into the mainstream market and suggests that prioritizing the unaddressed needs of their niche audience through an inward approach may be a more viable strategy for business growth in a mobile ecosystem dominated by a handful of major players.

"2023","Grindr Tourism Among Tourists, Locals, and Immigrants: Dating App Impacts for Social Relations, Gay Tourism, and Digital Convergence"," Dating app tourism is a phenomenon that intersects both digital mobile media applications and tourism networks. As such, it represents a new but little-examined frontier in the study of sexuality, technology, and identity formation. Using a qualitative sociological approach, this exploratory study identifies Grindr tourism practices and their consequences for gay tourism, tourist-local relations, and digitally mediated social life. With Tel Aviv as the research site, Grindr tourism practices were analyzed using 19 in-depth interviews and six audio diaries. The concept of embedded learning is used to understand the communication that results from contemporary mobile media-integrated tourism. Grindr tourism practices are viewed as mutually beneficial by tourists, locals, and immigrants. Findings indicate that Grindr tourism contributes to tourists’ embedded learning about travel destinations, immigrants’ acclimation and friendship networks, and locals’ self-ascribed cosmopolitan, multicultural identities. The research also uncovered wider issues affecting sexuality, communication, migration movements, ethnicity, and the economic bodies that support large-scale tourism. Specifically, Grindr is used as a tool to arrange independent, mobile, non-institutionalized travel that serves as an alternative to LGBT + tourism industry institutions. Not only is Grindr tourism indicative of shifting travel practices, but it also reflects dating apps’ overarching tendency toward the convergence of multiple social functions into one platform.

"2023","Mediatized Love: A Materialist Phenomenology of Tinder"," The article scrutinizes the mediatization of dating and love as part of a broader mediatization process of the life-world, with a focus on the experience of using the popular dating app Tinder. Central to the analysis is how interfacial features, algorithmic structuration, and user perceptions create the affordances of the application and, in the process, shape the experience of using it. The experience of using Tinder is characterized by a “swipe logic,” marked by speediness, visuality, and (self-)objectification, but also by the prevalence of cynicism and boredom on the platform. Under these circumstances, users of Tinder are confronted with new challenges, and to tackle these, they make use of their life-world knowledge as well as creating novel forms of knowledge. While using Tinder, they apply and modify their life-world stock of knowledge. Tinder as a tool of online dating is marked by the duality of reflectivity versus impulsive affectivity, superficiality versus depth, and instrumentality versus striving for relations thought of as authentic. All in all, the mediatization of partner selection is interpreted as a special form of the colonization of the life-world. ","",""
"2023","How College Students Interpret and Use Social Media as a Potential Source of Sexual Consent Communication"," This study investigated how social media use, specifically exposure to and posting of sexualized and party-related content on social media and interpretations of that content as sexual consent communication, related to college students’ intentions to engage in sexual consent communication. A national sample of U.S. college students ( N = 954) completed the relevant measures in an online survey. Results indicated that the more college students reported exposure to sexualized and party-related content on social media, the more likely they were to report posting similar content and believe in harmful consent myths (i.e., that a person’s sexual consent can be assumed by looking at their social media profiles). Posting sexualized and party-related content on social media was also related to lesser intentions to engage in consent communication. These findings provide evidence for the importance of considering social media use in how college students understand sexual consent communication that may be used to inform future sexual consent education on college campuses.

"2024","Minimising the Risk","Introduction and Background  Sexual choking / strangulation encompasses a range of practices where pressure is applied to the neck to restrict air or blood flow during a sexual encounter. While choking is most commonly associated with the application of hands around a person’s neck, other limbs or ligatures, such as the forearm or rope, may also be used (Herbenick et al., Frequency 3122; Herbenick et al., Prevalence 1059). This article will predominantly use the term “choking” or “sexual choking” to match teen vernacular and public discourse. These terms, however, may be used interchangeably with other more context-specific terms used in the literature such as “breath play”, “strangulation”, “erotic asphyxiation”, and “sexual asphyxia” (Cardoso 1070; Vilhjálmsdóttir and Forberg 4). Recent studies exploring the prevalence of sexual choking (Sharman et al., Prevalence 1; Herbenick et al,. Prevalence 1068; Vilhjálmsdóttir and Forberg 24) indicate that sexual strangulation is a relatively common practice among young adults, including trans or gender-marginalised populations. In a recent Australian study, researchers found that 57% of participants (aged 18–35 years) reported being sexually strangled (from a sample of 4,702 adult Australians; Sharman et al., Prevalence 1). A US-based study of undergraduate and graduate students also found that choking during sexual encounters was consensual 92.1% of the time (Herbenick et al., Frequency 3130), indicating that choking can be a favoured and consensual activity between sexual partners. However, it is widely acknowledged and agreed upon that there is no adaptation of the practice that is entirely free from risk (Cardoso 1069; Schori et al 291); engaging in any form of the act can have harmful and potentially lethal consequences. The authors acknowledge that the devastating effects of sexual violence (including family and intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual assault), which strangulation and non-fatal strangulation (NFS) form a part of, are a serious and significant issue (Bennett 167; White et al., 2); however, this article seeks to explore sexual choking practices within consensual contexts, given the rising prevalence of these behaviours. Pornography is often noted as the primary reason for the popularisation of sexual choking throughout modern discourse and existing research (Herbenick et al., Frequency 3135; Sharman et al., Prevalence 1). However, erotic asphyxiation and sexual hanging depictions are documented centuries earlier through renaissance paintings and prehistoric art such as Mayan relics (Tarr 57). In their study of 4,702 Australian adult participants (aged 18–35), Sharman and colleagues found that pornography was the most common way individuals reported first hearing about choking as a sexual activity (34.8%), whereas others discovered the concept via discussions with friends (11.5%; Prevalence 6). Other studies have identified shifts in sexual repertoire, such as choking, that may have been influenced by pornography (Herbenick et al., Diverse 624). However, much of public discourse is focussed on pornography’s influence without causal links. Nominal data taken from the Australian Research Council Project Adolescents’ Perceptions of Harm from Accessing Online Sexual Content which investigated teens' (aged 11–17 years) perceptions of pornography is explored in this article. Teens suggested that young people often mimic acts, such as sexual choking, that are depicted in pornography, and criticised pornography for not displaying safety parameters normally used in the BDSM/kink community. Some teens speculated that sexual choking may be a relatively common occurrence between young people. These teens suggest that there is a need for more accessible education and resources about risky sexual behaviours. This article explores teens’ perspectives of sexual choking through a sexological and public health lens and suggests that a broader harm reduction approach may result in better outcomes than an abstinence-only approach. This article may assist to inform public policy, public health strategies, and educational approaches. ‘Breath Play’ in BDSM/Kink The acronym BDSM stands for ‘bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, sadism and masochism’, can refer to a range of meanings and experiences, and often involves consensual power exchange, restraint, or intense sensations (Carlström 404; Lawrence and Love-Crowell 67; Schori et al. 293; Sprott 2). Breath play is an activity some may explore within BDSM/kink, and can include an array of activities that restrict airways or play with breath for sexual arousal (Sharman et al., Strangulation 1; Tomassilli et al., 439). BDSM has become popularised in recent years and is often misrepresented in the media, leading to pathologisation and misunderstanding of the practice (Ortmann and Sprott 34; Shahbaz and Chirinos 21). The BDSM/kink community prioritises safety as part of a “controlled set of practices governed by clear and identifiable cultural standards of behaviour” (Bennett 173). These practices require mutual consent to specific acts and refer to frameworks such as Safe, Sane, and Consensual (SSC), Risk-Aware Consensual Kink (RACK), and “safe words” (Bennet 164; Gewirtz-Meydan 584; Holt 928; Schori et al. 293), where safety is paramount. However, some of the most common injuries within the BDSM/kink community relate to breath play (a.k.a. “choking”; Sprott et al. 1723), including death (Schori et al. 295), and while informed BDSM practitioners are able to practice breath play in more aware and mindful ways, risk can never be fully eliminated (Holt 920; Schori et al. 291). Exploration through kink has been linked to healing and transformation of trauma, contributing to the development of a notion of healthy sexuality (Cascalheira et al. 373; Sprott 2). This exploration may provide a way to confront shame and explore desires and fantasies in a controlled, safe environment, which is compatible with a healthy, normal life (Lawrence and Love-Crowell 69; Gewirtz-Meydan, et al. 584; Sprott 4). Studies warn that in spite of concerns around the growing prevalence of sexual strangulation and choking, stigmatisation of kink-related activities is not conducive to improvements in public health for minority populations (Sharman et al. Prevalence 12; Herbernick et al., Frequency 3135). Shaming those who wish to engage in breath play and sexual choking (kink-shaming) is not advised, particularly given that this article explores that some teens may wish to engage in alternate sexual practices, potentially irrespective of the popularisation of such acts. Teen Perspectives  A total of 49 interviews were carried out with 30 Australian teens aged 11–17 years; 30 were carried out in 2021–2022, with a further 19 interviews undertaken with the same teens at least one year later (2023). This research focussed on teen perspectives of pornography, and participants were predominantly recruited through social media. Permission was first sought via a parent who also agreed to an interview, as per the project’s ethics approval, and both parents and teens were given a small gift to thank them for their time. While discussing the impact of pornography, some teens instigated discussions around what they referred to as “choking”. Sexual choking was not the focus of the pornography study, and while the findings discussed were incidental, the organic discussions provide nominal insights into teens’ perspectives of sexual choking behaviours.  One big danger with pornography is people start watching it and then they’ll start on the soft porn, and they’ll go from this into the next and that’s how they end up at BDSM. They’ll go to a partner and the partner’s also been watching it, but one of them doesn’t know about ‘aftercare’ [and] how to go and take care of the partner, or any of that sort of stuff, and while it starts well and they’ll have a hoot of a time, they don’t know proper limits, so they don’t know. For instance, if it’s choking, how to actually choke, because [if] you do it wrong, it’s not good. (Miles, 16)  Miles illustrates a level of digital sexual literacy and awareness by utilising terms such as “aftercare”, a kink-specific terminology, which involves the checking-in and care of a sexual partner following a sexual encounter or “scene” (Fuentes 3). Miles used podcasts and social media to supplement his sexual knowledge, as he felt schools were not providing sufficient information, as is evident in other studies (Cardoso and Scarcelli 8). While most information sourcing for adults in BDSM and alternative sexual practices is done via self-directed means or social groups (Sprott, et al. 49), further availability of resources in non-formal environments could be useful to teens too. “Third-person media effects” may be evident in Miles’s reflection here, where individuals can perceive media to have a stronger influence on others than themselves (Perloff 357). Miles illustrates these effects while trying to make sense of his and his peers’ experiences. Miles speculates that pornography may inform young people’s sexual scripts, but often lack associated safety information that would normally accompany acts within the kink community. He believed the omission of safety information and relevant frameworks is where the harm lies. Similarly, Warren (17) stated:  like if they’re watching hardcore stuff and they’re choking a girl, the girl might actually be getting suffocated by not doing it right, they could hurt the girl, like, a false idea of what it actually is.  Warren recognised how the adoption of particular sexual scripts could be harmful when they occur without information to assist individuals to practise in safer ways. Given pornography has been explored as an influence for changes in sexual scripts and potentially contributes to popularising acts such as choking (Wright et al. 1100), these changes could be balanced with more available resources and education. In answer to whether resources could be of assistance, Warren answered:  if there was a kink or something and they wanted to learn how to do that properly, it’d be good to have a video that they could actually learn. That’d be good.  Teens recognised a gap, where more explicit educational resources could assist teens practicing risky behaviours, whether influenced by pornography or not, to engage in ways that can potentially reduce harm. The danger of teens potentially mimicking acts without being educated or informed about safety parameters, was further explored by Miles (16):  in my cohort, [sexual choking is] seen as something that’s a bit risky, but a bit cool, and the girls are into [it] – but don’t really know [how], so there’s a lot of lines that are crossed because they don’t know how to set them up or while there might be safe words, they might not actually know how to [implement them] and have only seen porn where the safety borderlines are set beforehand, all you see is the porn.  Miles reflected that safety practices such as “safe words”, or prior discussions of consent are seldom depicted in mainstream pornography. “Safe words” are a previously agreed-upon word or gesture which communicates to a partner the need to immediately cease a sexual activity (Weiss 78). Although borrowed from BDSM/kink, these frameworks could be considered as part of mainstream communication and harm-minimisation strategies (Herbernick et al., Frequency 3134) and could also be adopted as part of wider sexuality education skill development. It must also be considered that teens may perceive choking to be a risky, “cool” sexual practice and thus may feel peer pressured to engage. Indeed, existing research (Sharman et al. Strangulation) posits that “wanting” to engage in choking behaviours may reflect social conditioning (11), much like other sexual behaviours. Seraphina (12) shared that most young people she knew had seen pornography: “even girls watch that stuff [pornography] as well, like, with girls doing it, like, pretty much everyone has watched it or has come across it”. She implies that pornography viewing is widespread among teens, where some teens may be inspired by acts depicted in porn. Given choking was perceived as “cool” or “risky”, some teens may perceive expectation and/or pressure to engage in sexual choking, whereas some teens may genuinely desire to engage in these acts. These findings suggest that teens could benefit from education which encourages them to introspect and reflect upon whether they genuinely wish to engage in sexual acts or whether they feel socially pressured to do so. Most teens claimed that they were able to discern that porn is a fantasy and not very representative of reality; “you probably have to also keep in mind if you are looking at that sort of stuff, that it’s staged or fake or whatever and that that’s not realistic necessarily” (Heath, 14). Despite this, some young people believed their peers had a tendency to mimic what they had seen online:  yes, it can be harmful for a load of people mainly because some dumb men might see a video and try to do it [pornographic acts] to a woman. (David, 11) A lot of people copy what they see online in general anyway, especially with the TikTok trends and everything so I reckon that people would copy things online. But I think it’s still pretty bad, I'm not sure why you’d want to copy things like that [acts in pornography], I mean sometimes I can understand TikTok trends but I think that’s on a different level and it’s just pretty bad. (Lauren, 13)  These findings are supported by existing research (Rothman et al. 743; Smith 71), which found that young people often imitate what they see in pornography. Teens believe their peers can be quite impressionable, particularly in the digital age, and may be primed to copying behaviours online. Arguably, media literacy, including pornography literacy, could assist in encouraging teens to be aware of risk and to be more critical of the content they consume. Given the prevalence of choking behaviours among young people, educational programs and relevant messaging could consider discussing alternate sexual practices and how to engage in safer ways (Herbernick et al., Frequency 3133; Wright et al. 1105), particularly given that the predominant message that young people receive is to abstain, yet behaviours persist. Harm Reduction While it is widely acknowledged that there is no “risk-free” way to engage in choking behaviours (Cardoso 1069; Schori et al. 291), there is a need to acknowledge that there are some that will continue to practice or experiment with these behaviours. In the same way that a “zero tolerance” attitude around illicit substances and other sexual practices impedes help-seeking behaviours, acts as a barrier to education and information, and drives these behaviours underground, so too will an abstinence-only approach to sexual choking. Many authors have written about the dangers and ineffectiveness of abstinence-only sex education programs (particularly in the United States; Heals; LeClair; Santelli Abstinence; Santelli Abstinence-Only; and others), but there is also a significant amount of literature available relating to sex work, HIV/AIDS, chem-sex, and other high-risk sexual behaviours highlighting that “abolition is not effective in reducing those harms and indeed may, in fact, exacerbate them” (Dea 340). Harm reduction is an important yet controversial strategy that provides an “alternative to the moral/criminal” approaches in public health (Dea 302–4). While abstinence is the ideal goal, harm reduction seeks to reduce the harm associated with stigmatised behaviours through a larger, nested approach that allow experts and governments to acknowledge that these behaviours occur within society, without supporting the risky behaviour (Hickle 302; Wellbourne-Wood 407). This approach takes a morally neutral stance which shifts the emphasis to health and human rights, and acknowledges that social approaches are a more suitable and more effective approach (Denis-Lalonde 321; Hawk et al. 4; Hickle 302; Keane 228; Steenholdt and Colquhoun 12). Harm reduction incorporates a range of strategies, including education, information provision, prevention, care guides, and first aid training, along with policy, legislative, and punitive measures (Dea 305; Denis-Lalonde 318; Hawk 2). To reduce harm to individuals who may engage in sexually risky behaviours, experts must navigate barriers such as stigma, marginalisation, or lack of awareness (Sansone et al. 3). The criminalisation of sex work, for instance, can result in increased risk and harms, as sex workers may be afraid to seek help when they are in danger (Dea 305). Harm reduction interventions, on the other hand, link vulnerable and marginalised individuals with experts capable of providing necessary assistance, information, and education (Hickle 302). The criminalisation of risky sexual behaviours alone places clinicians, sexual health practitioners, and those seeking help, assistance, or information, in a problematic position (Piatkowski et al. 62). When faced with an individual seeking assistance, the practitioner must decide whether to aid in the minimisation of potential harms or follow legally sanctioned procedures (referral to domestic family violence services or police referral; Victoire 875). On the other hand, individuals face challenges in seeking help and support due to the stigma and fear associated with the illegal nature of these health behaviours (Piatkowski et al. 62; Stangl et al. 1). As Treloar states: “it’s really hard to step up and identify with living with a stigmatised condition or identity or practice. For someone who’s prohibited [criminalised] on top of that, the fear of repercussions is even greater” (Treloar in Australian Academy of Science). Stigma, discrimination, and marginalisation of individuals who engage in alternative sexual practices, by both medical professionals and others, is widespread (Bezreh et al.; Hansen-Brown et al.; and others). In order to seek help, an individual needs to feel confident that they will not face criminal sanctions from the police, nor will they be subject to stigma or marginalisation from society (Sansone et al. 7). Conclusion  There is little published evidence on how teens perceive sexual choking and strangulation practices. This article offers nominal insight into teens' perspectives of choking depicted in pornography, and speculates on the prevalence of the practice among their peers. Like adults, teens indicated that many young people (of all genders) share an inclination to partake in alternative sexual practices such as “choking”. Participants also recognised that their peers were uneducated in terms of “safer” alternative practices, often learning BDSM/kink-inspired acts from pornography. However, young people felt that pornography could be misleading, given that safety parameters normally implemented in the kink scene were not often displayed on screen, leaving room for potentially dangerous consequences. Some teens suggested that resources and educational information could assist them to navigate these practices in safer ways. More adolescent-focussed research with a greater sample size is needed, with research questions more specifically aligned with the prevalence of sexual strangulation and teens’ interpretation of these risky sexual behaviours, particularly given the limitations of this study sample. The authors note that this article neither advocates nor condones these behaviours. This article opts for an educational risk-reduction approach that acknowledges that teens and adults alike partake in kink-inspired behaviours, and as such calls for relevant resources and discussion to support individuals. In the face of acknowledging the prevalence of choking and breath play behaviour, as Cardoso states, “instead of asking how we can stop breath play, should we not ask how to make it safer, how to make it less stigmatized – in the end, less deadly?” (1071).

"2024","“The value of privacy is not as high as finding my person” — Privacy risks as abstractions","Online dating has emerged as a key platform for digital engagement among young people, serving as a common medium for building relationships. As multimedia platforms, dating apps encourage users to translate their notions of identity construction, self-expression, and communication into engagement and participation in the digital world. Dating apps are one of several technologies that are changing existing norms of relationship building, self-presentation, and ideals of romance. Dating apps foster a unique form of engagement because to facilitate a date users must reveal sensitive details about their demographics, location, values, and lifestyle that they might not otherwise display on social media. On dating apps privacy concerns are unusually self-conscious. This unique digital environment constitutes a strategic research site where research can explore how privacy concerns influence the process of personal information (PI) disclosure. Findings reveal that users perceive other users as threats to their privacy, which makes them carefully consider what they reveal. In contrast, risks associated with app providers, such as selling data to advertisers, are viewed as abstract, and not behavior-altering. This discrepancy in risk is attributed to inadequate data literacy and agency over personal data. This paper concludes with suggestions for future research and policy that would improve the quality of youth engagement.","",""
"2024","The psychological influence of dating app matches: The more matches the merrier?"," Swipe-based dating apps characteristically provide quantitative social feedback in the form of matches. Surveys suggest a link between dating app success and well-being, but the nature of this correlation has yet to be examined. In an experiment with 125 undergraduate women, we manipulated dating app feedback: When accepting a profile, participants had either a high (27/31) or a low chance (3/31) of receiving matches. We found no effect of chance of matches on women’s loneliness or fear of being single. However, a higher chance of matches led to higher partner choice overload. Furthermore, in those who accepted seven or more profiles, women in the low chance of matches condition reported higher loneliness than women in the high chance of matches condition. This could mean that matches are rewarding for women with a high approach orientation. Manipulating social feedback in a dating app paradigm seems suitable to study the effects of social acceptance and ostracism. ","",""
"2024","“Why are you on Tinder if this isn’t what you wanted?” Dating apps as digital brokers of sexual activity in the college hookup sexual market"," Scholars have argued that college hookup culture is facilitated by the unique physical and social context of college campuses and that young adults are increasingly using dating apps to initiate hookups. This has inspired calls for researchers to examine the digital interactions that precede face-to-face hookups. In this study, we used a “sexual market” framework to investigate the processes by which college hookups are “digitally brokered” via dating apps. Using data from focus groups conducted with 49 college students representing diverse sexual identities, we analyzed dating app users’ stories of their transitions from digital interactions to face-to-face meetups with matches. Participants discussed three types of consent that matches attempt to digitally broker: app-implied consent, colloquial consent, and (re)negotiated consent. We discuss problems that arise when users attempt to redeem these forms of digitally brokered consent during face-to-face meetups and make recommendations for sexual assault prevention efforts.

"2024","The quest for meaningful connections: Navigating scripted sexuality on Instagram amid Grindr and Tinder fatigue"," In the contemporary digital age, the experience of intimacy, sex, and love has been profoundly transformed, in part due to technological transformations. How do individuals navigate the evolving landscape of dating in the digital age to seek meaningful connections? To answer that, I conducted 30 individual, in-depth interviews with queer men in Argentina. Drawing on the conceptual apparatus of the sociology of sexuality and research on social media repertoires, I argue that different platforms elicit specific imaginaries, relationships, and pleasures. While Grindr emphasizes sexual explicitness and anonymity, Tinder offers a more conversational and personal experience. However, scripted and repetitive conversations tend to foster feelings of anxiety, boredom, and fatigue. Thus, many interviewees opt to escape the dating environment to Instagram, a platform that provides them a space for more authentic and pleasant interactions. These findings expand the notion of networked intimacy beyond the realm of dating platforms to social media and messaging apps. ","",""
"2024","The year of the “virtual date”: Reimagining dating app affordances during the COVID-19 pandemic"," The coronavirus disease-19 pandemic introduced a crisis of safety and relevance for dating apps, as their affordances for facilitating in-person encounters posed the risk of viral transmission. This article examines how eight apps primarily catering to heterosexual markets responded to the pandemic through changes to socio-technical arrangements, new user prescriptions, and the curation of corporate data and success stories. By analyzing corporate social media and promotional materials alongside in-app developments, we find that these companies reimagined app affordances to promote “virtual dating,” a set of practices and symbolic meanings that prioritize visual, synchronous digital interaction as the most responsible, reliable, and successful dating approach to the pandemic. Virtual dating centers apps as databases of potential partners while prescribing modes of use aimed toward affective relief, displays of authenticity, and romantic courtship. This reimagining counters moral panics about digitally mediated relationships by resorting to heteronormative dating scripts while overlooking alternative app uses. ","",""
"2024","Dating algorithms? Investigating the reciprocal relationships between partner choice FOMO, decision fatigue, excessive swiping, and trust in algorithms on dating apps"," Dating apps have changed the way people establish contact with potential romantic partners. However, more and more dating apps use algorithms to keep their users’ engagement high. Studies suggest that trust in algorithms can shape offline dating experiences. We theorize that excessive swiping, driven by fear of missing out, predicts trust. We also explore the role of decision fatigue. Findings from a two-wave panel study with NTime2 = 521 young dating app users suggest that the fear of missing out on potential romantic partners was positively related to decision fatigue on dating apps. Moreover, excessive swiping and decision fatigue were positively related to trust in algorithms. No reciprocal effects of trust in algorithms on excessive swiping or decision fatigue were observed. It seems that trust in algorithms might present some kind of relief strategy for compulsive behaviors such as excessively swiping, or for negative feelings such as decision fatigue. ","",""

Four themes were identified: (1) ambiguous perception of the usefulness of dating services as a means to search for a romantic partner, (2) acquiring skills in using dating services, (3) personal difficulties and failures in using dating services, and (4) online dating as self-obligation. The participants positioned themselves with regard to dating technology through ambiguous opinions and beliefs about the usefulness of dating services. They perceived using dating services to be a task that requires skills in self-commodification and self-branding and a good opportunity to gain practice in dating; they experienced various difficulties related to using dating platforms, and sometimes they reported a feeling of self-obligation to use such services. Single adults related to dating technology in various modes in the context of their singlehood and relationship desires. ","",""
"2024","From the auction block to the Tinder swipe: Black women’s experiences with fetishization on dating apps"," The digital has been celebrated for its objectivity and lack of bias, yet digital media scholars have addressed the ways that inequity is embedded in technology. What is often missing from this discourse is the voices of Black women. Drawing on interviews with 20 self-identified Black and African American women, aged 18–30, who have used dating apps in the preceding 6 months, we invited participants to share their experiences with online dating and racial fetishization. Using reflexive thematic analysis, we explore how Black women perceive and navigate racial fetishization and stereotypes often informed by racialized and gendered ideologies. Our findings trace Black women’s movements through three phases of the dating process in which participants discussed feeling fetishized; a sentiment that we identify as racial desire that is rooted in colonialist ambitions.

"2024","Burnt out and still single: Susceptibility to dating app burnout over time"," Despite the ubiquity of dating apps, there is little longitudinal research examining the mental health and well-being of dating app users. To fill this void, this study takes a social compensation approach to exploring dating app users’ burnout experiences (i.e., emotional exhaustion, inefficacy, and depersonalization) over time. Four hundred ninety-three active single dating app users were surveyed over four waves across 12 weeks, with a final sample of 190. Multilevel growth curve models showed that dating app users experienced increased emotional exhaustion and inefficacy over time. Furthermore, depression, anxiety, and loneliness predicted more emotional exhaustion and inefficacy, while problematic dating app use predicted more emotional exhaustion and less inefficacy. The results suggest that dating apps may exacerbate existing difficulties with relationship initiation among vulnerable users by increasing their risk of burnout. Dating app burnout is a potential intervention target to improve users’ dating success. ","",""
"2024","Gendered Affordances of Digital Technology in Mitigating the Perceived Risk of Dating App Matches Perpetrating Sexual Assault or “Making Stories” of Assault"," Dating apps are a popular tool for finding sexual and romantic partners. Yet, these apps can pose risks that arise from gendered affordances of technology that users deploy to harass and victimize their matches, particularly matches who are women or sexual and gender minorities. Just as gendered affordances may facilitate risks, dating app users may also deploy technology in ways that mitigate risk. In this study, we examined risks that men and women perceive dating app matches to pose, as well as ways in which they use technology to mitigate these risks. Through an analysis of focus groups conducted with a sample of college student dating app users, we found the perceived risks that matches pose were markedly different for men and women, particularly among those seeking mixed-gender pairings. Women who matched with men were concerned about being sexually assaulted, whereas men who matched with women were concerned about being falsely accused of assault. Thus, women used gendered affordances to enhance their safety, and men used affordances to enhance their “believability.” We suggest our findings point to the positional and interactional nature of gendered affordances, encompassing ways in which gender inequality may be both maintained and subverted with digital technology.

"2024","Nationwide research on the uses and motivations of dating apps by young adults in the cultural environment of Turkey"," Since Tinder's worldwide popularity, location-based dating apps have become widespread. The existing literature mainly focuses on a single app in European and US contexts and pays little attention to other cultural contexts. This paper addresses this gap by examining dating app choices and motivations of young adults (18–29 years old) in Turkey. It examines the intersectionality of socio-demographic variables in a cultural setting that is quite different not only from European and US contexts but also from other Muslim-majority contexts. Deriving from the nationally representative survey ( n = 1,498), our research finds statistically significant differences in dating app preferences and adults’ motivations regarding location, sexual, gender, and religious identities. This study underlines the crucial role of cultural geography and its social fabric in mobile dating, even within the same national setting . ","",""
"2024","The association between mobile dating app use and relationship status satisfaction: A survey study"," Connecting with others through mobile dating apps has become one of the most popular ways for people to meet. These apps might help people find a suitable partner and, thus, achieve a satisfactory love life. To examine whether mobile dating apps deliver on their potential for positive relationship outcomes, this study investigates if and how the use of these apps is related to satisfaction with one's relationship status. In a survey study, we compared previous and current users of mobile dating apps with people who have never used such apps ( n= 1,054, from the United States or United Kingdom, younger than 35). Results showed that dating app users score lower on satisfaction with their relationship status than non-users. This negative association between dating app use and satisfaction was stronger for women than it was for men. The most crucial factor in relationship status satisfaction, however, is whether people are in a relationship or not. Future research should aim to disentangle the causal order of the association between mobile dating app use and relationship status satisfaction, and investigate if these apps have the potential to improve users’ satisfaction with their relationship status in the long term through facilitating romantic relationships.

"2025","BEYOND THE SWIPE: UNPACKING INDIAN WOMEN’S SAFETY STRATEGIES ON BUMBLE","Bumble, a dating app that positions itself as feminist and safe for women in India, has failed to live up to its claims. Despite its promotion of a safety-by-design approach, users have not fully embraced the app's safety features. This suggests a lack of understanding of the cultural factors contributing to the risks associated with online dating in India. To investigate women's experiences with Bumble’s safety features and their efforts to ensure their own safety while using dating platforms, a semi-structured interview was conducted with 23 women who are Bumble users in India. The preliminary findings indicate that using Bumble requires additional “safety work” from women, who rely on support from their peer network to manage their safety. The notion of safety by design has been misleading, as power dynamics shift back to men after women make the first move. This study is important to understand how profit-driven platforms with neo-liberal agendas put women in danger within their local cultural context on the pretext of empowering them.","",""

This paper aims to explore perceptions and responses to risks and fears in online dating experiences among queer young adults in Italy and Australia, utilising a qualitative approach through focus groups (15 in total, 8 in Italy and 7 in Australia). Initial findings from Italy reveal concerns about outing, appearance-based judgments, and hierarchies of intimacies, with participants employing various strategies for safety. Similar strategies for risk mitigation during offline encounters are observed across both contexts. As the analysis of Australian focus groups remains ongoing, anticipation mounts for further elucidation of the nuanced dynamics at play within this cultural setting. Overall, the study underscores the resilience and resourcefulness of queer individuals in navigating online dating complexities while emphasizing the need for safer and more inclusive digital spaces for these communities.","",""
"2025","FATHERHOOD ON DATING APPS: A NORWEGIAN TWIST","In this study, I investigate the intricate realm of single fathers navigating the online dating landscape within Norway, when I ask the question: How do single dads in their mid-life adulthood present themselves as parents on dating apps in Norway? Employing a multifaceted research methodology comprising nethnography and autoethnography, I meticulously scrutinize how these fathers choose to divulge their parental status and romantic preferences through their dating app profiles, with a specifical focus on their self-presentation dynamics, re-partnering strategies, parental obligations, in context with cultural nuances. The insights gathered from this inquiry unveil a thoughtful approach adopted by these individuals, strategically accentuating their roles as fathers while also elucidating their priorities, logistical considerations, and compatibility criteria. By shedding light on these details, this study serves as a crucial exploration into the complexities that confront modern single parents navigating the terrain of dating apps. Furthermore, it offers valuable reflections on the shifting paradigms and evolving norms within contemporary relationships, underscoring the nuanced interplay between personal aspirations, parental responsibilities, and societal expectations in the context of romantic pursuits.","",""
"2025","‘IT’S A CANDY STORE. YOU CAN SEE THE CANDIES, BUT THE DOOR IS CLOSED.’ (NEURO)QUEERING THE HOOK-UP APP INDUSTRY IN NON-METROPOLITAN FINLAND.","Industrial time and space produce marginalities and resistance: Queer time rejects linearity and potentiates alternate experiences (Halbertsam, 2005). Today, many experience phones or smartwatches as mediating temporal ruptures in daily lives (Mowlabocus, 2016), and hookup app industries monetise intimacies. Given permanent online connectivity, work and leisure are more porous than in a factory, yet corporate industries mediate marginal socialities. Industrious rural queers wrestle control of spatiotemporal intimacies from totalising platforms.  This study maps rural sexuality and hook-up app (dis)comfort and visualises whether hook-up contacts penetrate social networks. Seven semi-structured interviews took place in Finland. Three themes were determined: (in)visibility due to (fears of) marginalisation; categories and borders of app design inadequately reflecting indigenous/gendered, (neuro)queer, rural, linguistic, infrastructural and economic realities; and resisting spatiotemporal app logics.  History has shown the rise of industry as precariously subject to queer temporal forces lacking predictable directions, ultimately declining. Nonetheless, emergent digital industries, such as queer hookup apps, re-attempt to totalise expression via universal logic. They inadequately account for the cultural, linguistic, neurodiverse, gender diverse, disabled, indigenous and local contexts of queer lives beyond major cities, just as clock-time undermined working labourers while empowering colonial interests. We hope to demonstrate the ingenuity of users in questioning and queering social norms, with the hope of building improved digital queer social worlds that do not fetishise queer bodies as visible yet unreacable products for capitalist consumption but rather facilitate spatiotemporal possibilities that fulfil rural, queer, digital, and social needs.","",""

Bisexuality is becoming increasingly common; younger adults are very much more likely to identify as bisexual. There does not appear to be any research that investigated differences between lesbian/gay and bisexual adults on relationship search and online dating. Results show that 1) bisexual adults are significantly less likely than lesbian/gay adults to adopt online dating and 2) bisexual adults are significantly more likely than straight adults to use online dating. Online dating offers the promise of helping bisexual adults make better matches. Future research should investigate additional differences between bisexual, lesbian/gay, and straight adults on the use of technology for relationship search, formation, and establishment.","",""

Awareness cues convey digital information about others’ activities, but their link with rejection is underexplored. This study explores the uses of awareness cues in mobile dating applications (MDAs) in relation to rejection, social surveillance and post-digital safety. Using a 1-month diary study with eight participants of diverse gender and sexual identities, we identify a grammar of awareness cues that helps users interpret others’ intentions, manage relational uncertainty (e.g. ghosting) and navigate rejection. While awareness cues convey helpful information, they also expose users to social surveillance or even stalking. Since ‘incognito mode’ is a premium affordance on most MDAs, participants developed creative             invisibility strategies             to restrict access to social surveillance mechanisms.

Results revealed that online daters possessed both relational (i.e. romantic, sexual, and platonic companionship) and information-seeking (i.e. fact-checking and exploration) MS motives. Holding the MS in person was associated with romantic, sexual, and platonic companionship motives, whereas meeting through video chat was associated with fact-checking motives and the degree of pre-MS channel expansion.

Results from an autoregressive structural equation model revealed people felt lonelier when they used dating apps for social approval, but not when they used them to pursue relationships. Perceived success was linked to psychological well-being: people felt lonely and less satisfied when they believed they were not attracting partners and better well-being when they felt successful. Gender differences were observed where women reported being more successful and less lonely but also more anxious about dating than men. However, men were observed to have higher life satisfaction when experiencing higher success. Our findings contribute evidence for the importance of motivations and perceptions in communication technology use and psychological well-being.           ","",""
