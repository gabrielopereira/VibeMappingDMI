"2000","THE VIRTUAL UNIVERSITY AS 'TIMELY AND ACCURATE INFORMATION'","This article investigates the implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning System in a redbrick university in the UK. The first part is concerned with the way in which the implementation project team has come to conceptualize its task or mission and represent it both to itself and to the rest of the university. On one hand, the discussion is about the rolling-out of a rather mundane information system, purchased simply as a replacement for an out of date system called 'MAC'. On the other, for some people, the system amounts to a large, and complex - almost mythical - model of the university, a kind of 'virtual university'. Specifically,the article is interested in one particular phrase, script, or mantra that appears over and over as the accepted rationale, mission and justification for the project: the 'provision of timely and accurate information'. It is argued that the phrase helps to mediate the boundary between how the project team and others understand the university as a whole, and the ways in which it is, could be, and should be changing. The second part of the article is focused on the way in which those implementing the new system are attempting to move the university from an old (seemingly 'chaotic') model to a new (supposedly 'ordered') 'informational model'.","",""

The USA, therefore, is a particularly unique setting for an examination of the rhetoric associated with the politics of adopting online learning technologies. This paper examines the context of the US on-line learning system with a particular focus on those aspects of the movement which appeal so keenly to Americans. Certain values are expressed in this movement which are almost uniquely American such as democracy, freedom, efficiency, independence, the vocational nature of education, and meritocratic schemes for education as a sorting mechanism for the society.","",""

Tutorial approaches to education are highly effective and new media can bring critical aspects of tutorial approaches to more students than ever before possible.","",""
"2000","DISTANCE EDUCATION PROVISION BY UNIVERSITIES: HOW INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXTS AFFECT CHOICES","Decisions about distance education are made too often without adequately considering the broader institutional context. This paper explores how a better understanding of 'macro' contexts can lead to more successful choices at the 'micro' level of designing and developing specific programmes. Six models derived from distance learning practices are examined. Analyses of these experiences highlight three primary institutional and political characteristics that have a critical influence on distance education outcomes: private or public emphasis; degree of dedication to distance learning; and holistic or incremental strategy. Three secondary dimensions are also discussed: technology mix; financial and production models; and target markets.","",""

This paper compares the UK's two largest distance learning initiatives: the Open University (OU) and the University for Industry (UfI). The comparison suggests four alternative approaches to 'virtualization' and shows that debate has often under-estimated the variety of possible approaches. The relationship between ICTs, knowledge and organizational structure is complex, reflecting a diversity of values and rationalities embodied by learning institutions.","",""
"2000","THE VIRTUAL UNIVERSITY IS . . . THE UNIVERSITY MADE CONCRETE?","The application of information and communications technologies (ICTs) to higher education has recently gained a new impetus, fired by the promise, and also perhaps the threat, of the 'virtual' university. While there has been much empirical research on individual ICT initiatives, most of this has been narrowly evaluative with little attention paid to their cumulative impacts on the university as an institution. Equally, while there has been much writing on the development of virtual higher education, much of this has been speculative, concerned with the advent of still marginal new institutions and little of it has been empirically grounded. This paper is based on in-depth studies of ICT initiatives in four established universities in the North East of England. It argues that one of the consequences, often unintended, of the introduction of these technologies has been to generate demands and pressures for a more corporate institutional form in which goals, roles, identities and procedures are made explicit and standardized across the institution. To the degree that these demands are met, the result appears to be that the closer that institutions move towards the goal of becoming a virtual university, the more corporate, or 'concrete', their institutional form becomes.","",""

"2000","COMPETITION AND COLLABORATION IN ONLINE DISTANCE LEARNING","For-profit firms use the internet to offer classes, courses and degree programmes in direct competition with nonprofit and government-supported colleges and universities. At the same time, many firms seek to partner with academic institutions in offering online instruction or distance learning.This paper outlines and discusses alternative models of academic/for-profit collaboration that are being developed in the USA. Collaboration requires the partners to define responsibilities for technology, administrative services, content development, promotion and student selection, instruction, awarding of credits and overall quality control. Firms may want to 'unbundle' the traditional faculty role of both course designer and teacher,and use different professionals for the two functions. Although most collaborations today involve non-degree programmes, many schools of business are working with for-profit firms to offer MBA degrees online. The diversity of higher education in the USA means that many different models will be tried. Collaborations will expand the markets for online distance learning, but a number of difficult issues remain to be resolved.","",""
"2000","INFRASTRUCTURE AND INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE IN THE NETWORKED UNIVERSITY","Many people believe that information technology will bring massive structural changes to the university. This paper draws on concepts from both computer science and social theory to explore what these structural changes might be like. The point of departure is the observation that the interaction between information technology and market economics creates incentives to standardize the world. Standardization can be a force for good or evil, depending on how it is done, and this paper develops normative ideas about the relation between the forces of standardization and the places in which university teaching is done. Information technology allows these places to be more diverse than in the past, and a good rule of thumb is that the places in which learning occurs should be analogous in their structure and workings to the places in which the learned knowledge will be used. Universities can support this increased diversity of learning places with appropriate structural reforms, including decentralized governance and explicit attention to certain aspects of the university organization, such as media services and the career centre, that, historically, have been marginalized.","",""

"2000","DEFINING MOMENTS: THE TENSION BETWEEN RICHNESS AND REACH","The defining moments of traditional spatially based higher education are made up of fixed and fluid experiences. These 'moments' are now creaking as funding per student falls and the romanticized ideal of an education detached from 'real' life falters under the weight of highly variable student experiences. Distance learning in all its guises has always been regarded as inferior by those embedded in the traditional system. However more and more students demand something different from costly campus-based education. It is time for a more open discussion about the tensions between richness and reach and the role that new facilities like the Internet could play in reaching more students without wallowing in the nostalgia that often accompanies such debates.","",""
"2000","STUDENT DISTRESS IN A WEB-BASED DISTANCE EDUCATION COURSE","Many advocates of computer-mediated distance education emphasize its positive aspects and understate the kinds of communicative and technical capabilities and work required by students and faculty. There are few systematic analytical studies of students who have experienced new technologies in higher education. This article presents a qualitative case study of a small graduate-level web-based distance education course at a major US university.This paper examines students' distressing experiences due to communication breakdowns and technical difficulties. This topic is glossed over in much of the distance education literature written for administrators, instructors and prospective students. The intent is that this study will enhance understanding of the instructional design issues, instructor and student preparation, and communication practices that are needed to improve web-based distance education courses.","",""

Yet web-based and online learning tools should not be just repurposed text and information, or videotaped faculty lectures. Instead, the web calls for the inclusion of sound, text and visuals for learning tools that provide a media-rich environment. This allows faculty to create multidimensional experiences that cater to different learning styles and provide opportunities for problem solving. Drawing on my production experiences at HBS, as well as my own experience teaching visual anthropology and creating films, videos, photographs and web products, I discuss the teaching opportunities that new technologies and media can provide.","",""
"2000","THE RHETORIC OF DEMOCRACY IN INTERNATIONAL ON-LINE EDUCATION","On-line education has been heralded as the next democratizing force in education, particularly in higher education (Daniel 1996; Jones 1997). By opening access to populations which have not had access either because of geographical location, job status, or physical handicap, the rhetoric of on-line education suggests that this new technology will democratize education, breaking down the elitist walls of the ivory tower. However, it is not at all clear that the reality of implementing distance learning solutions have in fact any potential, much less actual value for democratizing higher education. Much the opposite, founded on the myth of the meritocracy, on-line education has the potential to exacerbate already intractable views of individual achievement through education as rectifying failures to meet disadvantaged populations' needs. This paper presents several cases of international on-line education and the rhetoric that surrounds its introduction. In some cases we are able to share stories of implementation of distance learning programmes or governmental promises made to those interested in distance learning. In each case, we attempt to tell a story that sheds light on the ways in which the noble goals of democracy are and aren't met in the harsh reality of on-line learning.","",""
"2000","ENHANCING DISCOURSE ON NEW TECHNOLOGY WITHIN HIGHER EDUCATION","Universities face challenges in creating and nurturing reflective discourse about ICTs within higher education. Constraints to this discourse include time-space compression caused by ICTs, and changing perceptions of the university's role in an information society. In answering these challenges, a call is made for elevating the role of higher education in public knowledge formation. Such a move reduces the constraints of time pressures by valuing discussion and debate and the time required for these activities, and questions authority and credibility gained solely due to practical and discursive technological competency. Thus, the question is not just to explore how communications technologies are shaping our experience of time and space, but to debate how we wish to use technologies and other means to shape and create the time and space in which meaningful human social and political life is possible. Institutions of higher education should both serve as sites for public knowledge formation, and as contributors to such initiatives in civic society.","",""

We have developed a Web-based collaborative system, which enables students to work through lab-based tutorials with access to a lecturer at a remote location through a Web cam, e-mail and a chat room applet. The student also has access to other students through the chat room applet and can browse through the history to check whether questions have been previously answered. Remote control software allows the lecturer to take control of the students machine in order to troubleshoot problems. Currently, the system is in everyday use and here we demonstrate the many benefits of such a collaborative environment.","",""
"2000","Coping in a distance environment: Sitcoms, chocolate cake and dinner with a friend","Students entering distance education programs often find themselves adapting to new learning environments and new technologies. Part of this adaptation involves coping with unfamiliar technology and learning to manage its use within the group, helping them create the environment in which they will learn. Part of it involves developing personal relationships that will ease their work and learning, helping them cope with unfamiliarity and change. Examining suggestions from distance learning students on how to cope with this process yields three-fold results. First, it demonstrates how students, instructors and administrators need to work together to ease student's paths. Second, it helps us in advising distance learning students about what they can expect from distance learning, and how they can contribute to and benefit from their distance learning community. Finally, it provides recommendations to instructors and program directors on how better to help their students cope with this community building transition and distance learning environment.","",""
"2000","The Virtual University and college life: Some unintended consequences for democratic citizenship","Advocates of the Virtual University assume that the Internet can be used to replace the bricks and mortar campus. Even if the academic course work of higher education can be replicated online, what cannot are the organized extracurricular activities which have been a crucial component of a traditional college education. These activities create social capital, prepare students for civic engagement and combat the self-absorbed individualism which undermines democratic society. We would do well to think about their loss, and the unintended social consequences which flow from adopting the Virtual University as a model for higher education in the twenty-first century.","",""
"2000","Using the World Wide Web to enhance classroom instruction","The use of the World Wide Web (WWW) as an instructional tool is gaining momentum as more teachers, instructors, and trainers incorporate it into their repertoire. Grouped together, any instruction that makes use of a computer is called Computer Based Training (CBT), and those strategies that employ the Web as the repository for instructional information are known as Web-Based Instruction (WBI). WBI can be employed in a distance education model or as an adjunct to teacher-led classrooms.  Specifically, WBI can be used to meet the needs of a more diverse student group. Typical classes consist of students with varying abilities and previous knowledge, and WBI can help a teacher address these differences. WBI also allows students to work a pace that is more comfortable - some students work faster than their peers while others may wish to take longer. In addition, the use of WBI provides the opportunity for multiple grade levels to be accommodated in the same classroom at the same time.  From a teacher's perspective, SBI can help with many daily management tasks by reducing the paper flow required for paper-based instruction, allowing for quick and easy revisions to instructional materials, and ensuring that instructional materials are always available to students. In addition, because the bulk of instruction is delivered via the Web, the teacher is free to spend time working with individual students and small groups; less time is spent in whole-class instruction.  An added bonus of Web-Based Instruction is the fact that it can offer students a """"virtual teacher"""" because students can access the instructional materials anytime, anywhere. This allows students who were absent the opportunity to access instructional materials away from school, and even the possibility to accommodate students in a course when their schedule is full.","",""
"2000","ATEEL: The Advanced Technology Environmental Education Library","The field of environmental technology education is a rapidly changing, multifaceted field that requires students to have access to a rich, reliable, and up-to-date resource base of information. Nearly all 1,200 community colleges in the U.S. offer some type of environmental courses. Over 100 community colleges offer one-year certificate or two-year associate degree programs in environmental technology.  The constant change in federal, state, and local environmental, health, and safety regulations impacts and quickly dates the curricula in environmental programs. New regulations, discoveries, and emerging technologies change the nature of the knowledge and skills required of environmental technicians. Community college libraries have fixed budgets that may curtail purchasing the wide array of supplemental materials that are current with developments in the field. This problem is drawn into even sharper focus as increasing numbers of colleges offer environmental programs via distance learning. ATEEL is an innovative, online library designed to serve the specialized needs of community college environmental technology students, instructors, and workers throughout the nation.","",""
"2000","Hello, out there: A look at distance education in Alaska","This study examines the state of distance education in Alaska. Providing public education has offered long-standing challenges to educators and policy makers in the state since the indigenous peoples of Alaska were introduced to Western education. This is especially so at the secondary and post-secondary levels. Factors such as a low population density, isolated and remote villages, a high teacher attrition rate, a low number of Alaskans (particularly Alaska Natives) in the classroom as licensed teachers, and a challenging environment contribute to the situation.  The University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) has had a longstanding commitment to provide post-secondary education to students in rural Alaska. By surveying individuals involved in distance education in the state, this study found that distance education is primarily being delivered by audio conferencing and prepared curriculum modules. In an effort to meet the educational needs in rural Alaska at the post-secondary level, administrators and faculty are working to increase the number of courses delivered by distance education using asynchronous communication.  There were over 1,000 distance-delivered courses at the post-secondary level in Alaska delivered by the various campuses within the University of Alaska System during the 1999-2000 academic year. The typical distance education student in UA System is female, in her 30's, and likely to be White. Twenty-five percent of students taking distance education courses in various UA campuses were identified as Alaska Native, which is significant since they constitute 15 percent of the state population. Students taking distance education courses from any of the University of Alaska sites took an average of two courses per semester.  There is a need for greater coordination among the different sites delivering distance education courses and training for faculty in a more consistent manner. Information and access to course work should be made more readily available to all post-secondary students within and outside the state. Further research is necessary on gender disparity and on the relatively high number of Alaska Native students taking distance education courses.","",""
"2000","Navigating technology: beyond a critical theory","This paper explores how the new communication technologies have impacted on the 'Graphic Information Design' BA Hons at the University of Westminster and uses a reading of the degree course documents from 1970 to the present day to identify and trace the history of this impact. The paper outlines, in particular, the development of the theoretical component of the course and argues that this component, known as contextual studies, has done little to address the impact of the new technologies and the radical paradigm shift from 'page' to 'screen'. It suggests that contextual studies should develop a more appropriate framework which would address these developments and details the content of one module 'Critical Theory' as a possible site for a more appropriate framework. In conclusion, it suggests that the Internet has greater potential than conventional teaching to deliver a more appropriate contextual studies programme; one which would also address the needs of graphic information design students into the 21st century.","",""
"2001","A New Game In Town: Competitive higher education","Research universities in the USA are complex, expensive organizations that perform multiple interrelated tasks and serve numerous constituencies. The value structure that has evolved for these universities is one that creates very high barriers to entry for new players and numerous impediments to rapid change. Consequently, real competitive pressures on universities have been minimal. However, new types of for-profit and non-profit organizations are beginning to provide competition in targeted segments of higher education. The arrival of Internet-mediated distance learning will greatly increase both market penetration by these new organizations and competition between traditional institutions of higher learning. Because this new competition targets only selected activities of the research university, it risks to destabilize their organization and structure. Ways in which this destabilization might occur are analysed and possible responses are discussed.","",""
"2001","Professional Cultures and Collaborative Efforts: A Case Study of Technologists and Educators Working for Change","The need for those working in a variety of settings to interact effectively with technical experts has grown dramatically in recent years as computers have become essential to the performance of an increasing broad range of professional work. This article presents a case of this sort of interprofessional interaction, exploring the process and outcomes of collaboration between technical professionals and educators working to bring Internet access to an urban public school district. Drawing on field note and interview data, the case reported here illustrates how differences in institutional routines and professional values can generate differing agendas, contrasting assumptions, and contrasting expectations concerning project products and outcomes among collaborators from different professional worlds. In the case we describe, these differences affected such central matters as the types and usefulness of technical resources to which users had access as well as users' confidence in the technology. The case also illustrates how aspects of this interprofessional conflict were addressed through an organizational change. The kinds of issues that arose in this project are likely to occur in a variety of professional settings; therefore, examination of this case provides insight into a variety of issues and dynamics that should be considered when embarking upon or analyzing any interprofessional collaborative effort, and particularly one that involves technical professionals.","",""

"2001","Computer-mediated school education and the Web","The addition of the Web to the range of technologies which humans have used to mediate between themselves and the world has contributed to problems as well as advantages in the area of school education. Historical antecedents in areas such as writing, printing and industrialisation provide a context in which mediated experiences can be examined. In the 21st century, the availability of online education increases the possibility that virtual experience will be substituted for reality. There are also concerns that there will be a blurring of appearance and reality, and that cultural imperialism will continue to spread by use of the Web. Together with the observation that computer-mediation via the Web tends to reframe the central role of the teacher in the educational process, these factors are considered in terms of the need to establish future guidelines to reduce the adverse impact of the Web on school education.","",""

The drive to develop a winning formula for commercial online education has fostered some unusual partnerships. This paper provides a broad overview of some models of online education that have been developed by commercial and academic institutions. It examines some of the rhetorical strategies that have been used to talk about online education by commercial groups, and discusses some of the hopes and fears that have been associated with online instruction by academics, administrators, and businesspeople. The paper outlines some of the main players and positions involved in debates about online education, and suggests some strategies that academic groups ought to explore. In particular, the author argues that academics need something an open source movement for academic resources, akin to the Free Software Foundation. This 'Free Courseware Foundation' would give teachers greater control of their resources, and better enable them to share materials with other teachers and with the public.","",""
"2002","Object Lessons: Towards an Educational Theory of Technology","This article offers a critical consideration of current initiatives, and concomitant discourses, exhorting educators to adopt and integrate digital tools on a large scale. Despite immense obstacles standing in the way of full-scale implementation, educational perspectives critical of the e-learning imperative are, for the most part, marginalized and/or ignored, as economic interests are prioritized over more specifically educational ones, and a new breed of entrepreneurial academics give intellectual legitimacy to commercial and corporate ideologies. New 'partnerships' of designers and developers committed to technology for its own sake now create products for the 'education marketplace,' with little or no experience of, or interest in, underlying educational goals, while explicitly educational theories are supplanted by a re-purposed economistic discourse. Two prominent examples of 'educational technology' are describe here: the """"integrated learning system"""" and the """"networked e-learning environment"""", and some contrasts are made to the authors' own, small-scale, school-based technology research and development efforts. This latter type of interventionist work, designed to challenge business-as-usual in the culture of public schooling, offers a critical perspective on the typically under-theorized and unproblematic uptake and mis/uses of new technologies in school-based settings. It is proposed that one way of re-thinking the purposes and uses of new technologies for education might be to re-position common theoretical questions, asking not how education might use these new tools, but instead asking what, educationally, they might offer; instead of theorizing educational technology, then, the focus becomes an educational theory of technology. Adopting this reflexive stance, which views intervention activities as object lessons, provides instructive opportunities to learn from our tools even as we endeavor to rethink, not just their uses, but more fundamentally the prospects of digital technologies for reconceiving the very idea of a truly public education.","",""

"2003","Translating an Eletronic Panopticon Educational technology and the re-articulation of lecturer-student relations in online learning","Around the world universities are currently in the midst of an online learning revolution. Australia is no exception, with new online learning software packages being used throughout the country at various levels of implementation. This paper reports on research conducted at a regional campus in Australia, which is trialing an online educational software package. Using Foucault's writing on disciplinary techniques and the panopticon as a diagram of power in tandem with the translation approach outlined within Actor-Network Theory (ANT), this paper demonstrates how certain functions within an educational software package act interdependently as an electronic disciplinary technique that renders the student as an object, making them knowable to the lecturer and the university. This technologically-mediated objectification of the student enables lecturers to act upon the actions of the student at-a-distance, and thus carries the effects of disciplinary power to them in new ways. The subsequent analysis shows how the introduction of online technology into university education serves to produce multiple translations of disciplinary and counter-disciplinary practices between lecturers and students. The success or failure of the lecturer's attempts to translate the actions of the students through the educational technology was not necessarily related to any intentional resistance by the students. Instead, the production of multiple learning practices produced in association with the online technology served to exacerbate the ambivalent and ambiguous subject positions inhabited by the students. This affected the students' translation of the lecturer's course instructions, resulting in some students engaging in questionable pedagogical practices.","",""

"2005","Electronic courseware in higher education"," The rising costs of education often lead to the call for a change from the traditional, space–and–time bound institutions to ones that offer increasingly cost–effective, technologically enhanced programs. As institutions of higher education turn to technology, primarily Internet–based, to address these challenges, the use of electronic courseware is dramatically increasing. In order to effectively utilize electronic courseware in the classroom, educators not only need to be aware of terminology, functions, and uses of the most popular types of electronic courseware, but also (and perhaps more importantly) educators need to develop and critique pedagogically based research that can, at the broader level, help educators at various levels of technological expertise learn and adapt their teaching styles to maximize student learning.  In this paper we consider electronic course management systems from a pedagogical perspective, with the goal of aiding educators to effectively utilize electronic courseware in the classroom. By discussing the basics (such as terminology, functions, and uses of the most popular types of electronic courseware) and examining pedagogically based research we hope, at the broader level, to help educators at various levels of technological expertise learn and adapt their teaching styles to maximize student learning.

To establish their bearings, the instructors need to be aware of their goals and combine them with strategies and techniques that effectively manage the affordances and constraints of the environment. That process may require a degree of risk–taking combined with a willingness to help students lead themselves.

We see changes in teaching and learning emerging from the nexus of a changing landscape of information and communication technologies, an active and motivated teaching corps that has worked to derive new approaches to teaching, an equally active and motivated learning corps that has contributed as much to how to teach online as they have to how to learn while online, with others, and away from a campus setting. We see the need for, and the emergence of, new theories and models of and for the online learning environment, addressing learning in its ICT context, considering both formal and informal learning, individual and community learning, and new practices arising from technology use in the service of learning.

Professional development experiences can play an important part in supporting faculty in these endeavours; however, most faculty professional development at the postsecondary level has been of an ad hoc nature involving interested individuals who have seen a need and sought out someone more skilled with computers to help them. Glenn (2002) calls for more work in the area of identifying viable models for preparing faculty to infuse technology into teacher education programs. In this paper I share some of the elements of a faculty wide professional development model designed for a large faculty of education. The Teaching with Technology in the Faculty of Education (TTFE) website was developed to provide a professional development model that includes practical resources for faculty seeking ways to make effective use of learning technologies. The model, which includes a suite of online tools and resources, integrates ideas both from people in the faculty and from other postsecondary institutions as to different ways to enhance teaching and learning. Faculty members have opportunities to engage in hands-on learning about active student-centred learning approaches as well as learning about effective use of technology for transforming their courses along these lines.

In this paper, we offer an example of a writing project with social media designed to foster critical awareness and broaden understandings of textuality and intellectual property in a new knowledge economy. We describe a study with two instructors and thirty-five pre-service teachers in a post-degree education program. Students undertook a collaborative writing project in a wiki environment over the course of several months, the aim of which was to generate a communal response to a set of professional standards for teachers. This allowed an iterative process of learning whereby students were encouraged to interrogate their understandings of commonly held beliefs about knowledge creation and representation, as well as their subject position as learners, on an ongoing basis. This process, which was challenging but ultimately valuable, is described herein as an “interrupted model” of inquiry.","",""

"2009","Insidious pedagogy: How course management systems affect teaching","Course management systems, like any other technology, have an inherent purpose implied in their design, and therefore a built-in pedagogy. Although these pedagogies are based on instructivist principles, today's large CMSs have many features suitable for applying more constructivist pedagogies. Yet few faculty use these features, or even adapt their CMS very much, despite the several customization options. This is because most college instructors do not work or play much on the Web, and thus utilize Web-based systems primarily at their basic level. The defaults of the CMS therefore tend to determine the way Web-novice faculty teach online, encouraging methods based on posting of material and engendering usage that focuses on administrative tasks. A solution to this underutilization of the CMS is to focus on pedagogy for Web-novice faculty and allow a choice of CMS.","",""

Following a postindustrial model, the information/knowledge economy was seen as the leading productive sector.

"2012","A Review of “Learning, Creating, and Using Knowledge: Concept Maps as Facilitative Tools in Schools and Corporation”","The U.S. education system faces a crisis at all levels. A study by the international Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that, when compared to students from 70 countries, 15-year-olds from the United States averaged 15th in reading skills, 17th in science, and 25th, or below average, in mathematics (OECD 2010). The same report also shows the United States falling behind in student enrollment and graduation (Zeitvogel 2010). On the subject of higher education, Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa’s Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses (2011) has garnered significant attention for arguing that most college students make little progress in higher order learning during their four-plus years in school. Many fear that America’s youth are not being adequately prepared for the needs of the new global economy and that they will be unable to compete with the innovations coming from China, India, and other foreign markets. Fingers have been pointed at many different factors in attempts to assign responsibility for these educational difficulties: a lack of funding from federal and state governments; mismanagement by school administrations; No Child Left Behind and high-stakes testing; ill-trained or entrenched teachers and teachers’ unions; the influence of new technology on student attitudes and learning abilities; a consumer mentality that views education as a commodity; a loss of traditional values in education; and the list goes on. According to long-time science educator and educational researcher Joseph D. Novak, the root of the problem is the lack of a unified theory of learning that serves as the basis for systematic reform of educational methodology. In this revised edition of his 1998 Learning, Creating, and Using Knowledge, Novak marshals a significant body of practical and theoretical research to support his concept of “meaningful learning” as a unified theory of education that can radically improve learning on all levels, from early childhood to corporate development. The improvements he seeks are not merely quantitative gains in test scores but qualitative changes in the ways humans construct, integrate, and apply knowledge in academic and business settings. While recognizing the challenges to widespread change, Novak is ultimately optimistic about the possibilities for a full-fledged revolution in learning that will empower individuals and companies to harness human creativity and improve the human condition. Novak bases his ideas on David Ausubel’s “Assimilation Learning” Theory, which holds that meaningful learning occurs when the learner negotiates between knowledge previously gained and newly acquired. This active engagement on the part of the learner results not in the rote memorization of facts but the construction and reconstruction of complex cognitive frameworks. By integrating information into a hierarchical structure that demonstrates the relationship between concepts, the learner develops a deeper understanding of knowledge; the process of learning accelerates as he or she can adapt these cognitive frames to incorporate additional information and new levels of complexity. In turn, the learner can apply his or her knowledge in more effective and more creative ways. For Novak, Ausubel’s theory provides a powerful foundation upon which to build a comprehensive theory of education. He expands Ausubel’s primarily cognitive focus to include","",""

However, assessment is a necessary part of education, because it helps instructors to determine how well students are meeting course goals. In fact, I argue that assessment can be a positive tool to help critical educators to work toward conscientization, thus, determining whether students are developing a heightened awareness of hegemony, identifying avenues for praxis, and developing means to respond to hegemony when they discern its presence in society. By providing examples of how critical educators can help students reach conscientization,   this article examines the relationship between two seemingly incongruous terms—critical communication pedagogy and assessment—to enable critical educators to facilitate a critical agenda.","",""

In such a climate, students may feel less alienated from the university community and more connected to the class and their peers, and as such, they may be less likely to plagiarise their work.

The virtual nature of MOOCs presents considerable advantages to students in terms of flexibility to learn what they want, when they want. Yet despite their virtual focus, some MOOC users also seek to create face-to-face communities with students taking similar courses or using similar platforms. This paper aims to assess the learner motivations behind creation of these offline communities. Do these face-to-face meetings represent an added extra to the learning experience, with students taking advantage of the context of the MOOCs to create new personal and professional connections? Or, are offline meetups filling a gap for students who feel that not all learning can take place online? We also assess the extent to which these patterns vary between developing and industrialised regions, thus testing the claim that MOOCs are helping to democratise access to education around the world. Our research is based on a unique source of socially generated big data, drawn from the website ‘meetup.com’, which gives us a data set of over 4000 MOOC related events taking place in over 140 countries around the world over a two year period.

However, despite the potential, the principles of inclusive education are often applied in ways that serve to further disenfranchise the very students the approach seeks to support. This paper draws on research undertaken through funding support provided by the Australian Government, Office for Learning and Teaching in presenting the case for teachers to adapt their learning and teaching strategies to address an increasingly diverse student population and to adopt more transformative pedagogical approaches to engaging all students with “difference”. This paper explores issues of particular relevance to the design of technology enhanced learning that is inclusive of the diverse needs of higher education students with disabilities, however, the term “diverse students” is preferred, acknowledging the transient nature of some disabilities, the varying ways in which individuals choose to identify, the multiple layers of equity overlap, and the benefits of inclusive design of technology enhanced learning for all students. The inclusive education approach presented in the paper incorporates accessibility, usability, personalization and transformative pedagogy within a holistic model, as well as strategies for implementation at the institutional, program and individual student level. This paper concludes by arguing for more transformative approaches to understanding diversity and strategies for implementing inclusive design of technology enhanced learning in the higher education context.","",""

Taking into account evolving trends and trajectories in the fields of digital networked technology and education since the 1990s, it argues for the multiple articulations of mediation as a core component in competing discourses about competence formation. These are centred on three evolving and interrelated trends: a) the increased emphasis on computer mediated communication and collaboration as shapers of meaning and improvement; b) the introduction of media logics in particular fields and domains of education; and c) datafication and metrics as means of both self-organization or management and cross-promotional strategies. While several scholars within critical media literacy traditions and critical educational technology have dealt with evolving trends in technology and competing discourses as writing passage from the information to data-driven society, developing a fuller sense of these trajectories can enable us to chart out interconnected threads of power, conflict and subversion that frame learning as a competitive endeavour and reconfigure the expansion of education in broader areas of society.","",""
"2017","Breaking down barriers: The ambivalent nature of technologies in the classroom"," This article provides a critical study of the ambivalent nature of educational technology. Departing from the fact that the contemporary classroom is no longer a bounded and discrete space, the article uses ethnographic participant observation to provide thick descriptions of technologies-in-use at a Danish business college. These observations suggest that educational technologies play much more nuanced roles than hitherto imagined. Building on the notion of spatial imaginaries, the article explores two complementary patterns of spatial relations in the classroom: Educational technologies open a gateway to the world that can be used both to bring relevant information into the space of the classroom (“outside-in”) and to escape educational activities in favor of off-task activity (“inside-out”). By exploring these twin movements, this article hopes not only to provide a glimpse into the 21st-century digitized classroom but also to showcase the uneasy position of educational technology between burden and blessing.

This article considers how teachers can work with digital productions at primary schools even when they are not acquainted with the new production genres. We propose a methodological framework to assist students and teachers in their exploration of unknown media genres based on a case study. We revive the ancient concept of imitatio and integrate it with contemporary design thinking to support production dynamics that lead to increased digital literacy.","",""

"2018","Balancing media environments: Design principles for digital learning in Danish upper secondary schools","Based on a case study on pupils at a Danish upper secondary school this paper reveals that the pupils’ media experiences in school are dominated by frustrations and feelings of ambiguity. Two pupil groups with different attitudes towards digital media were identified: one ‘IT positive’ group that call for more activating uses of digital media, and an ‘IT skeptic’ group that call for less experimentation and a return to traditional teaching methods and paper books. The case study reflects several ways in which new technologies challenges our educational system. This results in schools today generally being caught between practices of the literate, book-based environment, on the one hand, and the interactive, networked digital environment, on the other. The paper uses the concept of affordances to demonstrate how different media environments shape learning possibilities differently, and that any technology elicits desirable learning outcomes as well as undesirable learning outcomes — or challenges. Essentially, the educational system faces a fundamental challenge of balancing logics and principles of digital learning with traditional, paper-based learning. On this basis, a theoretical framework is developed that sets up didactical principles — distinguishing between affordances at individual, social and societal levels — for applying digital technologies in learning contexts. The paper concludes by demonstrating the principles through a learning design case concerning the climate debate.","",""
"2019","The possibility of enmemberment","Learning in the Age of Digital Freedom, by Petar Jandrić, accomplishes several goals. It brings together 16 diverse and complex voices to discuss human learning at the intersection of technology. It also delves deeply into the layered work of each individual interlocutor while juxtaposing their dialogues collectively to frame a wholistic critical conversation that resounds with collaboration. Finally, it feels important. As a college professor, I step into the classroom several times a week to confront not only the complexities of the teaching task, but also the dilemmas inherent in the changing pedagogical landscape. And, like many progressive educators, I ask: What does freedom in this space mean for every learner (Bialka, 2015)? Which voices are likely to be the most vulnerable as a result of the irrevocable push of outside social forces (Freire, 2010; hooks, 2017), especially in this age of digital reasoning? And which teacher/learners (Cook-Sather & Shore, 2007; Freire, 2010) appear the best positioned to succeed in today’s “knowledge economy”? Critical pedagogy informs my praxis and my political ideology, but, at times, I need both a comforting arm across the shoulder to shepherd me through or a bit of a shove in the backside to move me along. And, as our praxis has taught us, in order to break out of the ideological frameworks that inform our everyday life, we need to dig deeply into critical theory. Jandrić (2017) provides both by weaving a continual dialogue which has at its core the simultaneous goal of informing learning while transgressing disciplinarity. To me, this is the best of all worlds because of the benefits to students, especially with the shifting student demographics toward minoritized, high poverty, and immigrant populations (Noguera, 2017). Although there are numerous critical theoretic and dialogic goals accomplished by the work, the conversations in Learning in the Age of Digital Reason enable educators to explore dynamic teacher/learner dialogism for all students through a lens of enmemberment (Scuro, 2018) which encapsulates both the limitation and possibility of the book.","",""
"2019","PLATFORM PEDAGOGIES: LEARNING, AUTHORISING AND VALIDATING TRUST IN EDUCATION","This panel investigates the pedagogic dimension of digital platforms thus drawing on older theoretical traditions that use pedagogy as a way of describing and explaining the relationships between individual and society, agency and structure (paper 1). We want to explore what it means to conceive of the relationship between people and their platforms as a pedagogic relationship; and how such conceptualisations might advance study of platforms in general (paper 4). Additionally, using the term pedagogy in its more specifically educational sense the panel explores the relationship between learning, schooling and education systems across emerging platforms (papers 2 regarding 8th grade teachers in the US using apps, and paper 3 regarding Australian universities’ learning management systems).&#x0D; Platforms, we argue, standardise and seek to offer a relationship of trust over time with their “citizens”. Platforms working with families, schools or in higher education feed off the authority and trust that pertains between citizens and these institutions. However, the platformisation of education (van Dijck, Poell &amp; de Waal, 2018) may contain other kinds of risks for students and their families, thereby introducing the need for new forms of validation. By thinking about activities in and across a series of platforms in terms of pedagogic relationships, where trust is placed in authority, the panel will explore the mechanisms by which digital interactions take forms of social trust and yet expose people to forms of dataveillance beyond ways that any membership or participation suggests in its initial contract.","",""
"2019","CRITICAL PEDAGOGIES IN INTERNET STUDIES: TEACHING FOR CHANGE","There are urgent reasons for considering whether, as academics, we place our trust in the current system or whether we try to change it. Research offers one pathway towards supporting efforts for positive change, but we should not neglect the potential of our teaching work. Academics within Internet studies have unique possibilities for engaging in critical pedagogies, supporting students in understanding and challenging oppression. I draw here on ten years’ experience teaching in Internet studies, student and peer feedback, and the literature on critical pedagogy and decolonizing academia. I suggest that where possible we reflect on the texts we set students; redesign assessment; considering being vulnerable with students; and challenge restrictive policies and procedures (such as those around late submission of assignments). These approaches rely on trusting students, and on building their trust in us without relying solely on our institutional authority. As a field we need to actively and explicitly discuss how, and what, we teach.","",""
"2019","(Digital) Media as Critical Pedagogy","From chalkboard sites to social media, from smartphones to interactive grading software, there is an overabundance of digital learning tools at our fingertips, many of which float into our classrooms on airy praise from university administrators, politicians, and corporate technicians alike who tout the incorporation of these technologies into our teaching as an undeniably positive step toward the â€œenhancementâ€ of student learning. Rather than promoting a critical model of learning by which students and teachers can explore the matrix of possibilities â€œaffordedâ€ by their relationship to new media, the techno-fetishist instrumentality of â€œtechnology-enhanced learningâ€ functions as an efficient means of materializing neoliberal market ideology and adjusting us to accepting our positions as self-contained users of discrete tools that define for us what the goals and processes of learning will be. It is imperative, then, that we engage ourselves and our students in the critical pedagogical process of learning to learn in conversation with â€“ not at the behest of â€“ media. To do so gets to the very heart of critical pedagogy itself, because, as I argue, the ontological assumptions underwriting the very hope and possibility of critical pedagogy as a political project are nothing if not the essential coordinates for a media theory of being. If we are to determine how to develop a sufficiently critical pedagogy in the age of digital media, we must first re-locate the learning process in the exploration of the open, dialectical circuits between human and world through which life itself is mediated, and from which political change is made possible.   ","",""
"2021","OPEN PEDAGOGY: INDEPENDENCE AND INTERDEPENDENCE IN TEACHING ABOUT NEW        MEDIA","In the quest for independence from traditional media constraints, open pedagogy — involving students in the creation of openly licensed materials — offers training in open culture practices alongside deeper learning. Our research builds upon an exploratory study by Hilton et al. (2019). We collected quantitative and qualitative data about the experiences of 85 students participating in an open pedagogy course project: creating content for the open textbook Humans R Social Media (HRSM). We asked students to compare their experiences working on HRSM with traditional learning activities (e.g., writing papers, taking quizzes). About 66% of students said the HRSM project had greater educational value than traditional learning activities. Most students (54.1%) also reported that HRSM helped them master more core academic content, and 51.8% said the project helped them become more collaborative learners. Although a small percentage preferred traditional learning activities, most students reported that open pedagogy’s focus on agency and choice enabled them to share their individuality and creativity. We also found that students valued knowing their work could be shared beyond the classroom; and that publishing, in the words of one student, “gave me more incentive to make sure my assignments were my best product.” This study tentatively reinforces the benefits of independent, hands-on learning as well as collaborative interdependence in an online environment. These findings suggest the active nature of open pedagogy holds rich possibilities for cultivating participatory learning activities, involving students in the creation of knowledge as they learn, and cultivating interdependent connection and community.","",""

"2022","Special Issue: Theory and Practice in Remote Teaching, Online Learning, and Distance Education for K-12","There are many situations where digital technology has served as the lifeline or salvation for society. Unexpected and unpredictable situations like catastrophic floods, blizzards, earthquakes, and more recently the Covid-19 pandemic have forced families to stay home, meaning that digital technologies have become important tools for people to work and learn. Other examples are societal and regional challenges such as lack of qualified teachers, diminishing birth rates, and difficulties in filling classrooms that force digital and educational development. The symposium held in May 2021, which resulted in this special issue, was intended to explore possibilities for ensuring equal access to education in rural schools using remote teaching. At the symposium, different strategies to increase access to education in the context of K-12 using digital technologies was presented and discussed. It brought together researchers from Europe and North America, all represented in this issue.","",""
"2022","A Theoretical Framework for Synchronous Remote Teaching? Reshaping the Pedagogical Triangle","This paper explores synchronous remote teaching as a pedagogical practice and elaborates upon a framework with which to understand the practice theoretically. The empirical backdrop comprises remote teaching practice in Sweden, where this practice is implemented via digital technology and with an onsite facilitator who is present with the students. The pedagogical triangle is revisited, examined, and explored in relation to remote teaching as a new pedagogical practice. In the theoretical elaboration, the pedagogical triangle is reshaped into a pyramid due to the onsite facilitator’s participation in the remote teaching. This elaboration is a first step to establishing a theoretical understanding of remote teaching practice on its own terms.","",""
"2022","Through the Lens of Situated Learning and Levels of Scale: Theorizing Development of Remote Teaching and the Role of On-Site Facilitators","The aim of this paper is to contribute to theoretical development within a field otherwise mostly characterized by empirical contributions, with a primary focus on the practice and perspectives of on-site facilitators. To theoretically understand the development and use of remote teaching, we focus on the interaction between systems of human activity in education and the relationships enacted in practice through their interaction, with a focus on on-site facilitators’ work. In doing so, we use the concept levels of scale in situated learning. Through levels of scale, we conceptualize the historical development of remote teaching as the large scale and the remote learning environment as the small scale. Integrating the levels of scale and tracing the historical development of remote teaching in Sweden into the enactments taking place in a classroom of modern language teaching is the concrete theoretical development that our aim entails.","",""
"2022","In Need of Development, Learning and Research? : On the Possibilities of a Common Point of Departure for Digital and Educational Development","A growing body of initiatives aims to connect school improvement with external actors, such as universities, by means of networks and collaborative partnerships of different kinds. Simultaneously, many schools have difficulties in assessing or predicting their needs associated with the digitalization of a specific local school practice given their lack of existing tools to articulate those needs. This has made it difficult to study digitalization in a complementary and symmetrical way between academia and practice. In this study, we used a quantitative instrument to generate findings and development needs relevant to both research and school development. The instrument, which we distributed to all school leaders in one municipality, measures perceptions of three overall areas: (a) levels of digitalization, (b) organizational digital maturity, and (c) notions of leadership. The data shows, for example, that digitalization, in this municipality, was a concern or issue on an individual level. Achieving a more complex view of digitalization as school development—a collegial approach and mindset together with leadership and organization that focuses on strategy and common goals—appears to be a high priority for research and practice. To conclude, the results generated from the instrument used in this study can contribute to a shared understanding of the findings and the needs relevant to both research and school development.","",""

To understand this idea historically, this article brings together computer science researchers with theories of education and childhood development. These researchers—Seymour Papert at MIT and Alan Kay and Adele Goldberg at Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center—drew on a group of midtwentiethcentury education theorists. These cases offer a window into how computer researchers have read and interpreted scientific theories about education and childhood development that then make their way into computer technology or fail to do so entirely.","",""
"2023","Digital pedagogies post-COVID-19: The future of teaching with/in new technologies","Pedagogies in the 21st century still exhibit certain uneasiness in relation to digital technologies. Instead of rapid speeds and rhythms of networked technologies and their endless streams of information, these pedagogies are marked by a strong preference for what Hayles (2007) refers to as deep attention. This form of attention is able to focus on one single object for longer periods of time, has the capacity to tune out distractions, and a high tolerance for boredom. Hayles depicts this cognitive mode with an image: ‘picture a college sophomore, deep in Pride and Prejudice, with her legs draped over an easy chair, oblivious to her ten-year-old brother sitting in front of a console, jamming on a joystick while he plays Grand Theft Auto’ (2007: 187–88). The disciplinary norms upheld by education at all levels are still univocally grounded in this form of attention, while the restless excitement-seeking mode of attention associated with playing video games, but also with browsing the web or scrolling through different feeds, is seen as the enemy. This adversary mode of attention, characterized by constantly switching between different tasks in pursuit of stimulation, is referred to by Hayles as hyper attention, and is, as she rightly points out, regarded by educational institutions as ‘defective behavior that scarcely qualifies as a cognitive mode at all’ (2007: 188). One of the aims of education today, it would seem, is to remedy the influence of digital media and immunize us against it. Yet, pedagogy is not alone in its mistrust of the digital. As aptly summed by Paasonen (2021: 1), according to ‘a plethora of cultural diagnoses, networked devices, apps, and social media are atrophying our attention spans, eroding our capacity to focus and think, addicting us, boring us, and stealing our time, as well as stopping us from truly relating to one another, engaging in critical thought, or contributing to public life in a meaningful way’. Paasonen, who maps some of these accounts, draws attention to a range of such analyses put forward by journalists, critical theorists and","",""
"2023","Implementation as a constitutive entanglement: Framing sociomaterial pedagogical practices  emerging from the implementation of a learning management system","Are there concealed ways of using a learning management system (LMS) among educators in higher education? This paper argues that it is the case, and uses a sociomaterial bottom-up perspective to understand how a group of educators used a new LMS that was implemented at a Nordic university. Understanding an implementation as a constitutive entanglement, a sociomaterial research lens is applied to explain that in an implementation current technology usage evokes previous knowledge and assumptions about technologies and shapes the engagement with new technologies. This study found that when educators engaged with a new LMS, they viewed it as complex and needed to perform strategies that reduced technology complexities into practices that they knew. This engagement formed three sociomaterial pedagogical practices. A sociomaterial perspective might cast new light on how we understand the outcomes of technology implementation processes in educational contexts.","",""

What is identified as the main problem is the power of digital technology and how technologies shape institutional practices of teaching and learning, often in opposition to democratic education aims. The introduction of AI in higher education deepens the mediatization process of higher education, demonstrated by a mainstream oriented usage of AI. In higher education, digital technology shapes practices that are indifferent to the epistemic claims and rights of students, and quite perfectly attuned to the ‘practical needs’ of digital technology which severely challenges the concept of knowing and also critical thinking in higher education.    ","",""

The objective was to explore how integrating an understanding of individual students' distinctive traits into developing technology-based pedagogies informed by students' different ways of knowing can increase learning outcomes. In this article, I discuss how adopting culturally responsive technologies in classrooms can redress epistemic injustice and improve learner outcomes by promoting student engagement, hands-on experiential learning, and culturally aware learning. The concept of epistemic justice inspires efforts to enhance learning environments and cultivate a sense of connection and community among students. The cases draw from my experience adopting the intervention and are presented within an analytical framework of culturally responsive technology-based pedagogies in selected hybrid and in-person media production courses.

This brief forum article explores how research and teaching in many regions are being ‘platformised’ by a combination of academic publishers, the edtech industry, and Big Tech firms. Together, these processes of platformising research and teaching are integrating universities into complex digital infrastructures for many of their central operations. Universities are being re-infrastructured. They are also being ‘assetised’ as control of platforms and infrastructures allows their proprietors to extract value from the HE sector. These developments call for concerted dialogue on the conditions and prospects of academic labour in the digital university, and close attention to how emerging technological devices and systems are integrated into, challenged or transformed by scientific and pedagogic practice.","",""

Edtech provides a useful empirical object of study because of the increasing deployment of new digital technologies in educational organizations; our focus is on higher education institutions (i.e. universities) in the United Kingdom. The empirical analysis is split between a discussion of digital infrastructures and architectures of (data) assetization in higher education; the tensions arising between new digital infrastructures and legacy infrastructures in UK higher education institutions; and the implications of reconfiguring legacy infrastructures for UK universities. We pay particular attention to the creation of new techno-economic objects, especially the transformation of personal and user data into an asset, as datafication transforms higher education in unexpected and not necessarily beneficial ways.","",""
