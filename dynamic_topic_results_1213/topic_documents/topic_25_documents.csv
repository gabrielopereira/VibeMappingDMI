Maybe they need good financial                 information, but I don't think people know what good information is when                 you get into culture, society, and politics.""""                 -- Steven Brill,Chairman and Editor-in-chief, Brill's Content                                               Once upon a time, not very long ago, advertisements were easy to                 recognise. They had simple personalities with goals not much more                 complicated than selling you a bar of soap or a box of cereal. And they                 possessed the reassuring familiarity of old friends or relatives you've                 known all your life. They were Pilgrims who smiled at you from Quaker Oats                 boxes or little tablets named """"Speedy"""" who joyfully danced into a glass of                 water with the sole purpose of giving up their short life to help lessen                 your indigestion from overindulgence. Yes, sometimes they could be a                 little obnoxious but, hey, it was a predictable annoyance.                And once, not very long ago, advertisements also knew their place in the                 landscape of popular culture, their boundaries were the ad space of                 magazines or the commercial time of television programs. When the ads got                 too annoying, you could toss the magazine aside or change the TV channel.                 The ease and quickness of their dispatch had the abruptness of slamming                 your front door in the face of an old door-to-door salesman.                This all began to change around the 1950s when advertisements acquired a                 more complex and subtle personality and began straying outside of their                 familiar media neighborhoods. The social observer Vance Packard wrote a                 best-selling book in the late 50s called The Hidden Persuaders which                 identified this change in advertising's personality as coming from hanging                 around Professor Freud's psychoanalysis and learning his hidden,                 subliminal methods of trickery.                Ice cubes in a glass for a liquor ad were no longer seen as simple props                 to help sell a brand of whiskey but were now subliminal suggestions of                 female anatomy. The curved fronts of automobiles were more than aesthetic                 streamlined design features but rather suggestive of a particular feature                 of the male anatomy. Forgotten by the new subliminal types of ads was the                 simple salesmanship preached by founders of the ad industry like David                 Ogilvy and John Caples. The word """"sales"""" became a dirty word and was                 replaced with modern psychological buzzwords like subliminal persuasion.                The Evolution of Subliminal Techniques               The book Hidden Persuaders made quite a stir at the time, bringing about                 congressional hearings and even the introduction of legislation. Prominent                 motivation researchers Louis Cheskin and Ernest Dichter utilised the new                 ad methods and were publicly admonished as traitors to their profession.                 The life of the new subliminal advertising seemed short indeed. Even Vance                 Packard predicted its coming demise. """"Eventually, say by A.D. 2000,"""" he                 wrote in the preface to the paperback edition of his book, """"all this depth                 manipulation of the psychological variety will seem amusingly old-                 fashioned"""".                Yet, 40 years later, any half-awake observer of popular culture knows                 that things haven't exactly worked out the way Packard predicted. In fact                 what seems old-fashioned today is the belief that ads are those simpletons                 they once were before the 50s and that products are sold for features and                 benefits rather than for images. Even Vance Packard expresses an amazement                 at the evolution of advertising since the 50s, noting that today ads for                 watches have nothing to do with watches or that ads for shoes scarcely                 mention shoes. Packard remarks """"it used to be the brand identified the                 product. In today's advertising the brand is the product"""". Modern                 advertising, he notes, has an almost total obsession with images and                 feelings and an almost total lack of any concrete claims about the product                 and why anyone should buy it. Packard admits puzzlement. """"Commercials seem                 totally unrelated to selling any product at all"""". Jeff DeJoseph of the J.                 Walter Thompson firm underlines Packard's comments. """"We are just trying to                 convey a sensory impression of the brand, and we're out of there"""".                Subliminal advertising techniques have today infiltrated the heart of                 corporate America. As Ruth Shalit notes in her article """"The Return of the                 Hidden Persuaders"""" from the 27 September 1999 issue of Salon magazine,               """"far from being consigned to the maverick fringe, the new psycho-                 persuaders of corporate America have colonized the marketing departments                 of mainstream conglomerates. At companies like Kraft, Coca-Cola, Proctor &amp;                 Gamble and Daimler-Chrysler, the most sought-after consultants hail not                 from McKinsey &amp; Company, but from brand consultancies with names like                 Archetype Discoveries, PsychoLogics and Semiotic Solutions"""".                Shalit notes a growing number of CEOs have become convinced they cannot                 sell their brands until they first explore the """"Jungian substrata of four-                 wheel drive; unlock the discourse codes of female power sweating; or                 deconstruct the sexual politics of bologna"""". The result, as Shalit                 observes, is a """"charmingly retro school of brand psychoanalysis, which                 holds that all advertising is simply a variation on the themes of the                 Oedipus complex, the death instinct, or toilet training, and that the goal                 of effective communications should be to compensate the consumer for the                 fact that he was insufficiently nursed as an infant, has taken corporate                 America by storm"""".                The Growing Ubiquity of Advertising               Yet pervasive as the subliminal techniques of advertising have become,                 the emerging power of modern advertising ultimately centres around """"where""""                 it is rather than """"what"""" it is or """"how"""" it works. The power of modern                 advertising is within this growing ubiquity or """"everywhereness"""" of                 advertising rather than the technology and methodology of advertising. The                 ultimate power of advertising will be arrived at when ads cannot be                 distinguished from their background environment. When this happens, the                 environment will become a great continuous ad.                In the process, ads have wandered away from their well-known hangouts in                 magazines and TV shows. Like alien-infected pod-people of early science                 fiction movies, they have stumbled out of these familiar media playgrounds                 and suddenly sprouted up everywhere. The ubiquity of advertising is not                 being driven by corporations searching for new ways to sell products but                 by media searching for new ways to make money.                Traditionally, media made money by selling subscriptions and advertising                 space. But these two key income sources are quickly drying up in the new                 world of online media. Journalist Mike France wisely takes notice of this                 change in an important article """"Journalism's Online Credibility Gap"""" from                 the 11 October 1999 issue of Business Week. France notes that subscription                 fees have not worked because """"Web surfers are used to getting content for                 free, and they have been reluctant to shell out any money for it"""".                 Advertising sales and their Internet incarnation in banner ads have also                 been a failure so far, France observes, because companies don't like                 paying a flat fee for online advertising since it's difficult to track the                 effectiveness of their marketing dollars. Instead, they only want to pay                 for actual sales leads, which can be easily monitored on the Web as                 readers' click from site to site.                Faced with the above situation, media companies have gone on the prowl                 for new ways to make money. This search underpins the emerging ubiquity of                 advertising: the fact that it is increasingly appearing everywhere. In the                 process, traditional boundaries between advertising and other societal                 institutions are being overrun by these media forces on the prowl for new               """"territory"""" to exploit.                That time when advertisements knew their place in the landscape of                 popular culture and confined themselves to just magazines or TV                 commercials is a fading memory. And today, as each of us is bombarded by                 thousands of ads each day, it is impossible to """"slam"""" the door and keep                 them out of our house as we could once slam the door in the face of the                 old door-to-door salesmen.                Of course you can find them on the matchbook cover of your favorite bar,                 on t-shirts sold at some roadside tourist trap or on those logo baseball                 caps you always pick up at trade shows. But now they have got a little                 more personal and stare at you over urinals in the men's room. They have                 even wedged themselves onto the narrow little bars at the check-out                 counter conveyer belts of supermarkets or onto the handles of gasoline                 pumps at filling stations. The list goes on and on. (No, this article is                 not an ad.)                Advertising and Entertainment               In advertising's march to ubiquity, two major boundaries have been                 crossed. They are crucial boundaries which greatly enhance advertising's                 search for the invisibility of ubiquity. Yet they are also largely                 invisible themselves. These are the boundaries separating advertising from                 entertainment and those separating advertising from journalism.                The incursion of advertising into entertainment is a result of the                 increasing merger of business and entertainment, a phenomenon pointed out                 in best-selling business books like Michael Wolf's Entertainment Economy                 and Joseph Pine's The Experience Economy. Wolf, a consultant for Viacom,                 Newscorp, and other media heavy-weights, argues business is becoming                 synonymous with entertainment: """"we have come to expect that we will be                 entertained all the time. Products and brands that deliver on this                 expectation are succeeding. Products that do not will disappear"""". And, in                 The Experience Economy, Pine notes the increasing need for businesses to                 provide entertaining experiences. """"Those businesses that relegate                 themselves to the diminishing world of goods and services will be rendered                 irrelevant. To avoid this fate, you must learn to stage a rich, compelling                 experience"""".                Yet entertainment, whether provided by businesses or the traditional                 entertainment industry, is increasingly weighted down with the """"baggage""""                 of advertising. In a large sense, entertainment is a form of new media                 that carries ads. Increasingly, this seems to be the overriding purpose of                 entertainment.                Once, not long ago, when ads were simple and confined, entertainment was                 also simple and its purpose was to entertain rather than to sell. There                 was money enough in packed movie houses or full theme parks to make a                 healthy profit. But all this has changed with advertising's ubiquity.                Like media corporations searching for new revenue streams, the                 entertainment industry has responded to flat growth by finding new ways to                 squeeze money out of entertainment content. Films now feature products in                 paid for scenes and most forms of entertainment use product tie-ins to                 other areas such as retail stores or fast-food restaurants. Also popular                 with the entertainment industry is what might be termed the """"versioning""""                 of entertainment products into various sub-species where entertainment                 content is transformed into other media so it can be sold more than once.                 A film may not make a profit on just the theatrical release but there is a                 good chance it doesn't matter because it stands to make a profit in video                 rentals.                Advertising and Journalism               The merger of advertising and entertainment goes a long way towards a                 world of ubiquitous advertising. Yet the merger of advertising and                 journalism is the real """"promised land"""" in the evolution of ubiquitous                 advertising. This fundamental shift in the way news media make money                 provides the final frontier to be conquered by advertising, a final               """"promised land"""" for advertising. As Mike France observes in Business Week,                 this merger """"could potentially change the way they cover the news. The                 more the press gets in the business of hawking products, the harder it                 will be to criticize those goods -- and the companies making them"""".                Of course, there is that persistent myth, perpetuated by news                 organisations that they attempt to preserve editorial independence by                 keeping the institutions they cover and their advertisers at arm's length.                 But this is proving more and more difficult, particularly for online                 media. Observers like France have pointed out a number of reasons for                 this. One is the growth of ads in news media that look more like editorial                 content than ads. While long-standing ethical rules bar magazines and                 newspapers from printing advertisements that look like editorial copy,                 these rules become fuzzy for many online publications. Another reason                 making it difficult to separate advertising from journalism is the growing                 merger and consolidation of media corporations. Fewer and fewer                 corporations control more and more entertainment, news and ultimately                 advertising. It becomes difficult for a journalist to criticise a product                 when it has a connection to the large media conglomerate the journalist                 works for.                Traditionally, it has been rare for media corporations to make direct                 investments in the corporations they cover. However, as Mike France notes,                 CNBC crossed this line when it acquired a stake in Archipelago in                 September 1999. CNBC, which runs a business-news Website, acquired a 12.4%                 stake in Archipelago Holdings, an electronic communications network for                 trading stock. Long-term plans are likely to include allowing visitors to                 cnbc.com to link directly to Archipelago. That means CNBC could be in the                 awkward position of both providing coverage of online trading and                 profiting from it. France adds that other business news outlets, such as                 Dow Jones (DJ), Reuters, and Bloomberg, already have indirect ties to                 their own electronic stock-trading networks.                And, in news organisations, a popular method of cutting down on the                 expense of paying journalists for content is the growing practice of                 accepting advertiser written content or """"sponsored edit"""" stories. The                 confusion to readers violates the spirit of a long-standing American                 Society of Magazine Editors (ASME) rule prohibiting advertisements with               """"an editorial appearance"""". But as France notes, this practice is thriving                 online. This change happens in ever so subtle ways. """"A bit of puffery                 inserted here,"""" notes France, """"a negative adjective deleted there -- it                 doesn't take a lot to turn a review or story about, say, smart phones,                 into something approaching highbrow ad copy"""". He offers an example in                 forbes.com whose Microsoft ads could easily be mistaken for staff-written                 articles.                Media critic James Fallows points out that consumers have been swift to                 discipline sites that are caught acting unethically and using """"sponsored                 edits"""". He notes that when it was revealed that amazon.com was taking fees                 of up to $10,000 for books that it labelled as """"destined for greatness"""",                 its customers were outraged, and the company quickly agreed to disclose                 future promotional payments.                Unfortunately, though, the lesson episodes like these teach online                 companies like Amazon centres around more effective ways to be less               """"revealing"""" rather than abstention from the practice of """"sponsored edits"""".                France reminds us that journalism is built on trust. In the age of the                 Internet, though, trust is quickly becoming an elusive quality. He writes               """"as magazines, newspapers, radio stations, and television networks rush to                 colonize the Internet, the Great Wall between content and commerce is                 beginning to erode"""". In the end, he ponders whether there is an                 irrevocable conflict between e-commerce and ethical journalism. When you                 can't trust journalists to be ethical, just who can you trust?                Transaction Fees &amp; Affiliate Programs - Advertising's Final Promised Land?               The engine driving the growing ubiquity of advertising, though, is not                 the increasing merger of advertising with other industries (like                 entertainment and journalism) but rather a new business model of online                 commerce and Internet technology called transaction fees.                This emerging and potentially dominant Internet e-commerce technology                 provides for the ability to track transactions electronically on Websites                 and to garner transaction fees. Through these fees, many media Websites                 take a percentage of payment through online product sales. In effect, a                 media site becomes one pervasive direct mail ad for every product                 mentioned on its site. This of course puts them in a much closer economic                 partnership with advertisers than is the case with traditional fixed-rate                 ads where there is little connection between product sales and the                 advertising media carrying them.                Transaction fees are the new online version of direct marketing, the                 emerging Internet technology for their application is one of the great                 economic driving forces of the entire Internet commerce apparatus. The                 promise of transaction fees is that a number of people, besides product                 manufacturers and advertisers, might gain a percentage of profit from                 selling products via hypertext links. Once upon a time, the manufacturer                 of a product was the one that gained (or lost) from marketing it. Now,                 however, there is the possibility that journalists, news organisations and                 entertainment companies might also gain from marketing via transaction                 fees.                The spread of transaction fees outside media into the general population                 provides an even greater boost to the growing ubiquity of advertising.                 This is done through the handmaiden of media transaction fees: """"affiliate                 programs"""" for the general populace. Through the growing magic of Internet                 technology, it becomes possible for all of us to earn money through                 affiliate program links to products and transaction fee percentages in the                 sale of these products.                Given this scenario, it is not surprising that advertisers are most                 likely to increasingly pressure media Websites to support themselves with                 e-commerce transaction fees. Charles Li, Senior Analyst for New Media at                 Forrester Research, estimates that by the year 2003, media sites will                 receive $25 billion in revenue from transaction fees, compared with $17                 billion from ads and $5 billion from subscriptions.                The possibility is great that all media will become like great direct                 response advertisements taking a transaction fee percentage for anything                 sold on their sites. And there is the more dangerous possibility that all                 of us will become the new """"promised land"""" for a ubiquitous advertising.                 All of us will have some cut in selling somebody else's product. When this                 happens and there is a direct economic incentive for all of us to say nice                 things about products, what is the need and importance of subliminal                 techniques and methods creating advertising based on images which try to                 trick us into buying things?                A Society Without Critics?               It is for these reasons that criticism and straight news are becoming an                 increasingly endangered species. Everyone has to eat but what happens when                 one can no longer make meal money by criticising current culture?                Cultural critics become a dying breed. There is no money in criticism                 because it is based around disconnection rather than connection to                 products. No links to products or Websites are involved here. Critics are                 becoming lonely icebergs floating in the middle of a cyber-sea of                 transaction fees, watching everyone else (except themselves) make money on                 transaction fees. The subliminal focus of the current consultancies is                 little more than a repackaging of an old theme discovered long ago by                 Vance Packard. But the growing """"everywhereness"""" and """"everyoneness"""" of                 modern advertising through transaction fees may mark the beginning of a                 revolutionary new era. Everyone might become their own """"brand"""", a point                 well made in Tim Peters's article """"A Brand Called You"""".                Media critic James Fallows is somewhat optimistic that there still may                 remain """"niche"""" markets for truthful information and honest cultural                 criticism. He suggests that surely people looking for mortgages, voting                 for a politician, or trying to decide what movie to see will continue to                 need unbiased information to help them make decisions. But one must ask                 what happens when a number of people have some """"affiliate"""" relationship                 with suggesting particular movies, politicians or mortgages?                Orville Schell, dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the                 University of California at Berkeley, has summarised this growing ubiquity                 of advertising in a rather simple and elegant manner saying """"at a certain                 point, people won't be able to differentiate between what's trustworthy                 and what isn't"""". Over the long run, this loss of credibility could have a                 corrosive effect on society in general -- especially given the media's                 importance as a political, cultural, and economic watchdog. Schell warns,               """"if people don't trust their information, it's not much better than a                 Marxist-Leninist society"""".                Yet, will we be able to realise this simple fact when we all become types                 of Marxists and Leninists? Still, there is the great challenge to America                 to learn how to utilise transaction fees in a democratic manner. In                 effect, a combination of the technological promise of the new economy with                 that old promise, and perhaps even myth, of a democratic America. America                 stands on the verge of a great threshold and challenge in the growing                 ubiquity of advertising. In a way, as with most great opportunities or                 threats, this challenge centres on a peculiar paradox. On the one hand,                 there is the promise of the emerging Internet business model and its                 centre around the technology of transaction fees. At the same time, there                 is the threat posed by transaction fees to America's democratic society in                 the early years of the new millennium.                Yes, once upon a time, not very long ago, advertisements were easy to                 recognise and also knew their place in the landscape of popular culture.                 Their greatest, yet silent, evolution (especially in the age of the                 Internet) has really been in their spread into all areas of culture rather                 than in methods of trickery and deceit. Now, it is more difficult to slam                 that front door in the face of that old door-to-door salesman. Or toss                 that magazine and its ad aside, or switch off commercials on television.                 We have become that door-to-door salesman, that magazine ad, that                 television commercial. The current cultural landscape takes on some of the                 characteristics of the theme of that old science fiction movie The                 Invasion of the Body Snatchers. A current advertising campaign from RJ                 Reynolds has a humorous take on the current zeitgeist fad of alien                 abduction with copy reading """"if aliens are smart enough to travel through                 space then why do they keep abducting the dumbest people on earth?""""                One might add that when Americans allow advertising to travel through all                 our space, perhaps we all become the dumbest people on earth, abducted by                 a new alien culture so far away from a simplistic nostalgia of yesterday.

Since the early 1900s, the trends of new media both displacing magazines as well as spurring magazine sales and introductions are evident through the introduction of feature films, sound recordings, radio, television, computers, and the World Wide Web. New media have a tendency to both displace magazines, but also cause increasing specialization. The overriding goal of this paper is to provide a perspective for magazine publishers and scholars as they address the increasing penetration of the World Wide Web.","",""

In this paper, I want to inquire into the relation between intermedia and what has, for some years now, been termed simply ’new media’. While some writers have objected to this term, pointing to the continuities between newer media and earlier media forms, the present context brings other resonances to the fore, including the way in which intermedia forms become ’established’ and familiar. Dick Higgins’ proposal to continually ’follow one’s nose’ out of such established forms ’towards trying the frontiers of this or that’, suggests that intermedia works themselves constitute, at least for a time, new media.~ But what about the reverse scenario: is new media intermedia?","",""
"2002","Passages Across Thresholds"," This essay examines concepts of multimodality, intermediality and intertextuality within a wider cultural context of boundaries and transgressions. Earlier concepts of passages and thresholds may enrich today's understanding of recent mixtures and flows across borders within contemporary digital media culture. Charting traces from Walter Benjamin's Arcades Project through the borderlands of a contemporary shopping centre, this study explores late modern thinking about flows across borders in media culture and cultural studies, in which contextualising, dialogic and critical interpretation assume crucial functions. The combination of 'multi' and 'inter' stresses plurality and interrelations rather than monolithic and essentialist reductions. The first section presents sociological, anthropological and philosophical ideas of passages and borderlands. The second part outlines important kinds of media passages through real and virtual spaces. The third segment discusses interrelations between multi- and inter-concepts that have taken on a crucial significance for cultural theory, suggesting new ways of understanding their mutual connections.

"2003","The MIT Media Lab: techno dream factory or alienation as a way of life?"," This article critically analyses the work and the ethos of the MIT Media Lab in the context of globalizing capital and the ICT revolution. It argues that the Media Lab owes its tremendous success in part to the public relations strategies of its founder, Nicholas Negroponte, and to the very real need for the Lab’s products to ‘fill in the gaps’ left by the broad and irregular dynamics of globalization and the ICT revolution. The Media Lab and its research products insert information technologies into the interstices of cultural, social and temporal life, stitching together an ‘informational ecology’ of interconnectivity. This ecology has its own temporality, a synchronized ‘chronoscopic’ temporality or real-time duration that obliterates the many other temporalities that interpenetrate our lives and give them meaning. It is argued the ‘informational ecology’ of interconnectivity constructed by the Media Lab and many other emulative ‘start-ups’, lead not to a world of ‘diversity’ as Negropontean philosophy insists, but a one-dimensional world of alienation.

"2003","Myth and Realities of New Media Technology"," This article takes a critical look at how new media technology is used as both a medium of instruction as well as a subject of instruction in educational institutions. It tries to sieve the realities of techno-enhanced education from its hype and in the process discusses the sociocultural and economic implications of such a novel idea in a digitally divided global economy. It uses results gathered from a study that evaluated students' performances in physical and virtual classroom environments as a case study. The research came out with the following summary: the online/virtual classroom environment is a useful complement and not a substitute to physical classroom interaction. New media technology has a lot to offer society in flexible delivery of educational materials but it is still at the experimental stage and more work is needed to extract its full potential. It is, however, still predominantly a Western preserve. ","",""
"2003","Questions of Knowledge in Australian Media Education"," This article draws on the work of Foucault to construct a history of the invention and introduction of media studies in the Australian context through the analysis of two of its epistemological regimes: audience studies and media production. In so doing, it challenges contemporary assumptions about the subject's foundations, purposes, and achievements, most significant the belief that the story of media education is a story of seamless progress marked by the movement from a protectionist philosophy to one that approaches the media as a representational system. Questioning the normative, taken-for-granted history and conduct of a school subject does not necessarily mean that a subject will, or should, be changed. However, there exists at least the opportunity to bring about change when current practices can be located and understood in terms of historical contingency rather than the more common change and reform rhetoric of curriculum developers.

"2004","What’s Changed about New Media? Introduction to the Fifth                Anniversary Issue of New Media &amp; Society","The inaugural issue of new media & society, which was published in spring 1999, launched the journal with a special section of short articles under the title: ‘What’s New About New Media?’ The contributors provided wide-ranging and sometimes divergent answers to the question. However, a common theme among the articles was uncertainty, a sense that it was still early days for ‘new media’, particularly the internet. Until new media technologies became more broadly available and stable, many authors were reluctant to make any general claims about their development or consequences. Five years ago, although the internet had long been established, the world wide web was still relatively new. Web browsers had begun to change the ways in which internet users could interact or seek information online. The dot.com boom and the ‘new economy’, fuelled by visions of ubiquitous ecommerce and new forms of work, leisure, and wealth, was well underway in developed nations. Economic and cultural globalization seemed an inescapable outcome of the growth of networked telecommunications, computing, and traditional media. Concerns about the digital divide were just beginning to be heard, and the ‘millennium bug’ seemed to be the most serious technological or security threat looming on the horizon. Over a year ago, the editors of new media & society agreed that the fifth anniversary issue would be an ideal opportunity to reflect on progress in new media research, scholarship, and creative work since the journal began. new media & society","",""
"2004","Media Design: New and Improved without the New","First, a caveat. The term ‘new media design’ has the stink of the dot com bubble about it. New media designers were the web wizards and interface gurus zipping down no-collar, hierarchy-free corridors on Razor scooters, grabbing double tall mocha lattes on the way to inventing the new, new thing. New media designers wore black, had goofy Pez dispensers on their desks, and laughed at the clueless squares in suits who were their clients. They chattered away about XML databases, NASDAQ, peer-to-peer (P2P), and Pets.com while watching their option packages and planning their ‘posteconomic’ futures. Or so went the fairy tale part of this story, where anyone with the ability to write HTML code and build a webpage labeled him or herself a ‘designer’. Then, poof . . . it was all over. Second, a reminder. Market euphorias and economic dystopias come and go, but where we are in the cycle does not in any way diminish the incredible impact that digital technologies and electronic networks have had on design. It is only after the new economy utopianism has crashed that we can begin to see the transformations for what they are. Any discussion about the impact of computer-inflected media on the design disciplines over the past five years should be situated within the move from information technologies (IT) to information technologies and creative practices (ITCP) (Mitchell, et al., 2003) This shift of emphasis indicates a healthy maturation from the 1990s focus on communication infrastructure to the 21st century’s more encompassing interests in the form and content of what is actually being communicated. In this context, concentrating on ‘new’ media design has also evolved to the point that the concentration on novelty inherent in the term ‘new’ is less productive than talking about media design in a broader socio-economic context. What more than two decades of digital inflection have brought to the design fields is a comprehensive infusion of information density and transmedia connectivity. new media & society","",""
"2004","Pushing at the Boundaries of New Media Studies","One of my first pieces of research in what we know now as ‘new media studies’ was an ethnographic investigation of a group of women who were trying to build and sustain a social network using the early discussion list programmes and web interfaces. Much of the data that I collected was as much to do with the battles involved in representing same-sex and nonmainstream sexualities in the increasingly hostile politics of North America, as it was about the struggles for access to online resources. When I began my work I was rather naively tempted to think of my fieldsite as being ‘in cyberspace’ and my participants as constituting a ‘virtual community’. That was in 1993, and one of the successes of new media studies since then has been to problematize such assumptions, both theoretically and through empirical research. Contemporary work shows that it is tricky to divide the ‘virtual’ from the ‘real’ in any simplistic way. We no longer take for granted that our fieldsites are located within one undifferentiated global network, or that access to the hardware is the same as participating in the network society. However, in selecting books for this review, I have been reflecting on the extent to which new media studies has still failed to think through the importance of non-normative identities. Certainly there are some excellent articles and monographs. Nevertheless, a researcher just setting out in the field would be hard pressed to find any body of work which worked through the epistemological and methodological implications of the multiplicities, incongruities and partialities of knowledge outside mainstream social groups and cultural locations, even though such thinking has been of central importance in allied disciplines such as sociology and cultural studies. Therefore, this review article will focus on the strengths of two approaches to new media – material culture studies and feminist technoscience studies – new media & society","",""
"2004","The natural life cycle of new media evolution"," This article analyzes the evolution of the internet, with special emphasis on its impact on older media in their struggle to survive. The analysis is based on a 6-stage, natural life cycle model of new media evolution, comprising birth (technical invention), penetration, growth, maturity, self-defense, and adaptation, convergence or obsolescence. Our universal model melds several elements of previous theories and analyses from disparate fields such as media history, marketing, technological diffusion and convergence, while adding a few new aspects as well. The model’s three contributions lie in expanding the scope –quantitatively and qualitatively –of new media’s development stages (beyond the three or four stages noted by others); emphasizing the interaction and struggle between old and new media; and analyzing ‘functional-life after appliance-death’of media transformed/co-opted into something old/new. Applying this model to the internet enables us to better understand its future evolution and the survival chances of older mass media. ","",""
"2005","Digital Media and Disciplinarity","This article asks two related questions: Is digital media studies a discipline, and should scholars within the field desire to move toward disciplinarity? Drawing on the writings of Michel Foucualt and Pierre Bourdieu, as well as several Anglo-American cultural studies of disciplinarity, the essay argues that digital media studies has not yet constituted a truly novel scholarly discourse. Because of that, our reasons for disciplinizing—to the extent that it is possible to choose to become a discipline—would be largely strategic. Given that the field is already successfully reproducing itself, the symbolic benefits of becoming a discipline are relatively limited, and such a move would also have significant intellectual costs.","",""
"2005","Who Wants to Be a Discipline?","In contemporary times, two primary motivations have driven academics to attempt to form new intellectual disciplines. The first motivation is intrinsic to the subject matter at issue: Either old disciplinary questions need to be examined in new ways (as in the creation of sociolinguistics out of linguistics and sociology) or the field itself is novel (for example, computer science). The second motivation is more political: Unlike “areas of inquiry,” “fields of study,” or “tools of research,” new disciplines (e.g., cognitive science) often command significant academic real estate and sizable budgets. This essay considers several case studies in which potential academic disciplines have emerged—or failed to do so. The author suggests that in their attempts to determine what formal status they wish their research to hold, Internet scholars must carefully differentiate between the nature of their intellectual enterprise and legitimate professional desire for academic turf.","",""
"2006","Optimization and Its Alternative in Media Choice: A Model of Reliance on Social-Influence Processes","In the reconciliation of rational-choice and social-influence approaches to media choice offered here, the choice process is decomposed into two subprocesses. In the first subprocess—that of rational choice—decisional ambiguity frustrates complete optimization. Optimization is partial, yielding a set of effectively interchangeable media alternatives over which the user is indecisive. In the second subprocess—that of social influence—imitation, deference, and other cues act on the set of interchangeables, yielding a single ultimate choice. If in the social-influence subprocess there are benefits to coordinating with others, group choice crystallizes around a single media alternative. If these benefits are absent, individual choice remains idiosyncratic, with each decision maker making random choices within the set of interchangeables. In organizational life, media choice transpires sequentially, with each choice conditioning a succeeding one. In its dynamic form, the present model explicitly incorporates such sequential environments: The twofold choice process transpires iteratively within individual decision sites (in the multiple purchasing decisions of a committee, for example) and sequentially across decision sites (from committee to individual, for example). The model generates considerable empirical implications. As decisional ambiguity grows, the rational-choice component of the choice process shrinks, implying upper-bound conditions for the explanatory power of rational-choice statistical models.","",""

I also argue, however, that writing studies scholars should not rely solely on these rubrics because they function in designerly, not readerly, ways that would help readers understand a text's rhetorical situation. I apply the rubrics to a new media text, ‘While Chopping Red Peppers’ (Ankerson and Sapnar, 2000), to show their limited use and to suggest that while these multimodal and new media theories have a place in writing studies, we need better methods and/or reading heuristics in order to interpret (and teach) such works.

"2006","Facsimile"," Scholars have expressed increasing interest in understanding the conceptual and technological roots of contemporary new media. Yet, to date, accounts of the history of media technologies have ignored the rise, fall, and transformation of one innovation whose applications in the first half of the 20th century parallel recent developments in WiFi internet, mobile telephony, telework, telemedicine, online publishing, and video-on-demand. This article introduces scholars to the history of the fax machine, and suggests how the technology provides an important comparison point for analyzing technological developments, past and present. The conclusion explores how positioning this innovation more prominently within the common disciplinary wisdom about the rise of new media opens a door for scholars to deliberate about the historiographical boundaries of the ‘old media studies’ in the era of new media: what technological systems have received disproportionate attention, and what new histories of old media might be written.

The site has become a powerful force in the U.S. media sphere and its founder was named one of Time Magazine’s most influential people in 2006.  In existence for more than a decade, the Drudge Report makes an ideal case study for examining the “new media versus old media” argument.  How dependent is such a “new media” aggregator on the “old media” it draws from, and how does it find the breaking stories it has built its reputation on?  A cross-section of analytical techniques is used to demonstrate how to profile a news Web site, and finds that the Drudge Report relies heavily on wire services and obscure news outlets to find the small stories that will break large tomorrow and is highly dependant on the mainstream “old media” sites it draws from.","",""

"2010","Extending knowledge domains for new media education: integrating interaction design theory and methods"," Over the last 10 years, new media has ascended to a prominent place in many fields that utilize communication technologies. At the same time, new media education has evolved in such a way that students are often not prepared to understand the social context of new media design and development. To produce new media professionals who are adequately prepared to meet the needs of an online hyper-social marketplace, new media curricula must reflect those human-centered theories and practices found within the discipline of interaction design, in addition to formal new media technical knowledge. The authors propose a new three-by-three theoretical model, referred to as Knowledge-Operators-and-Domains (KOD). Applying this model suggests an approach that extends the practical boundaries of new media to include a range of human-centered theories and practices, such as ethnography and usability-based studies.

"2010","There’s no ‘I’ in information: some naysayings for new media studies"," The proliferation of empirical inquiries into concepts such as ‘interactivity’ and ‘virtual reality’ has been at the expense of the theoretical (or metadiscursive) in new media studies. The greatest consequence of empiricism’s inductive hierarchies is an ontological negation of the body, the subject in corporeal space. Far from producing a ‘new’ subjectivity, such a negation only reifies a subject’s disembodiment and wholly abstracts the space around them. Examining the writings of many critics and theorists, most significantly Mark Hansen and the spatial theory of Henri Lefebvre, this argument shows that the theoretical must first and foremost be held accountable to itself if the ‘new’ is to be realized. The stakes in this piece are the subject’s embodiment and very ability to articulate itself as ‘I’ in an information-saturated age that challenges the distinction between virtuality and corporeality, a challenge that conceptually bankrupts acts of distinction and differentiation.

"2011","Making an Impact: Cultural Studies, Media and Contemporary Work","Cultural Studies has tended to prioritise the domain of leisure and consumption over work as an area for meaning making, in many ways defining everyday life in opposition to work. Greg Noble, a cultural researcher who examined work in the context of the early computerisation of Australian universities made the point that """"discussions of everyday life often make the mistake of assuming that everyday life equates with home and family life, or leisure"""" (87).  This article argues for the need within Cultural Studies to focus on work and media as a research area of everyday life. With the growth of flexible and creative labour and the widespread uptake of an array of new media technologies used for work, traditional ways to identify and measure the space and time of work have become increasingly flawed, with implications for how we account for work and negotiate its boundaries. New approaches are needed to address the complex media environments and technological practices that are an increasing part of contemporary working life.   Cultural Studies can make a significant impact towards this research agenda by offering new ways to analyse the complex interrelations of space, time and technology in everyday work practice. To further this goal, a new material practices account of work termed Officing is introduced, developed through my doctoral research on professionals' daily use of information and communication technology (ICT). This approach builds on the key cultural concepts of """"bricolage"""" and """"appropriation"""" combined with the idea of """"articulation work"""" proposed by Anselm Strauss, to support the analysis of the office workplace as a contingent and provisional arrangement or process.   Officing has a number of benefits as a framework for analysing the nature of work in a highly mediated world. Highlighting the labour that goes into stabilising work platforms makes it possible to assess the claims of productivity and improved work-life balance brought about by new mobile media technologies; to identify previously unidentified sources of time pressure, overwork and intensification and ultimately, to contribute to the design of more sustainable work environments.  The Turn Away from Work  Work held a central position in social and cultural analysis in the first half of the twentieth century but as Strangleman observed, there was a marked shift away from the study of work from the mid 1970s (3.1). Much of the impulse for this shift came from critiques of the over-emphasis on relations of production and the workplace as the main source of meaning and value (5.1). In line with this position, feminist researchers challenged the traditional division of labour into paid and unpaid work, arguing that this division sustained the false perception of domestic work as non-productive (cf. Delphy; Folbre). Accompanying these critiques were significant changes in work itself, as traditional jobs literally began to disappear with the decline of manufacturing in industrialised countries (6.1).   With the turn away from work in academia and the changes in the nature of work, attention shifted to the realm of the market and consumption. One of the important contributions of Cultural Studies has been the focus on the role of the consumer in driving social and technological change and processes of identity formation. Yet, it is a major problem that work is largely marginalised in cultural research of everyday life, especially since, in most industrialised nations, we are working in new ways, in rapidly changing conditions and more than ever before.  Research shows that in Australia there has been a steady increase in the average hours of paid work and Australians are working harder (cf. Watson, Buchanan, Campbell and Briggs; Edwards and Wajcman). In the 2008 Australian Work and Life Index (AWALI) Skinner and Pocock found around 55 per cent of employees frequently felt rushed or pressed for time and this was associated with long working hours, work overload and an overall poor work–life interaction (8).   These trends have coincided with long-term changes in the type and location of work. In Australia, like many other developed countries, information-based occupations have taken over manufacturing jobs and there has been an increase in part-time and casual work (cf. Watson et al.). Many employees now conduct work outside of the traditional workplace, with the ABS reporting that in 2008, 24 per cent of employees worked at least some hours at home.   Many social analysts have explained the rise of casual and flexible labour as related to the transition to global capitalism driven by the expansion of networked information processes (cf. Castells; Van Dijk). This shift is not simply that more workers are producing ideas and information but that the previously separated spheres of production and consumption have blurred (cf. Ritzer and Jurgenson). With this, entirely new industries have sprung up, predicated on the often unpaid for creative labour of individuals, including users of media technologies.  A growing chorus of writers are now pointing out that a fragmented, polarised and complex picture is emerging of this so-called """"new economy"""", with significant implications for the quality of work (cf. Edwards and Wajcman; Fudge and Owens; Huws). Indeed, some claim that new conditions of insecure and poor quality employment or """"precarious work"""" are fast becoming the norm. Moreover, this longer-term pattern runs parallel to the production of a multitude of new mobile media technologies, first taken up by professionals and then by the mainstream, challenging the notion that activities are bound to any particular place or time.  Reinvigorating Work in Social and Cultural Analysis  There are moves to reposition social and cultural analysis to respond to these various trends. Work-life balance is an example of a research and policy area that has emerged since the 1990s. The boundary between the household and the outside world has also been subject to scrutiny by cultural researchers, and these critically examine the intersection between work and consumption, gender and care (cf. Nippert-Eng; Sorenson and Lie; Noble and Lupton, """"Consuming"""" and """"Mine""""; Lally). These responses are examples of a shift away from what Urry has dubbed """"structures and stable organisations"""" to a concern with flows, movements and the blurring of boundaries between life spheres (5). In a similar vein, researchers recently have proposed alternative ways to describe the changing times and places of employment. In their study of UK professionals, Felstead, Jewson and Walters proposed a model of """"plural workscapes"""" to explain a major shift in the spatial organisation of work (23). Mobility theorists Sheller and Urry have called for the need to """"develop a more dynamic conceptualisation of the fluidities and mobilities that have increasingly hybridised the public and private"""" (113).   All of this literature has reinforced a growing concern that in the face of new patterns of production and consumption and with the rise of complex media environments, traditional models and measures of space and time are inadequate to account for contemporary work. Analyses that rely on conventional measures of work based on hourly units clearly point to an increase in the volume of work, the speed of work and to the collision (cf. Pocock) of work and life but fall down in accounting for the complex and often contradictory role of technology. Media technologies are """"Janus-faced"""" as Michael Arnold has suggested, referring to the two-faced Roman god to foreground the contradictory effects at the centre of all technologies (232). Wajcman notes this paradox in her research on mobile media and time, pointing out that mobile phones are just as likely to """"save"""" time as to """"consume"""" it (15).   It was precisely this problematic of the complex interactions of the space, time and technology of work that was at stake in my research on the daily use of ICT by professional workers. In the context of changes to the location, activity and meaning of work, and with the multiplying array of old and new media technologies used by workers, how can the boundary and scope of work be determined? What are the implications of these shifting grounds for the experience and quality of work?   Officing: A Material Practices Account of Office Work  In the remaining article I introduce some of the key ideas and principles of a material practices account developed in my PhD, Officing: Professionals' Daily ICT Use and the Changing Space and Time of Work. This research took place between 2006 and 2007 focusing in-depth on the daily technology practices of twenty professional workers in a municipal council in Sydney and a unit of a global telecommunication company taking part in a trial of a new smart phone.   Officing builds on efforts to develop a more accurate account of the space and time of work bringing into play the complex and highly mediated environment in which work takes place. It extends more recent practice-based, actor-network and cultural approaches that have, for some time, been moving towards a more co-constitutive and process-oriented approach to media and technology in society.  Turning first to """"bricolage"""" from the French bricole meaning something small and handmade, bricolage refers to the ways that individuals and groups borrow from existing cultural forms and meanings to create new uses, meanings and identities. Initially proposed by Levi-Strauss and then taken up by de Certeau, bricolage has been a useful concept within subculture and lifestyle studies to reveal the creative work performed on signs and meaning systems in forming cultural identities (cf. O'Sullivan et al.).   Bricolage is also an important concept for understanding how meanings and uses are inscribed into forms in use rather than being read or activated off their design. This is the process of appropriation, through which both the object and the person are mutually shaped and users gain a sense of control and ownership (cf. Noble and Lupton; Lally; Silverstone and Haddon). The concept of bricolage highlights the improvisational qualities of appropriation and its status as work. A bricoleur is thus a person who constructs new meanings and forms by drawing on and assembling a wide range of resources at hand, sourced from multiple spheres of life.   One of the problems with how bricolage and appropriation has been applied to date, notwithstanding the priority given to the domestic sphere, is the tendency to grant individuals and collectives too much control to stabilise the meanings and purposes of technologies. This problem is evident in the research drawing on the framework of """"domestication"""" (cf. Silverstone and Haddon). In practice, the sheer volume of technologically-related issues encountered on a daily basis and the accompanying sense of frustration indicates there is no inevitable drift towards stability, nor are problems merely aberrational or trivial. Instead, daily limits to agency and attempts to overcome these are points at which meanings as well as uses are re-articulated and potentially re-invented.   This is where """"articulation work"""" comes in. Initially put forward by Anselm Strauss in 1985, articulation work has become an established analytical tool for informing technology design processes in such fields as Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Workplace Studies. In these, articulation work is narrowly defined to refer to the real time activities of cooperative work. It includes dealing with contingencies, keeping technologies and systems working and making adjustments to accommodate for problems (Suchman """"Supporting"""", 407).   In combination with naturalistic investigations, this concept has facilitated engagement with the increasingly complex technological and media environments of work. It has been a powerful tool for highlighting practices deemed unimportant but which are nevertheless crucial for getting work done. Articulation work, however, has the potential to be applied in a broader sense to explain the significance of the instability of technologies and the efforts to overcome these as transformative in themselves, part of the ongoing process of appropriation that goes well beyond individual tasks or technologies.  With clear correspondences to actor-network theory, this expanded definition provides the basis for a new understanding of the office as a temporary and provisional condition of stability achieved through the daily creative and improvisational activities of workers. The office, then, is dependent on and inextricably bound up in its ongoing articulation and crucially, is not bound to a particular place or time.   In the context of the large-scale transformations in work already discussed, this expanded definition of articulation work helps to; firstly, address how work is re-organised and re-rationalised through changes to the material conditions of work; secondly, identify the ongoing articulations that this entails and thirdly; understand the role of these articulations in the construction of the space and time of work. This expanded definition is achieved in the newly developed concept of officing.   Officing describes a form of labour directed towards the production of a stable office platform. Significantly, one of the main characteristics of this work is that it often goes undetected by organisations as well as by the workers that perform it. As explained later, its """"invisibility"""" is in part a function of its embodiment but also relates to the boundless nature of officing, taking place both inside and outside the workplace, in or out of work time.  Officing is made up of a set of interwoven activities of three main types: connecting, synchronising and configuring. Connecting can be understood as aligning technical and social relations for the performance of work at a set time. Synchronising brings together and coordinates different times and temporal demands, for example, the time of """"work"""" with """"life"""" or the time """"out in the field"""" with time """"in the workplace"""". Configuring prepares the space of work, making a single technology or media environment work to some planned action or existing pattern of activity.  To give an example of connecting: in the Citizens' Service Centre of the Council, Danielle's morning rituals involved a series of connections even before her work of advising customers begins:  My day: get in, sit down, turn on the computer and then slowly open each software program that I will need to use…turn on the phone, key in my password, turn on the headphones and sit there and wait for the calls! (Humphry Officing, 123)  These connections not only set up and initiate the performance of work but also mark Danielle's presence in her office. Through these activities, which in practice overlap and blur, the space and time of the office comes to appear as a somewhat separate and mostly invisible structure or infrastructure.  The work that goes into making the office stable takes place around the boundary of work with implications for how this boundary is constituted. These efforts do not cluster around boundaries in any simple sense but become part of the process of boundary making, contributing to the construction of categories such as """"work"""" and """"life"""". So, for example, for staff in the smart phone trial, the phone had become their main source of information and communication. Turning their smart phone off, or losing connectivity had ramifications that cascaded throughout their lifeworld. On the one hand, this lead to the breakdown of the distinction between """"work"""" and """"life"""" and a sense of """"ever-presence"""", requiring constant and vigilant """"boundary work"""" (cf. Nippert-Eng). On the other hand, this same state also enabled workers to respond to demands in their own time and across multiple boundaries, giving workers a sense of flexibility, control and of being """"in sync"""".  Connecting, configuring and synchronising are activities performed by bodies, producing an embodied transformation. In the tradition of phenomenology, most notably in the works of Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty and more recently Ihde, embodiment is used to explain the relationship between subjects and objects. This concept has since been developed to be understood as not residing in the body but as spread through social, material and discursive arrangements (cf. Haraway, """"Situated"""" and Simians; Henke; Suchman, """"Figuring"""").   Tracing efforts towards making the office stable is thus a way of uncovering how the body, as a constitutive part of a larger arrangement or network, is formed through embodiment, how it gains its competencies, social meanings and ultimately, how workers gain a sense of what it means to be a professional. So, in the smart phone trial, staff managed their connections by replying immediately to their voice, text and data messages. This immediacy not only acted as proof of their presence in the office. It also signalled their commitment to their office: their active participation and value to the organisation and their readiness to perform when called on.   Importantly, this embodied transformation also helps to explain how officing becomes an example of """"invisible work"""" (cf. Star and Strauss). Acts of connecting, synchronising and configuring become constituted and forgotten in and through bodies, spaces and times. Through their repeated performance these acts become habits, a transparent means through which the environment of work is navigated in the form of skills and techniques, configurations and routines.  In conclusion, researching work in contemporary societies means confronting its marginalisation within cultural research and developing ways to comprehend and measure the interaction of space, time and the ever-multiplying array of media technologies. Officing provides a way to do this by shifting to an understanding of the workplace as a contingent product of work itself. The strength of this approach is that it highlights the creative and ongoing work of individuals on their media infrastructures. It also helps to identify and describe work activities that are not neatly contained in a workplace, thus adding to their invisibility.  The invisibility of these practices can have significant impacts on workers: magnifying feelings of time pressure and a need to work faster, longer and harder even as discrete technologies are utilised to save time. In this way, officing exposes some of the additional contributions to the changing experience and quality of work as well as to the construction of everyday domains.  Officing supports an evaluation of claims of productivity and work-life balance in relation to new media technologies. In the smart phone trial, contrary to an assumed increase in productivity, mobility of work was achieved at the expense of productivity. Making the mobile office stable—getting it up and running, keeping it working in changing environments and meeting expectations of speed and connectivity—took up time, resulting in an overall productivity loss and demanding more """"boundary work"""". In spite of their adaptability and flexibility, staff tended to overwork to counteract this loss. This represented a major shift in the burden of effort in the production of office forms away from the organisation and towards the individual.  Finally, though not addressed here in any detail, officing could conceivably have practical uses for designing more sustainable office environments that better support the work process and the balance of work and life. Thus, by accounting more accurately for the resource requirements of work, organisations can reduce the daily effort, space and time taken up by employees on their work environments. In any case, what is clear, is the ongoing need to continue a cultural research agenda on work—to address the connections between transformations in work and the myriad material practices that individuals perform in going about their daily work.

"2011","Special Section: New Media in International Contexts Introduction","Author(s): Horst, Heather A.; Wallis, Cara | Abstract: The study of the relationship between media and society has a long and varied history in the social sciences and the humanities.1 From the Frankfurt School’s theories of the culture industries and McLuhan’s focus on the relationship between the medium and the message to work on mediation, remediation, and the network society, media continue to be viewed as a driver and a lens for understanding social, economic, and political life. Indeed, the first wave of research on new media—particularly on the Internet—explored how access to networked forms of communication and information may lead to transformations in notions of community, identity, and the nature of being human (Castells, 2000; Van Dijk, 1991; Katz a Rice, 2002; Lievrouw a Livingstone, 2002; Miller a Slater, 2000; Rheingold, 1993; Turkle, 1995; Wellman a Haythornthwaite, 2002). Research on mobile phones, portable music players, and gaming (desktop and console) began to explore the embeddedness of new media in everyday life (Boellstorff, 2008; Castells, Qiu, Sey, a Fernandez-Ardevol, 2006; Horst a Miller, 2006; Ito, Okabe, a Matsuda, 2005; Katz a Aakhus, 2002; Ling, 2004; Ling a Donner, 2009). Exemplified by sites such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google, and others, the presence and participatory properties of new media in the contemporary moment represent an opportunity to reconsider the relationship between media and society in light of the changing media ecology. Are new media technologies appropriated in a similar fashion in what Thomas Friedman calls a “flat” world? Or do particular engagements with such technologies arise from specific local contexts? Even when new media technologies appear to be appropriated in a similar manner (on the surface, anyway), what local sociocultural, economic, or political factors contribute to such appropriations?","",""

"2011","Media life","Life in today’s liquid modern society is all about finding ways to deal with constant change, whether it is at home, at work or at play. Over the last few decades, these key areas of human existence have converged in and through our concurrent and continuous exposure to, use of and immersion in media, information and communication technologies. Research in countries as varied as the United States, Brazil, South Korea, The Netherlands and Finland consistently shows that more of our time gets spent using media, and that multi-tasking our media has become a regular feature of everyday life. It must be clear that media are not just types of technology and chunks of content we pick and choose from the world around us – a view that considers media as external agents affecting us in a myriad of ways. If anything, today we have to recognize how the uses and appropriations of media penetrate all aspects of contemporary life. This world is what Roger Silverstone (2007), Alex de Jong and Marc Schuilenburg (2006), and Sam Inkinen (1998) label a ‘mediapolis’: a comprehensively mediated public space where media underpin and overarch the experiences and expressions of everyday life. It is the point of this commentary to argue that such a perspective on life lived in, rather than with, media can and perhaps should be the ontological benchmark for a 21st-century media studies (Deuze, 2009). As media become pervasive and ubiquitous, forming the building blocks for our constant remix of the categories of everyday life (the public and the private, the local and the global, the individual and the collective), they become invisible – in the sense that, as Friedrich Kittler suggests, we become blind to that which shapes our lives the most. I propose that the key challenge of communication and media studies in the 21st century is, or will be, the disappearance of media. This is not a renewed claim for the kind of soft techno-determinism espoused in the work of Marshall McLuhan and Manuel Castells (Stalder, 2006: 153). The increasing invisibility of media is exemplified by their disappearing from consciousness when used intensely – by their logic of immediacy (Bolter and Grusin, 1996). In this process, the primary bias of media technologies – the fact that people can read, edit and write their codes, programs, protocols and texts – comes to shape our sense of reality. This is a reality that seems malleable as well, that could be manipulated, fast-forwarded, panned, scanned and zoomed in on (Stephens, 1998). In this statement of purpose, I follow the lead of David Harvey (1990), who signaled a","",""
"2011","Is there an expertise of production? The case of new media producers","The rise of Web 2.0 has prompted debates around the legitimacy and contributions of professional and amateur producers in fields such as journalism and popular culture, but it also begs the question: what is the substance of the expertise now under threat by the anonymous, amateur masses? This article extends recent debates in Science and Technology Studies (STS) on the validity of distinctions between expert and layperson to the field of new media. Drawing on a case study of a British production laboratory in educational technology, it shows how producers debate both the substance of production expertise and the reference group through which producers acquire expertise — is it technical professions that are relevant to the endeavour, or the target audience? The article stresses the latter and argues that opportunity, rather than ability, is key in the mobilization of knowledge in production, thus calling into question the distinction between expert and amateur producers.","",""

Hype also well expresses the cynicism and backlash that are indigenous to this communication environment, and its consideration is a necessary step toward explaining and contending with this environment. I draw examples of hype primarily from the world of entertainment and popular culture, with specific attention to popular music.","",""

"2012","The unseen disappearance of invisible media: A response to Sebastian Kubitschko and Daniel Knapp","In the conclusion of Peter Sloterdijk’s epic Sphären trilogy (1998–2004), the German philosopher performs a contemporary iteration of Socrates’ original critique (as documented in Plato’s Phaedrus around 370 bc and reimagined for the 20th century by Walter Benjamin) by questioning our blindness to and alienation from the experience of others in a life lived inside one’s own mediasphere – a sphere of lived experience that simultaneously stretches the globe as it envelops the lifeworld of the individual. Paraphrasing such eminent observers of the human condition, once in media there is no outside to media, and people ‘will be hearers of many things and will have learned nothing; they will appear to be omniscient and will generally know nothing; they will be tiresome company, having the show of wisdom without the reality.’1 The perpetual motion between media, mediation, and mediatization is indeed a truism. On the other hand, people are increasingly aware of media in the social process, eagerly blaming media – or denying media’s responsibility – for the Arab uprisings, the UK riots and people having sex (faster).2 Media, concludes Lisa Gitelman in her history of phonography and the world wide web, are located ‘at the intersection of authority and amnesia’ (2006: 6), as people tend to ignore the role of media in their lives, and in the process forget how the kind of media they use format and shape their interactions with the world around them. Gitelman points to a profound paradox intrinsic to the findings of studies on the appropriation and use of media – something that Sebastian Kubitschko and Daniel Knapp (2012) similarly signal in their critique of the media life hypothesis (Deuze, 2011). The more people use media in the domains of everyday life and seem to take media for granted, the more reflexive","",""
"2012","Border communication: media sociology and STS"," This article examines the curious interplay between media sociology and Science and Technology Studies (STS). Recent media research is increasingly drawn to STS, while STS analysts are increasingly drawn to research media technologies. While it is routine practice in STS to stress the ‘materiality’ of the objects under investigation, media technologies pose a challenge to this. Their ‘materiality’ is difficult to distinguish from their communicative/symbolic dimensions, the latter often being misframed as ideal/immaterial. By contrast, media research traditions have thought through these issues in terms of the concept of articulation and the related conceptual legacy of aesthetic modernism. While far more attentive to the specificity of ‘the symbolic’, these frameworks have been only partly informed by macro-social theoretical reflection. Here we advocate Calhoun’s placement of communications within his ‘infrastructure of modernity’ as the most suitable overarching framework for discussion of this border communication. However, Calhoun’s framework itself can benefit from re-invigoration by the socio-technical insights of both traditions. ","",""

"2012","If They Show <i>Prison Break</i> in the United States on a Wednesday, by Thursday It Is Here"," This article describes practices of informal digital media circulation emerging in urban Cuba between 2005 and 2010, drawing from interviews and ethnographic research in the city of Santiago de Cuba. The Cuban new media landscape is supported by informal networks that blend financial and social exchanges to circulate goods, media, and currency in ways that are often illegal but are largely tolerated. Presenting two case studies of young, educated Cubans who rely on the circulation of film and television content via external hard drives for most of their media consumption, I suggest that the emphasis of much existing literature on the role of state censorship and control in Cuban new media policy overlook the everyday practices through which Cubans are regularly engaged with Latin and U.S. American popular culture. Further, informal economies have been central to everyday life in Cuba both during the height of the Soviet socialist era and in the period since the collapse of the Soviet Union that has seen a juxtaposition of some market reforms alongside centrally planned policies. In the context of nearly two decades of economic crisis, consumer shortages and a dual economy, Cuban people use both informal and state-sanctioned networks to acquire goods ranging from groceries to furnishings and domestic appliances. Understanding the informal media economy of Cuba within this broader context helps to explain how the consumption of commercial American media is largely uncontroversial within Cuban everyday life despite the fraught politics that often dominates discussions of Cuban media policy.

In this theoretical context, the article pays particular attention to the simulation processes that occur in the different phases of the evolution of a medium. Finally, a series of critical reflections on the sequential-linear and genealogical-branched evolution models are presented to propose alternatives that represent the complexity of the media ecosystem more closely.","",""

Media studies has always existed on the fuzzy boundary line (or border war, depending on your perspective) between the humanities and the social sciences; its hybrid nature has often provoked debates about the future of the field. Current prescriptions for the future of media and cultural studies from John Hartley and Graeme Turner provide new directions for researchers; our attempt here is to add to their provocations and think through some of the research and collaboration opportunities of digital media studies futures while pointing toward the economic, institutional, and disciplinary challenges of further enriching and hybridizing media studies. While we take seriously the critiques made by Graeme Turner (2012) against a small slice of scholarship on creative industries, new media studies, and/or convergence culture studies, we find it important to stress the variety and depth of digital media scholarship as well as the theoretical and methodological vigor of “new” media studies. We also want to stress a wider array of digital media scholarship than Turner acknowledges and point to the ways that critical race, feminist, queer, postcolonial and globalization scholars interrogate digital poetics and politics and open up new pedagogical and research horizons.

"2013","New media idiocy"," The article explores the concept of new media idiocy – both a new kind of idiocy and an idiocy performed in new media networks. The paper argues that instead of being neglected, idiocy needs to be appreciated if we are to enquire into the current forms of techno-human subjectification. Idiocy, following Deleuze, is interpreted as distinct from stupidity (a base mode of thinking); it is a mode of living that explores the true through the false. In new media, idiocy acquires a performative character; it is crafted, practiced and re-enacted collectively. Many forms of aesthetic expression, and especially those produced and circulated through social networks, such as memes and viral videos, have such performance of idiocy at their core. Moreover, it is through such expressive creation and performance of the idiot that the new forms of subjectification take place. Network culture’s allowance for participatory creativity enables new media idiocy to establish new forms of visibility and availability in relation to digital networks. The process of becoming an individual or the formulation of political discontent are dynamically expressed and documented online as they happen. Such order of visibility problematizes the processes of subjectification and the emergence of the cultural as well as the political on the Internet. The article uses YouTube videos and subcultures of webpage production as its case studies. ","",""

As part of a broader understanding of new media and marketing, u-commerce deserves attention from critical communication studies. In foregrounding concerns of space, time, and consciousness, u-commerce exemplifies a commercial theory of media and invites critique at the nexus of medium theory and political economy.

The article describes a recently finished project on media generations in Sweden and Estonia and discusses overcoming the problem of conducting research on mediatization as a long-term process. Through intergenerational and cross-cultural analysis, the article shows how media memories from childhood and the formative years of youth can reveal specific traits in the historical process and how the role of the media has changed over time in the minds of different generations. The article focuses on four generations that had their formative years during significant historical moments in the late 20th century; these formative moments were marked by specificities both in the respective national media landscapes and in the vast historical and geopolitical differences between the two countries.","",""

Agreement was found among respondents across disciplinary communities about what new media represent and how they support their work. Analysis of semantic differential charts identified two dimensions underlying attitudes—“flexibility” and “fitness for scholarly purposes.” Rather than being anchored by epistemological divisions, new media are assessed by practical viewpoints relating to the activity types they allow, and by traditional measures of reliability. In response to questions about other characteristics of their disciplines (such as reputation and audience diversity), distinctions are in evidence, although in some cases these are not traditional ones.","",""

I begin by noting that discursive constructions of the web as disruptive, open, and participatory have emerged at various points in the medium’s history, and that these discourses are not as neatly tied to economic interests as most new media criticism would suggest. With this in mind, field theory is introduced as a potential framework for understanding this (re)production of a belief in the new as a dynamic of the interplay of cultural and symbolic forms of capital within the new media field. After discussing how Bourdieu’s theory might be applied to new media culture in general terms, I turn to a key moment in the emergence of the new media field—the rise of cybercultural magazines Mondo 2000 and Wired in the early 1990s—to illustrate how Bourdieu’s theory may be adapted in the study of new media history.

"2018","Abandoned not: media sociology as a networked transfield","ABSTRACT The relationship between the disciplines of communication and sociology has been primarily described as being abandoned by sociologists. This article historicizes the alleged sociological abandonment of communication and media research and centers on media sociology as the key manifestation of an ongoing vibrant relationship between the two disciplines. It has two goals. First, I examine the contours of the abandonment notion since Berelson vs. Schramm, Riesman, and Bauer in Public Opinion Quarterly in 1959. I demonstrate the diversity and the depth of media sociology and argue that an US-centric positivist understanding of media sociology has led to the exaggerated and misleading notion of abandonment, which homogenizes theoretical discourse and discounts scholarly contributions from outside of the US. Personal and collective memories have also documented institutional and organizational growth of media sociology. Second, I propose to conceptualize media sociology as a networked transfield driven by questions transcending disciplinary little boxes. Rather than returning to the Lazarsfeldian media effect paradigm, media sociology as a networked transfield driven by questions will allows scholars take advantage of structural holes for synthesis and innovation.","",""

Towards this, I start working from Levinson’s differentiation among old media, new media, and new new media to arrive at the difference among the variable types of media. Next, I address the role of new new media in establishing world democracies and changing the social, cultural, and political world map. After that, I investigate the terms of “global village” and “cosmopolitanism” in relation to literature. To clarify what I mean by Cosmo Literature, I will investigate two new new media novels: Only One Millimeter Away, an Arabic Facebook novel by the Moroccan novelist Abdel-Wahid Stitu, and Hearts, Keys and Puppetry an English Twitter novel by Neil Gaiman, to infer the characteristics of Cosmo-Literature in general and Cosmo narration in particular.","",""

While this is a reasonable settlement, in this paper I will suggest an alternative arrangement based around controversies. Controversies, and related empirical objects, can help break down dichotomies like producer/audience, social/technical, content/material and also provoke questions such as ‘which media technologies matter in a given case?’ However, controversies are often specific to science so I propose a type of study based around ‘mediated events’ (drawing on the work of Isabelle Stengers). I illustrate this with the case of the Woolwich attacks on Twitter. While this approach does not deliver a comprehensive theory of the media, it proposes a new settlement between STS and media studies, grounded in the empirical rather than high theory.","",""
"2019","Rethinking the distinctions between old and new media: Introduction"," Recent approaches to media change have convincingly shown that distinctions between old and new media are inadequate to describe the complexity of present and past technological configurations. Yet, oldness and newness remain powerful ways to describe and understand media change and continue to direct present-day perceptions and interactions with a wide range of technologies – from vinyl records to artificial intelligence voice assistants such as Siri and Alexa. How can one refuse rigid definitions of old and new, while at the same time retaining the usefulness and pertinence of these concepts for the study and analysis of media change? This introduction to the special issue entitled ‘Rethinking the Distinctions between Old and New Media’ aims to answer this question by taking up the notion of biography. We argue that the recurrence of oldness and newness as categories to describe media is strictly related to the fact that interactions with media are embedded within a biographical understanding of time, which refers both to the life course of people or objects and to the narratives that are created and disseminated about them. Employing this approach entails considering the history of a medium against the history of the changing definitions that are attributed to it and, more broadly, to considering time not only as such but also against the narratives that make it thinkable and understandable.

"2019","On the relativity of old and new media: A lifeworld perspective"," It is an old, yet, accurate observation that the ‘newness’ of media is and most probably will continue to be a catalyst for research in media and communication studies. At the same time, there are numerous academic voices who stress that studying media change demands an awareness of the complexities at play interweaving the new with the old and the changes with the continuities. Over the last decades, compelling theoretical approaches and conceptualizations were introduced that aimed at grasping what defines old and new media under the conditions of complex, disruptive media change. Drawing from this theoretical work, we propose an empirical approach that departs from the perception of media users and how they make sense of media in their everyday affairs. The article argues that an inquiry of media change has to ground the construction of media as old or new in the context of lifeworlds in which media deeply affect users on a daily basis from early on. The concept of media ideology (Gershon, 2010a, 2010b) is used to investigate notions of ‘oldness’ and ‘newness’ people develop when they renegotiate the meaning of media for themselves or collectively with others. Based on empirical data from 35 in-depth interviews, distinct ways how the relativity but also relationality of old and new media are shaped against each other are identified. In the analysis, the article focuses on the aspects of rhetoric, everyday experiences, and emotions as well as on media generations, all of which inform media ideologies and thereby influence how media users define old and new media.

This study aims at analyzing the professional ideology of the New Media Art territory in Turkey using Thomas F. Gieryn’s concept of the ‘boundary-work’. The data obtained via semi-structured in-depth interviews conducted with a purposively sampled population of artists, curators and producers are used to assess whether a common cultural repertoire exists in this territory and whether it conforms to or contradicts its global counterpart. The study finds that since the mid-1990s, the professional ideology of the New Media Art territory in Turkey has developed in parallel with the world, but not monolithically. The curators/producers’ ideology is defined by potential for democratization, intersections of art, science and technology, interaction/interactivity and interdisciplinary collaboration. However, they exhibit two repertoire variants positively correlated with the subjects’ career orientations. The artists’ common ideology is similar to the curators’/producers’, but their cultural repertoires are more flexible thanks to the variety of their individual practices. The study concludes that this duality emerges due to the limited funding sources in Turkey.","",""
