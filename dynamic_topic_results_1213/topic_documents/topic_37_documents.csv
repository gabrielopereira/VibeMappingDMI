"2012","Organizational Learning and Home-Grown Writing: The Library Staff Magazine in Britain in the First Half of the Twentieth Century","    Staff magazines in British public libraries emerged in the early twentieth century. Unlike staff magazines in private enterprises, which predate them by two decades, library staff magazines were more truly the product of employees, inaugurated and operated as they often were by staff associations. This study is based on an analysis of staff magazines in three public library systems in Britain in the first half of the twentieth century: Croydon, Sheffield, and Leeds. Against backdrops of growing popular education, organizational enlargement, changing management styles, and increasing professionalization, the library staff magazine provided opportunities for employees to write. This was undertaken as a pastime; as a form of organizational learning and networking; as a contribution to labor and occupational solidarity; and, finally, as a vehicle for professional advancement and professional identity formation, though one that contained an element of “othering” of the public as well as of junior and female staff.

"2012","From History to Library and Information Science: A Case Study of Archival Education at Wayne State University","This article provides a case study of the development of archival education at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan. The study investigates the emergence of an archival concentration within the Department of History and the transition of that concentration to a jointly run interdisciplinary program more closely aligned with the School of Library and Information Science. This progression demonstrates both the challenges and the benefits that the lack of an independent institutional home had on the development of archival education, particularly in regard to curriculum development and administration. It argues that the transition has been especially difficult because different groups involved with the administration and growth of the archival curriculum had varying notions of the primary purpose of archival education.","",""
"2012","The Contribution of Ægidius Fauteux and Edmond Desrochers to Quebec Librarianship in the Twentieth Century","At the start of the twentieth century, Quebec libraries had a different look from those in the rest of North America. The Catholic clergy, whose power extended over all aspects of Quebec society, had imposed a parish library on a population learning to read, which inhibited the development of public libraries for French speakers in Quebec. The head of the Bibliothèque Saint-Sulpice in Montreal (both a research and a public library), Ægidius Fauteux, gave this institution a large cultural influence from 1915 to 1931. In the third quarter of the twentieth century, a Jesuit librarian, Edmond Desrochers, became a leader in the development of libraries in Quebec. The impact of his work was felt in professional associations, in the university training of librarians, and in the promotion of public, college, and university libraries for French speakers. Fauteux and Desrochers represent two generations of librarians who had an outstanding influence on the development of libraries in Quebec throughout the twentieth century.","",""

"2012","Editor's Note: Changes to the Journal","This issue witnesses a number of changes for the journal: a new title, a new scope of coverage, and a new editor. For the past six years, Libraries & the Cultural Record has principally focused on library history but occasionally covered other topics that fall under what the previous editor, David Gracy, calls the history of the “information domain.” By that term, David meant the history of archives, museums, conservation, and information science, in addition to library history. In the journal’s new configuration, as Information & Culture: A Journal of History, it will continue to publish in all of these areas but will also expand the scope to the entire history of information, as broadly conceived. Over the past decade, there has been a major change in the library and information school community. The so-called information school, or iSchool, movement has broadened the set of topics that are covered and has vastly expanded the use of technological and social science approaches, in addition to the humanities approaches that have been the hallmark of library studies. The School of Information at the University of Texas at Austin, long the institutional home of this journal, is one of the library and information schools that have been transformed by this movement, and the intention is that Information & Culture will be faithful to the mission of its home institution. Thus, it will cover the history of any topic that might be taught or researched in this or other iSchools. The term “information history” is shorthand for what Information & Culture will publish. There are few people today who actually call themselves “information historians,” and the boundaries of a field of study called “information history” have yet to be determined. This is a work in progress, and Information & Culture is delighted to be part of the defining process. Perhaps as time goes by, what falls within the boundaries of information history will become clearer. Some things are already clear. Information history is about many topics, including:","",""
"2012","The Origin of College Libraries in North Carolina: A Social History, 1890-1920","The creation of academic libraries at the end of the nineteenth century was a fundamental element in the rapid growth of higher education in the United States. This was the period when college and university libraries began their transformation from book depositories into centers of information retrieval, access, and dissemination. Academic libraries, however, have seldom been studied on a statewide or regional basis. Using a state as the basis of investigation provides a suitable set of examples for comparative analysis and historical insight. North Carolina is a good illustration of academic library development because it was neither first nor last in this process of transformation. The state also enjoys a wealth of archival materials about academic libraries, which facilitates their examination against a scholarly background of local and national research.","",""

In all that he did, history and historical scholarship were the central points of what one needed to know to become an archivist, an idea seemingly left behind as archival education has become ensconced in library, information science, and information schools. Although he failed to complete a book about historical and archival manuscripts that could be used in the classroom, Cappon’s commitment to the project and the publication of a few selected chapters mark his place as a pioneer in archival education.","",""

We document the expansion of public libraries in the United States using data drawn from library surveys conducted by the federal Bureau of Education. We then review causal accounts for that expansion. Exploiting cross-state and temporal variation in the data, we use statistical techniques to assess a number of plausible demand-and-supply factors affecting the pace of library development. Social and economic variables in the analysis include state income or wealth, urbanization, ethnic composition, and gender ratios. We also examine the effect of institutional innovations, such as state library commissions and library associations, that likely affected the establishment of public libraries. We confirm that library expansion was robustly related to urbanization and greater ethnic (immigrant) diversity and to institutional innovations and that it was greatly delayed in southern states.","",""

However, libraries became increasingly disillusioned with civil defense during the late 1960s, and they largely abandoned civil defense in favor of peace advocacy in the 1980s.

Drawing on rhetorical genre theory, we conceive of these finding aids as sociohistorical texts and trace their evolution across three dimensions (textual features, composing processes, and social roles). Our study suggests that the calendars and guides were not simply tools for making the PRO’s holdings accessible to the public; they also shaped and were shaped by ideas and beliefs about what it meant to make records accessible to the public and the most effective means of accomplishing that end. These ideas and beliefs were linked, in turn, to the PRO’s sense of its purpose and identity in relation to the communities it served. The generic evolution of the calendars and guides reflects and, to some extent, embodies that evolving sense of purpose and identity.","",""

Gracy II is very well known for his advocacy for archives and the study of archives, an enthusiasm that he has been communicating to students from the 1970s through the first decade of the twenty-first century. He has been involved during his career with most initiatives having to do with furthering archival education through both continuing education for working archivists and, at the University of Texas at Austin (UT), crafting a full program of postgraduate archival and preservation education. In this article I discuss the development of a discourse about and cadre for archival education in the United States, counterpointed by developments at UT from the perspective of Gracy’s career as it intersected with the social worlds of state, local, and national archives and archivists; national postsecondary education for archivists; and the national professional association of archivists.","",""

H. Smith, Mudie’s, and the Times Book Club. This article examines the literary impact of one of the largest of these, Boots Book-lovers’ Library (1899–1966), which by 1935 had around four hundred libraries attached to its high-street pharmacies catering for the literary tastes of over one million subscribers a year. The article considers the impact of the Boots Book-lovers’ Library on authors’ practices of writing and revision and on literary marketing and censorship, focusing in particular on James Hanley’s The Furys (1935) and using unpublished correspondence in the Chatto & Windus archive at the University of Reading to demonstrate how the publisher’s sense of the tastes and expectations of the Boots library reader influenced the revisioning process.","",""

It identifies three discursive strands and discusses their implications for archivists today: how local and national differences might temper wholesale adoption of practices employed in other settings; the initial attempt to blend bibliographic and archival approaches at the National Archives; and the conceptualization and subsequent adoption of the record group as an institutional compromise. This compromise embedded conceptual principles identified by European archivists while simultaneously addressing specific pragmatic and physical considerations presented by federal records at the time.","",""

During the 1950s, the nation’s leading libraries converted their buildings into fallout shelters and disseminated survival information to millions of Americans.

Cappon ran a summer institute in historical administration at Radcliffe, participated in crucial debates about archival education, presented guest lectures in undergraduate and graduate courses whenever the opportunity presented itself, advocated for more rigorous graduate programs in archival work and documentary editing, and consistently argued about the synergy between teaching and publishing. In all that he did, history and historical scholarship were the central points of what one needed to know to become an archivist, an idea seemingly left behind as archival education has become ensconced in library, information science, and information schools. Although he failed to complete a book about historical and archival manuscripts that could be used in the classroom, Cappon’s commitment to the project and the publication of a few selected chapters mark his place as a pioneer in archival education.","",""

Drawing on rhetorical genre theory, we conceive of these finding aids as sociohistorical texts and trace their evolution across three dimensions (textual features, composing processes, and social roles). Our study suggests that the calendars and guides were not simply tools for making the PRO’s holdings accessible to the public; they also shaped and were shaped by ideas and beliefs about what it meant to make records accessible to the public and the most effective means of accomplishing that end. These ideas and beliefs were linked, in turn, to the PRO’s sense of its purpose and identity in relation to the communities it served. The generic evolution of the calendars and guides reflects and, to some extent, embodies that evolving sense of purpose and identity.","",""

"2014","The Development of Public Libraries in the United States, 1870–1930: A Quantitative Assessment","The period 1870–1930 witnessed the emergence of the local public library as a widespread and enduring American institution. We document the expansion of public libraries in the United States using data drawn from library surveys conducted by the federal Bureau of Education. We then review causal accounts for that expansion. Exploiting cross-state and temporal variation in the data, we use statistical techniques to assess a number of plausible demand-and-supply factors affecting the pace of library development. Social and economic variables in the analysis include state income or wealth, urbanization, ethnic composition, and gender ratios. We also examine the effect of institutional innovations, such as state library commissions and library associations, that likely affected the establishment of public libraries. We confirm that library expansion was robustly related to urbanization and greater ethnic (immigrant) diversity and to institutional innovations and that it was greatly delayed in southern states.","",""
