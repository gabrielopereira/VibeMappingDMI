"2000","Intra-Institutional Rivalry and Policy Entrepreneurship in the European Union"," The topic of information and communications technology (ICT) convergence is now of primary interest to policy makers in industry and government at the national and international level, as well as the academic community. In 1997, the European Commission published a Green Paper on the matter, and subsequently launched a consultation process which resulted in a series of re-regulatory proposals as part of the 1999 Communications Review. In recent years, there has been considerable evidence of Commission pro-activity and agenda setting in telecommunications and broadcasting. This article argues that ICT convergence policy is an interesting case of both policy entrepreneurship and intra-institutional rivalry within the Commission. Here, the ambitious initial proposals of interests in the Commission in favour of creating a uniform, light-touch regulatory ICT regime at EU level were significantly modified in the light of opposition from the Commission's own quarters, other EU institutions, the national political level and the broadcasting sector. As a result, it appears that in the immediate future there will be only limited, though still very significant, development of a convergent approach to ICT regulation, in the form of measures dealing with infrastructure and associated services.

"2001","Telecommunications and Transnationalism: The Polarization of Social Space","This article critically assesses the policy orientation, social impacts, and linkages of telecommunications in the United States within a government deregulated policy environment and an increasingly globalized economy. Deregulation has been driven by both ideological and technological demands, stemming from several political and economic transformations in the world economy, the collapse of state socialism in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and greater oligopolistic competition among transnational corporations. An expanded infrastructure of new digital information and communications technology (ICT) is the foundation of a worldwide political economic regime of accumulation. ICT increases command and control capabilities of large corporations, together with the mobility and liquidity of capital, making it essential to the restructuring of the world economy, the new international division of labor, and the creation of global """"information city"""" networks. At the same time, government deregulation and rapid technological change are associated with a number of spatial, economic, and social dualisms.","",""

In Turkey, efforts to privatize Tu¨rk Telekom and liberalize the telecommunications regime have not yet been successful. At the same time, the Internet has experienced dramatic growth. While the experience of Turkey illustrates that formal liberalization of basic telecommunications services is not a necessary condition for the growth of a dynamic Internet services provision market, the relationship between the Internet service providers and the provider of basic telecommunications services remains a critical one. Tu¨rk Telekom and policymakers have permitted the creation of a de facto liberal market for Internet services, have supported the creation of Internet infrastructure, and have established a rather level playing field for Internet service providers.","",""

"2002","Tuning into the New Economy"," This article discusses how European competition law has been applied, particularly with regard to merger control, in relation to the converging markets of media and telecommunications. The imperatives of technological reform, cross-sectoral and platform convergence, trade liberalisation, and the globalisation of communications services have served to establish new strategic alliances, acquisitions and most notably corporate marriages and mergers. Telecommunication companies have metamorphosed from domestically rooted monopoly utilities into national champions in international, even global markets. Moreover, actors from the adjacent sectors - media and computing- have sought alliances with one another and with telecommunication corporations as the new communications markets have continued to converge. Within this context, the European Commission's Competition Directorate has been responsible for applying European Union competition policies and making rulings with regard to a growing number of corporate communications 'convergence' alliances and mergers. This article reviews the factors which have driven European competition policy within the communication sectors, discusses how such policy has been administered with regard to three prominent mergers in converging communication markets, and considers the implications of these particularly high profile merger rulings. It relates the EC's policy responses to the wider questions which competition policy raises regarding information and communications as public or private good and concludes by commenting on the ability of EC competition law alone to address issues of the public good as well as purely economic matters (competition).

"2002","Europeanisation, Globalisation and Policy Transfer in the European Union"," The article discusses the ways in which the concept of policy transfer might be employed in order to help explain the transformation of telecommunications policy within the European Union (EU). From a 'policy transfer' approach, the article analyses the process of telecommunications liberalisation that has occurred in Europe from the mid-late 1980s onwards in terms of the influences arising from globalisation and Europeanisation. In particular, it aims to disentangle the explanatory power of Europeanisation from that of globalisation as causal factors for convergent telecommunications liberalisation in Europe. The article shows how both globalisation and Europeanisation have been refracted by national institutional differences so that the emergent EU regulatory framework should be characterised as 'pluralist' rather than as 'hierarchically' supranational. Despite the diversity of national regulatory authorities, European Community (EC) implementation reports, telecommunications committees and the transnational network of independent regulators are all factors for policy transfer and learning.

"2004","Competition for Technology Leadership: EU Policy for High Technology, by Johan Lembke. Cheltenham, UK and Northampton, MA: Edward Elgar, 2002. xiv + 313 pp. $100.00 cloth. ISBN 1-84064-792-2","This is an informative book about the making of industrial policies for high-technology industries in the European Union (EU) in the late 1990s. Lembke chooses three cases for detailed analysis: the GALILEO satellite navigation system, Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) wireless systems, and Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) digital radio. The author demonstrates that no industrial policies are likely to be forthcoming for industries, like digital radio, with low lobbying strength and low potential payoffs for political entrepreneurs (Table 8.5 on p. 280). In contrast, GALILEO satellite navigation benefited from the desire of industry representatives and political actors to have a European alternative to the American geographical positioning system (GPS), while UMTS benefited from the desire of Europeans to build on the success of the earlier Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) cellular phone systems without ruining their chances for marketing thirdgeneration phones in the rest of the world, particularly in Asia. European solidarity was helped by the dominance of the United States in GPS systems and by the U.S. company Qualcomm in CDMA (code division multiple access) telephone technology. European solidarity was hindered by the existence of a competing European standard for digital audio that came out of the digital video broadcasting (DVB) effort after 1993 and the desire of EU officials to avoid another disaster like the one that occurred in the early 1990s with HD-MAC (the Europeans’ first and failed attempt to institute a standard for high-definition television). I was struck by the importance of military/strategic considerations in Lembke’s account of the support for the GALILEO system and of the creation of an antiUnited States coalition of European and Japanese forces in UMTS phone systems. Regional pride over the success of GSM played an important role not just in the UMTS debate but in the rejection of more parochial approaches such as that represented by the advocates of DAB. The Europeans clearly changed their approach to industrial policy in the 1990s. As Lembke argues correctly (p. 282), there is “a new form of critical industry support in the ‘information age’ which contrasts with the subsidy-based industry support promulgated by the first wave of strategic trade theorists in the 1980s and 1990s.” This new support tended to focus on global standardssetting processes based on consensus building among scientists and engineers (including some non-Europeans) on key technological questions, instead of the imposition of regional standards to insulate regional firms from international competition. As I read the DAB case, I had the impression the EU had made the right decision in not imposing a standard and in not backing the technology that came out of the Eureka research program. Here the opponents made a good case for the need not to foreclose innovation by prematurely imposing a regional standard. The claim by supporters that DAB would help to revive consumer electronics in Europe was not credible. Overall, I found the author’s descriptions to be interesting and accurate and his explanations for outcomes to be convincing. The subject matter is complex. It is impossible to describe what is in the book without using a lot of acronyms. There are many alternative technologies, numerous and diverse social actors, and the usual complications introduced by the interventions of individuals. For example, in one of the cases (DAB), a change in the composition of European commissioners was a crucial determinant of the outcome. This was sometimes a difficult book to read, and it would have benefited from better copyediting, but it is strong on details and reports many important and original findings based on interviews with key players.","",""
"2005","The challenges of classification: Emerging VOIP regulation in Europe and the United States"," Internet telephony — or Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) — has the potential to transform the world of voice communications more profoundly than anything since the invention of the telephone itself. As telecommunications incumbents and a range of new entrants begin rolling out commercial VOIP services, policymakers around the world are grappling with the regulatory implications. In the United States and the European Union, the two largest near–term VOIP markets, efforts are underway to fit VOIP into existing regulatory frameworks. This process of """"regulatory classification"""" is by no means a purely administrative act. A lot is at stake and different interest groups have therefore mobilized to shape the respective outcomes. Because legacy regulatory systems in Europe and the United States differ, the regulatory treatment of VOIP in the two markets is beginning to differ as well. Yet in both markets there is a substantial danger that fitting VOIP into existing classifications will force VOIP to look more like regular telephony, thereby limiting its innovation potential.

"2007","The State of the Debate on Network Neutrality","The debate over “network neutrality” has recently emerged as the single most important communications policy issue—at least within the United States—that is now being debated around the world. The resolution of this debate may greatly influence what applications and content are available to Internet users, which business models are successful for service providers, which modes of social communication develop, and which technical designs are effective. As applications move to become Internet Protocol (IP)-based, the reverberations will also reach those sectors that build on or compete with the Internet, including the telephone, television, radio, and electronic commerce sectors. The magnitude of this issue demands careful consideration by policymakers. The papers in this special issue can serve as a valuable basis for such consideration.","",""

"2007","[Special Section on Net Neutrality] A Layered Network Approach to Net Neutrality","Net neutrality was the most contentious communications policy issue considered by Congress during 2005-2006. The issue is the result of a fragmented communications policy unable to deal with technology convergence. In this paper, we develop a net neutrality policy based on the layered structure of the Internet that gracefully accommodates convergence. Our framework distinguishes between discrimination in high barrier-to-entry network infrastructure and in low barrier-to-entry applications. The policy prohibits use of Internet infrastructure to produce an uneven playing field in Internet applications. In this manner, the policy restricts an Internet service provider's ability to discriminate in a manner that extracts oligopoly rents, while simultaneously ensuring that ISPs can use desirable forms of network management. We illustrate how this net neutrality policy can draw upon current communications law through draft statute language. We believe this approach is well grounded in both technology and policy, and that it illustrates a middle-ground that may even be somewhat agreeable to the opposing forces on this issue.","",""

The European regulatory framework for electronic communications services permits ex ante regulatory intervention in specified network or services markets only where there is dominance or 'significant market power.'  We argue that this provision, combined with European competition law which can be applied to content as well as – concurrently – to electronic communications services, is adequate to deal with actual or prospective abuses of market power, whereas a blanket prohibition of the kind envisaged by proponents of net neutrality is likely in some cases to harm consumers' interests.","",""

The goal of this paper is to characterize the resulting arms race by examining scenarios for how downstream end-users of broadband, sometimes in conjunction with upstream players (e.g. content providers), might respond to limit the potential harm from network-based discrimination. We identify three classes of end-user responses: (1) infrastructure-based bypass (e.g., municipal open access networks, mesh networking, or multi-homing); (2)","",""

"2007","[Special Section on Net Neutrality] Analyzing the Net Neutrality Debate Through Awareness of Agenda Denial","Public policy making can be considered a set of processes that include the setting of the agenda, specification of alternative policy choices, an authoritative choice among those specified alternatives, and the implementation of the decision (Kingdon 1995, pp. 2-3).   A successful policy outcome requires success in all these processes.  With regard to the first process, the agenda “is the list of subjects or problems to which governmental officials … are paying some serious attention at any given time” (Kingdon 1995, p. 3).  “Agenda setting, the politics of selecting issues for active consideration, can be examined from a variety of perspectives” (Cobb & Ross 1997, p.3).   Much of the agenda-setting literature emphasizes how individuals and groups, or initiators, try to gain access to decision makers through issue expansion, that is, by framing issues to appeal to a larger audience.  Cobb and Ross (1997, p. xi) focus on agenda denial, that is, “the political process by which issues that one would expect to get meaningful consideration from the political institutions in a society fail to get taken seriously.” Agenda denial concerns tactics used by issue opponents to keep issue initiators from attaining success at any stage in the set of policymaking processes.    The current network neutrality debate is a clear example of agenda conflict, whereby proponents seek to get the issue of network neutrality on the agenda and opponents seek its denial.  The lack of a consensus as to the definition of network neutrality is symptomatic of the ongoing battle to frame the debate.      Opponents’ framing of the network neutrality issue represent strategies of agenda denial described by Cobb and Ross (1997).  This paper asserts that awareness of the strategies of agenda denial assists evaluation of opponents’ arguments and provides a better understanding of the political dynamic of the overall network neutrality debate.  In this way, network neutrality proponents may more effectively construct counterarguments and policymakers may better distinguish meritorious claims from rhetoric.","",""
"2007","[Special Section on Net Neutrality] Network Neutrality: The Debate Evolves","The network neutrality debate burst on political scene in late 2005-early 2006, centered on alleged incentives by broadband ISPs to act as Internet “gatekeepers,” disadvantaging certain Internet applications toward anticompetitive ends.  The debate is a continuation of an earlier debate on “open access” and was spurred by two high-profile events that appeared to presage such anticompetitive behavior.   Self-styled defenders of the Internet joined forces with interested parties such as Google, Yahoo! and Microsoft to demand legislation protecting the “neutrality” of the Internet, to ensure that broadband ISPs could in no way control the bits that passed between end-customers and application providers.  Predictably, the broadband ISPs objected to any legislation, stating they had no intention of keeping their customers from the content they desired.    In the heat of this debate, exactly what net neutrality is has been subject to change as the debate has evolved.  In this paper, I identify what appear to be the three major components of the net neutrality argument and analyze each in turn.  Only one component (vertical foreclosure) of the net neutrality argument raises valid concerns; I discuss whether those concerns are best dealt with by ex ante laws or ex post enforcement of existing law/regulation.  The paper closes with a discussion of how vertical foreclosure issues may become more serious with the advent of IPTV.","",""

"2007","[Special Section on Net Neutrality] Internet 3.0: Identifying Problems and Solutions to the Network Neutrality Debate","What Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can and cannot do to diversify and differentiate services lies at the core of the debate over neutrality in network operation.  In prior generations ISPs had little incentive or technological capability to deviate from plain vanilla best efforts routing for content providers and from a single standard bit rate offered on “all you can eat” terms for consumer access to the World Wide Web.  The next generation Internet has the technological capability and ISPs have the commercial motivation to offer “better than best efforts” routing and premium services for both content providers and consumers seeking higher quality of service and more reliable traffic delivery.     However the potential exists for carriers, operating the major networks used to switch and route bitstreams, to go beyond satisfying diverse requirements of content provider and end users.  Network neutrality advocates worry that major ISPs have both the wherewithal and incentive to bifurcate the Internet into one medium increasingly prone to congestion and declining reliability and one offering superior performance and potential competitive advantages to users able and willing to pay, or affiliated with an ISP operating a major bitstream transmission network such as AT&T, Verizon and Comcast.  Opponents refuse to see a current or prospective problem and worry that network neutrality requirements legitimize common carrier regulation of the Internet, a regulatory regime heretofore limited to telecommunications services operating in a less than fully competitive environment.     This paper will examine the network neutrality debate with an eye toward refuting and dismissing the many false and misleading claims and concentrating on the real problems occasioned by the Internet’s third evolution.  The paper accepts as necessary and proper many types of price and quality of service discrimination.  However the paper identifies other types of  discrimination, which operators can obscure, that constitute unlawful and anticompetitive trade practices.      The paper identifies best practices in lawful discrimination that should satisfy most network neutrality goals without creating disincentives that might dissuade ISPs from building the infrastructure needed for Internet 3.0 services.  The paper concludes that legitimate concerns about unlawful network discrimination warrant the presence of a referee to remedy abuses before irreparable marketplace competitive harm occurs and well before a court of law could act.  The paper recommends that the FCC require ISPs to submit network usage reports that the Commission could use to determine the causes of congestion and other types of service disruption.","",""
"2007","[Special Section on Net Neutrality] The Benefits and Risks of Mandating Network Neutrality, and the Quest for a Balanced Policy","A fundamental issue in the network neutrality debate is the extent to which network operators should be allowed to discriminate among Internet packet streams to selectively block, adjust quality of service, or adjust prices.  This paper first reviews technology now available for traffic discrimination.  It then shows how network operators can use this technology in ways that would make the Internet less valuable to Internet users, and why a network operator would have financial incentive to do this if, and only if, it has sufficient market power.  A particular concern is that network operators could use discrimination to extract oligopoly rents from upstream markets that are highly competitive.  This paper also shows how network operators can use the very same technology to discriminate in ways that benefit Internet users as well as the network operator.  Thus, network neutrality supporters are right to fear unlimited discrimination in some cases, while network neutrality opponents are right to fear a policy that imposes strict limits on discrimination.  From this, we argue that the network neutrality debate should be refocused on the search for a balanced policy, which is a policy that limits the more harmful discriminatory practices in markets where there is insufficient competition, with little interference to beneficial discrimination or innovation.  We apply this balanced policy in a few controversial scenarios as examples.  There has been too little attention on the possibility of a nuanced balanced policy, in part because the network neutrality debate is focusing on the wrong issues.  This paper argues that the debate should shift toward the complex details of differentiating harmful discrimination from beneficial discrimination, and away from high-level secondary questions like whether discrimination is inherently just, who ought to pay for certain Internet services, how important general design principles are, what abstract rights and freedoms consumers and carriers deserve, or whether network operators can give their affiliates special treatment.  Reality is more complex than these questions would imply, and none of them will serve as a basis for a sufficiently specific and effective policy.","",""

Unfortunately, the systems we use in the US and worldwide to allocate and manage spectrum is bending under the strain these demands place on the system.  Government allocation of spectrum, either by “beauty contests” (traditional) or auction (more recent) has failed to keep up with the growth in demand.

While information provision is often favored as a policy/regulatory tool to address “market failure,” it can have its own failings and drawbacks. For instance, the volume of information presented can contain its effectiveness. While the demand-side analysis indicates that actual consumer behavior exhibits systematic departures from the “rational” behavior assumed by conventional (neoclassical) economics, behavioral economics goes further in questioning whether additional information is always useful. It challenges some of the presumptions of conventional economics that consumers make their choices coherently and rationally.

The best available data suggests that the majority of federal spectrum capacity is left unused. Strategic reuse of this spectrum could help obviate the need for significant additional reallocation while enabling a wide range of creative new uses and social benefits. Based on what little information is publicly available, it is reasonable to assume that the repurposing of government spectrum would go far in addressing a number of access-related communication problems. Repurposing currently unused U.S. government-controlled spectrum for opportunistic unlicensed use would benefit society by dramatically expanding access to high-speed broadband and increasing the pace of wireless technology innovation. This approach to spectrum policy presents a “third option” for reform, drawing from both the commons and property rights models of spectrum management.","",""

We do so by examining the record of three key layers in the industry’s vertical chain: software applications, devices (handhelds), and the core wireless distribution networks.  We find that all three markets exhibit very high rates of innovation, that the markets are competitive, and that this competition has driven innovation.

"2009","A National Broadband Plan for Our Future: A Customer-Centric Approach","Congress has recently charged the Federal Communications Commission to establish a National Broadband Plan. This paper argues that a customer-centric plan, which puts the customer in control of decision-making, will yield the best broadband result for the U.S. The Federal government must establish a market infrastructure that encourages competition, requires transparency of both network providers and application providers, and includes vigorous antitrust enforcement. Competition from wireless broadband is present now and will become far more prevalent shortly, on the basis of current and announced investment plans.    Regulators must also make available far more licensed spectrum to ensure this competition is realized. Calls for regulation in the form of mandated unbundling and more unlicensed spectrum are regulatory cul-de-sacs with proven track records of failure. Calls for regulatory control of network provider practices (other than transparency), such as network neutrality, are misguided. Such decisions are best left to customers, who can very well decide for themselves which of the broadband providers offer terms that best suit the customer.","",""
"2009","SUPRANATIONALISM THROUGH INSTITUTIONALIZATION AND ITS LIMITS IN EUROPEAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS","The recent proposal of a European Electronic Communications Market Authority (EECMA) by the European Commission has turned out to be the most high profile and controversial element of the latest review of the EU's telecommunications regulatory framework, begun in 2006. EECMA provides an important example of the ‘intergovernmental’ and supranational-level tensions which exist in European telecommunications governance. This article argues that creating EECMA, in the form proposed by the European Commission, would have amounted to a radical departure in the direction of supranationalism for a system which has developed over 20 years a largely ‘intergovernmental’ character. Despite telecommunications being widely viewed as one of the most Europeanized parts of the communications sector in terms of governance, the fractious and protracted politics of EECMA provide a candid illustration of both the persistent supranational aspirations of the European Commission and, by contrast, the robustness and ultimately determinative power of national level interests.","",""
"2009","Broadband policy:  Beyond privatization, competition and independent regulation","During the last 25 years, telecommunication has moved away from government-owned or regulated monopolies toward privatization with competition and oversight by independent regulatory agencies – PCR policies. We present data indicating that PCR has had little impact on the Internet during the last ten years in developed or developing nations, and discuss the reasons for this. We then describe several ways government can go beyond PCR, while balancing needs for next generation technology, decentralized infrastructure ownership, and immediate economic stimulus. We conclude that there is a need for alternatives to the expedient action of subsidizing the current Internet service providers with their demonstrated anti-competitive bent. The decisions we make today will shape telecommunication infrastructure and the industry for decades.","",""

In this paper, I develop four principles of transparency: 1) disclose all information relevant to customer choice, 2) to which customers have easy access, 3) clearly and simply, and 4) in a way that is verifiable.  I draw on experience in other industries and other regulators to illustrate these points, and I review the current state of transparency of Internet firms, including broadband ISPs, as well as the challenges they face.  The point of this paper is not to recommend specific disclosure practices, but rather, to provide a framework for policy analysis.","",""
"2010","The Open Internet: A Customer-Centric Framework","The Federal Communications Commission’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, “Preserving the Open Internet,” is the most significant reach of regulatory power over the Internet in U.S. history.  The NPRM proposes a set of regulations for broadband ISPs corresponding to the four principles previously adopted by the Commission, plus two new ones: nondiscrimination and transparency. We strongly support customer-focused transparency by all Internet firms, not just broadband ISPs. We oppose, however, the remaining five proposals to implement network neutrality for broadband ISPs as both unnecessary and harmful.  We find that there is nothing here to be fixed, and that there is no market failure.  The regulations are not only unnecessary; they would impose significant costs on broadband customers.  We find that the costs that would be imposed on wireless broadband would be particularly punishing, and likely to permanently harm that industry.      We instead propose that the FCC focus its energies on bringing more competition to the already rivalrous broadband marketplace, a goal which is within reach.  Over a dozen wireless carriers now provide 3G service, and 4G service, which can substitute even more effectively for many Internet uses that were previously confined to wireline, is imminent.  It is essential that the FCC release substantial amounts of licensed spectrum into the marketplace so that this additional competition can emerge quickly.  The FCC should not waste its time with pointless, costly regulation; it should facilitate competition so that customers can choose for themselves if and how much network neutrality they want.  Let the customers decide; not regulators, not pundits, not advocates.","",""

This discussion is particularly timely, as the European Commission is working on a new telecommunications regulatory framework, with the lessons and failures of the past appearing more critical than ever. In this context, the article points to the debate between national heterogeneity and shared vision in the European Information Society and it proposes a shift of the culture and procedures dominating the formal EU regulation. It brings to the fore the potential for the tension between national particularities and EU regulation to be resolved by applying subsidiarity along with existing regulatory tools and mediation via the enforcement of mediating networks and the establishment of institutions that increase the accountability of EU regulation on telecommunications.","",""

In 2002, a new law was passed requiring the introduction of a nationwide conditional access system (CAS) (addressable cable), but administrative problems and court challenges delayed its implementation until 2007 and limited it to some localities in the four largest cities. At a substantive level, the case supports incrementalist theories of policymaking that argue that radical policy changes mobilize opposition and fail in implementation. But at a procedural level, this paper argues that the CAS controversy catalyzed a radical change in the telecommunications policymaking process, lending support to theories such as punctuated equilibrium, which acknowledge the possibility of radical change. In conclusion, lessons for telecommunications policy-making in India and other developing countries are put forward.","",""

Yet this has been occurring in the United States around efforts to introduce “Net neutrality” regulation. A similar grassroots mobilization has not developed in the United Kingdom or elsewhere in Europe. We develop a comparative analysis of U.S. and UK Net neutrality debates with an eye toward identifying the arguments for and against regulation, how those arguments differ between the countries, and what the implications of those differences are for the Internet. Drawing on mass media, advocacy, and regulatory discourses, we find that local regulatory precedents as well as cultural factors contribute to both agenda setting and framing of Net neutrality. The differences between national discourses provide a way to understand both the structural differences between regulatory cultures and the substantive differences between policy interpretations, both of which must be reconciled for the Internet to continue to thrive as a global medium.","",""
"2012","Understanding the net neutrality debate: Listening to stakeholders","The Internet is increasingly seen as integral to economic progress and prosperity. Yet how the Internet will be managed as it grows and diversifies remains a hotly contested topic, as the debate on net neutrality demonstrates. Whether the Internet is neutral or not has serious implications for Internet service providers (ISPs), businesses operating online, governments, and civil society. With these stakeholders and varying interests at play, the debate about net neutrality is often characterized in terms of polar positions, and the discussion has seemed intransigent and ongoing with an uncertain end point. To increase understanding about the debate, this paper combines a review of the literature on net neutrality with evidence from interviews with four individuals, each representing the viewpoint of a major stakeholder group in Canada. Analysis of the similarities and differences among key stakeholder positions shows that in fact the positions are more complex and considerably more nuanced than typically depicted.  By focussing on components of the issues, and staying away from the politics of contesting net neutrality, progress in the debate can be made. While this paper gives attention to the Canadian context in particular, the findings echo those of international organizations, and adds to the global conversation on the future of the Internet.","",""
"2013","Classic conditioning: the FCC’s use of merger conditions to advance policy goals","Federal regulators routinely impose conditions on companies seeking to complete a merger or acquisition. Under standard circumstances, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) must justify significant policy decisions by explaining assumptions underlying the decision; key alternatives; the rationale for that particular policy tactic; and how the new policy dovetails with agency precedent (Yoo, 2007). Critics contend, however, that merger negotiations lack transparency and are too far-reaching. In fact, the FCC may negotiate with companies under review to extract conditions that have minimal connection to actual concerns surrounding the transaction, and that circumvent established policymaking processes (Koutsky and Spiwak, 2010; Noah, 1997; Tramont, 2001; Weiser, 2009). Critics also assert that by engaging in closed-door negotiations and “arm-twisting” (Noah, 1997), the FCC is able to evade judicial scrutiny—partially because companies in regulated industries fear repercussions if they challenge agency demands. For these reasons, members of Congress have sponsored legislation aimed at severely limiting—and even stripping—FCC regulators of their power to review acquisitions (Borland, 1999; Telecommunications Merger Review Act of 2000). Despite their controversial nature, merger negotiations often do result in a set of conditions that benefit the public. While this study focuses on U.S. deals, European merger obligations can also be used to achieve industry-wide policy goals (Voight and Schmidt, 2005).","",""

This prospectively unchallenged chokepoint for political communication, advertising, entertainment, and economic transactions could extract monopoly rents and distort otherwise open political processes. As minimally acceptable broadband data rates escalate, the physical limitations of copper-wire technologies increasingly limit the incumbent telephone carrier as a meaningful competitor.

To avoid a return to the inflexibility of full tariff-based common carrier regulation of an inadvertent, but potentially de facto monopolist, there remains one potential for meaningful competitive technology for provision of broadband Internet—fixed terrestrial wireless Internet based on fifth-generation and successor cellular technologies with competitive monthly fees for unlimited data.","",""

To wit: this case study of the forgotten net neutrality struggle that took place in France between 1979 and 1982. In 1978, the French PTT started “Minitel,” the world's first successful mass market online ecosystem. The Minitel experience prefigured most of the legal, economic, industrial, and other public policy issues we face today in cyberspace. The concept of network neutrality was explicitly debated by administrators and regulators – only to be rejected upon pressure from the incumbent print press industry, which foresaw its own impending demise and did all it could to hinder the development of open and neutral digital fora. Minitel has been derided by many scholars and policy wonks as the epitome of statism that precluded real and meaningful innovation from emerging from the edges. This article demonstrates instead that hindrances to net neutrality in France in the early 1980s were the result of private sector lobbying, not of PTT administrators. It provides a counter-narrative grounded in historical data, to fuel further thinking about what policies will better support private innovation over modern online platforms.","",""

Advocates in favour of strict rules feared the end of the Internet itself, while access providers fought against interferences in their business areas. The regulatory process in the European Union was multi-faceted and faced several key changes and turning points.

The results shed light on the importance of the EU Internet market, its characteristics and challenges and allow to draw a comprehensive image of the European Union’s performance in regulating network neutrality. Albeit the complex institutional setting slowed down the process, the outcome is characterized by the inclusion of multiple stakeholders and the possibility to adapt legal norms on a dynamic basis.","",""
"2020","EC competition law and the idea of “open networks” (1950s–1980s)","Abstract Competition policy has been on the top of the European Community’s political agenda since the construction of a European Common Market in the 1960s. A comprehensive body of law was created to eliminate market dominance, cartels or state aid and to control mergers and competition. A key issue of the EC competition law was the Council Regulation 17/62, which established the idea of ‘openness’ of competition in European market law for the decades to come. Infrastructure sectors like telecommunications were, however, mostly excluded from the Council Regulation 17/62 in the early 1960s. The European Commission put the question of an application of EC competition law again on the political agenda in the 1980s. Dramatic losses of European producers of telecommunication technology in the share on global markets further backed the Commission, which in 1987 issued a first green paper on telecommunications. This paper had an enormous effect on the liberalisation of the telecommunication sector across Europe and subsequently incorporated the sector into the scope of application of EC competition law. The Council Regulations 17/62’s idea of ‘openness’ and ‘open networks’ were established as basic principles for European telecommunication markets with three decades’ delay and made Europe ready for digital technologies and in particular for the internet. The paper analyses the discourses and imaginaries of ‘open networks’ in the debate about the relationship between EC competition law and the telecommunication sector in a long term perspective from the 1960 to the 1980s.","",""
"2020","Editorial: the internet and the EU market","Abstract This special issue is the result of an open call launched two years ago in connection with the activities of the Robert Schuman Initiative, led at the University of Luxembourg by Prof. David Howarth. Our call for papers invited scholars to historically analyse the relationship between the EU single market and the internet from a critical perspective. This interdisciplinary issue mainly analyses how the development of the Internet has created major regulatory challenges at the EU level. It looks at the various stakeholders and their changing roles, the regulatory framework and its turning points, underlining policy changes but also strong legacies and continuities within EU policies and debates.","",""

"2020","Telecommunications Companies as Digital Broadcasters: The Importance of Net Neutrality in Competitive Markets"," This article examines the recent phenomenon of telecommunications companies distributing screen content over-the-top (OTT). It begins by localizing this international trend through an Australian case study and exploring how this process manifests in a relatively competitive telecommunications market. The article reveals that telecommunications companies going OTT contributes to increasing concentration among Australian Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and also raises a series of consumer issues. I go on to argue that the ownership or provision of telecommunications infrastructure must be separated from content distribution and that net neutrality needs to be embedded as a central media policy concern, even in markets with a relatively strong level of competition. However, the article also notes that such policies do not address the long-term profitability of telecommunications companies that are not already vertically integrated, a problem that future research needs to address.

"2021","The struggle for co-existence: communication policy by private technical standards making and its limits in unlicensed spectrum","ABSTRACT Huge increase in the demand by the wireless sector to use the airwaves has trained focus on the classic policy problem of resource scarcity in the field. This article illuminates a part of wireless communication – unlicensed spectrum – where a particularly fractious debate over the future usage of such space has developed between incumbent Wi-Fi interests and new entrants from the field of licensed mobile communication. The case is novel in that private technical standards making has become a site aimed at resolving what is a contest for co-existence in unlicensed spectrum. In its conceptualisation of private technical standards making processes as communication policy activity, the article illuminates both their affordances and limitations. It also shows the enduring utility of public regulatory steer in what are, in effect, private self-regulatory processes aimed at creating solutions to problems with a complex socio-technical character.","",""
