"2001","Content is not king","Широко известно, что Интернет – это система распространения информации, некого содержания. В то же время, если смотреть исторически, связь сама по себе оказывается более материальным понятием, чем содержание. Даже в Интернете содержание не настолько важно, насколько оно претендует (если это не послание e-mail, содержащее зловредный вирус-убийцу). Главенство связи над содержимым объясняет феномен, который сбил с толку исследователей беспроводных систем: почему с энтузиазмом была воспринята SMS-технология (Short Message System) и весьма прохладно принят протокол WAP (Wireless Application Protocol)? Основываясь на статистических данных, показывающих уровень использования сотовых телефонов, автор показывает, что вводимые 3G-системы также будут первоначально использоваться для речевого общения, а не для доступа в Интернет. В статье подчеркивается мысль, что гигантские суммы, выделяемые на поддержку содержания (контента) расходуются не по назначению.","",""
