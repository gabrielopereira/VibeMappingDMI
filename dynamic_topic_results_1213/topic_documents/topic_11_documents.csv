"2000","Cooling Hot","Computer-mediated technologies (CMT) have created many opportunities for the arts. Some of those opportunities have been about re-purposing or re-mediating existing practices. Elsewhere, emergent practices, which are significantly different to what have gone before, are evident. A growing body of CMT works contest traditional practices in that there is no single unique or master copy; in the way the roles of maker and consumer are reapportioned; in the ways digital media themselves, physically and extra-linguistically, differ from previous display technologies; and in the user’s knowledge of what is missed or skipped.3 A particular feature of CMT art practices is ’new media’ interactivity: sequences of textual, visual and aural display guided by human actions of varying complexity which create new variations or instances of the work which are unique to the occasion and result from the reflexive selection of the user. Widening cultural and economic access to fast, reliable and responsive, local and networked systems means that such interactivity is now an increasingly important site of cultural activities.","",""
"2000","From the times of the first scribes: innovation and technology within graphic design","The authors use their different work and training background as perspectives for discussing the changing world of graphical design. In this digital world, expert knowledge of the technology is essential, but the authors argue that a consequence of prioritising technical expertise in the new interdisciplinary IT- design studies may be a loss of quality in design. To improve the depth in design the authors introduce a psychological framework for design work and on this basis they suggest a systematic method. The method is a 4-step conceptual model: reason, function, emotion and senses, and technology. The model interacts with all phases of the design, and functions as a generating-creating and execution-evaluation system. The authors emphasise that evaluation is embedded throughout the design process. They suggest that a systematic method becomes the guiding tool in interdisciplinary design education, an essential part of the students design qualifications as well as an essential tool in design work.","",""

This paper argues that architects are now moving away from this paradigm and are able to use computer systems to handle greater complexity of form. It discusses the possible advantages and disadvantages of this, with particular reference to architect-client relations.","",""

"2000","The design and evaluation of an interactive calculator for children","The aim of the research project reported here was to investigate the potential use of multimedia systems in teaching primary mathematics to pupils with learning difficulties. A multimedia interactive calculator (MIC), that combines learning materials with a calculator interface, has been designed as a result of classroom-based studies together with iterative prototype evaluation. The visual styling and operation of the MIC is the consequence of design decisions made in response to a user-need analysis carried out as part of this research. The MIC mediates between the concrete stage of learning number and the manipulations of symbolic arithmetical representations, particularly as they are used in the standard calculator, a transition which is difficult for many pupils to make. The work shows that multimedia systems can be helpful to children in making this transition. However, the authors agree that the careful use of an information design approach is needed to produce successful software. The MIC has been shown to be useful in teaching the concepts of number and the routines of addition and subtraction. Its interactive multiplication tables have helped pupils to discover number patterns and to improve their recall of number facts.","",""
"2000","The Sadeian interface: computers and catharsis","This paper explores the limitations of contemporary interface design and offers the potential of more profound forms of interaction by drawing on the rich and much older heritage of interactive art. Whilst HCI design is preoccupied with making the computer more simple to use, installation work, kinetic sculpture, and interactive multimedia art forms have generally been more concerned with the predicament of human/technological negotiation, whilst remaining a salient form of human communication. HCI activity sets out to make the complex systems of computing easy to understand and use, whilst interactive art often uses simple technology to make complex, inspiring and esoteric statements and experiences. In many ways the more simple and 'low resolution' the technology the more immersive, acute and intimate the experience. 'Low resolution' examples such as telephone-sex-lines are explored alongside more immersive systems, such as biofeedback interfaces, and other interactive experiments drawn from the 'technic' strand of art history.","",""
"2000","The integration of theory and practice in teaching designing for the screen","Future typographic and graphic designers will need to be able to design for a range of media, both to secure their role and to provide the necessary design expertise in technological environments. This paper proposes an approach to teaching which introduces theoretical issues within a practical design project to encourage the development of general concepts that can be transferred to different technologies. A specific project on designing for the screen is described, which is taught as part of a BA degree in Typography & Graphic Communication. In the context of this project, reasons for introducing theory are proposed, examples of the nature of the theory are given, and the methods used to introduce material are illustrated. A detailed account of one student's implementation of this project is used to demonstrate how theoretical issues can provide direction in a design task. However, careful consideration needs to be given to how theory and practice are integrated to encourage students to look beyond the short-term benefits of specific training to the development of more general knowledge.","",""

This paper describes an EU ACTS project called RESOLV which develops an integrated system to capture real 3D environments using laser and video. Current research on motion tracking, statistical behaviour modelling and simulation is presented, and possible applications, both for visual augmentation and audio generation, are discussed. The projects presented were not originally designed in the domain of theatre and performance, however their results and output seem to be well suited to be applied in this area.","",""
"2001","Avatarculture: Narrative, power and identity in virtual world environments","Drawing on the work of Raymond Williams, this paper examines avatar culture through the interplay of emergent and residual forces. A dual process is at work in the formation of cultural identities in which the enabling conditions of virtual worlds are understood alongside and in relation to pre-existing off-line phenomenon. Avatar culture confirms structure for participants, especially in relation to gender and sexuality, whilst at the same time providing a reflexive space to break with pre-existing features of social identity. Virtual environments are thus microcosms of a grounded cultural materiality that is simultaneously improvised on and transformed. With regard to the distinctive aspects of avatar culture the paper focuses on issues of narrative, representation, censorship and power relations and their formation within virtual worlds. It discusses how virtual worlds incrementally acquire a peculiar power and meaning in the lives of participants. The paper discusses the flows of social interaction in virtual environments and how intermittence best describes how users participate and withdraw from different encounters. Avatar culture binds people together temporarily and loosely and then frees them up to relocate themselves elsewhere. In this context, virtual environments might be regarded as putting structure and power into movement. The ethnographic approach adopted helps peel back the residue of social structure to reveal a virtual agency with its emerging shells of avatar-derived affiliations, tensions and conflicts.","",""
"2001","Deeper Conversations with Interactive Art","computer-based interactive art being produced, spurred on by the advent of the internet and World Wide Web. Hundreds of experimental works are being created as artists struggle to understand the computer as a new medium for art, which in turn is fueling the establishment of dozens of ’new media’ departments, institutes, festivals, museums and web sites to serve and showcase the work. As I navigate this wildly diverse, sometimes confusing landscape of computer-based art, I find myself searching for works that truly take advantage of the capabilities that, from my experience as a designer and programmer of interactive virtual characters, I know the computer can offer.","",""
"2001","In Love with our Technology: Virtual Reality"," The intellectual history suggests that desire for intelligence augmentation underlies the idea of virtual reality (VR). The assumption underlying this teleological thrust towards intelligence augmentation is that intellectual advances are made by improving and facilitating human thinking and problem solving. This was thought possible only if computers were integrated effectively into the whole ecology of thought by virtue of a human-computer partnership, or symbiosis. VR media are seen as augmenting intelligence by more direct, intuitive channelling of information through the senses to establish a more direct interface, or experience with knowledge. The history of the idea of virtuality shows that policy, personnel choice and placement, and research and development aimed to implement this vision for VR. Related work led to the internet as focus was placed on networked, cooperative interaction - computers and people working together to augment human intelligence. ","",""

The effects of computing on the architectural design process can hardly be overstated. Yet, to date, its effects on the design product seem limited to novelties of computer modelling, and manufacturer-driven security/building operation systems. These merely substitute previous techniques with new technologies much as CAD displaced conventional drafting and rendering.","",""
"2001","Exchange Fields: Embodied Positioning as Interface Strategy","The work Exchange Fields was commissioned by the exhibition Vision Ruhr, held in Dortmund, Germany, in 2000. The work was a collaboration between the Dutch dancer/choreographer Regina Van Berkel, myself and the programmer Gideon May. The central question dealt with the generation of a new kind of interface how might an embodied experience of interface be layered into the content of an interactive media/dance comprised of video, text, a sculptural installation and music? Exchange Fields sought to develop a novel interface strategy by eliciting culturally determined environmental ’behaviour in relation to objects’ as a grammar of gesture that could be used as input to the reacting system. The physical interface system functioned as an embodied intuition. The work sought to tap into prelinguistic environmental knowledge related to the use of particular varieties of objects. A series of furniture/sculptures were developed. Each furniture/sculpture was designed with a unique implied ’suggestion’ of how the body might be positioned in relation to that","",""
"2001","Traces"," Traces is an artwork for the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) that uses a novel machine vision system to enable unencumbered full body interaction with a range of semi-autonomous agents without the imposition of any sort of textual, iconic or encoded gestural interfaces and without physically restrictive wiring, pointing devices, or headgear. Furthermore, Traces does not consist of a 'world' which is 'navigated'; instead, the movement of the user through the space leaves volumetric and spatial-acoustic residues of user movement that slowly decay. This project was motivated by a desire to explore and critique four central issues in contemporary human-computer interface (HCI): (a) embodied interaction with computational systems; (b) rapid and transparent learning of interfaces by untrained users (the autopedagogic interface); (c) immersive bodily interaction with software agents, (d) extension and elaboration of the general conception of 'interactivity' itself. To explore these issues, we built an infrared (IR) multi-camera machine vision system that constructs a volumetric model of the whole of the user's body in real time. We have also developed custom thee-dimensional vision tools, graphical techniques and a range of techniques for generating and managing semi-autonomous agents in immersive environments. ","",""
"2001","Building on diversity: crafting a paradigm for digital design environments","Advanced computer systems for 3D design and modelling are widely used in many areas of design and manufacturing. However, although they offer undoubted benefits, there is growing awareness of their inadequacy to meet the range of capabilities required by designers. Limited types of design representations can be created in the virtual environment. The precise, detailed geometric modelling techniques are unsuited to the earlier stages of design, and emphasise the creation and visualisation of three-dimensional form, rather than the more dynamic and functional aspects of working with materials. There is a discrepancy between the highly sophisticated three-dimensional models, and current ‘two-dimensional’ ways of interacting with them via mouse and screen. In most systems, a complex user interface requires extensive experience before it can be used transparently. Ways of interacting intuitively and expressively in three dimensions are now highly desirable. Rapid advances in digital technologies, such as haptic and gesture interfaces, 3D imaging, and more intuitive modelling techniques, offer us a means of moving away from the ‘desk-top box’ scenario to more fluid and flexible human-centred ‘digital design environments’. The potential of such technologies to allow a less constrained, more naturalistic interaction with virtual models has increased the drive towards computer support for the whole design process, in particular for conceptual design. To take full advantage of these developments, we must understand how the types of interaction they enable are, or could be, used in the design process. Existing systems have developed around the ‘design-by-drawing’ paradigm, but this does not adequately reflect the complexity, diversity and individuality of designers’ processes. To truly move forward, a radical re-evaluation is required.","",""
"2001","Making it new: transformations in the grammar and identity of digital printmaking","Notions of skill and sensitivity in fine art printmaking have been transformed by the new action and knowledge environments brought about by digital technologies. However, the off-the-shelf programs used in these environments are still influenced by an ideology that promotes the simulation of traditional techniques, which in turn prevent a move away from conventional forms of depiction. The ideological stance that drives these programs is problematic because it re-enforces out-dated artistic paradigms. In order to move beyond these paradigms, artists who work with digital technologies will need to be more critical of attempts merely to import techniques analogous to those used in traditional practice (e.g. processing applications that only provide a virtual equivalent to traditional painting, drawing, montage, and photographic methods) and will have to face down the tendency to mimic existing paint and print media. What we need for computer printmaking is the sort of interdependence and autonomy gained by an all-digital approach.","",""

"2001","A preliminary poetics for interactive drama and games","Interactive drama has been discussed for a number of years as a new AI-based interactive experience. While there has been substantial technical progress in building believable agents and some technical progress in interactive plot, no work has yet been completed that combines plot and character into a full-fledged dramatic experience. Part of the difficulty in achieving interactive drama is due to the lack of a theoretical framework guiding the exploration of the technological and design issues surrounding it. This paper proposes a theory of interactive drama integrating Laurel's Aristotelian structural model with Murray's concept of agency. The resulting theory illuminates the general conditions under which a user will experience agency in any interactive experience and provides design and technology guidance for the particular case of building interactive dramatic worlds.","",""
"2001","Origination and exploitation of high-quality digital materials for courseware development: a student-centred approach","This research project seeks to identify the points in the new materials/pedagogic production and application at which a student's perception and expectation of pedagogic interface design, navigation and learning activities are judged/mapped against their real-world experience. It asks whether, on the basis of this observation, new approaches to teaching and learning material design should be adopted, and what these new approaches should be if the materials produced are to satisfy expectations while enhancing the students' generic and transferable skills base. This paper describes the author's involvement as a developer with the Higher Education Funding Councils' initiative into computers and learning. It outlines some of our attempts to investigate a genuinely student-centred approach to the production of an exemplar for computer-assisted musical courseware in the HEI. It asks two main questions: 1. what range of approaches to music-based courseware design might be employed; 2. how do we chart student perceptions, expectations and evaluation of instructional courseware and the computer as an interface? The paper provides a brief overview of the project in practical terms, it considers pedagogic and cultural implications, and it outlines the methodological enquiry and application, including examples of visual data and commentary. It concludes with an interpretation of the interim findings, and identifies directions for further research.","",""

The research proposal charted the characteristics of digital art, which were based on apparent physical conditions (ex. nonmateriality) as well as on conditions related to the artist’s gesture and intention (ex. immediate reversibility). However during the development of the research my interest in the process of the creative activity and its role in the forming of subjectivity replaced the focus on the characteristics of digital art and their effect on subjectivity. 3.

"2001","Beyond the icon: the role of the image in human computer interface (HCI) design","If we examine communication we see the origins of some of the most fundamental systems of reconciling experience. Primarily, it is our systems of classification and categorisation that allow us to objectify the world and assign names to ‘collections’ of experience. Such ordering has resulted in the isolation and establishment of a basic unit of communication, the sign. However, the sign can never be the original, as communication inherently involves taking aspects of experience and converting them into a different form that merely re-presents the original. Pierce describes the different association of a sign to ‘its object’ as either an icon, index or symbol (Figure 1). An icon refers to a sign that resembles its object in some way, such as a picture of a fire. An index is related to its object by an existential connection, in the way smoke is associated with a fire and finally the word ‘fire’ itself is a symbol, as we have learned to understand it through convention.","",""

This paper records the development of the conceptual design of the gallery. It tells the story, not of the design process, but of the key design decisions, and the theoretical and practical considerations behind them, that transformed the initial concept into the reality of a final product. The project looked at the potential of new technology to approximate presentation and display, and one of the driving issues in the design was the primacy and authenticity of the object. By focussing on the issues relating to museums and museum display theory the project arrived at a solution that was shaped by these issues, rather than being driven by the technology. The final design represents a synergy between the salient features of a museum and gallery visit, an academic print publication, and a museum catalogue.","",""

In its inherently ergodic nature, that discourse exists as particular instances which may never be shared. In its inevitable narrativity, in its construction of meaning through fleeting fragments juxtaposed in time, and in its unique instance determined by selection and selection histories, this discourse is unlike that of other media and represents a distinct and different way of storying the world.

"2002","The Synthetic Image","                            Author's Note: The Theme of the Loop: Image, Exhibition and Networkability             In his contribution to the anthology, The Digital Dialectic, George P. Landow inventories a set of characteristics that define digital media. These defining traits result from a hybrid mixture of ideas relating hypertext writing to the visual language of collage. Included in this list is the quality of """"networkability"""".1 It is through reading into this particular element that I will focus on the character of the digital image itself as multi-dimensional and how, by extension, this enmeshes notions of the image within a wider network of relations; of image to the imaginary, of vision to visuality, and of artwork to exhibition. Underpinning this text will be my curatorial """"projection""""2—using the term as it is articulated by Ron Burnett as an active, interpenetration of the processes of vision, representation, technology and the imagination—of the digital image culminating in the exhibition, The Synthetic Image.3 The exhibition presents the work of thirteen artists working within the vectors that define imaging practices informed by new technologies. Exploring the relationship between the real and the virtual, the selected artists and artworks exemplify the crossover between a variety of digital and interactive media informed by other artistic traditions and individual positions on the role of the image in representing, simulating or creating realities.            The perspective of this project views the relationship between digital technologies and the image as a synthetic one. Recognizing the ability to double and fold in the malleability of the material from which the digital image is composed, the dichotomy of inside and outside collapses. Instead of conceiving, visualizing pixels as a solid, impenetrable grid, I've tried, rather, to recognize in this resulting surface the qualities of a fabric, as a mesh of interpenetrating, weaving fibres. Instead of the content of the image being contained in the """"solid"""" pixels, it is implied in the """"threads"""" of the screen holding together the field of relationships, looping like a closed electrical or magnetic circuit. The vectors of relationship bound the """"empty"""" image; fastening, holding together and forming the picture.             In many ways my approach to this topic (as artist, curator and, in this immediate guise, as author) finds expression in the term """"synthesis"""" defined as a """"rhythmic coexistence of radically heterogenous and temporally dispersed elements"""".4 The virtuality of this thing called an """"exhibition"""" is approached as a narrative space; a fluid, complex epistemological environment. The curatorial role makes evident the subtext of diverse strands connecting respective works and artists and collects them in the space of the gallery in an attempt to draw them into the """"loop.""""            The exhibition/ installation operates by gathering together disparate components into what is as much a """"context"""" as a physical and spatial realization. The choice and arrangement of artworks, displayed as printed images or encountered as fleeting emanations of light, creates channels of communication where meaning is more than implied, and can be likened to the type of referentiality associated with that of the image produced by projection and the apparatus of the projector itself. Considered in this way, even static images, fixed into pigment on paper, operate luminously, acting like beacons which together form a constellation of points creating lines of force, motion, influence and meaning; the exhibition itself is a loop structure which enfolds and encircles its incorporated range of (inter, hyper, meta and para) textual components.             The writing also parallels a similarly conceived and structured trajectory towards the metaphor of the loop. At its inception, I developed a graphic visualization of the textual content of this text, meditating upon the interrelationships of the synthetic qualities of the image fused with a mapping of theoretical positionings and the example provided through the exhibition itself. This diagram of sorts resulted in a narrative structure which collects the various themes (mesh, weave, wire frame, map, moire and screen) within the text's centrifugal sweep, overlapping with the artists' works comprising the exhibition, and made possible by the navigation structure realized by Leon Meyer. In exploring the formal possibilities offered by hypertext, multiple vantage points and intersections result from the folding and overlapping of image and text. As with crumpling the written page into a ball,5 synthetic qualities are realized.             Enter """"The Synthetic Image"""".

Collaborative virtual environments (CVEs) allow several users to interact simultaneously within the virtual environment, each taking different perspectives or role-play characters. Within the AS interactive project a series of SVEs and CVEs have been developed in collaboration with users and professional groups with an overall aim of supporting social skills learning.

Ozlab extends the traditional, linguistically- based Wizard-of-Oz technique for manual prototyping to graphical interaction. The pilot study indicates that a refined Ozlab could be used by inexperienced designers for testing their own ideas. The fact that requirements of interactivity thus can be visualised by laymen will have implications for the design of requirements specification for multimedia products.","",""
"2002","Interacting with pictures: film, narrative and interaction","The article explores the spatial practices of film in order to better understand the design of digital interactive media. The criteria used in the design and selection of the film image are discussed and a novel view of film as a pragmatic and highly economical form of picture making is proposed. The difficulties are highlighted of simply transferring such imagery to an interactive context, but it is argued that the same guiding principles can be applied in the newer medium. It is suggested that the demands of visual interaction are leading to the development of new pictorial modes, but that much work remains to be done. In particular it is proposed that the mature expressivity of traditional film is a goal to which designers of pictorial interactive media should aspire.","",""

It is necessary to develop computer tools that narrow the gap that still persists between the perceived form and the computer representation of a shape. We present a set of prototype tools to create two-dimensional compositions, whose purpose is to facilitate the interaction between designer and computer. The tools have been used to teach architecture students some fundamental implications in the use of computers to design.","",""

"2003","The Technological Construction of Performance"," Performance in film is more than straightforward recording of actors; performances were (and are) often constructed in postproduction by technological means. Today with digital effects, we are seeing an unprecedented degree of technological advances that allow the breaking up, recombining, and reconfiguring of actors' abilities as multiple forms of input. This essay examines the history behind the technological construction of performance, the elements which performances have been divided into, and some of the ways in these divisions redefine what we have traditionally thought of as constituting a performance, which has become in many ways a more collaborative effort instead of the work of an individual 'star' performer.

By interactive systems we mean both systems and artworks, where the user by interacting changes the course of events. We intend to show why we need new terms and why we consider Field to be a fruitful concept and term. Further we will show how the Field concept changes both our understanding of what we do as designers and composers and how we acknowledge our audience. We will exemplify the design consequences of the Field concept by going through some design considerations we made when designing the audio tactile installation Mufi.","",""

"2003","Making art in a digital/cyber culture: exploring the dialectic between the manual creator and the digital self","Traditional forms of art making practice have become more complex in this culture that increasingly relies on, and is fascinated by, computer technology and the Internet. The web has facilitated an incredible, often overwhelming amount of information that is multidimensional and multi-contextual, offering artists global connections. A new dialectic however, is emerging as artists approach their work from positions of both manual creators and digital selves. The dialectic raises issues and questions such as: How does the hands-on engagement with artists’ materials interchange with digital manipulation capabilities facilitated by a computer mouse? What do the artists have to say about an art practice that straddles real and virtual contexts? Using conversations with six visual artists of varying age and career levels, this paper begins to explore how digital technologies and cyberspace are affecting hand-made art processes, while highlighting the artists’ perceptions of how these new contexts are enveloping their practices. Issues of researching ideas on the web, integrating digital processes with hand drawn images and the seduction of digital manipulation programs and computer capabilities frame the artists’ conversations.","",""

"2003","The design implications of user selection between communication resources","In this paper it is argued that the dominant approach to designing multimedia communication environments, which focuses on trying to establish what group doing what kind of task in which situation will benefit from what sorts of communication media, is unproductive. Instead it is argued that design methods are needed that enable us to deal with particular situations, i.e., that enable particular users in a particular context get the best out of the resources at their disposal. After presenting a framework for understanding user selection of communication resources, a method that yields design/redesign recommendations through interpretation of the reasons for the user’s selection of a particular communication medium for a particular purpose from among competitive communication media, is described. It is shown how such analysis results in hypothesised communication needs that serve as a basis for design/ redesign recommendations. Finally, it is argued that the hypothesised communication needs derived from particular situations should become the focus of hypothesis testing research.","",""
"2003","Avatar Body Collision: enactments in distributed performance practices","This article is an account and analysis of the work of Avatar Body Collision, a globally distributed, collaborative performance group who use free Internet chat room technologies to perform live across multiple stages and screens. The company’s organising metaphors refer to the distributed performance practices of cyberformance, a form of virtual theatre, in an attempt to encapsulate a phenomenon whose ontological, aesthetic and epistemological condition is contentious, and the hybrid offspring of at least two disciplines: the performing arts and computer technology. The author—a member of the company—locates this undisciplined subject within what Roland Barthes has termed an ‘epistemological slide’, as an emergent performance form. Attention focuses on the process and outcomes of the cyberscript, Screen save her, performed in May 2002 at the 12-12 Time Based Festival, Cardiff School of Arts, and at Riverside Studios, London. Comparison is made between avatar, cyborg and character enactments within the context of distributed performance practices. The primary conceptual framework for this production draws on the work of Murray Gell-Mann and complex adaptive theory. Analysis of spectator feedback from Screen save her ascribes key areas where spectator competencies were misjudged and where spectator expectations remediated the performance event. Additionally, the author speculates about the necessary conditions for developing new performance languages and wonders if a theatre stage is a malleable enough context for such endeavours.","",""

The dispute is growing as to whom these digital manifestations belong to. The dispute is in part due to the ability of the technology to transfer the avatars and also in part on the desire of the software manufacturers to enforce the end user licence agreements. These licences do not follow contract theory but have been enforced by the courts. Despite the actions of the court their validity as a whole is still questionable. This paper contains descriptions of the disputed objects and presents the arguments of both sides. There is also a presentation of the law regulating the area and its rationale, strengths and weaknesses. Then there follows a critique of the law as it is and a presentation of what the law could, and indeed in some cases, should be. In the conclusion this work both describes the importance of this issue and what is at stake if an equitable and reasonably balanced solution to the collective rights cannot be found.","",""

"2004","Experience and design methods: cross-dressing and border-crossings","We are pleased to present this special issue on experience and design methods. This issue has its origins in a workshop organised by Ron Wakkary, Thecla Schiphorst and Jim Budd (2004), titled ‘Cross-dressing and border crossing: exploring experience methods across disciplines’, held as part of the ACM SIGCHI 2004 conference in Vienna, Austria. The workshop was to all appearances among the strangest gatherings at SIGCHI 2004. Blindfolded researchers were spied wandering the fluorescent-lit lower concourse of the Austria Center in Vienna, or dashing from table to food-court table in a tag-like game whose rules remained obscure. But the playful, seemingly aimless movement of the participants belied a serious purpose. The practice of designing interactive objects, environments and systems has outgrown its roots in Human Computer Interaction (HCI), with its residual load of cognitive science. We engage in interactive experiences out of choice, in search of the pleasures of the mind and senses we have hitherto found in performance, art or our experience of architectural spaces. For the workshop organisers and participants, a provocation is required: hence, cross-dressing, the opportunity to try on new roles and experience design methods coming from art and design— disciplines often marginalised by the research community. The workshop received an overwhelming response and unfortunately only about fifteen percent of the position papers submitted were accepted.

The account begins with a discussion of the nature of conventional picture space and its separation from real-world space, and the roles of the picture frame or boundary in maintaining that separation. Perceptual depth cues implicated in the viewing of both types of spaces are briefly examined, leading to a consideration of the ‘hybrid’ perceptual spaces that can emerge when cues are integrated and the frame nullified. The authors describe computer-aided methods for creating anamorphic imagery and displaying it in studio/gallery contexts, and consider the properties and nature of the unconventional pictures and viewing experiences thus defined. They argue that anamorphic perspectives are effectively frameless and are rich in potential for development by fine artists and other image-makers in a variety of applications and situations.","",""

"2004","Digital mnemonics","Architectural design involves a process of iteration and testing which is closely akin to practice-based research and lends itself naturally to this approach in the University environment. Academic research into the relationship between mnemonics and spatial theory reveals the significant part architecture can play in developing the design of memorable virtual environments. The art of memory, which has largely been forgotten in the 21st century, may provide a theoretical context for this research. As we increasingly rely on mechanised forms of memory storage and recall on computer screens, these synthetic memories become ever more complex, and the creation of new methods of representing them becomes pressing. To this end traditional ‘Memory Arts’, based in physical architecture and spatial orientation, are a fruitful source of inspiration. The concept of ‘architectural mnemonics’, which grows from the memory arts, requires a multidisciplinary approach for it to be fully understood. The virtual environments produced using such a theory also require input from different disciplines to allow them to be fully analysed and tested. The interdisciplinary nature of the work reflects the many sided approaches of architecture, which always include both scientific and artistic elements. Through carrying out such practice-based experimental work, both the practice and theory of architecture are advanced and extended.","",""

In particular (multi)media art can serve as an experimental laboratory, not only for new technologies but, especially, for studies of the new social relation(ship)s created or fuelled by those technologies. Media and multimedia information and communication technologies generate new promises, problems, and threats; and artists undertake efforts to examine this emerging area that has been repeatedly considered as a ‘post-biological syndrome’.

In this context designers are more like architects than authors, constructing a database of narrative possibilities that exist within the framework of a conceptual environment. By linking the elements of this database, the user can discover and co-author the narrative, generating a unique work that subverts the passive, voyeuristic role in which audiences experience traditional time-based narrative media and reshaping the relationship between the designer and user. In forming this relationship designers must link narrative and spatial considerations with design functionality that is grounded in the subjective elements of the user experience rather than simple usability goals.","",""

Their use of video interaction analysis showed that when a model was a physical object students ‘touched, pointed at, manipulated and gestured’ with the object. In contrast immersive technology nearly became the subject of the design review ‘due to the undesirable usability problems of the ImmersaDesk’. In retrospect the attempt to make the virtual act as a substitute for the physical was bound to raise issues. But in pushing beyond the hype of new technology Bucolo and Brereton developed an understanding of the role that the virtual object could play as a vehicle for abstract thought. In contrast Sundholm, Ramberg, and Artman’s Learning conceptual design followed ‘students during the conceptual design phase’ within a technologically mediated ‘co-located collaborative workspace’. However by dwelling on the reticence of users to ‘publicly’ expose aspects of their work, primarily their ability to draw, the success of this work was understated. In marked contrast to the problems that Bucolo and Brereton encountered, the problems discovered here were due to the fact communication was facilitated. In fact students solved this problem through the fl exibility of the system, appropriating images from the web and creating their own symbols to represent what they would have drawn.

"2006","Interruption/Interaction/Collaboration:  A Critical Appraisal of the Textual @traction Interactive Event","            This article reflects upon the process of the making and screening of an interactive short film called Textual @traction, which I wrote and directed.    The film is 12 minutes long, 35mm film, and shows how a series of messages sent to a lost mobile phone inadvertently allows two gay men to declare their love for each other. In the form of a puzzle, the film denies sight of the crucial messages sent between the characters, messages which motivate their actions. However, through the simple use of SMS (Short Message System) text technology, the audience can receive each of these messages on their own mobile phones as they watch the film in the cinema.     Billed as an interactive event with prior information for audience telephone registration, the film has been screened at cinemas, film festivals, and conferences as well as on broadcast television.  To receive the text messages during the film, the phone owner is asked to send a message before the screening to a five-digit number that registers their telephone for the event. If audience members do not have a mobile phone, they must share with another audience member or try to solve the puzzle of the film without messages.    Messages are sent to audience members’ mobile/cell phones from a laptop computer by a bulk SMS delivery programme, via an SMS gateway, directly to the appropriate national mobile telephone network provider, guaranteeing split-second accuracy. When appropriate and depending on the location of the screening, audience members can also choose the language of the messages when they register.   Textual @traction was nominated for UK BAFTA Interactive Award 2005 and won the Best New Media: Interactive Award at the Celtic Film Festival 2005. It has been shown in a number of international film festivals, including the International Festival of New Film, in Split, Croatia 2004; the International Short Film Festival in Los Angeles 2005(Academy-listed); and the Atlantic Film Festival, Halifax, Nova Scotia, 2005.  It had its broadcast premier, and world-first for an interactive film, on S4C (Sianel Pedwar Cymru), the Welsh Language Channel with its Welsh title, ‘Caru T x’, on 25 Jan. 2006.   This article addresses the audience’s experience of this interactive event, speculating on the relative audience/user positions inherent in the two technologies (cinema and mobile telephone) and on whether or not their combination can be described as a collaboration.    Underpinning this speculation is the assumption that modes of representation and communication construct the subject/user in specific ways and that the Textual @traction interactive event requires of the audience member to occupy both the position of cinema viewer and of phone user alternately during the event if they are to ‘complete’ the fiction.   Following on from this assumption, I have set out a number of oppositions: Live/Dead, Social/Individual, Intimate/Anonymous, and Passive/Active, against which the differences between the two technologies and the ways they construct the viewer/user are posited.  These polarities also allow exploration of the various aspects of the suspension of disbelief assumed by the viewer of the film and whether the interruption to the flow of images and sounds on the cinema screen by the actions required of the viewer to retrieve and read the telephone messages dismantles that suspension by spoiling the viewer’s identification with the characters, undermining their assumptions governing the world of the film, and shattering its temporal and spatial coherence.    As writer and director of the film, my initial intention was not to set out to explore these questions at all.  Once the story took shape and I saw the possibility that the only dialogue in the film was that delivered by text message, it was a short step (albeit, initially, a frivolous one!) to investigate the possibility of delivering those messages to the audience during the screening of the film.  I dislike reading diegetic written text on the cinema screen, believing it to be a betrayal of cinema’s essential qualities: it is a medium of pictures and sounds, not words.   Of course, once it became clear that it was going to be possible to send time-specific messages to the audience members, enabling them to simultaneously read the very same message the character on screen is reading, I soon became intrigued by the potential effect this would have on the audience.  Would it ‘deepen’ the process of identification with the characters?  None of the characters in the film are aware of each other’s identity when they communicate and thus the narrative unfolds with dramatic irony.  Would the audience’s resulting privileged knowledge in relation to the characters be enhanced by the film’s interactive dimension, because the characters are ‘unaware’ that the audience members are reading ‘their messages’?   The following explores these questions and is, to a large extent, a product of observation and analysis of the interactive event, post-event, and also includes reflection on comments from audience members that have attended the event.   Live/Dead   Textual @traction has been constructed according to the principles of classic continuity, with every shot contributing to the narrative chain.  At the end of the film, there is closure, both the conventional culmination and the objective of the classic (Hollywood) narrative, the classic continuity approach.   Textual @traction, like all forms of cinema—whether classic narrative, avant-garde, multi-screen, or home movie—is a record of past events.  In this film we engage with re-animated past events at twenty-four still frames a second, willingly suppressing whatever knowledge and awareness of apparatus and artifice we possess.    However, while knowledge of a process of construction and presentation are suppressed, there is no necessity for the viewer to believe that the events on screen are happening as we observe them.  We know these events are in the past; rather, it is the knowledge of the active arrangement of these discreet, past events (shots, scenes, sequences…) into a natural flow that we necessarily suppress.  This is achievable, of course, by our unconscious operation of a complex system that organises this flow into spatial, temporal, and narrative coherence.    ‘Film language’ is the term given to this internalised vocabulary we bring to bear on a film to make sense of what we see and hear—modified in each film, some more than others.  It allows us to understand spatial and temporal construction, to accept ellipses, parallel action and so on.  It is a very complex system, which in classical continuity is mobilised in the service of the story and rendered invisible, so that a film unfolds as if conforming to natural laws (Bazin; Metz; Monaco).   I made the decision at an early stage in the development process for Textual @traction that the film would do precisely this.  While I wanted the film to be challenging and ‘experimental’, I believed its potential for breaking new ground resided in the realm of the juxtaposition/collaboration of the two technologies and its impact on the viewer’s engagement with the fictional world of the story. The messages would necessarily be disruptive of a mode of presentation that is sacrosanct (at least in mainstream cinema) and I thought the tighter the narrative chain, the more apparent the effects of this juxtaposition/collaboration would be. Disruption does occur when the viewer receives a message (there are eleven in all during the 12 minutes of the film) and it is at these points that the viewer becomes phone user and the recipient of a ‘live’ communication that is time-specific.     Technically, each message is sent from the bulk-messaging programme to all the registered phones at the same time so that their arrival coincides with the arrival of the ‘same message’ in the on-screen character’s phone: audience member and on-screen character then read the same message simultaneously.  To achieve this, the start time of the computer programme and the start time of the film projection in the cinema have to coincide exactly.     One always presumes that text messages sent to our phones originate with a person, even those that are anonymous (news and sports alerts, etc.).  The assumption underlying the use of the messages in Textual @traction is that, since according to the classic narrative cinema-effect we ‘become’ each character in order to understand what motivates their actions (identifying most energetically with the protagonist), receiving the same text messages they are receiving and reading them at the same time as they are is consistent with this process of identification, although stretching it to its limits.   Crucial to the achievement of identification within the classic continuity approach is the point-of view shot, and it is this element that the messages ‘substitute’ or, perhaps, ‘literalise’ in the film (Bordwell 29-33; Branigan; Gaut 260-270). Conventionally in a film, when a character looks at something that is significant to the story, the look is followed on screen by the point-of-view shot, which shows the audience what is being seen by that character.     In Textual @traction, point-of-view shots are deployed in this conventional manner.  Moreover, as the main character in the film is a photographer whom we see taking photographs early in the film, the act of looking and the views he sees are, in fact, clearly foregrounded in a number of shot-reverse shot sequences.  However, when we see characters looking at their phones and reading the messages they’ve been sent by other characters in the film, these shots are not followed by point-of-view shots that show the messages they are reading.  Instead, the spectators in the cinema ‘enact’ their own point-of-view shot as they look at the same message on their phone screens in their hands.  In a ‘literal’ sense, the audience members, at these points, ‘become’ the characters.   Thus, in Textual @traction there is a two-fold process that reverses the live/dead polarity of cinema.  Firstly, the arrival of the message in the audience-member’s phone transforms the past event on the screen to a live one.  The suspension of disbelief in the viewer is heightened in order to accept the impossibility of acquiring the same knowledge the people on screen are acquiring, at the same time.  Secondly, the viewer in the cinema, when reading the messages, ‘becomes’ the fictional character, performing a live enactment of the point-of view shot that is missing on screen.  In both processes, phone technology bestows its live-ness to the dead world of the film—at least momentarily, until rational thought points out its absurdity.   Social/Individual   While going to the cinema is a social activity, the apparatus of cinema is organised in such a way as to individuate the cinema experience.  The combination of the dimming of the auditorium lights to darkness and the seating arrangement encourages the viewer to suppress the awareness of others.  The experience can then become intensely private.  While there are physical and aural constraints on the viewer’s behaviour, imposed mainly to guarantee other viewers’ enjoyment (including, ordinarily, the prohibition of mobile phone use!), once seated and still, the viewer feels entitled to respond to the action on the screen in whatever way appropriate: they can smile, shudder, or weep with impunity.     Additionally, the optics of the lens (the cinema projector reproducing the camera’s), in conjunction with the design of the auditorium itself, continues the tradition of Renaissance perspective in providing a single vanishing point that guarantees centrality to each viewer in relation to the scene depicted however many viewers there are in the cinema, wherever they are sitting.  As far as the apparatus of cinema is concerned, there is no privileged view of the visual field displayed on the screen; each viewer in the auditorium see the same view, wherever they sit, centred and interpolated individually.   Text-messaging is one-to-one communication par excellence. It takes speech telephone privacy one step further: even in a situation where both sender and receiver are in public spaces, surrounded by people, two-way communication can be completely private.    When every member of the audience in a screening of Textual @traction receives text messages, they receive them at the same time as everyone else, and they assume they are receiving the same message.  Emphasised by the cacophony of (individually-chosen) text alerts as each message reaches its destination within split seconds of each other, the simultaneity and the common address transforms what is usually an individual and private mode of communication into a collective, social one.  At the same time, the individuating effect of the cinematic apparatus is undermined.  Awareness of their counterparts’ presence returns, the light from individual phone screens illuminate the viewers’/phones users’ faces as they retrieve and read their messages and they look around the auditorium to compare their reactions with those of others.  In those moments, the social/individual polarity as it relates to the two technologies is reversed: the phone’s from individual to social; cinema, from individuating to collectivising.   Intimate/Anonymous   While the apparatus of cinema individuates, the address of cinema is anonymous, making no adjustment for the individual (Baudry; Comolli; De Lauretis). Of course, there is specificity in the address of most cinema: the various genre of commercial film, as well as the varieties of independent and avant-garde films, presume certain audiences and address these audiences on the basis of a shared set of assumptions and expectations.  These include individual films’ themes, the forms of narrative (or non-narrative), its variety of characters, the pleasures the films afford, and so on. However, cinema is not discursive.  It cannot by ‘adjusted’ to suit the individual.   The Intimate/Anonymous polarity is one that draws out the difference between a mode of representation, in this case cinema, and a mode of communication, text messaging.  The former presents a completed artefact of some kind while the latter is a technology that allows for discursive activity between sender and receiver.  Of course, various forms of interactive art are necessarily making this notion of the ‘artefact’ problematic, allowing the individual viewer to organise and re-organise narratives, modify environments, and create unique assemblages of images and sounds, often enabled by sophisticated computer programmes.  During such interaction, individuals may create never-to-be repeated experiences brought about by complex, randomised interfaces.  Nevertheless, these are examples of interaction with the artefact and while they may be unique, they are also anonymous.  If discursive activity between users is achieved in these circumstances then the technology by definition becomes a mode of communication, however mediated by technology or programming.   Telephone communication is all about individual address, both in spoken and text language.  A text messages is either sent to elicit a response or it is the response.  Unless it is an unsolicited, anonymous message, a text message is a specific and personal missive to the individual, its specificity arising from the sender’s knowledge of the receiver.  Receiving such text messages during Textual @traction (and because of the sexual tenor of some of the messages, they are especially ‘personal’)—‘sent’ to the audience members ‘unwittingly’ by the individual fictional characters on screen—transforms the address of the film from anonymous to intimate, from general to individual.  The intimacy associated with text messaging enhances our identification with the on-screen characters because we are given an insight into their motivations by being (voyeuristically) included what is generally a private discourse.  For those who have experienced the Textual @traction interactive event and who have expressed an opinion about it, it does seem that it was this dimension of the experience that was a particular source of pleasure.    Passive/Active   In mainstream cinema we enter the auditorium and we sit down to face the screen, on which the film appears.  While we watch and listen we may eat and drink, shout, weep, and laugh.  We can also leave if we disapprove of the film or of the behaviour of others around us.  While all these activities (and more) are possible, none will impact on what is happening on the screen, nor, crucially, on the flow of information that constructs our understanding of the characters’ actions and the narrative in general.  In this respect, as an audience, we are effectively passive.   The receiving of messages during Textual @traction invites the audience to collaborate actively in the final form of the narrative that is the interactive event, completing the fictional world constructed by film and text messages together.  The information they receive by text message enhances their understanding of both character motivation and of the narrative in general.  Without their activity, the film is a puzzle.     Added to the conceptual activity that this involves, there is also the physical activity and the psychological adjustment: when the audience members’ message alert sounds, they have to undertake a number of keystrokes on their keypad in order to bring the message up on the phone screen, then they have to read the message and construe the message’s relevance to the characters on screen, before returning to the cinema-screen element of the event once more.    Conclusion   There is no doubt that the Textual @traction interactive event strains credulity, or, to put it another way, depends on an enhancement of the suspension of disbelief normally accustomed to by a cinema audience.  The notion that on-screen characters are ‘unwittingly’ sending text messages to audience members and that they are reading them ‘at the same time’ is nothing short of absurd.  Absurdity and its wilful disregard by the audience, however, is no stranger to cinema, as we know.    What I have attempted to do in this paper is to account for the success of the Textual @traction interactive event, despite its absurdity, by identifying three forms of collaboration that it depends on: collaboration with the text in order to complete the fiction, a collaboration between cinema as a mode of representation and messaging as a mode of communication that the audience member enables, and a collaboration between cinema/subject and telephone/subject performed by each audience member.   As I have indicated, when these collaborations take place, some of the habitual characteristics of both modes are transformed or modified: text messaging becomes a social rather than a private activity, while the apparatus of cinema transforms from one that individuates to one that collectivises.  In addition, the address of cinema, normally anonymous, is bestowed with intimacy by the text messaging, and finally, a normally passive audience is active in their involvement to complete the fiction.

Designers have much at stake in the use of their software, while users are greatly influenced by the design of the software that they use. In this article, I explore the complex relationships built up between the designers and users of human anatomy simulations, including processes of cooperation and conflict. I develop and apply a three-step process for studying the design and use of a software product in its social context. First, it is important to focus on the social worlds of designers and users that influence the development of the technology. Next, the emphasis shifts to the technology itself, which can be viewed as a boundary object emerging from the intersection of the contributing social worlds. Finally, the technology exhibits agency by reshaping the relationships and interactions among the contributing social worlds.","",""
"2006","Beyond binary choices: Understanding and exploiting trade-offs to enhance creativity","Many research approaches are conceptualized as binary choices, representing endpoints of a spectrum (each of them providing important perspectives within their own discourses). Design and creativity are often conceptualized as being focused on one of these binary choices, thereby overlooking other possibilities. To better stimulate, enhance, and support creativity, our research has explored the middle ground between the endpoints defined by binary choices to identify “sweet spots” based on a careful trade–off analysis of specific goals, objectives, stakeholders, and socio–technical environments.  This paper illustrates some of the major trade–offs related to design and creativity that we have explored in our research over the last ten years, including prescriptive and permissive environments, individual and social creativity, communities of practice and communities of interest, and consumer and active contributor cultures. It briefly describes some of the socio–technical environments that we have developed to enhance creativity in specific contexts.","",""
"2006","Spatial dialectics: montage and spatially organised narrative in stories without human leads","Abstract This article analyses and formulates mechanisms for creating meaningful and engaging narrativity in interactive movies not based on character, where the dialectic relationship between architectural space and the rules that govern montage shape the narrative structure. Formalist analysis of Dziga Vertov's film Man with the Movie Camera (USSR, 1929) highlights two significant terms which play a centralrolein the formulation of the rhetoricalargument of the moving image. ‘Punctus-contra-punctum mon-tage’(‘counterpoint montage’) describes a technique that exploits analogies in form or content between adjacent clips, to produce meaningful thematic sequences; while Lev Kuleshov's ‘artificial landscapes’—the imaginary, creative geographies constructed of moving images that exist only on the screen—offer a way of arranging media spatially. A proof-of-concept, prototype production, Cambridge City Symphony (Alifragkis & Penz 2006), where these approaches are instantiated as rule-sets, and handled by the computer, illustrates how these produce engaging interactive narrativity.","",""
"2006","Back to the future: interactivity and associational narrativity at the Bauhaus","Abstract This paper contextualises the themes of interactivity and associational narrativity within a wider historicaltrajectory, by examining projects conducted at the Bauhaus during the 1920s. Bauhaus artists such as László Moholy-Nagy and Oskar Schlemmer developed models and theories for cinema, theatre and installation art, which sought to surrender authorial control and engage the audience as a creative force. As contemporary artists continue to debate how to transform interactivity into an aesthetically compelling rather than participatory activity, Bauhaus projects, with their focus on associational narratives and awareness of embodied cognition, offer inspiration for current practice.","",""
"2006","Computational and spatially-organised narrativity","In the first quarter of the 21 century, there is no sign of conventional linear storytelling disappearing or losing its expressive power; but at the same time, new genres of non-linear games, television, music, drama and cinema, supported by the computer, have become a reality—rather than a theoretical possibility. On the one hand, these rely on the heritage of conventional storytelling genres; on the other, they draw on—and sometimes generate—new, contemporary, interactive-media technologies and approaches. In these emerging art-forms, developed in what Murray terms a ‘processcentred medium’ (Murray 1997, p.182), linear narrative thinking is expanded to include—or inhabit—the space of narrative potentials. The spatial organisation of narrative has become a shared ground for many kinds of creativity, enabling a range of conceptualisations and interaction-frameworks, designed to activate these potentials as new kinds of narrative experience that are engaging and immersive. “Of the three types of immersion”, claims Ryan, “the spatial variety has the most to gain from the built-in spatiality of pictures” (Ryan 2001, p.263)—and visualising storyspace is as important as structuring the story itself. With the inclusion of the computer, the borders between screen-space and participatory space, action and participation, shift and re-form to compelling dramatic effect. At the symposium Computational and Spatially Organised Narrative held at Media Centre LUME, Helsinki, April 26–29 2006, a representative sample of practical and theoretical work in the field was brought together for discussion; and from that process emerged all the articles in this special issue of Digital Creativity. In this context, computational narrative and spatial organisation appear as already well-established phenomena, of which the historical roots deserve attention. The light of historical discovery is shed by Alifragkis and Penz, who revisit, for example, Vertov’s work and Kuleshov’s ‘artificial landscapes’, mining them for metadata categories to create new portraits of the city using interactive digital media. Prager, who reviews the work of Moholy-Nagy, Schlemmer and other Bauhaus artists, finds models for the computational treatment of visual cinematic narrativity today, while Tikka, Vuori and Kaipainen revive Eisenstein’s ‘montage machine’ for the algorithmic generation of narrative flow. Spatial organisation is discussed in two senses in this issue: the ontological space of content, and the physical space of installation—which interact and relate to each other in various fertile ways. Artopoulos and Condorcet elaborate an idea for parametrically generative physical viewing-space as the matrix for generative video narrative, which embodies the practice of gamelike ‘what if? ...’ storytelling. In a similar spirit, Sussner, Thomas and Richens formulate the topography of cinematic narrative as architectural construction, refashioning Kevin Lynch’s urban categories (Lynch 1960, p.6) and Christian Norberg-Schulz’s concept of place (Norberg-Schulz 1986, p.29) as design ontology for both 3D-environment and cinematic narrative structure. This approach has strong similarities with the work of Tikka, Vuori and Kaipainen, who propose a formal definition of virtual narrative space in terms of ontological dimensions—that is, multidimensional characterisations of the content which constitutes the nature and existence of a particular storyworld, and carry meaning when associated with storylines that cross its space. In these conceptualisations, ontological dimensions constitute the co-ordinate system in which the building-blocks of the story reside, and which allows the fixing of waypoints for navigating the space, and generating narrative sequences algorithmically. The narrative spaces of several works presented in the current issue can, in principle, be analysed as such ontological space—Obsession (Tikka, Vuori and Kaipainen), Gormenghast Explore (Sussner and Thomas), House of Affects e d it o ri a l","",""

A distinctive mark of this pedagogic approach has been to look upon computer technology as an opportunity to rethink the methods, contents and goals of architecturaleducation,in thelight of contemporary culture. The course is structured in six themes, each one standing for a ‘system of representation’: ‘text’, ‘figure’, ‘object’, ‘image’, ‘space’ and ‘light’. Within every system, a variety of issues dealing with the concept of ‘representation’ are addressed in an interdisciplinary manner. It is a compulsory course lasting three semesters, in the second and third year of a five-year architectural program. It has been offered since the academic year 1999/2000.","",""

Literacy is about the use of particular tools to satisfy well-defined tasks while fluency is a deeper form of knowledge that allows people to adapt to the uncertainties of computing and keep up with new, technological trends. Computational flexibility suggests the further capacity toinvent software when existing applications fail to solve new problems. I will suggest a need for designers to become computationally flexible to achieve goals that often begin as ideas that are difficult, if not impossible, to articulate and hand off to expert software engineers for further development.","",""

Computer vision software has been developed that can recognise and distinguish between different flashlight beams and these can be used to activate digital media including audio, video or special effects. The technology appears to ’magically bring to life’ objects and areas of the environment merely by shining a torch on them and has been used successfully to enhance visitor attractions such as museum exhibits and displays. This paper considers the potential for using this technology in special needs education, providing a means for children to explore their immediate environment and discover something new. Potential applications for supporting learning are proposed and a feasibility study is presented. Three case examples were conducted to assess the practicalities of configuring interactive learning experiences within the schoolenvironment and pupil’s responses to the technology.","",""

Following the gift to the mother of a video recording that depicted the young adult's progress as a result of the sessions it was found that upon viewing he was able to recognize himself and associate with his activities. Further, when watching alongside his mother, the recorded material became as a mediating reference for his communication.

This paper examines the nature of their dissatisfaction and proposes solutions. A comprehensive observational study of industrial designers' existing CAD and physical modelling activities is reported, from which an evidence base for the specification of improved digital industrial design tools is derived. Theories on design modelling, sketching, human cognitive development and CAD evolution are used to underpin the major conclusion that a conceptual shift in digital design tools must take place if industrial design is to be properly supported. The shift is discussed and illustrated through the presentation of plausible new HCI systems classed as ‘virtual workshops’ and ‘intelligent environments’.","",""
"2007","Editorial: ArtAbilitation","The inaugural international conference ArtAbilitation was hosted at the Utzondesigned Centre for the Performing Arts, Musikhuset Esbjerg, Denmark in September 2006. It supported the renowned International Conference for Disability, Virtual Reality and Associated Technologies (ICDVRAT) which celebrated a decade of biennial conferences. Thus a claim was made for the hosting of ‘The conference of the decade’! ‘ArtAbilitation’, as an open conceptual entity, carries—through its mission statement—manifold interpretations. The concept has emerged out of a new evolving platform for interdisciplinary research, knowledge exchange and product development entitled SoundScapes. The SoundScapes concept involves the use of sensor technologies that are not worn on the body and involve human data capture from movement within an invisible volumetric information space. This data is mapped to personalised multimedia which is experienced as a virtual environment. This capture technique and mapping strategy empowers intuitive and natural control through gesture for motivated engagement with the virtual environment. The personalisation of the interactive environment enables utility as a new therapeutic supplement for practitioners. SoundScapes was featured in an article in Digital Creativity, vol. 16, no. 1, pp. 43–53 and is the subject of a book that is currently being written. Scientific reports on alternative realities such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR) and artificial reality are as welcome in ArtAbilitation as are the most basic of assistive devices like a single switcher. Hardware and software, digital and analogue, positivism and hermeneutic are all amongst targeted topics. Too diverse? Possibly but let me explain a little more... Some may refer to the term ‘ArtAbilitation’ from a linguistic perspective and interpret it as in ‘Art (Reh)abilitation’ and thus directed at art therapists who use art forms such as painting, music, dance, theatre and movement in practises that give benefit from within rehabilitation to the community of, for example, those with a disability or damage. There are also other groups for whom an alternative interpretation has been suggested. These are groups closely linked to therapy but differ in that they are categorised as not capable of rehabilitation but, rather, undergo abilitation. In other words, due to the severity of their dysfunction they are classified as regressive. This group is addressed so as to give whatever quality of life is possible with whatever functional ability they have and according to the human resources available. Addressing optimally requires passionate meaning and conviction, as in art. However, as Davies (2005) states, this group is often excluded from research or healthcare funding due to their inherent complexities or diverse characteristics. Despite being a rich resource from within which to explore unchartered avenues of human research, this exclusion from funding possibly brings it even closer to art! Consider for a moment when a person loses a sense and is categorized as disabled, often it is witnessed that a compensatory sense becomes strengthened. A blind man’s nuances of profile, feeling of space or auditory perception all grow into a heightened state. This arbitrary sensory nuance is fertile ground for the development of future art, artist and audience. Yet, many steer clear of the blind man tap, tap, tapping across the street, not realising his listening to the echo of his cane sounding against the targeted sidewalk or pavement is giving him distance feedback. With current predicted demographic trends the balance of people with disability versus those without is changing towards an unprecedented predicament for society. Eurostats (ec. europa.eu/eurostat) inform of an increased aged population, decreased workforce and extended life expectancies. The aged population is where disability figures predominate. e d it o ri a l","",""

We describe two projects where this methodology has been successfully applied. We first give an overview of the CELL project where the performative approach led to a significant change in the way that scientist Neil Theise investigated stem cells. The success of this project directly led to the work which is the main focus of this paper: the design of Net Work, an interactive artwork that consists of a grid of autonomous buoys that emit different coloured light in response to the environment and the state of neighbouring buoys. We describe our performative approach to building the Net Work prototype and outline in detail its control system which is based on Ashby's homeostat model. The paper concludes with a short discussion of some of the benefits and pitfalls of an interdisciplinary collaborative approach to problem solving.","",""

In addition to storytelling rhetoric, interactive comedy has to rely on computational rules in order to build narrative from a database of media elements. As an example, the executable rules and metadata that generate narrative according to user input in the interactive television comedy Accidental Lovers are compared to conventional rules of comedy. In conclusion, it seems that at least some rules of the comedy genre resonate with the characteristics that narrative engines based on software and metadata have, and that these similarities should be exploited in the design of interactive comedy.","",""

Very little theatre, dance or art events exist in which visually impaired people can participate. While compensated audio-description or talking books are standard products that these people can buy to imagine feature film stories or decide what is happening on the stage, computer interfaces are not often designed which promote communication between impaired actors. Nor are they designed to allow them to navigate and control audio-visual information on the digital stage or present cultural events to sighted audiences. Our research group is interested to address these problems by constructing ergonomic human computer interfaces (HCI) that can explore the above problems including research into orientation, cognitive mapping and external audio-visual device control. Furthermore, the unique cross-modal potentials of human sensory perception could be augmented by electronic devices, which in turn might communicate with sighted audiences. Consequently, we are implementing our discoveries in artificial systems that can interact intelligently with people on the real digitally mediated stage.","",""
"2008","Obfuscatocracy: A stakeholder analysis of governing documents for virtual worlds","Virtual worlds are governed not only by the source code used to develop the world, but also by civil code documents that establish a governance structure that constrains the interactions of users of the virtual world and regulates relationships among stakeholders of the virtual world. While previous research has examined specific aspects of these documents, this paper analyzes these governing documents as a totality. By examining the totality of and the interplay among the governing documents of a number of established social worlds, this paper seeks to discover insights that can prove valuable both for scholarly understanding of social world governance and for the various stakeholders of social worlds. Following this analysis, the paper offers a set of policy recommendations and considerations to facilitate the development of governing documents that more democratically and equally serve the needs and rights of all stakeholders in virtual worlds. The paper concludes that virtual worlds and their governing documents are boundary objects with agency, in that they are the result of interactions among stakeholder groups and in turn reshape the relationships among those stakeholder groups.","",""

The rationale of what elements are chosen and where they are placed is based on tacit knowledge gained over a number of years of experience. The aesthetics associated with the overall finished design are often based on a style. Important elements of style are complexity and aesthetic value. In this paper I explore how various mathematical aesthetic functions can use complexity as an arousal enhancing or limiting mechanism in the application of layout designs.","",""
"2008","<i>Flying Cities</i>: building a 3D world from vocal input","Abstract Flying Cities is an artistic installation which generates imaginary cities from the speech of its visitors. Thanks to an original interactive process analysing people's vocal input to create 3D graphics, a tangible correspondence between speech and visuals opens new possibilities of interaction. This cross-modal interaction not only supports our artistic messages, but also aims at providing anyone with a pleasant and stimulating feedback from her/his speech activity. As the feedback we have received when presenting Flying Cities was very positive, our objective is now to cross the bridge between art and a potential application. We believe that it could become a new medium for creativity and a way to visually perceive a vocal performance in the context of the rehabilitation of people with reduced mobility or language impairments.","",""
"2008","Digital myths and delusions: an approach to investigate interaction aesthetics","Digital myths and delusions is here suggested as a way of working with interaction aesthetics of computational products. It is a critical design approach introducing alternative design proposals in three steps. In the first step we define myths and delusions of digital products restricting interaction and awareness. In the second step we introduce critical myth exposures reading, exposing, reviewing and demystifying the myths. In the third step we design ‘transformers to explore design alternatives, i.e. we transform the myths by changing the design and the way the product is being presented in use. The aim is to question what counts as normal and intuitive with respect to all those everyday computational products we are getting more and more used to. Defining and questioning digital myths is here seen as one form of design critique.","",""
"2008","Creativity and evolution: a metadesign perspective","Abstract In a world that is not predictable, improvisation and evolution are more than a luxury: they are a necessity. The challenge of design is not a matter of getting rid of the emergent, but rather of making it an opportunity for more creative and more sustainable solutions. User-centered and participatory design approaches have focused primarily on activities taking place at design time. These approaches have not given enough emphasis and they have provided few mechanisms to support systems as living entities that can evolve over time. Metadesign is a unique design approach concerned with opening up solution spaces rather than complete solutions (hence the prefix meta-), and aimed at creating social and technical infrastructures in which new forms of collaborative design can take place. This approach extends the traditional notion of design beyond the original development of a system to include co-adaptive processes between users and systems that enable the users to act as designers in personally meaningful activities and be creative.","",""
"2008","Embodied interfaces: dancing with digital sprites","Abstract This paper focuses on the research project, Projecting Performance, in which off-stage technical operators take on the role of performer through the live manipulation of digital ‘sprites’ in a theatrical environment. The sprites are projected onto gauzes in the stage space and operators control them with graphics tablets and pens to perform with on-stage dancers. Operators have frequently described experiences of dislocation or translocation during the experience of operating and this paper investigates the reasons for such reports. It presents the tripartite models of Zich and Castronova from the fields of theatre studies and human-computer interaction respectively, cross-referencing them to analyse the relationship between performer-operator and sprite. Merleau-Ponty's phenomenological theories are then employed through the writings of Crowther and Fraleigh to explore the experience of the performer-operator. The paper proposes an understanding of the digital interface in Projecting Performance as embodied and experienced both visually and kinaesthetically by the performer-operator.","",""

An audiovisual immersive interactive environment was developed to encourage creative interaction and expression from the participants. The feedback was via a microphone attached to a sound processor to capture any vocal utterances or speech, additionally the child's gestures were captured through a digital camera and mapped to computer vision algorithms to create a ‘moving painting’, and then further to a MIDI sound source that responded to the movements of the child. Results indicated increased engagement spans whilst in the environment, atypical communicative responses in the case of the ASD child; highly expressive gestural movements that vividly illustrated aspects of the theory of movement as postulated by Laban (1963) and Laban and Lawrence (1974); and increased vocal utterances.","",""

"2009","Wearable performance","Wearable computing devices worn on the body provide the potential for digital interaction in the world. A new stage of computing technology at the beginning of the 21st Century links the personal and the pervasive through mobile wearables. The convergence between the miniaturisation of microchips (nanotechnology), intelligent textile or interfacial materials production, advances in biotechnology and the growth of wireless, ubiquitous computing emphasises not only mobility but integration into clothing or the human body. In artistic contexts one expects such integrated wearable devices to have the two-way function of interface instruments (e.g. sensor data acquisition and exchange) worn for particular purposes, either for communication with the environment or various aesthetic and compositional expressions. ‘Wearable performance’ briefly surveys the context for wearables in the performance arts and distinguishes display and performative/interfacial garments. It then focuses on the authors' experiments with ‘design in motion’ and digital performance, examining prototyping at the DAP-Lab which involves transdisciplinary convergences between fashion and dance, interactive system architecture, electronic textiles, wearable technologies and digital animation. The concept of an ‘evolving’ garment design that is materialised (mobilised) in live performance between partners originates from DAP Lab's work with telepresence and distributed media addressing the ‘connective tissues’ and ‘wearabilities’ of projected bodies through a study of shared embodiment and perception/proprioception in the wearer (tactile sensory processing). Such notions of wearability are applied both to the immediate sensory processing on the performer's body and to the processing of the responsive, animate environment.","",""

"2009","Breaking the rules in interactive media design education","In today's interactive media design it is difficult for a designer to create aesthetic innovations and to break free from ordinariness. The most important factor limiting interactive media design aesthetics is that education seems to be more focused on following traditional rules of interaction design rather than innovative approaches. These rules limit creativity and often relegate design students to producing ordinary interface solutions. This is especially burdensome for us as teachers. In order to address this problem, we developed an education model inspired by Lars von Trier's film Five Obstructions. We call this model ‘breaking the rules’. In the ‘breaking the rules’ approach students produce, within a range of probabilities, design problem solutions in cases of total or partial visual/auditory/tactile obstructions. The most important outputs of the model are (1) to make design student think/look outside of the ordinary, (2) to produce unusual solutions, (3) to maximise design solutions with sound.","",""
"2009","Hyper-twist","In this paper, we introduce ‘hyper-twist’, a distortion technique for the production of abstract artistic forms (see Figure 1). It is developed via exploiting the theoretical feature of deforming an infinite space filled with a hyper-elastic media. Any object placed within this space can change its shape as a result of the distortion of the space. Based on this developed theoretic insight, we have produced a computer program where point sources are used to control the form and extent of distortion. These sources perform a similar function to forces exerting on a soft body. By qualifying them with a distortion tensor, they define the patterns of the resultant distortions. Linking this representation with time, temporal effects can be produced. Our work, incorporating physics into a digital creation, presents a new form of algorithmic art.","",""

Readers' Responses to Interactive Fiction"," Interactive fiction has excited huge interest amongst scholars and experimental artists since the pioneering work of Michael Joyce in the 1980s. However, it has not reached out to a wide community of writers and readers, largely because of the twin problems of poor reader engagement with fractured narrative structures, and the heavy cognitive demands of the interfaces used by hyper-writers. This article reports upon an empirical study of readers’ responses to a range of interactive fictions, a study which aimed to uncover in detail the key factors affecting readers’ experience of this narrative form. On the basis of the study’s findings, it is argued that interactive fiction can offer an enjoyable reading experience, if core issues around narrative structure and interface design are addressed by writers. The article suggests guidelines for writers, based on the findings of the empirical study. ","",""
"2010","Authorization and governance in virtual worlds","Although a variety of formal and informal mechanisms govern behavior in virtual worlds, the proprietors of such worlds increasingly have relied upon formal legal claims to sanction undesired user behavior. A range of such legal claims might be asserted in different factual situations: copyright infringement, or trespass to computers, or circumvention of technical protections. But each of these claims relies upon the authorization status of the targeted user. Authorization is largely an incident of the virtual world proprietor's Terms of Service (ToS). Thus, the ToS is increasingly regarded as a license to access the proprietor's servers; violation of the ToS annuls authorization to access the servers. The result is that any misbehavior by users, in violation of the ToS, can be recast as a violation of copyright, or trespass, or technical circumvention laws, even if the undesired behavior has little bearing on the variety legal claim asserted.  This mutation of legal claims is troubling, not only from the standpoint of legal policy, but as a social policy to govern virtual worlds.","",""
"2010","Developing virtual worlds: The interplay of design, communities and rationality","This paper examines the evolution of virtual worlds from the developer's perspective. What are the motivations of developers? What are the specific challenges of the governance of user-generated content? User-created virtual worlds may be characterized according to their degree of design or emergence. On one end is the 'the designer as god' perspective and on the other is the unforeseeable and perpetually emergent 'user creativity.' Utilizing a theoretically derived sample of virtual worlds, we illustrate how governance is more complex as designers contend with three major issues. In general, across all three worlds, developers had to come to grips with the limits of their ability to design virtual worlds for premeditated outcomes. Secondly, communities forming within worlds, as opposed to atomized users, are central to the (creative) building, usage and governance of virtual worlds. Developers have a range of choices for how to interact with communities ranging from arm's length monitoring to engagement. Thirdly, developers have to manage instrumentally rational aspects of their business which can lead to tensions with the design and community goals, and, ultimately, lead to the failure of a world's business model. A fuller accounting of governance will have to accommodate the complex interplay between purposeful design, emergent community, and the logic of the marketplace.","",""

This 2 × 2 experiment compared dyadic (co-viewing) vs solitary emotional reactions watching either a linear or an interactive version of a seven-minute digital video narrative, Modern Cinderella. Eighty subjects were randomly assigned to each of the four conditions. People who watched the interactive version of Modern Cinderella reported higher enjoyment than those who watched the linear version. Story involvement, arousal and connection were not different across conditions. Those who experienced the interactive version were enthusiastic about being able to make choices. Interactive narratives appear to fall in-between high and low involvement. Co-viewing of the interactive narrative was different to solitary viewing. Those watching with another person thought less carefully about the choices and paid less attention. Solitary viewers were the more curious. ","",""
"2010","Becoming materials: material forms and forms of practice","As a result of development toward ‘smart’ materials, materials now enable an expanding range of aesthetic expressions and user experiences. These materials are fundamentally temporal in their capacity to assume multiple, discrete states of expression that can be repeatedly and minutely controlled. These materials come to be, or become, only over time and in context—they are becoming materials. Thus, in the development and application of such materials, we must engage more extensively with the experience of materials in practices of design and of use. This paper introduces and discusses the concept of becoming materials—as well as the implications for practice—through a series of examples from our own practice-led research within art, design and architecture. Coming to terms with the implications for material practices of design and of use, we suggest, requires the development of new concepts and methods for doing and studying the design of becoming materials.","",""
"2010","The art of interaction","Interactive art has become much more common as a result of the many ways in which the computer and the Internet have facilitated it. Issues relating to human–computer interaction (HCI) are as important to interactive art making as issues relating to the colours of paint are to painting. It is not that HCI and art necessarily share goals. It is just that much of the knowledge of HCI and its methods can contribute to interactive art making. This paper reviews recent work that looks at these issues in the art context. In interactive digital art, the artist is concerned with how the artwork behaves, how the audience interacts with it and, ultimately, in participant experience and their degree of engagement. The paper looks at these issues and brings together a collection of research results and art practice experiences that together help to illuminate this significant new and expanding area. In particular, it is suggested that this work points towards a much needed critical language that can be used to describe, compare and discuss interactive digital art.","",""

Our research is based on empirical findings arising from the use of Inspiration Card Workshops, which are collaborative design events in which domain and technology insight are combined to create design concepts. In addition to the systematically introduced sources of inspiration that form part of the workshop format, a number of spontaneous sources of inspiration emerged during these workshops.","",""

This trend has been labelled the ‘good enough’ revolution and has highlighted contemporary parameters for technological development. The present article presents this trend as a design movement that is characterised by introducing a new functionalism and challenging common perceptions that have emerged as a result of the twentieth-century design story about ‘high quality’ and ‘added value’ in product development. In addition, the article introduces the concept of aesthetics as the basis for a discussion about user experiences in contemporary digital artefacts, and argues that the good enough movement calls for a new understanding of aesthetics that springs from the role of digital artefacts in the user's social life and plays a role in relation to technologically oriented design development.","",""

What is rigorous and relevant interaction design research and how do we recognise and evaluate it? Most current attempts at dealing with these issues tend to be on loan from other disciplines, and may overlook, conceal, or knowingly exclude some of what makes interaction design research such a unique field. Our primary contribution is that what may be perceived as three different design research activities—design practice, design exploration and design studies—have their own purposes, intended outcomes, and internal logic. Each approach must be examined in its own right and the notions of rigour and relevance have to be based on a firm understanding of the particular purpose of each approach.","",""

Next, the paper draws upon critical concepts drawn from multimodal discourse analysis, media theory and sociology to analyse Brainstorm in terms of the interplay of software structure and design agency. The key concepts used are modality, articulation and interpretation (Kress and van Leeuwen 1996, 2001), the database as cultural form and the logic of selection (Manovich 2001), habitus and practical logic (Bourdieu 1977) and the radius of creativity (Toynbee 2000).

It is the ability of an artwork to respond to and ‘dialogue’ with its audience—to ‘look back’ and ‘talk back’—that is the key factor in making it an engaging and believable social partner.

With computational technology and sensors infiltrating many aspects of our lives and urban surroundings, interaction designers' ability to visualise and generate designs are important in order to understand and explore such design spaces. I propose three concepts—accessibility, immediacy and generation—as means for analysing movement as a design material for interaction design. Drawing on a social semiotics approach, contemporary choreographic research is studied where digital tools are used to generate, explicate and communicate interactive movement. I argue that by drawing on the particularities and potentials of the moving body as interface such as those explored through choreographic practice, we may avoid imitating existing exchanges with technology and create novel interactions.","",""

In order to develop an object-oriented exploration of these works, and our day-to-day interactions with technology in a broader sense, I explore digital interaction as a process that involves the transductive relationships set up between objects and the milieu in which these objects find themselves. Central to this argument is setting all objects, including human users, technology and artifacts, on the same ontological footing.","",""

This was a project that was initiated in 2009, during the VI Novosibirsk Graphic Art Biennial, which was held at the Novosibirsk State Art Museum. Novosibirsk, Russia. As the artistic curator of the project, I invited curators from nine countries, to select printed works from some of the most innovative contemporary printmakers in the field. HotPlate focused on installation and unframed work, seeking to position prints as objects and site-specific pieces, as well as wall-based works on paper. By approaching contemporary printmaking in the widest possible way, HotPlate sparked a lively conversation about process, technique and technology within a continuously evolving area of the visual arts. Here the emphasis was on testing the perceived boundaries of the medium, breaking out of the literal and metaphorical ‘frame’ and exploring new formats which actively engage with the gallery space. It also opened up the possibilities for prints to move beyond the gallery walls and engage with modern street culture. Drawing upon a broad cultural and geographical demographic, the exhibition brought together a range of influences. The prints address a vast spectrum of conceptual, figurative and illustrative themes, touching upon current events and politics, contemporary urban landscapes, portraiture, interior worlds and abstraction. The pieces range from traditional etching, lithography, relief and screen-printing to more contemporary digital imaging, and are printed onto a variety of substrates, including cloth, synthetic paper, metal and plasterboard. Some prints appear as light projections and others arise out of experiments with heat-sensitive inks, vegetable juices and bacteria. An artist’s book, surrounded by veils of printed fabric, and relief prints on three-dimensional forms move the medium into the physical space of the viewer. HotPlate is a unique project offering visitors the opportunity to experience the vibrant and continually evolving world of contemporary printmaking first hand.

Conducting research in virtual worlds must incorporate considerations of the spaces and actors that are necessary parts of those worlds. Although prior research provides solid guidelines for conducting ethnographies in virtual worlds, the implications of selecting site and self for non-ethnographic projects in such spaces have been largely overlooked. This paper examines the influence of research sites and presentations of self in virtual worlds in order to discuss how choices about these elements can influence study outcomes. To do so, we discuss how ethnographic paradigms informed the development and implementation of a mixed-method study conducted in Second Life.

"2012","Virtual worlds as sites for social and cultural innovation","There is a growing recognition of the importance of virtual worlds as environments and media that carry the potential for social and cultural innovation by making possible new forms of social relationships based on communication among avatars. The articles in this special issue exemplify some aspects of this potential but also point out some of the many questions and unsolved problems that follow with innovation and the continuous development of virtual worlds. The two key concepts of virtual worlds and innovation are both widely used concepts that refer to emergent and rapidly changing phenomena without sharp contours or clearly defined boundaries. In the context of this special issue, we treat both virtual worlds and innovation as emergent phenomena in flux. Some of the features of virtual worlds, however, may also be seen as stable. According to Bell (2008) and Schroeder (2008, 2011), virtual worlds depend on stable, persistent digital infrastructures. Moreover, the online presence of gamers and residents is referred to by digital symbols and signs – be they avatars, space ships or green dots – and the technological platforms are accessible 24/7 over longer periods of time. They appear to be stable technologies and platforms, almost permanent. How is it, then, that we see them as emergent phenomena in flux? Our focus in this special issue of Convergence is on social and cultural innovation in and with virtual worlds which means that the technological innovation of the digital platforms and of the technology in itself are not our primary interest of reflection and analysis. Social and cultural innovation are phenomena of a fluid nature, subject to continuous change: the way we see and understand ourselves and each other, the way we experience exciting and extraordinary events or seek inspiration by thought-provoking art installations, the way we build virtual communities of high ideals or take the opportunity to live out behaviours otherwise not acceptable in our everyday life, these are all examples of human relationships with distinctive features that hold the potential for creative and innovative responses to new environments.","",""

The innovative forms of interaction are analysed in the light of the new technology and as performances and make-belief strategies directed towards realizing performative utopias, towards influencing the direction in which leaders and residents of this digital context want the role-play to develop, and towards shaping the emergent social and cultural rules and the political framework of the role-play.

In particular, studio surfaces such as designers' desks, office walls, notice boards, clipboards and drawing boards are full of informative, inspirational and creative artefacts such as, sketches, drawings, posters, story-boards and Post-it notes. Studio surfaces are not just the carriers of information but importantly they are sites of methodic design practices, i.e. they indicate, to an extent, how design is being carried out. This article describes the results of an ethnographic study on the use of workplace surfaces in design studios, from two academic design departments. Using the field study results, the article introduces an idea of ‘artful surfaces’. Artful surfaces emphasise how artfully designers integrate these surfaces into their everyday work and how the organisation of these surfaces comes about helping designers in accomplishing their creative and innovative design practices. Using examples from the field study, the article shows that artful surfaces have both functional and inspirational characteristics. From the field study, three types of artful surfaces are identified: personal; shared; and project-specific. The article suggests that a greater insight into how these artful surfaces are created and used could lead to better design of novel display technologies to support designers' everyday work.","",""

"2012","Documenting mixed reality performance: the case of CloudPad","This article introduces an original documentation and archiving tool, CloudPad, that integrates ‘cloud computing’ into the annotation and synchronisation of mixed media resources. Through CloudPad users are able to view a documentation, edit a version of it, and record their own comments in response to it. Whether users may have created and/or experienced a particular work, or whether they may simply wish to consult a work's documentation, their journey through these records and annotations are subsumed into the work's documentation, thus augmenting the ‘original’ artwork's field of social engagement. Before discussing CloudPad in detail, we proceed to explain how recent debates in performance documentation influenced our methodology and development, and the general challenges of mixed reality documentation that CloudPad aims to address.","",""

Accordingly, it is very important to study the immersion that encourages the participation of the audience. In this paper, we analyse the expressive characteristics of material-focused Modernist paintings as immersive elements for which the characteristics of the material itself are highlighted. This includes how behavioural elements are introduced to paintings, how such a seemingly consequential abstract visual exists in the context of Formalism, and how these characteristics are shown in the combined action of physical phenomena of nature. That is, the expressive characteristics that occur as the result of interaction between behaviour of artist, gravity and materials are analysed as the sense of presence, the facilitation of immediate feedback, and the immersive elements of visual beauty. Accordingly, it is suggested this type of analysis can be utilized in interactive art.","",""

The authors argue that the aesthetic qualities of an interface are critical since they affect the overall perceptions of the project (i.e., product, business, organisation, etc.) as a whole. Given a sufficiently refined interface, the users will likely increase their trust in the people responsible (p. 17); trusting users may be more willing to persevere when something has gone wrong (p. 18). This emphasis on the aesthetics of interface design differs from much of the systems papers and usability testing literature. As such, it aims to support a faster progression from the merely functional tool, through one that is easily used, towards a pleasurable information interface (p. 19).","",""
"2013","Having belief(s) in social virtual worlds: A decomposed approach"," The interest in social virtual worlds with multiple functions has mushroomed during the past few years. The key challenge social virtual worlds face while attempting to anchor and serve the masses is to reflect the core beliefs of their users. As existing research lacks insight into these core beliefs, this study aims to contribute to the existing knowledge base by proposing and testing a model grounded on the decomposed theory of planned behavior. Predicated on the multipurpose nature of social virtual worlds, the model proposes medium-specific attitudinal, normative and control beliefs as determinants of continual use intention. The model is tested with a sample of 2175 users who inhabit Habbo Hotel – one of the largest social virtual worlds in the industry. The results indicate significant though different influences of attitudinal and control beliefs. The most fundamental finding is the irrelevance of normative beliefs, which puts the social character of social virtual worlds into perspective. ","",""

Ekkomaten is an affectively engaging listening machine that lets people probe the narrative potential of Store Torv, in Aarhus, Denmark. Through its physical manifestation and conceptual framing, Ekkomaten offers an auditory and situated experience of the 18th century through six site-specific echoes that engage its users as protagonists in the exploration of an imagined narrative space emerging from the intersection of fact and fiction and the infra- and extraordinary. As an electronic design object, Ekkomaten points both back and forward in time, questioning our current understanding of the 18th century, science fiction's previous visions of the future, and current ideas about possible post-digital futures.","",""

In this article we adopt a blend of rhetorical devices to present and discuss design fictions. We do this by referring to current discourses around drone technologies. We resituate these in the context of the networked city and the projection of a hybrid rogue drone. She is dissatisfied with her given functions and begins to question her deployment in urban policing. The article is based in the conceptual end of designing such a future city space. It refers to practical, popular and academic materials and citations to argue for the need for openness and clarity at the ideational end of developing design fictions. The text is part of a wider developmental and reflexive design–research process that takes up the speculative in design fictions and related hermeneutic design research.","",""

However, prior knowledge of GUI design often leads the students to create cliché and impractical designs for gestural interaction. To solve the problem, our study aims to explore feedback as an alternative education method, enhanced by an exercise we call ‘gestural shadow mapping’, which is based on the art of mime, within the concept of creative drama. Using a basic setup for shadow representation, a group of design students practised expressing prepared visual compositions as gestural shadow maps for an audience of their peers. After several observations, feedback showed that the method based on gestural shadow mapping does afford students a better understanding of gestural interaction, free from the inhibitions of their prior experiences of GUIs and the limitations of current commercial examples.","",""
"2013","Understanding performative behaviour within content-rich Digital Live Art","Abstract Research into human–computer interaction (HCI) has traditionally been concerned with users' abilities to complete tasks at desk-bound computers. However, recent research into Digital Live Art (Sheridan 2006) and audiences' engagement with interactive art focuses on ‘non task-based uses of computing’ (Sheridan, Bryan-Kinns, and Bayliss 2007, 13), such as the user experience. As computing becomes more mobile, wireless and tangible, there is a shift to understand the needs of ‘users as performers’ (ibid.). As a result, research has begun to draw on the methods and theories in the performing arts to better understand these needs. However, much of this research into interactive art focuses on playful or physical experiences of users, and fails to address work with social content and themes to be communicated. This is a critical analysis of Sheridan's framework for understanding performative behaviour with technologically mediated interactive art (Sheridan 2006; Sheridan, Bryan-Kinns, and Bayliss 2007). By applying the framework to works with rich thematic content, our findings indicate that the framework needs refining in order to better understand the ways in which users engage with interactive artworks of this kind.","",""
"2013","Performance art and digital media","Interaction depends on some form of activity and it is important to realise that the procedural power is not limited to the computational side in this activity. It is shared between human and bit machine. That is why interactive text has been described as the result of the continuous operation of a ‘textual machine’ which depends on the engagement of both (Aarseth 1997). We can look at the pre-conditions for these processes—the design for a digital piece or its interface; we can look at the effects—the emergence of social networks and digital products; but at the heart of the matter remains the activity itself. This dependency on the process formed the initial motivation for this collection. Much like interaction, performance is about doing. Performing cannot be reduced to an artistic interpretation of a given text but it has constitutive powers. We can study the pre-conditions—the structure of an underlying dramatic text like a play or an event score; we can look at the effects—the historical frame, response and social impact; but at the heart of the matter remains the activity itself. This core parallel was part of the formation of this special issue of Digital Creativity on performance art and digital media. But from this shared core, the themes rapidly fanned out into related but distinct questions from the role of the body in the activity to that of the technological counterpart. Thankfully, these debates can connect to respected scholars with established work in the field. This collection aims to support already existing work such as Dixon (2007), Benford and Giannachi (2011), or Jacucci (2004), but it uses the format of the journal to allow a more open assembly and meeting place for differing perspectives. While Dixon provides a much needed historical view and Benford and Giannachi and Jacucci offer more HCI-based positions, the contributions in this collection enter the discussion from multiple directions while standing next to each other. Their respective domains include performance studies, video games, HCI and digital arts, among others. Such a wide net of disciplines poses a challenge. If performance studies is already defying disciplinary boundaries and interaction design reaches the last corners of human activity in ubiquitous computing, then an interrogation of one through the other is bound to be messy. And, indeed, the contributions collected here overlap, and at times conflict with each other. But it never was the intention to solve this conundrum or to provide a single theory. It would be a disservice to both disciplines to attempt such a unified theory across so many domains. It might be precisely because of the diversity of the connections that performance is ‘trending’ in interaction. Notable work has been done in related fields such as theatre and interaction design (Laurel 1991) that investigated structural connections between the performing arts and the computational ones, but both fields have evolved over the past decades and have grown more complex.

How is the fictional character of such work conceptualised and produced? What kinds of speculation are involved? The article considers the value of one particular approach and argues that speculative design serves two distinct purposes: first, to enable us to think about the future; second, to critique current practice. Methods are described through case studies, either of the author's own projects or projects completed by graduates of the design interactions course at the Royal College of Art. A key concept is the ‘perceptual bridge’—the means by which designs engage their audience. The article argues that a vital factor in the success of a Speculative Design proposal is the careful management of the speculation, specifically what informs the use of technology, aesthetics, behaviour, interaction and function of the designed artefact.","",""

We identify three strands of current HCI research that are already working in this area of overlap, which we have termed ‘performative experience design’. We then single out one of these strands, digitally augmented autobiographical performance, for further examination. Digitally augmented autobiographical performance draws on both autobiographical performance, which we see as rooted in performance and performance art, and media sharing, a field of research within HCI. Drawing on our experiences of designing a digital system for autobiographical performance, we offer a series of proposals for HCI research and applications of performative experience design.","",""

Design fictions are introduced as a method to articulate future possibilities. Three case studies are described which explore interaction in public space. The fictions create imaginative projections with the intention of generating reaction and responses in the public that will lead to a greater understanding of the physical and conceptual design space. The first case study explored how citizens could anonymously comment on their relationship with a city. The second study encouraged participants to reflect on their habits and rituals and to view these through fresh eyes. The final case study sought to surprise and engage gallery visitors through an interactive piece that raised issues concerning the surreptitious capture of data. The paper concludes by reflecting on the utility of design fictions and the role they can play in concept envisionment.","",""

Fictions can entertain as much as cause social friction. This article discusses three sources of design fictions: a global information technology company; an art school in the UK; and a design institute in Brazil. By contrasting the three cases in light of the philosophical work of Álvaro Vieira Pinto, this article deconstructs the ideology of the future—futurology—and proposes acting in the present—handiness—to sketch an ideology of liberation. Instead of supporting the status quo, such ideology could inspire collective action for change. The practices from the three aforementioned sources are discussed to lay the foundations for such ideology of liberation in design fictions.","",""

Despite the rapid spread of virtual environments, no model has been developed to date that fully captures this complex entity. Rather than taking a purely social approach, as has been the dominant trend in most prior work, the structural elements used in this current framework incorporate several dimensions and approaches identity as a conglomerate of personal, social, relational and material aspects. Building on an extensive body of the available literature, with the current conceptual model, we intend to provide a comprehensive base on which to further expand theoretically as well as empirically in future work-related concerning identity in virtual worlds.

A literary aesthetic driven approach to interactive media"," In this paper we employ a conceptual repertoire from philosophical hermeneutics and literary aesthetics to examine people’s expectations of and trust in interactive media. Drawing on data from two projects, first, with young professionals on their perceptions of the informational value of various media, and second, with youthful users of the online genre of social networking sites, we present findings on perceptions of authorial presence and constructions of an imagined author. We conclude that an (imagined) author plays a key role in media users’ ability to critically use interactive media and evaluate the relevance and reliability of media content, rather than functioning as an authoritative originator of the meaning. We argue that this is important not only for contemporary research in critical digital literacies, but also for the intrinsic importance of trust in any act of communicative engagement. ","",""

We compare five brainstorming modalities: traditional brainstorming—graphical interaction, reverse brainstorming, brainwriting and brainsketching—adopted by six delocalised teams working through a cloud computing environment. We analyse: co-authoring production; the ratio of ideas production according to task-goal; and the variation of brainstorming modalities. Our results show that designers work on brainstorming modalities according to the task-goal assigned, and we see that task content and the verbal and graphical communicative modes are supported by the proposed computational environment; as well as all brainstorming modalities. Because co-authoring or collective sketching are hardly possible without verbal communication support in graphical production, we propose the use of these new cloud computing functionalities to enhance the distributed design work.","",""

To gain insight into this phenomenon, we propose the concept ‘decisive constraints’ based on a review of current, but dispersed, studies into creativity constraints. We build decisive constraints on two definitional conditions related to radical decision-making and creative turning points. To test our concept analytically and ensure its relevance to creative practice, we apply the two definitional conditions to three media façade installation projects in which our interaction design research lab has been involved. In accord with insights from these case analyses, we argue that decisive constraints may inform current research into design processes and act as a creative resource for practitioners, not only in interaction design but, we assume, also across related creative domains and disciplines.","",""

This area of research is positioned at the intersection of sound and music computing, auditory displays and interaction design. The key issue the designer is asked to tackle is to create meaningful sound for objects and interactions that are often new. To date, there are no set design methodologies, but a variety of approaches available to the designer. Knowledge and understanding of how humans listen and interpret sound is the first step toward being able to create such sounds. This article discusses two original approaches that borrow techniques from film sound and theatre. Cinematic sound highlights how our interpretation of sound depends on listening modes and context, while theatre settings allow us to explore sonic interactions from the different perspectives of the interacting subject, the observer and the designer.","",""
"2014","An analytical framework for facilitating interactivity between participants and interactive artwork: case studies in MRT stations","This article presents a heuristic approach for analysing computer-based interactive art by the extent to which it produces an interaction, and by whether participants are able to gain a meaningful experience from the interaction. Interactive installations responding to participants' physical input have been increasingly displayed in public spaces outside conventional art domains. Nevertheless, people in such public spaces are often unaccustomed to engaging with art intellectually. Thus, although the interactive artwork with responsive multimedia effects are, to some extent, more capable of prompting physical engagements, it is not always clear whether participants are able to develop meaningful experiences from such interactive encounters. Here, an analytical framework for reviewing such experiences has been developed from examinations of interactive experiences on site, along with interviews with advisors, professionals in the field and the originating artists. Examples of the frameworks' application to three interactive artworks are demonstrated in this article.","",""

Most projection mapping experiences and events are non-interactive, partly because of the many inherent design problems in designing for interaction is such situations. This article explores one approach to this tricky issue by analysing a group of four interactive mixed reality experiences that combine projection mapping with camera-based interaction techniques. The approaches used are described, and their deployment in a variety of situations is analysed using engagement and play theories. The works suggest that some projection mapping techniques can be used in the service of creating engaging interactive exhibits and installations, but that the effectiveness of the approach relies on it placing the experience and interactions clearly in our own physical world, rather than behind a screen or in an artificial image space.","",""

Yet, many important aspects of such common undertakings are still understudied or unclear, including the effect of spatial configuration in information synthesis or writing process. This article investigates the effects of location-based setups on collaborative writing in the context of information seeking. These investigations are done using a laboratory study and an experimental system for collaboratively seeking and synthesizing information. A total of 30 pairs (60 subjects) were randomly assigned to one of the three experimental conditions: (1) on a single shared workstation; (2) in the same room with individual computers; and, (3) remotely located with text chat. By analyzing the way the collaborative pairs constructed their reports, it was found that those remotely located spent less effort per edit than those in the same room. Separate location discouraged social interactions and boosted the writing efficiency. These differences in various measures across different configurations, as discovered through exploratory analysis — both qualitative and quantitative — provide useful guidelines for developing collaborative systems, specifically presenting trade-offs among communication efforts, social interactions, and productivity. The work reported in this paper is a first known attempt to investigate impacts of spatial configuration on collaborative writing in the context of information seeking. In doing so, it brings together, and benefits to, scholarly inquiries from computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) and library and information science (LIS) fields.","",""

As new cost-effective digital recording technologies are introduced to the marketplace, this becomes a salient issue to understand for producers and production teams. In order to define cameras’ image quality capacities, three almost identical short fiction film sequences were tested on a young audience in a comparative blind test. Surprisingly, the result unambiguously showed that most viewers preferred the film recorded on an iPhone.

The introduction of code-based design practices in the design studio has altered this balance, introducing new models of joint authorship and new ways for individuals to contribute to co-authored projects. This paper presents a case study describing four design studios in a higher education setting that used code as a tool for generating architectural geometry. The format of the studios encouraged the students to reflect critically on their role as authors and to creatively address the multiple opportunities for shared authorship available with code-based production. The research question addressed in this study involved the role of code-based practices in altering the model of architectural education in the design studio, in particular the role of visual representations of a code-based design process in the production of shared knowledge.","",""

A key quality that distinguishes MRx from MR is an attention to the aesthetics of the experience. To examine the aesthetic dimension of writing is to ask: what it “feels like” to read and write according to an accepted set of practices. MR applications are tactile and proprioceptive, and MRx experiences further explore and make us aware of this multi-sensory engagement. MRx experiences are in this sense polyaesthetic, and as such they exhibit the qualities: seriality, weakened narrative and altered trace. The polyaesthetics of MRx experiences is explored in a series of example of digital art and public display, such as Blast Theory's Rider Spoke and the projection on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris to mark the finish of the 2013 Tour de France.","",""

I further draw on them to highlight the potentials, boundaries, and limitations of each with regards to the kinds of social interactions that are sought and cultivated through the integration of digital media on physical space. I suggest that as MR becomes mainstream, it is important to go beyond these visions to consider whether and how MRx environments might connect with the economic, social, and cultural specificity of local sites to meaningfully serve the always evolving social needs and purposes of their communities.","",""

However, this long established expectation faces new challenges through the increasing accessibility of a growing diversity of interactive technologies and ubiquitous smart media. Such innovations are often fully integrated components of interactive public artworks, many of which do not directly involve audiences or individuals as key agents in the functional or aesthetic realisation of the work. Based on three case studies of interactive artworks in public places, this article identifies an important characteristic of interactivity in interactive art, through the largely unexplored concept of “Ambient Interaction” in which artworks are embodied and enacted through environmental conditions and situational influences rather than exclusively through people's intentional and direct physical engagement.","",""

Initial sales and pre-order figures for headsets such as the HTC Vive, the Facebook-backed Oculus Rift, and the Sony PlayStation VR all indicate that there is indeed a voracious market out there for these new technologies, even if most initial purchasers fall into the category of risk-taking “early-adopters.” In any case, among enthusiasts for the hardware are a considerable number of writers who have expressed excitement around the idea that VR technologies have finally advanced enough to open up new possibilities for how we might think about play itself. They point toward early experiments in new kinds of community interactions, new types of experiences in worlds that users could otherwise not visit, and new kinds of disruptive, realitybending exercises that ask users to reconsider both the potentialities of play in virtual spaces as well as the relationship between those spaces and the actual, embodied, physical spaces in which they live. For many reasons, not least of which is that VR offers intriguing commentary on absence/presence binaries, the technology has long been theorized by critical theorists as philosophically diverse as Baudrillard (1998),1 Virilio (Kellner, 1999),2 Rheingold (1991),3 and so on. Although that foundational work will continue to inform how we conceptualize VR’s cultural significance, there is as yet a lack of scholarship that engages specific VR technologies through consideration of specific hardware/software and their related discursive formations.

"2016","The future of three-dimensional printing: Intellectual property or intellectual confinement?"," For the first 25 years, three-dimensional printing was the domain of industrial manufacturing and engineering. Through the open-source movement and peer production, this disruptive technology has become more widely available. This article considers how the future development and use of three-dimensional printing may be facilitated or inhibited through intellectual property law and practice. Using a combination of technical, legal, and policy analysis, we conclude that the potential for patent infringement is a primary issue in the continued development of three-dimensional printing technology. When it comes to the printed objects themselves, copyright issues will be the main focus of this debate. As these issues become more pervasive, some copyright holders will find technology-based solutions to enforce copyright laws and restrict printing activities. A common recourse is digital rights management as a means for protecting intellectual property, but its use has the potential for imposing unnecessarily stringent limitations on the use of three-dimensional printing.

"2016","Animistic design: how to reimagine digital interaction between the human and the nonhuman","ABSTRACT This article puts forward the notion of animistic design as an uncertainty-driven strategy to reimagine human–machine interaction as a milieu of human and nonhuman. Animistic design is suggested as capable of fostering affects, sensibilities and thoughts that capitalize on the uncertain, the unpredictable and the nonlinear, and their capacity to trigger creative pathways. Informed by post-human philosophies, theories of mediation and materiality, as well as by affect, agency and aesthesia, animistic design eschews the anthropomorphic and the cute playfulness often associated with animism. Instead, it proposes a practical–theoretical framework to articulate the nexus of digital innovation, interaction design practices, technical materialities and affective responses already emerging in the digital cohabitation of the human and the nonhuman. Using a ‘research through making’ approach, the article describes in detail a series of animistic design experiments and prototyping methods that explore ways of rethinking interaction as an open-ended and creative enterprise. Animistic design offers an investigative strategy that exploits degrees of collaboratively curated uncertainty and unpredictability to imagine forms of digital interaction, and to engender creative human–nonhuman relationships within a given digital milieu.","",""
"2016","Epistemologies of prototyping: knowing in artistic research","ABSTRACT Increasingly material artefacts are attributed a key role in research in the arts and design. Issues of dissemination and legitimacy of knowledge are however heavily disputed, often through redefinitions of the concept of knowledge itself. This article contributes to these debates by focusing on artistic prototypes, identified here as one of the prevailing outcomes in technologically engaged art research projects. In contrast with a common conceptualisation of knowledge emerging from inside the world of artistic research as subjective, ineffable and emotional, I discuss four examples to highlight how artistic prototypes can support transferable and generative contributions to knowledge, grounded in ad hoc but innovative methodologies. Furthermore, the examples offer insightful considerations that help to identify artistic research when conducted outside official institutions, as opposed to simply process-oriented art practices.","",""
"2016","A certain breakthrough","From the call for papers on ‘speculative hardware’ we have selected two long articles that might begin to articulate a philosophy of the speculative for hardware and design. As part of the research I also conducted an interview with David Cuartielles (part of the founding collective initiating the Arduino platform) and held an interview and workshop with the artist Martin Howse, these will be published online as a companion to this special section of Digital Creativity. In the two selected articles, relations between matter and media (information, the digital, analogue electronics, physical computing and infrastructure) are foregrounded as a significant concern for media theory and in their proximity to new materialisms. We might extend these concerns to what Jussi Parrika names the ‘real but weird materialities’ of media (2012). Cultural concern with such weird materialities was, perhaps, prompted by the materialist methodologies of media theorist Friedrich Kittler. We used Kittler’s essay ‘There is no Software’ (1992) to structure our call for contributions. This essay was referenced explicitly in our call so that from the outset we could make clear the position that electronic media are speculative and grounded in the material (the body, the earth and in conductive substances). It is from this position that this introductory text discusses the essays included in this special section of Digital Creativity and approaches its subject of a speculative hardware. But what is a speculative hardware? In this introduction I want to explore this question by opening up a tension between the materiality and immateriality of speculative hardware by following the inclusion of work by Howse in the first article by Spencer Roberts, ‘Scratching Your Own Itch’ (Roberts 2016) and by taking a lead from the author of the second article, Jamie Brassett, in the speculative moment of thinking about design, through design and as design. When I say ‘following’ I rather mean to use these two leads as points of departure. The vector I want to trace out of these points, by way of introducing some of the themes in the articles included in this issue, begins with Howse’s (2006) translation of Kittler’s essay ‘Pynchon and Electromysticism’. Thomas Pynchon’s metafiction as well as his sense of electromysticism might be said to permeate Kittler’s own ‘speculative’ hardware—his ‘sheer hardware’. Kittler’s sheer hardware, as I feel Whitelaw (2013) correctly intuits it, is an imaginary media ‘no-software’ material computer (Whitelaw 2013). This is what might be called a thought experiment in matter, one that serves to reveal Parrika’s real but weird media. In this combination of the weird with media, there is an encounter with the strangeness of media materialities, ephemeral energetic fields and temporalities that ‘simply make you feel strange’; and a precipitous sheerness, like standing on the edge of chaos—perhaps this is the sense of the speculative that is implied in Roberts’ reference to coercive powers of the technical object and enabled in Brassett’s opening up of the speculative machine to the thought of Isabelle Stengers—the notion that there might be a new ‘normal’, that what is considered ‘normal’ now, in fact, is simply the chronoclastic and morphological material of speculative becomings—we will have further recourse to this before concluding, suffice to list for now: the powers of a shimmering and energetic field, a glamour; the Digital Creativity, 2016 Vol. 27, No. 2, 132–142, http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14626268.2015.1119551","",""
"2016","Speculative machines and technical mentalities: a philosophical approach to designing the future","Abstract ‘Beyond their instrumental functions', writes Rivka Oxman in an article about design, creativity and innovation (2013), ‘advanced digital and computational environments are also becoming tools for thinking design’. At the leading edge of creativity and innovation design does not only speculate the plausible, possible or potential, but pragmatically inserts such futures into the present (as Whitehead says any ‘immediate existence’ (1962) must). Using concepts mainly from Deleuze, Guattari, Spinoza and Simondon, I will position such design speculation as pragmatic, divergent, complex and emergent. That is, as manifesting the technical mentalities (Simondon) that provide the milieu in which we can show what we ‘might be capable of’ (Stengers).","",""
"2016","Sonic boundary objects: negotiating disability, technology and simulation","ABSTRACT In this article, we present the concept of sonic boundary objects by discussing the case of binaural sound recordings as a tool, which helps to negotiate between blind and sighted experiences of an urban soundscape. We begin with developing the theoretical underpinning of the concept of a sonic boundary object by briefly elaborating on the relevance of the concept of the boundary object in the context of disability and technology; we then explain the special properties of binaural recordings and revisit the musicological concept of the sound object, whose relationship with technology partly inspired the work in this article. After introducing these concepts and related practices we proceed by proposing the term of a sonic boundary object. We discuss the relationship of the sonic boundary object with the concept of simulation in the context of disability studies and we then elaborate on its potential impact as a complementary practice to blind ethnography and to participatory design approaches. We will demonstrate its ethnographic potential with an account of the authors’ experience using binaural recordings to exchange on what blind navigation is like in Montreal. The article concludes with a first-person reflection on this experience and possible fields of application.","",""
"2017","Reading Makers","Abstract                 Since its inception, digital and interactive art has been forced to negotiate the tension between the inherently spectacular nature of the technologies it uses and the desire of creators to embed relevant critical stances within the work. With the recent rise of “maker” or DIY culture, this negotiation has become even more pronounced as the production of technologies becomes more accessible and (allegedly) more democratized. In addition, our relationship with technology is becoming increasingly intimate. Whereas machines once could have been read as tools, through which we would enact our individualized wills, they now implicate themselves into our mental processes, our bodies and (one could argue) our very being. Within this cyborgian construction we risk mindless acceptance and integration of the particular logical models technology and its producers bring to the merger. A tension arises between our need to understand or recognize the logic which drives our lives and the technology, which often seeks to obfuscate that logic. This paper, through the application of philosophy of technology to a specific maker subculture - as it has been adopted by a movement in fine art (art and technology) - situates making as a form of artistic practice at the intersection of these ideas. As a mode by which technologically inclined artists can navigate the spectacular and the critical in their work, making allows these artists to enact criticality through revealing underlying technical (and social) logic in the systems (and objects) with which they engage. Thus, this paper will trace the philosophical foundations of this critical approach and finally analyse a series of works that reveal strategies through which “making” as a mode of “revealing” has been refined by artists as a critical approach to embedded technological systems.","",""

The motivation for this art piece was to enrich the usual static format of a stone sculpture with a dynamic dimension. The dynamic dimension is attained with virtual water droplets running over the stone surface which behave as real water droplets. The 3-D surface of a specially carved stone sculpture is during an exhibition continuously captured by the Kinect sensor. Each water drop out of many thousands, which are introduced into the installation as evenly distributed rain drops, falling over the sculpture, are simulated individually to run over the stone surface following the largest slope. These simulated water drops are projected with a video projector as light points on the surface of the sculpture. An observer can enjoy simultaneously the haptic experience of touching the stone and observing a digitally generated but physically grounded animation.","",""
"2018","Virtual Reality and the Syrian Refugee Camps: Humanitarian Communication and the Politics of Empathy","In recent years, virtual reality (VR) has gained traction in humanitarian communication through its utopian promises of copresence, experiential immediacy, and transcendence. I analyze three communication texts that engage with the Syrian refugee crisis. Two were made using immersive technology, and one is a traditional documentary. The article argues that VR brings new techniques of experiential immediacy to the practice of humanitarian communication, but it also uses meaning-making codes in the simulations of other peoples and spaces. Therefore, VR remains subject to the operations of dominant ideologies. Comparing these artifacts, the article demonstrates that although immersive technologies foreground the primacy of nonmediation, ignoring the structures of representation defangs the political possibilities of humanitarian communication.","",""

"2018","Digital Matters: Processes of Normalization in Medical Imaging"," &#x0D; With the introduction of advanced computing technologies, medical imaging increasingly entails normalization – through procedures that create, shape, and adjust comparable variables deduced from processes in the living body. The computational rationalities of imaging technologies such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and computed tomography (CT) not only determine how human bodies are envisioned and visualized, but also how they need to be aligned with apparatuses to answer experimental and diagnostic inquiries. By drawing on the theoretical concepts of computational rationality and intra-action and on ethnographic observations, we aim to disentangle processes of normalization and intra-actions of bodies and technologies in medical imaging on three levels. First, we show how, in the history of theoretical mathematics, dynamic processes were conceptualized as discrete and hence calculable. In particular, the ideas of Joseph Fourier informed the development of fMRI imaging algorithms, which are currently applied in experimental contexts. Second, we analyze how the application of these algorithms enables and determines practices in fMRI-based research. Third, we explore how bodies and technologies are aligned with tomography scanners on a very material level and thereby demonstrate the convergence of digitalization and materialization on both conceptual and physical levels, which opens up possibilities for visualizing and understanding human bodies. On a theoretical and analytical level, we argue that a critical analysis of digital imaging processes calls for scrutiny of the epistemic and operational preconditions that are actualized but concealed in the application of imaging technologies.","",""

The most oft-cited distinctive properties of Ryzom in the MMO world is the way creates not only an immersive sense of “worldness”, but a living, breathing, organic world. The game world is not only a richly animated “world” like all MMOs, but the aggregate of these animations also produce a sense of life, a “living world”. Following Silvio (2010) in particular, I ask how and when the properties of animation — understood in the narrow sense as a medium or media form — can produce a broader sense of “animacy” (Chen, 2012), a lively affect of “animatedness”: how and when animation (movement) is read as life; how an animated world becomes a living world. Specifically, why is it that in the animated world of Ryzom, as in animated cartoons, the animation of animality is central to this transition from animation to life: why the reading of animated “movement-as-life tends to settle on cartoon animals”. The “immersive” feeling of Atys as a ‘living world’ is displayed in the “emergent” animation of animals, particularly the ways that animals interact via “ecological” algorithms of predation and mutual care. animations which players explore as part of the emergent living worldness of Atys.","",""

Focusing on the immersion feature of VR stories, this study explicates the user experience to determine what it is like to experience news stories in VR and how immersion improves viewing experiences in IJ. This study proposes a VR experience model in the IJ context that integrates cognitive, affective, and behavioral factors as the primary influencing determinants. The results indicate that the meaning of immersion strongly depends on the users’ traits and contexts and that the function of immersion is strongly determined by the users’ own cognition and intentions. VR stories are viewed and accepted based on the manner that users imagine and intend to experience them. The model demonstrates the users’ cognitive processes of experiencing quality, value, and satisfaction, which determine how people empathize with and embody VR stories. The results confirm the relationship between immersion and both empathy and embodiment, implying a new conceptualization of immersion in the IJ context. ","",""
"2018","The mouse, the screen and the Holocaust witness: Interface aesthetics and moral response"," How do the aesthetic attributes of digital interfaces affect users’ ability to respond morally to the witnessing of suffering? Focusing on mainstream Graphical User Interfaces (GUI), this article proposes a phenomenology of user experience centred on the moral obligations of attending to, engaging with and acting upon digitized Holocaust survivor testimonies. The GUI, it argues, produces a regimen of eye–hand–screen relations that oscillates between ‘operative’ and ‘hermeneutic’ modes of embodied attention, creating a default condition of bodily restlessness that threatens prolonged, empathetic encounters with depicted others. Nevertheless, interface attributes of real-time screen interaction, haptic sensuousness and user-indexicality enable moral engagement with the witness-survivor, while translating information-sharing into the moral action of co-witnessing. These attributes enable an ‘ethics of kinaesthetics’ that converts sensorimotor responsiveness into moral responsibility. Digital interfaces have established a historically novel situation, where moral response to distant suffering depends on the smallest movements of our fingers and eyes. ","",""

To analyse the cognitive role of digital design tools, we carried out a protocol analysis of conventional design sketching and a 3D sculpture tool. Cognitive evaluation was a differentiating factor when considering the contextual role of the 3D sculpture tool in subsequent evaluations, non-sequential evaluations for conversion, and passive approaches within the design process. Cognitive evaluation played the following roles: validation, extension, navigation, exploration, and confirmation. The navigation, exploration, and extension roles played by non-sequential evaluation were mainly related to inductive design thinking. Finally, the types of cognitive evaluation and their roles when using the 3D sculpture tool were different, according to the design thinking type. This study explored the multidimensional roles of cognitive evaluation using a 3D sculpture tool and its relationship with design thinking types.","",""

It is widely understood that individuals who live with disability often experience a lifetime of bullying, exclusion, marginalization and rejection. They often experience workplace bias and discrimination. Yet, when they can create an identity and experience embodiment in virtual environments, the results can be extraordinarily powerful – even life-changing. This research builds on nearly a decade of ethnographic research in 3D online immersive social virtual worlds; seven of those years working with disability communities to answer the following: RQ1: In a virtual world where one can choose any avatar form, how does that visual sense of self-representation influence one’s ability to gain access to a social network, to be a leader in that network, and to find work? RQ2: How does realism in representation influence work experiences in these digital worlds? The results reveal the importance of choice in online representation of avatars in creating work and online social engagement. Implications contribute to our understanding of visual bias in the workplace and how emerging virtual reality technologies may open new avenues for meaningful work and social interactions for people with disabilities.","",""

We examined three sites on the sales chain that stretches from the laboratory to the living room: industry developer conferences, industrial prototypes, and end-user experiences. At each of these sites, marketers renegotiate VR’s novelty in order to sell it to specific constituencies. Paradoxically, these negotiations reveal how VR, typically presented as a disruptive innovation, has been called upon to stabilize and ensure the continuity of the past: that is, of particular cultural forms and of the industrial and technological infrastructures that sustain them. We argue that the enculturation of VR demonstrates that the processes that summon new technologies and construct them as novel also reinforce existing—and often unspoken—agreements about the ways that culture should be organized.","",""

"2019","What design education tells us about design theory: a pedagogical genealogy","ABSTRACT In design theory, we often come across scholarly efforts that seek to define design as a unique discipline and to characterize it as a distinct category of practice, with its own epistemology in that it differs from sciences, arts and humanities (Cross, N. 2011. Design Thinking: Understanding How Designers Think and Work. Oxford: Berg.; Dorst, K. 2015. Frame innovation: Create New Thinking by Design. Cambridge: The MIT Press. Nelson, H. G., and E. Stolterman. 2012. The Design Way: Intentional Change in an Unpredictable World. The MIT Press.; Redström, J. 2017. Making Design Theory. MIT Press.). Although such efforts are helpful in teasing forward the nature of design epistemologies and practices, we question them by critically engaging with epistemic paradigms informing design education, its structural forms, origins and purposes, historically, while suggesting the time has come to reevaluate design’s relationships with other epistemological traditions, including the sciences and humanities. We unpack history of design education, in order to problematize what we have come to view as overly schematized epistemological distinctions, most notably the asserted opposition between (what Schön calls) technical rationality and an alternative epistemology broadly linked to pragmatism and/or phenomenology. We do so by offering a genealogy of design education showing that since the nineteenth century, design programmes have continuously, if diversely, taught novice designers, methods, crafts, and attitudes that reflect diverse epistemological traditions. Theorists and educators of design have a shared interest in balancing the needs to appreciate and help develop that which is distinctive of design and also to build upon design’s rich epistemological connections to the sciences and humanities. Whereas the former helps the field improve its abilities to contribute to society, the latter provides many of the theoretical, methodological, and pedagogical resources that make such contributions possible.","",""

Based on the influence of design tools in ideation, we compared the problem-solving styles of WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer) and VRE (Virtual Reality Environment) for an apartment flat design task. Function-Behaviour-Structure ontology analysis revealed that WIMP was problem-driven with clear divisions between problem analysis and solution building, while VRE was predominantly solution-driven with frequent modifications of solutions. Such procedural characteristics led to uneven outcomes wherein spatial efficiency was better in WIMP while arrangement was more diversified in VRE. When the key factor was high manipulability of user interface in VRE, the result suggests that higher usability does not always produce desired outcomes. Time for problem analysis and a match between the tool and given problem must be taken into account.","",""

While many designers have relegated it to a passing phase in the history of design, it continues to gain purchase in the broader public sphere, where it is increasingly celebrated as a natural evolution of design’s diverse trajectories and the realisation of its moral potentials. This article offers a brief analysis of the contemporary status of the Design Thinking brand and, specifically, its popular deployment toward the solution of social problems. As a peculiar form of immaterial labour, Design Thinking is increasingly reliant on the elaboration of a debt to design, as a way of mitigating the problem of the potentially non-productive privatisation of the commons. Drawing on the work of Stefano Harney and Fred Moten, I consider the implications of this for its supposed beneficiaries. I argue that, to the extent that design is recruited toward Design Thinking, figured as a model of solving social problems, it risks reproducing the dominant debt/credit logic and denying histories of unpayable debt. What I call design study, by contrast, makes ‘bad debt’ a principle of elaboration, thus opening the way for different ways of experiencing our mutual indebtedness. doi: 10.15307/fcj.30.224.2019","",""
"2020","Coextensive space: virtual reality and the developing relationship between the body, the digital and physical space"," Virtual Reality (VR) has traditionally required external sensors placed around a designated play space. In contrast, more recent wired and wireless systems, such as the Oculus Rift S (released in March 2019) and the Oculus Quest (released in May 2019) use cameras located on the outside of these devices to monitor their physical position. Users can now mark out a physical space that is then digitally tracked within their display. Once a play space has been established, users are alerted if they come close to breaching this boundary by the visual inclusion of a grid. Should this threshold be breached, the headset display shifts to an image of the surrounding concrete environment. We contend that physical space is increasingly being incorporated into the digital space of VR in a manner that meaningfully differs from older systems. We build our argument in the following way. First, the article explores how theories surrounding VR have implicated only a limited relationship with physical space. Second, the article introduces the concept of coextensive space as a way of understanding the developing relationship between the physical, digital and concrete reality enacted by current VR systems.

Scarce attention, however, has been paid on empirically studying how performance artists balance their use of social media between the need to promote their work and the ambition to experiment creatively on the medium affordances. This paper explores the use of social media by Italian contemporary theatre artists and companies. The study aims to explore the relational labour (Baym 2018) of performance artists in tracing the boundaries between online/offline performativity and between personal self-narration and artistic promotion. Through a combination of profile analysis and in-depth interviews, we want to understand how this artistic scene - that always experimented on intermedial and participatory possibilities - is making sense of social media. Preliminary results show how social media interaction and content production is becoming an integrated part of companies working routines. Companies position their social media activity outside a purely promotional logic. This anti-promotional ethos translates to a lack of efficacy in terms of strategic communication. However, it also lays the basis for the use of social media to expand performative practices. Although the interviewed companies do not exclude such a possibility, they lament their current inability in making such an attempt. Lacking resources is the most quoted explanation of this failure, followed by the refusal to compromise with the constraints of online languages, and the distrust of social media to reach wider audiences.","",""
"2020","EVOLVING IDENTITY ECONOMIES IN SOCIAL VIRTUAL WORLDS","It is only in the past few years that the public has had much access to embodied, immersive, social virtual worlds through consumer virtual reality hardware. While these new experiences are still restricted to those who can access the proper equipment and have sufficient network connectivity, academics and others have rushed to explore and explain them. A rich history of experimental research scaffolds our understanding of what the experience of embodiment in an avatar brings to social experiences in immersive virtual reality. However, properly understanding these phenomena will also require a deep understanding of the history of social virtual worlds. Historically, platform constraints and affordances have influenced how people experience and express the social self in virtual worlds, and this has resulted in different “places” having different cultures, norms, and behaviors. We discuss how these cultures and norms may affect what users expect from an embodied experience, and how these expectations in turn will affect their concerns about privacy and identity. Specifically, different virtual cultures will result in different forms of “identity economies” in which users will either pay or exchange data to achieve embodiment. To illustrate, we discuss two models of embodied virtual reality worlds. We propose that this framing will help us to better understand how virtual worlds have evolved and are experienced now; how they may be studied, and how they may continue to evolve in the future as VR technologies create new experiences, affordances and limitations.","",""
"2020","Palmer Luckey and the rise of contemporary virtual reality"," Despite a lack of consumer interest as recently as 2012, virtual reality (VR) technologies entered the mainstream in 2014 backed by multinational corporations, including Facebook and Google. At the heart of this transition is Palmer Luckey, founder of Oculus and purported ‘face’ of VR. This article develops a case study centred on Palmer Luckey to examine the rise of contemporary VR within the overlapping, contemporaneous contexts of video game culture and the misogynistic gamergate movement. As gamergate expanded its scope with far-right political fervour, Luckey’s political ambitions also expanded in scope. I argue that Luckey’s promotion under the banner of ‘progress’ serves to reify White, male systems of power that are both established and contested within cultures of technological development.

"2020","Art museums and the incorporation of virtual reality: Examining the impact of VR on spatial and social norms"," Art museums implicate established spatial and social norms. The norms that shape these behaviours are not fixed, but rather subject to change as the sociality and physicality of these spaces continues to develop. In recent years, the re-emergence of virtual reality (VR) has led to this technology being incorporated into art museums in the form of VR-based exhibits. While a growing body of research now explores the various applications, uses and effects of VR, there is a notable dearth of studies examining the impact VR might be having on the spatial and social experience of art museums. This article, therefore, reports on an original research project designed to address these concerns. The project was conducted at Anise Gallery in London, United Kingdom, between June and July 2018 and focused on the multisensory, and VR-based, exhibition, Scents of Shad Thames. The research involved 19 semi-structured interviews with participants who had just experienced this exhibition. Drawing on scholarly literature that surrounds the spatial and social norms pertaining to art museums, this study advances along three lines. First, the research explores whether the inclusion of VR might alter the practice of people watching, which is endemic of this setting. Second, the research explores whether established ways of navigating the physical setting of art museums might influence how users approach the digital space of VR. Third, the research examines whether the incorporation of VR might produce a qualitatively different experience of the art museum as a shared social space. ","",""
"2020","Telepresence Enclosure","Virtual reality proponents often promise the technology will allow a more fully embodied sense of presence at a distance, or what researchers have called ‘telepresence.’ Departing from telepresence’s original focus on providing access to dangerous environments, VR and robotics researchers in Japan now promote everyday service and factory work via telerobots as a solution to the country’s rapidly shrinking workforce. Telepresence becomes a way to access the physical labor of the elderly, persons with disabilities, and foreign workers, while at the same time keeping them fixed in place at home or behind closed borders. This essay theorizes the perceptual segregation imposed by these immersive labor platforms as a form of telepresence enclosure: the mediated privatization of presence itself. If VR continues on its current trajectory, the telepresence enclosure is poised to enable technologically advanced countries to extract the physical labor of marginalized populations at home and abroad, while at the same time ensuring these workers remain excluded from a more fully embodied social mobility.   ","",""
"2020","Virtual Empathy","Abstract                This article offers a theoretical response to the recent interest in virtual reality (VR) as a technology for enhancing empathy. It argues that the version of empathy envisioned by the champions of the technology—one in which care for the other is a function of being able to collapse the other’s experience into one’s own—runs counter to the very concept of empathy, as originally construed, which preserves otherness in its alterity. The point is not simply to invoke a historical concept of empathy to contrast with the VR version, but to emphasize its enduring salience in response to recent technological developments. There is little doubt regarding the need for empathy, in the sense explored in this article, as we confront the pathologies of political fragmentation and social polarization facilitated by the current iteration of social media. However, this article argues that the VR version is more likely to exacerbate than redress these concerns.","",""

VR’s optical illusions produce an expanded multisensory immersive experience that enhances the viewer’s interior position within new space. This article questions where embodiment and disembodiment lie in VR’s multisensory optical illusion and whether there is a difference produced by the digital environment versus the photographic, live-action environment? It takes into account our present moment in the history of VR during which the fantasy of total bodily engagement and transference into the “machine” has not yet occurred. In doing so, this article considers the way VR uses synesthetic modes rather than direct sensory stimuli to engage more of the senses. ","",""

There is increasing interest in utilizing living media in the context of interaction design influenced by recent advancements in biological sciences that make new forms of responsive living media possible. We establish a definition of LMIs appropriate for HCI’s interdisciplinary domain. We provide an overview of the current design space and identify open research questions from four different perspectives: Biological, Ethical, Artistic, and HCI. For each perspective, we use a series of LMI exemplars to illustrate and ground themes and arguments. We conclude with a series of implications for design, including a discussion of LMIs’ ability to engage human users through being alive, their potential to symbolize and embody dynamic information, and the practical and ethical questions that designers need to consider when working with them.","",""
"2020","Compositional interaction design—changes in design practice and its implications for teaching and research","ABSTRACT In this article, we focus on compositional interaction design as an emergent professional practice in interaction design. We propose that compositional interaction design practice can be defined as a practice of knowing, mapping configuring, customizing and connecting elements to form larger compositional wholes. We demonstrate how this practice demands new compositional skills, new methods and a changed division of labours. We suggest that this contemporary practice can be understood in terms of how different computational components are integrated to form interactive products and services. We illustrate this new practice with two concrete examples. Our first example illustrates compositional interaction design at a small scale, whereas our second example illustrates compositional design at a larger scale. We also discuss how this emergent practice relates to other streams of development (e.g. craft-oriented HCI and human-centred design) and we discuss what implications this shift may have to interaction design educational programs aimed at preparing students for this emerging professional practice.","",""

The project first collected data on audience attention (eye-tracking), arousal (skin conductance level) and emotion (using facial expression). This data was then used in pedagogical materials delivered to two student cohorts in both lecture format and as an e-learning package. Self-reported survey data on the student experience indicates significant increase in Learning Interest toward the concepts of the DDCP, as well as strong ratings of the material’s Useability and Application to Knowledge. We also report on focus group discussions of the strengths and weaknesses of the DDCP. We show that the DDCP offers an innovative and novel intervention into contemporary screen creativity pedagogy, forging a valuable teaching-research nexus between the findings of the research field of cognitive media theory and their application in the field of student production.","",""
"2020","From immersion to collaborative embodiment: extending collective interactivity in built environments through human-scale audiovisual immersive technologies","ABSTRACT This paper discusses the use of human-scale immersive virtual environments as a platform for developing technologies for embodied digital interaction. We propose a three-body framework of spatial typologies in the realm of collaborative room-centered immersive systems that governs the relationship between the immersants, the hardware system of the environment, and the presented virtual environment. Through the lens of this framework, we present several use cases in the Collaborative-Research Augmented Immersive Virtual Environment Laboratory (CRAIVE-Lab) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Through the narratives of these use cases, it is argued that the proposed framework not only affords the design of interaction systems in room-centered virtual environments with spatial awareness, but also engenders new approaches to envision system design and its integration to the built environment. This framework intends to emphasize the significance of spatial thinking in expanding the creative potentials of body-driven interactive immersive systems.","",""

For an empirical study to analyse the cognitive influence of VR sketching, we conducted a pilot study for empirical research based on the protocol analysis of designers’ cognitive activities in VR sketching and compared the results with those of traditional sketching. Spatial inspection was a key behavioural factor of VR sketching when considering its high-frequency repetitive and continuous interactions with a designer's representation activities throughout the concept generation process. The cognitive impact of VR sketching revealed the following decisive features: extension of solution space, enhancement of idea transformation and inducement to a holistic design approach for concept generation. These findings provide insight for understanding the cognitive role of advanced digital design tools for future design research.","",""

Following Aby Warburg's ‘space of thought’ (1929), they define the thinking space of interactive media art as a ‘space filled with data’ (Strauss, W., and M. Fleischmann. 2001. The artists’ thinking space is the artistic exploration of an architecture of interactivity that ‘evokes’ communication ‘in a culture of simulation’ (Turkle, S. 2004). by involving people in a performative way. This article presents three of their projects, all based on the metaphor of the thinking space: ‘Semantic Map’, ‘Media Flow’ and ‘Energy Passages’ illustrate strategies of interactivity using artificial intelligence to ‘reinforce human intelligence’. The question is not whether machines can think, but whether people can still think when everything is automated.","",""

Developments by the author in making various generative digital abstract, or concrete, works are described and compared to film. The generation of the time element of the works described is integral with the generation of images. It is shown how different approaches to dealing with time in the digital context have emerged. In particular, an integrated constructivist approach has built from concepts in abstract film to go beyond cinema in a way that makes significant use of digital media. It has been possible to develop these works into interactive pieces by using artificial intelligent methods in various ways. True to the spirit of the early work described, these interactive works are also concrete rather than virtual. The art uses artificial intelligence to make real realities.","",""

A 3D water curtain, water drop generation and control program, fog screen and computer program for recognizing visitors were developed for this work. The water curtain, implemented using an array of solenoid valves, creates ephemeral sculptures in real time; the continuous evolution of shapes and images is used as a metaphor of Eternal Recurrence. We developed a method of controlling the solenoid valves that avoids problematic vertical shape distortion caused by gravity and noisy satellite water droplets around the main water drops. The motion of the falling water drops at the centre of the installation is mirrored by the motion of baby-like shapes projected on to the floor and ceiling of the space in which this work is installed. This gives the impression of a full or completed circle. Visitors enter the exhibition through a fog screen, which acts as an entrance port to this immersive experience. ‘Eternal Recurrence’ is a convergence of digital images (3D shape projections) with natural phenomena (falling water drops), which are carefully blended and controlled. As an example of systems art, the installation embodies a process in which all of the separate elements are seamlessly blended through a mechanical–electrical–computer system. The creation and experience of this harmonious system help us to reconsider our existence and networked relations in contemporary society.","",""

As such, they promote a heightened interest in transition design to secure experience continuity. In this paper, the authors argue that returning to the Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) concept of trajectories provides a fruitful starting point for considering transition design in CVR installations. However, explicit explorations of transitions and their design in HCI literature are limited. This contrasts with a strong design focus ‘in the wild’ across immersive genres including performance art, theme parks, video games, and live-action roleplay. Therefore, this paper advances the trajectory framework by returning to existing case studies with a transition design focus in order to discuss two existing design strategies and to mark future directions for research in the context of CVR.","",""

"2021","“What's the Brief?”","“What's the brief?” is an everyday question within the graphic design process. Moreover, the concept and importance of a design brief is overtly understood well beyond design practice itself—especially among stakeholders who work with designers and clients who commission design services. Indeed, a design brief is often an assumed and expected physical or metaphoric artefact for guiding the creative process. When a brief is lacking, incomplete or unclear, it can render an already ambiguous graphic design process and discipline even more fraught with misinterpretation. Nevertheless, even in wider design discourse, there appears to be little research on design briefs and the briefing process (Jones and Askland; Paton and Dorst). It seems astonishing that, even in Peter Phillips’s 2014 edition of Creating the Perfect Design Brief, he feels compelled to comment that “there are still no books available about design briefs” and that the topic is only “vaguely” covered within design education (21). While Phillips’s assertion is debatable if one draws purely from online vernacular sources or professional guides, it is supported by the lack of scholarly attention paid to the design brief. Graphic design briefs are often mentioned within design books, journals, and online sources. However, this article argues that the format, function and use of such briefs are largely assumed and rarely identified and studied. Even within the broader field of design research, the tendency appears to be to default to “the design brief” as an assumed shorthand, supporting Phillips’s argument about the nebulous nature of the topic. As this article contextualises, this is further problematised by insufficient attention cast on graphic design itself as a specific discipline. This article emerges from a wider, multi-stage creative practice study into graphic design practice, that used experimental performative design research methods to investigate graphic designers’ professional relationships with stakeholders (Meron, Strangely). The article engages with specific outcomes from that study that relate to the design brief. The article also explores existing literature and research and argues for academics, the design industry, and educationalists, to focus closer attention on the design brief. It concludes by suggesting that experimental and collaborative design methods offers potential for future research into the design brief. Contextualising the Design Brief  It is critical to differentiate the graphic design brief from the operational briefs of architectural design (Blyth and Worthington; Khan) or those used in technical practices such as software development or IT systems design, which have extensive industry-formalised briefing practices and models such as the waterfall system (Petersen et al.) or more modern processes such as Agile (Martin). Software development and other technical design briefs are necessarily more formulaically structured than graphic design briefs. Their requirements are generally empirically and mechanistically located, and often mission-critical. In contrast, the conceptual nature of creative briefs in graphic design creates the potential for them to be arbitrarily interpreted. Even in wider design discourse, there appears to be little consistency about the form that a brief takes. Some sources indicate that a brief only requires one page (Elebute; Nov and Jones) or even a single line of text (Jones and Askland). At other times briefs are described as complex, high-level documents embedded within processes which designers respond to with the aim of producing end products to satisfy clients’ requirements (Ambrose; Patterson and Saville). Ashby and Johnson (40) refer to the design brief as a “solution neutral” statement, the aim being to avoid preconceptions or the narrowing of the creative possibilities of a project. Others describe a consultative (Walsh), collaborative and stakeholder-inclusive process (Phillips). The Scholarly Brief Within scholarly design research, briefs inevitably manifest as an assumed artefact or process within each project; but the reason for their use or antecedents for chosen formats are rarely addressed. For example, in “Creativity in the Design Process” (Dorst and Cross) some elements of the design brief are described. The authors also describe at what stage of the investigation the brief is introduced and present a partial example of the brief. However, there is no explanation of the form of the brief or the reasons behind it. They simply describe it as being typical for the design medium, adding that its use was considered a critical part of addressing the design problem. In a separate study within advertising (Johar et al.), researchers even admit that the omission of crucial elements from the brief—normally present in professional practice—had a detrimental effect on their results. Such examples indicate the importance of briefs for the design process, yet further illustrating the omission of direct engagement with the brief within the research design, methodology, and methods. One exception comes from a study amongst business students (Sadowska and Laffy) that used the design brief as a pedagogical tool and indicates that interaction with, and changes to, elements of a design brief impact the overall learning process of participants, with the brief functioning as a trigger for that process. Such acknowledgement of the agency of a design brief affirms its importance for professional designers (Koslow et al.; Phillips). This use of a brief as a research device informed my use of it as a reflective and motivational conduit when studying graphic designers’ perceptions of stakeholders, and this will be discussed shortly. The Professional Brief Professionally, the brief is a key method of communication between designers and stakeholders, serving numerous functions including: outlining creative requirements, audience, and project scope; confirming project requirements; and assigning and documenting roles, procedures, methods, and approval processes. The format of design briefs varies from complex multi-page procedural documents (Patterson and Saville; Ambrose) produced by marketing departments and sent to graphic design agencies, to simple statements (Jones and Askland; Elebute) from small to medium-sized businesses. These can be described as the initial proposition of the design brief, with the following interactions comprising the ongoing briefing process. However, research points to many concerns about the lack of adequate briefing information (Koslow, Sasser and Riordan). It has been noted (Murray) that, despite its centrality to graphic design, the briefing process rarely lives up to designers’ expectations or requirements, with the approach itself often haphazard. This reinforces the necessarily adaptive, flexible, and compromise-requiring nature of professional graphic design practice, referred to by design researchers (Cross; Paton and Dorst). However, rather than lauding these adaptive and flexible designer abilities as design attributes, such traits are often perceived by professional practitioners as unequal (Benson and Dresdow), having evolved by the imposition by stakeholders, rather than being embraced by graphic designers as positive designer skill-sets. The Indeterminate Brief With insufficient attention cast on graphic design as a specific scholarly discipline (Walker; Jacobs; Heller, Education), there is even less research on the briefing process within graphic design practice (Cumming). Literature from professional practice on the creation and function of graphic design briefs is often formulaic (Phillips) and fractured. It spans professional design bodies, to templates from mass-market printers (Kwik Kopy), to marketing-driven and brand-development approaches, in-house style guides, and instructional YouTube videos (David). A particularly clear summary comes from Britain’s Design Council. This example describes the importance of a good design brief, its requirements, and carries a broad checklist that includes the company background, project aims, and target audience. It even includes stylistic tips such as “don’t be afraid to use emotive language in a brief if you think it will generate a shared passion about the project” (Design Council). From a subjective perspective, these sources appear to contain sensible professional advice. However, with little scholarly research on the topic, how can we know that, for example, using emotive language best informs the design process? Why might this be helpful and desirable (or otherwise) for designers? These varied approaches highlight the indeterminate treatment of the design brief. Nevertheless, the very existence of such diverse methods communicates a pattern of acknowledgement of the criticality of the brief, as well as the desire, by professional bodies, commentators, and suppliers, to ensure that both designers and stakeholders engage effectively with the briefing process. Thus, with such a pedagogic gap in graphic design discourse, scholarly research into the design brief has the potential to inform vernacular and formal educational resources. Researching the Design Brief  The research study from which this article emerges (Meron, Strangely) yielded outcomes from face-to-face interviews with eleven (deidentified) graphic designers about their perceptions of design practice, with particular regard to their professional relationships with other creative stakeholders. The study also surveyed online discussions from graphic design forums and blog posts. This first stage of research uncovered feelings of lacking organisational gravitas, creative ownership, professional confidence, and design legitimacy among the designers in relation to stakeholders. A significant causal factor pointed to practitioners’ perceptions of lacking direct access to and involvement with key sources of creative inspiration and information; one specific area being the design brief. It was a discovery that was reproduced thematically during the second stage of the research. This stage repurposed performative design research methods to intervene in graphic designers’ resistance to research (Roberts, et al), with the goal of bypassing practitioners’ tendency to portray their everyday practices using formulaic professionalised answers (Dorland, View). In aiming to understand graphic designers’ underlying motivations, this method replaced the graphic designer participants with trained actors, who re-performed narratives from the online discussions and designer interviews during a series of performance workshops. Performative methodologies were used as design thinking methods to defamiliarise the graphic design process, thereby enabling previously unacknowledged aspects of the design process to be unveiled, identified and analysed. Such defamiliarisation repurposes methods used in creative practice, including design thinking (Bell, Blythe, and Sengers), with performative elements drawing on ethnography (Eisner) and experimental design (Seago and Dunne). Binding these two stages of research study together was a Performative Design Brief—a physical document combining narratives from the online discussions and the designer interviews. For the second stage, this brief was given to a professional theatre director to use as material for a “script” to motivate the actors. In addition to identifying unequal access to the creative process as a potential point of friction, this study yielded outcomes suggesting that designers were especially frustrated when the design brief was unclear, insufficiently detailed, or even missing completely. The performative methodology enabled a refractive approach, using performative metaphor and theatre to defamiliarise graphic design practice, portraying the process through a third-party theatrical prism. This intervened in graphic designers’ habitual communication patterns (Dorland, The View). Thus, combining traditional design research methods with experimental interdisciplinary ones, enabled outcomes that might not otherwise have emerged. It is an example of engaging with the fluid, hybrid (Heller, Teaching), and often elusive practices (van der Waarde) of graphic design. Format, Function, and Use A study (Paton and Dorst) among professional graphic designers attempts to dissect practitioners’ perceptions of different aspects of briefing as a process of ‘framing’. Building on the broader theories of design researchers such as Nigel Cross, Bryan Lawson, and Donald Schön, Paton and Dorst suggest that most of the designers preferred a collaborative briefing process where both they and client stakeholders were directly involved, without intermediaries. This concurs with the desire, from many graphic designers that I interviewed, for unobstructed engagement with the brief. Moreover, narratives from the online discussions that I investigated suggest that the lack of clear frameworks for graphic design briefs is a hotly debated topic, as are perceptions of stakeholder belligerence or misunderstanding. For example, in a discussion from Graphic Design Forums designer experiences range from only ever receiving informal verbal instructions—“basically, we’ve been handed design work and they tell us ‘We need this by EOD’” (VFernandes)—to feeling obliged to pressure stakeholders to provide a brief—“put the burden on them to flesh out the details of a real brief and provide comprehensive material input” (HotButton) —to resignation to an apparent futility of gaining adequate design briefs from stakeholders because— “they will most likely never change” (KitchWitch). Such negative assumptions support Koslow et al.’s assertion that the absence of a comprehensive brief is the most “terrifying” thing for practitioners (9). Thus, practitioners’ frustrations with stakeholders can become unproductive when there is an inadequate design brief, or if the creative requirements of a brief are otherwise removed from the direct orbit of graphic designers. This further informs a narrative of graphic designers perceiving some stakeholders as gatekeepers of the design brief. For example, one interviewed designer believed that stakeholders ‘don’t really understand the process’ (Patricia). Another interviewee suggested that disorganised briefs could be avoided by involving designers early in the process, ensuring that practitioners had direct access to the client as a creative source, rather than having to circumnavigate stakeholders (Marcus). Such perceptions appeared to reinforce beliefs among these practitioners that they lack design capital within the creative process. These perceptions of gatekeeping of the design brief support suggestions of designers responding negatively when stakeholders approach the design process from a different perspective (Wall and Callister), if stakeholders assume a managerial position (Jacobs) and, in particular, if stakeholders are inexperienced in working with designers (Banks et al.; Holzmann and Golan). With such little clarity in the design briefing process, future research may consider comparisons with industries with more formalised briefing processes, established professional statuses, or more linear histories. Indeed, the uneven historical development of graphic design (Frascara; Julier and Narotzky) may influence the inconsistency of its briefing process. Inconsistency as Research Opportunity The inconsistent state of the graphic design brief is reflective of the broader profession that it resides within. Graphic design as a profession remains fluid and inconsistent (Dorland, Tell Me; Jacobs), with even its own practitioners unable to agree on its parameters or even what to call the practice (Meron, Terminology). Pedagogically, graphic design is still emerging as an independent discipline (Cabianca; Davis), struggling to gain capital outside of existing and broader creative practices (Poynor; Triggs). The inherent interdisciplinarity (Harland) and intangibility of graphic design also impact the difficulty of engaging with the briefing process. Indeed, graphic design’s practices have been described as “somewhere between science and superstition (or fact and anecdote)” (Heller, Teaching par. 3). With such obstacles rendering the discipline fractured (Ambrose et al.), it is understandable that stakeholders might find engaging productively with graphic design briefs challenging. This can become problematic, with inadequate stakeholder affinity or understanding of design issues potentially leading to creative discord (Banks et al.; Holzmann and Golan). Identifying potentially problematic and haphazard aspects of the design brief and process also presents opportunities to add value to research into broader relationships between graphic designers and stakeholders. It suggests a practical area of study with which scholarly research on collaborative design approaches might intersect with professional graphic design practice. Indeed, recent research suggests that collaborative approaches offer both process and educational advantages, particularly in the area of persona development, having the ability to discover the “real” brief (Taffe 394). Thus, framing the brief as a collaborative, educative, and negotiative process may allow creative professionals to elucidate and manage the disparate parts of a design process, such as timeframes, stakeholders, and task responsibilities, as well as the cost implications of stakeholder actions such as unscheduled amendments. It can encourage the formalisation of incomplete vernacular briefs, as well as allow for the influence of diverse briefing methods, such as the one-page creative brief of advertising agencies, or more formal project management practices while allowing for some of the fluidity of more agile approaches: acknowledging that changes may be required while keeping all parties informed and involved. In turn, collaborative approaches may contribute towards enabling the value of contributions from both graphic designers and stakeholders and it seems beneficial to look towards design research methodologies that promote collaborative pathways. Mark Steen, for example, argues for co-design as a form of design thinking for enabling stakeholders to combine knowledge with negotiation to implement change (27). Collaborative design methods have also been advocated for use between designers and users, with stakeholders on shared projects, and with external collaborators (Binder and Brandt). Others have argued that co-design methods facilitate stakeholder collaboration “across and within institutional structures” while challenging existing power relations, albeit leaving structural changes largely unaffected (Farr 637). The challenge for collaborative design research is to seek opportunities and methodologies to conduct design brief research within a graphic design process that often appears amorphous, while also manifesting complex designer–stakeholder dynamics. Doubly so, when the research focus—the graphic design brief—often appears as nebulous an entity as the practice it emerges from. Conclusion  The research discussed in this article suggests that graphic designers distrust a creative process that itself symbolises an inconsistent, reactive, and often accidental historical development of their profession and pedagogy. Reflecting this, the graphic design brief emerges almost as a metaphor for this process. The lack of overt discussion about the format, scope, and process of the brief feeds into the wider framework of graphic design’s struggle to become an independent scholarly discipline. This, in turn, potentially undermines the professional authority of graphic design practice that some of its practitioners believe is deficient. Ultimately, the brief and its processes must become research-informed parts of graphic design pedagogy. Embracing the brief as a pedagogical, generative, and inseparable part of the design process can inform the discourse within education, adding scholarly value to practice and potentially resulting in increased agency for practitioners. The chameleon-like nature of graphic design’s constant adaptation to ever-changing industry requirements makes research into the role and influences of its briefing process challenging. Thus, it also follows that the graphic design brief is unlikely to quickly become as formalised a document or process as those from other disciplines. But these are challenges that scholars and professionals must surely embrace if pedagogy is to gain the research evidence to influence practice. As this article argues, the often obfuscated practices and inherent interdisciplinarity of graphic design benefit from experimental research methods, while graphic designers appear responsive to inclusive approaches. Thus, performative methods appear effective as tools of discovery and collaborative methodologies offer hope for organisational intervention. References Ambrose, Gavin.

"2021","Design","Conventional definitions of design rarely capture its reach into our everyday lives. The Design Council, for example, estimates that more than 2.5 million people use design-related skills, principles, and practices on a daily basis in UK workplaces (Design Council 5, 8). Further, they calculate that these workers contribute £209 billion to the economy annually (8). The terrain of design professions extends from the graphic design of online environments, the business models that make them economically viable, and the algorithms that enable them to function, through to the devices we use, the clothes we wear, the furniture we sit on and the spaces where we live and work. Yet paradoxically a search of online dictionaries reiterates the connection of design primarily to drawing and making plans for buildings. As we witness the adoption of practices of “design thinking” in non-traditional design disciplines, it is interesting to note that the Italian renaissance term disegno, referred to both drawing and aspects of thinking. Giorgio Vasari claimed that design was “the animating principle of all creative processes” (Sorabello). Buckminster Fuller was just as florid and even more expansive when he argued that “the opposite of design is chaos” (Papanek 2). The Oxford English Dictionary captures a broad sense of design as “a plan or scheme conceived in the mind and intended for subsequent execution” (OED Online). This issue of M/C Journal offered contributors the opportunity to consider “design” in its broadest sense. The articles in this issue cast a wide net over design in both practice and theory, and emerge from varied disciplinary bases including material culture, graphic design, media studies, and architecture. The authors critique diverse design practices and pedagogy as well as the social reach of design and its political potential. Design Canons and the Economy While design histories begin with the earliest accounts of toolmaking (Margolin), the Industrial Revolution reinforced the more abstract intellectual dimensions of the discipline. Changing methods of production distinguished making from thinking and led to the emergence of the design profession (Spark). During the twentieth century, New York’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) was instrumental in not only raising awareness of design, but its exhibitions and acquisitions endorsed and canonised the styles and figures associated with “good design”. From its promotion of modern architecture in 1932, to the Good Design exhibition in 1950, MoMA’s advocacy reinforced a selective (and exclusive) canon for modernist design, educating the design-conscious consumer and reaching out to public taste, even advising of local stockists. Design became a means to mediate the art of the past with contemporary furnishings, that they accurately predicted would become the art of the future (MoMA 1). Drawing from this context, in this issue, Curt Lund’s essay interrogates a porcelain toy tea set from 1968 through the lens of material culture analysis to confirm its role in mediating relationships, transmitting values, and embodying social practices, tastes, and beliefs.  MoMA was not unique in recognising both the artistic merit and commercial potential of design. Few design activities are inseparable from the market economy and the language of design has infiltrated business more broadly. Design processes are used in seemingly novel ways across businesses and governments seeking to improve their digital and real-world services. A 2018 report by the UK’s Design Council recognised the expanding reach of design and the competitive advantage of design-based economies:  the skills, principles and practices of design are now widely used from banking to retail. Designers, too, have always drawn on a range of different skills, tools and technologies to deliver new ideas, goods and services. This is what makes design unique, and is how it makes products, services and systems more useful, usable and desirable in advanced economies around the world. (Design Council 5)  Underpinned by design, the global gaming market, for example, is an expanding multi-billion-dollar industry. In this issue, Heather Blakey explores connections made in the digital world. Her article asks, how the design of interactions between characters in the game world can align the player experience with the designer's objectives? The reality of working within the design economy is also addressed by Yaron Meron, whose article in this issue examines the frequent absence of the brief in the graphic design context. Meron highlights problems that arise due to a recurring failure to define the scope of the brief and its significance to a formal collaborative framework between designers and their clientele. Recognition of the design economy’s value has translated to the educational sector. With the expansion of design practice beyond its traditional twentieth century silos, higher education managers are seeking to harness design as a source of innovation, driven by the perceptions of value in disparate industries. This desire for interdisciplinarity raises significant questions about pedagogy and the future of the design studio, which has anchored design tuition since the late nineteenth century. Mark Sawyer’s and Philip Goldswain’s article proposes the employment of concepts from open design literature, “meta-design”, and design “frames” to inform a toolkit to enable shared meaning in an architectural studio setting. Design for a Better World  The American industrial designer George Nelson described design as “an attempt to make a contribution through change” (Packard 69), echoing the perception that progress represents improvement in a teleological sense. Many designers have long pursued social agendas and explored solutions to inequities. What loosely unites the disparate design disciplines is a shared sense that design improves the world we live in. But even with the best intentions, design does not inevitably lead to a better world. Accounts of design frequently recognise its shortcomings. These might include narratives that document or delight in famous design failures, such as the complex circumstances that led to the famed demolition of the Pruitt Igoe housing complex in the 1970s (Bristol). We also regularly encounter design flaws in the digital environment—whether an encryption algorithm open to compromise or online forms that do not recognise apostrophes or umlauts. Although on one level this leads to frustration, it also leads to other types of exclusion. Lisa Hackett’s article on 1950s-style fashion shows how the failure of the fashion industry to accommodate varying body shapes has led some women to seek solutions with vintage-style fashion choices. Hackett’s article brings to mind the serious concerns that occur when the standards that define the normative fail to account for large parts of the population. Overlooking gender and race can have a cumulative and significant impact on the everyday lives of women and minorities (Criado-Perez). The global pandemic has emphasised the dangers arising from PPE ill-designed for racial and gender diversity (Porterfield). The idea that design was a means of progressive improvement began to be prominently debunked in the 1960s with the discussion of the design life of machines, objects, and buildings. Planned obsolescence—or designed obsolescence as it was also known—came to attention in the early 1960s when Vance Packard’s The Waste Makers called into question the ethics of post-war consumerism. Packard’s work drew attention to the ethical responsibilities of designers, by revealing their complicity in the phenomenon of planned obsolescence. Packard’s critique linked the problem of “growthmanship” with issues of saturation and disposal (Packard 5). Large digital libraries replace physical objects but introduce new types of clutter. The anxieties produced by alerts that one’s device is “out of memory” may be easily dismissed as “first world problems”, but the carbon footprint of digital communication and storage is a global concern (Tsukayama; Chan). Digital clutter is explored in Ananya’s article “Minimalist Design in the Age of Archive Fever” in this issue. Ananya contrasts minimalist aesthetics, and Marie Kondo-style decluttering, with our burgeoning prosthetic memory, and its attendant digital footprint. In the late 1960s, Victor Papanek considered the ethics of design choices, and in particular, the nexus between design and consumerism, acknowledging Thorstein Veblen’s coruscating critique of conspicuous consumption. But Papanek also drew attention to contemporary environmental crises. He railed against industrial designers, architects, and planners, attributing blame for the profligate consumerism and environmental degradation arguing that “in all pollution, designers are implicated, at least partially"""" (14). Inclusive Design  Papanek’s influential advocacy acknowledged the political dimensions of design and the inherent biases of the time. In response to his teaching, Danish student Susanne Koefoed designed the now ubiquitous International Symbol of Access (ISA), which Guffey suggests is the most widely exported work of Scandinavian design (358). In this issue’s feature article, Sam Holleran explores the connection between visual literacy and civic life, and the design of an international symbol language, which aimed to ameliorate social disadvantage and cultural barriers. Discussions of inclusive design acknowledge that design history is most often Eurocentric, and frequently exclusionary of diversity. Articles in this issue examine more inclusive approaches to design. These efforts to make design more inclusive extend beyond the object or product, to examining techniques and processes that might improve society. Poiner and Drake, for example, explore the potential and challenges of participatory approaches in the design of buildings for a remote Indigenous community. Fredericks and Bradfield, in this issue, argue that Indigenous memes can provoke audiences and demand recognition of First Nations peoples. The meme offers a more inclusive critique of a national government’s intransigence to constitutional change that recognises Indigenous sovereignty and self-determination. Further, they advocate for co-design of policy that will enshrine an Indigenous Voice to the Australian Parliament. There are many reasons to be grateful for design and optimistic about its future: the swift design and production of efficacious vaccines come to mind.  But as Papanek recognised 50 years ago, designers, most often handmaidens of capital, are still implicated in the problems of the Anthropocene. How can design be used to repair the legacies of a century of profligacy, pollution, and climate change? Design needs its advocates, but the preaching and practice of design are best tempered with continuous forms of critique, analysis, and evaluation.

"2021","Reframing Architecture through Design","Re-Framing Participation in the Architecture Studio Recently, within design literature, significant attention has been given to collaboration across different disciplines (see for instance, Nicolini et al.; Carlile), as well as consideration of the breakdown of traditional disciplinarity and the corresponding involvement of users in co-generation (Sanders and Stappers, “Co-Creation” 11–12) through the development and deployment of structured methods and toolkits (Sanders et al., “Framework”; Sanders and Stappers, “Probes”). Relatively less attention has been paid to the workings of the “communities of practice” (Wenger) operating within the disciplinary domain of architecture. The discourse around concept design in architecture has tended to emphasise individualist approaches driven by personal philosophies, inspirations, imitation of a more experienced designer, and emphasis on latent talent or genius (for instance, Moneo). This can be problematic because without a shared language and methods there are limited opportunities for making meaning to facilitate participation between collaborators in architectural studio settings. It is worth asking then: are there things that “Architecture” might learn from “Design” about the deployment of structured methods, and might this interdisciplinary exchange promote participatory practices in studio-based cultures? We address this question by connecting and building on two important concepts relevant to design methods, meta-design as described in the open design literature (De Mul 36–37), and design frames as described by Schön and formalised by Dorst (‘Core’; Frame; see also Weedon). Through this combination, we propose a theory of participation by making shared meaning in architectural design. We animate our theoretical contribution through a design toolkit we have developed, refined, and applied over several years in typologically focused architectural design studios in Australian university contexts. One important contribution, we argue, is to the area of design theory-building, by taking two previously unrelated concepts from the design methods literature. We draw them together using an example from our own design practices to articulate a new term and concept for making shared meaning in design. The other contribution made is to the translation of this concept into the context of studio-based architectural practice, a setting that has traditionally struggled to accept structured methods. The existence of other form-metaphor design tools available for architecture and the theoretical basis of their development and connection to design literature more broadly has not always been clearly articulated (see for example Di Mari and Yoo; Lewis et al.). The rationale for giving an account of the construction and deployment of our own toolkit is to illustrate its theoretical contribution while providing the basis for future field testing and translation (including by other researchers), noting the established trajectory of this kind of work in the design literature (see, for example, Hoolohan and Browne; Visser et al.; Vaajakallio and Mattelmäki; Sanders and Stappers, “Co-Creation” and ”Probes”). In line with this issue’s thematic and epistemological agenda, we adopt what Cross identifies as “designerly ways of knowing” (223), and is at least partly a reflection on a practice in which we engage with our own disciplines and research interests to propose and deploy design thinking as a kind of critical “reflection-in-action” (Robertson and Simonsen 2). Meta-Framing: Combining Meta-Design and Framing Meta-design is a term used in open design literature to describe approaches aimed toward orchestration of a project in such a way that people are afforded the agency to become effective co-designers, regardless of their pre-existing skills or design-specific knowledge (De Mul 36). According to a meta-design approach, design is conceived of as a shared project of mutual learning instead of an individualistic expression of singular genius. Through the establishment of shared protocols and formats, what Ehn (1) calls “infrastructuring”, individuals with even very limited design experience are provided scaffolds that enable them to participate in a design project. One important way in which meta-design helps “create a pathway through a design space” is through the careful selection and adoption of shared guiding metaphors that provide common meanings between co-designers (De Mul 36). The usefulness of metaphors is also recognised in the context of design frames, the second concept on which we build our theory. Conceptualised as “cognitive shortcuts” for making “sense of complex situations” (Haase and Laursen 21), design frames were first conceived of by Schön (132) as a rational approach to design, one guided by “epistemological norms”. Frames have subsequently been further developed within the design methods literature and are defined as a system of counterfactual design decision-making that uses metaphors to provide a rationale for negotiating ill-structured problems. According to Dorst, frames involve:  the creation of a (novel) standpoint from which a problematic situation can be tackled … . Although frames are often paraphrased by a simple metaphor, they are in fact very complex sets of statements that include the specific perception of a problem situation, the (implicit) adoption of certain concepts to describe the situation, a ‘working principle’ that underpins a solution and the key thesis: IF we look at the problem situation from this viewpoint, and adopt the working principle associated with that position, THEN we will create the value we are striving for. (525)  Despite Schön choosing to illustrate his original conception of framing through the example of a student’s architectural design project, there has been limited subsequent consideration of framing in architectural studio contexts—an exception being Eissa in 2019. This may be because formalised design methods have tended to be treated with suspicion within architectural culture. For instance, Christopher Alexander’s Pattern Language is one such “highly systemised design process” (Dawes and Ostwald 10) that despite its potential to guide participatory design has had an “uneven reception” (Bhatt 716) within architecture itself. One way architecture as a disciplinary domain and as a profession has attempted to engage with design method is through typology, which is one of the few persistent and recurring notions in architectural discourse (Bandini; Grover et al.). As a system of classification, typology categorises “forms and functions as simply and unequivocally as possible” (Oechslin 37). In addition to being used as a classification system, typology has also been positioned as “a process as much as an object”, one with the potential for an “active role in the process of design” (Lathouri 25). Type and typology have been conceptualised as a particular way of projecting architecture’s “disciplinary agency” (Jacoby 936), and this goes some way to explaining their enduring value. A potentially valid criticism of framing is that it can tend toward “design fixation”, when a pre-existing assumption “inadvertently restricts the designers’ imagination” (Crilly). Similarly, typology-as-method—as opposed to a classification tool—has been criticised for being relatively “inflexible” or “reductive” (Shane 2011) and responsible for perpetuating “conservative, static norms” (Jacoby 932) if applied in a rote and non-reflexive way. We deal with these concerns in the discussion of the deployment of our Typekit below. We are drawing here on our experience teaching in the first two years of undergraduate architecture degrees in Australian university settings. As well as being equipped with a diversity of educational, social, linguistic, and cultural backgrounds, students typically have divergent competencies in the domain-specific skills of their discipline and a limited vocabulary for making shared meaning in relation to an architectural proposal. The challenge for studio-based collaborative work in such a context is developing shared understandings and a common language for working on a design project to enable a variety of different design solutions. The brief for a typical studio project will specify a common site, context, and program. Examples we have used include a bathhouse, fire station, archive, civic centre, and lifesaving club. There will then be multiple design solutions proposed by each studio participant. Significantly we are talking about relatively well-structured problems here, typically a specific building program for a specified site and user group. These are quite unlike the open-ended aims of “problem frames” described in the design thinking literature “to handle ill-defined, open-ended, and ambiguous problems that other problem-solving methodologies fail to handle” (Haase and Laursen 21). However, even for well-structured problems, there is still a multitude of possible solutions possible, generated by students working on a particular project brief. This openness reduces the possibility of making shared meaning and thus hinders participation in architectural design. Designing the Typekit The Typekit was developed heuristically out of our experiences teaching together over several years. As part of our own reflective practice, we realised that we had begun to develop a shared language for describing projects including that of students, our own, precedents and canonical works. Often these took the form of a simple formal or functional metaphor such as “the building is a wall”; “the building is an upturned coracle”; or “the building is a cloud”. While these cognitive shortcuts proved useful for our communication there remained the possibility for this language to become esoteric and exclusionary. On the other hand, we recognised the potential for this approach to be shared beyond our immediate “interpretive community” (Fish 485) of two, and we therefore began to develop a meta-design toolkit.  Fig. 1: Hybrid page from the Typekit We began by developing a visual catalogue of formal and functional metaphors already present within the panoply of constructed contemporary architectural projects assembled by surveying the popular design media for relevant source material.  Fig. 2: Classification of contemporary architectural built work using Typekit metaphors We then used simple line drawings to generate abstract representations of the observed building metaphors adopting isometry to maintain a level of objectivity and a neutral viewing position (Scolari). The drawings themselves were both revelatory and didactic and by applying what Cross calls “designerly ways of knowing” (Cross 223) the toolkit emerged as both design artefact and output of design research. We recognised two fundamentally different kinds of framing metaphors in the set of architectural projects we surveyed, rule-derived and model-derived—terms we are adapting from Choay’s description of “instaurational texts” (8). Rule-derived types describe building forms that navigate the development of a design from a generic to a specific form (Baker 70–71) through a series of discrete “logical operators” (Choay 134). They tend to follow a logic of “begin with x … perform some operation A … perform some operation B … end up with y”. Examples of such operations include add, subtract, scale-translate-rotate, distort and array. Model-derived framing metaphors are different in the way they aim toward an outcome that is an adapted version of an ideal initial form. This involves selecting an existing type and refining it until it suits the required program, site, and context. Examples of the model-derived metaphors we have used include the hedgehog, caterpillar, mountain, cloud, island, and snake as well as architectural Ur-types like the barn, courtyard, tent, treehouse, jetty, and ziggurat. The framing types we included in the Typekit are a combination of rule-derived and model-derived as well as useful hybrids that combined examples from different categories. This classification provides a construct for framing a studio experience while acknowledging that there are other ways of classifying formal types.  Fig. 3: Development of isometric drawings of metaphor-frames After we developed a variety of these line drawings, we carried out a synthesis and classification exercise using a version of the KJ method. Like framing, KJ is a technique of abduction developed for dealing objectively with qualitative data without a priori categorisation (Scupin; Kawakita). It has also become an established and widely practiced method within design research (see, for instance, Hanington and Martin 104–5). Themes were developed from the images, and we aimed at balancing a parsimony of typological categories with a saturation of types, that is to capture all observed types/metaphors and to put them in as few buckets as possible.  Fig. 4: Synthesis exercise of Typekit metaphors using the KJ method (top); classification detail (bottom) Deploying the Typekit We have successfully deployed the Typekit in architectural design studios at two universities since we started developing it in 2018. As a general process participants adopt a certain metaphor as the starting point of their design. Doing so provides a frame that prefigures other decisions as they move through a concept design process. Once a guiding metaphor is selected, it structures other decision-making by providing a counterfactual logic (Byrne 30). For instance, if a building-as-ramp is chosen as the typology to be deployed this guides a rationale as to where and how it is placed on the site. People should be able to walk on it; it should sit resolutely on the ground and not be floating above it; it should be made of a massive material with windows and doors appearing to be carved out of it; it can have a green occupiable roof; quiet and private spaces should be located at the top away from street noise; active spaces such as a community hall and entry foyer should be located at the bottom of the ramp … and so on. The adoption of the frame of “building-as-ramp” by its very nature is a crucial and critical move in the design process. It is a decision made early in the process that prefigures both “what” and “how” types of questions as the project develops. In the end, the result seems logical even inevitable but there are many other types that could have potentially been explored and these would have posed different kinds of questions and resulted in different kinds of answers during the process. The selection of a guiding metaphor also allows students to engage with historical and contemporary precedents to offer further insights into the development—as well as refinement—of their own projects within that classification. Even given the well-structured nature of the architectural project, precedents provide useful reference points from which to build domain-specific knowledge and benchmarks to measure the differences in approaches still afforded within each typological classification. We believe that our particular meta-framing approach addresses concerns about design fixation and balances mutual learning with opportunities for individual investigation. We position framing less about finding innovative solutions to wicked problems to become more about finding ways for a group of people to reason together through a design problem process by developing and using shared metaphors. Thus our invocation of framing is aligned to what Haase and Laursen term “solution frames” meaning they have an “operational” meaning-making agenda and provide opportunities for developing shared understanding between individuals engaged in a given problem domain (Haase and Laursen 20). By providing a variety of opportunities within an overarching “frame of frames” there are opportunities for parallel design investigation to be undertaken by individual designers. Meta-framing affords opportunities for shared meaning-making and a constructive discourse between different project outcomes. This occurs whether adopting the same type to enable questions including “How is my building-as-snake different from your building-as-snake?”, “Which is the most snake-like?”, or different types (“In what ways is my building-as-ramp different to your building-as-stair?”) By employing everyday visual metaphors, opportunities for “mutual learning between mutual participants” (Robertson and Simonsen 2) are enhanced without the need for substantial domain-specific architectural knowledge at a project’s outset. We argue that the promise of the toolkit and our meta-framing approach more generally is that it actually multiples rather than forecloses opportunities while retaining a shared understanding and language for reasoning through a project domain. This effectively responds to concerns that typology-as-method is a conservative or reductive approach to architectural design. It is important to clarify the role of our toolkit and its relationship to our theory-building agenda. On the basis of the findings accounted for here we do claim to draw specific conclusions about the efficacy of our toolkit. We simply did not collect experimental data relevant to that task. We can, however, use the example of our toolkit to animate, flesh out, and operationalise a model for collaboration in architectural design that may be useful for teaching and practicing architecture in collaborative, team-based contexts. The contribution of this account, therefore, is theoretical. That is, the adaptation of concepts from design literature modified and translated into a new domain to serve new purposes. The Promise of Meta-Framing through Typology Through our work, we have outlined the benefits of adopting formalised design methods in architecture as a way of supporting participation, including using toolkits for scaffolding architectural concept design. Meta-framing has shown itself to be a useful approach to enable participation in architectural design in a number of ways. It provides coherence of an idea and architectural concept. It assists decision-making in any given scenario because a designer can decide which out of a set of choices makes more sense within the “frame” adopted for the project. The question becomes then not “what do I like?” or “what do I want?” but “what makes sense within the project frame?” Finally and perhaps most importantly it brings a common understanding of a project that allows for communication across a team working on the same problem, supporting a variety of different approaches and problem-solving logics a voice. By combining methodologies and toolkits from the design methods literature with architecture’s domain-specific typological classifications we believe we have developed an effective and adaptive model for scaffolding participation and making shared meaning in architecture studio contexts.

"2021","Critical questions for Facebook’s virtual reality: data, power and the metaverse",": Virtual Reality (VR) represents an emerging class of spatial computing technology reliant upon the capture and processing of data about the user (such as their body and its interface with the hardware), or their surrounding environment. Much like digital media more generally, there are growing concerns of who stands to benefit from VR as a data-intensive form of technology, and where its potential data-borne harms may lie. Drawing from critical data studies, we examine the case of Facebook’s Oculus VR—a market leading VR technology, central to their metaverse ambitions. Through this case, we argue that VR as a data-intensive device is not one of unalloyed benefit, but one fraught with power inequity—one that has the potential to exacerbate wealth inequity, institute algorithmic bias, and bring about new forms of digital exclusion. We contend that policy to date has had limited engagement with VR, and that regulatory intervention will be needed as VR becomes more widely adopted in society.","",""
"2021","A CRITICAL FUTURE OF VIRTUAL REALITY: ALL WORK AND NO PLAY","Head-Mounted Virtual Reality (VR) is generally discussed as a gaming         technology, but in this paper we argue for the greater need to take VR seriously as a         general computing platform and future site for, and of, work. For Facebook (who hold a         dominant 39% share of the VR market) VR is not simply a gaming device but as a new frontier         for social media, framed by Zuckerberg as a “new kind of social computing platform”. In this         paper we report on our research that is examining the implications of VR as (1) a technology         being introduced into workplaces; as (2) a possible site for existing forms of labour, in         technologies like Infinite Office; and as (3) a platform for transformed and new kinds of         labour, such as remote work via telepresence. We identify concerning issues of algorithmic         discrimination, exascberated by a prevailing 'fantasy of perfect data' with VR, with serious         consequences in the context of productivity tracking and analytics, and the further         expansion of the gig economy into new domains.","",""
"2021","The Body, the Threshold, and the Cut: The Aesthetics and the Ethics of Measuring in Interactive Media Art","New media artists working on interactive installations often rely on different monitoring techniques, such as variable sensors in the design and the production of responsive environments and objects. In this short commentary, I will inquire into my installation Mother, Child (2011/2000) to address a new media art practice as productive alignment of agencies at the interface. The term body-sensor co-performance is used to foreground both the performative nature and the fundamental integrity of the technology and the body in interactive art. I will suggest that the setting of threshold values for different measuring operations can be understood as the boundary-making process, through which the installation feeds off the embodied liveliness of its audiences for its responsive actions. Drawing on Karen Barad’s work, these thresholds can be thematized as agential cuts. A number of specific examples in using sensors for interactivity are then addressed in order to inquire into the ways in which the questions of ethics and aesthetics entangle in creative and collaborative labors for Mother, Child.","",""
"2021","Fourth VR: Indigenous virtual reality practice"," Indigenous creators are currently using virtual reality (VR) tools, techniques and workflows in wide-ranging geographical locations and across multiple VR formats. Their radical adaptation of this new technology folds together cultural traditions and VR’s unique audiovisual configurations to resist dominant, particularly colonial, frameworks. Within this context, we ask how VR is being used to create space and capacity for Indigenous creatives to tell their stories and how do Indigenous creatives negotiate Eurocentric modes of production and distribution? To answer these questions, our Fourth VR database provides a snapshot of Indigenous VR works. By drawing on three case studies drawn from the database – The Hunt (2018), Future Dreaming (2019) and Crow: The Legend (2018) – as well as the wider patterns emerging across the database, it is possible to see an Indigenous-centred VR production framework. This framework is diverse but also contains repeated trends such as the ability to use VR to express and realize Indigenous Futurism; foreground native languages in virtual worlds; provide new articulations of Indigenous activism; embody connections between the past, present and future and demonstrate the interconnectivity of all living things. In turn, this growing body of work, engaging with the full spectrum of VR formats and tools, provides a rich contribution to the wider arena of VR practice. ","",""
"2021","‘You wouldn’t get that from watching TV!’: Exploring audience responses to virtual reality non-fiction in the home"," Consumer virtual reality (VR) headsets (e.g. Oculus Go) have brought VR non-fiction (VRNF) within reach of at-home audiences. However, despite increase in VR hardware sales and enthusiasm for the platform among niche audiences at festivals, mainstream audience interest in VRNF is not yet proven. This is despite a growing body of critically acclaimed VRNF, some of which is freely available. In seeking to understand a lack of engagement with VRNF by mainstream audiences, we need to be aware of challenges relating to the discovery of content and bear in mind the cost, inaccessibility and known limitations of consumer VR technology. However, we also need to set these issues within the context of the wider relationships between technology, society and the media, which have influenced the uptake of new media technologies in the past. To address this work, this article provides accounts by members of the public of their responses to VRNF as experienced within their households. We present an empirical study – one of the first of its kind – exploring these questions through qualitative research facilitating diverse households to experience VRNF at home, over several months. We find considerable enthusiasm for VR as a platform for non-fiction, but we also find this enthusiasm tempered by ethical concerns relating to both the platform and the content, and a pervasive tension between the platform and the home setting. Reflecting on our findings, we suggest that VRNF currently fails to meet any ‘supervening social necessity’ (Winston, 1996, Technologies of Seeing: Photography, Cinematography and Television. British: BFI.) that would pave the way for widespread domestic uptake, and we reflect on future directions for VR in the home. ","",""

The study used a 2 (self- vs other-embodied) × 2 (mirror vs photo presentation) between-subjects VR experiment ( N = 128), wherein participants played the role of a patient needing a kidney donation, either as themselves or as a typical organ-failure patient. Our findings showed that self-embodied perspective taking triggered self-oriented emotions (i.e. personal distress) and subsequently egoistic motivations that resulted in alternative prosocial behaviors (e.g. monetary donation, volunteering) than kidney donation. We found that embodying the other, rather than the self, had the practical benefit of inducing other-oriented emotions (i.e. empathy) and hence altruistic motivations that promoted kidney donation. This study clarified the conditions under which embodied perspective taking promoted different prosocial outcomes, and the specific mechanisms through which it achieved those outcomes. ","",""
"2021","Defining empathy: Interconnected discourses of virtual reality’s prosocial impact"," While a consumer revolution in virtual reality (VR) has piqued the interest of many fields, industries, and professions, it is unclear when, how, and to what degree the technology can elicit empathy. To better understand how the relationship between VR and empathy is communicated and defined, we performed qualitative and quantitative thematic analyses on popular ( N = 640) and academic articles ( N = 53) that included both terms. Findings revealed empathy is an aspirational term for journalists and researchers to showcase the potential of immersive media for prosocial change. Writers in both corpora suggested that empathetic experiences could lead to prosocial action through VR, but do not consistently define or measure empathy, given the inherent complexities surrounding the term. Drawing on seminal research in the field, we conclude with a definition of empathy related to immersive media. ","",""

An immersive experience of a simulated conflict scenario filmed from the outgroup’s point of view led to the judgment of the ingroup actors’ behavior as less moral and less justified compared to watching the same scenario as a two-dimensional video. This effect was not mediated through increased outgroup perspective-taking and empathy but through higher levels of hostile emotions toward the ingroup actors, which in turn were influenced by an increased sense of presence and engagement in the immersive experience. These findings provide initial evidence for the still widely unexplored potential of virtual reality as a new method for conflict resolution. ","",""
"2021","Examining virtual reality for pro-social attitude change","Virtual reality (VR) has become a more common medium both in professional and in personal consumer use in recent years. Broadly, hardware has continued to decline in price and increase in portability. Building on this work, scholarly inquiry has expanded from traditional VR to cinematic virtual reality (CVR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR), which combines several types of reality in one medium. The term XR refers to all aforementioned real-and-virtual combined environments. As a parallel development, the cost of producing and publishing VR content has become easier with new platforms such as YouTube Virtual Reality and Facebook 360°. Consequently, VR is being produced, published, and consumed more than ever, and as a result, VR has permeated numerous domains (Aitamurto, 2019). The increased availability of consumer VR has also broadened the field of researchers and designers using these platforms (Bevan et al., 2019). While entertainment and gaming remain the dominant contexts, VR has been increasingly deployed in a multitude of civic applications, including education, healthcare, journalism, enhancing mutual understanding, reducing gender and racial biases, and promoting altruistic behaviors. One common theme of these applications is using VR for pro-social attitude change. This potential is supported by decades of research showing that the traditional game-engine-based VR may be a powerful tool for affecting people’s attitudes (Bailenson, 2018). With its immersive features, VR can—perhaps—help users to understand other people’s perspectives better compared with other media. Many of the discussions about VR center around its ability to change behavior, for good or ill. Such applications of VR may change or enhance users’ attitudes, leading them to contribute to society positively. Therefore, this special issue focuses on examining VR as a platform and technology, which can contribute to social change by affecting people’s attitudes, behaviors, and understanding of others’ perspectives. Particularly relevant it is to explore whether, how, and under what circumstances VR contributes to pro-social attitude changes and their theoretical, methodological, and practical implications. These questions became particularly timely during the COVID-19 pandemic, which swept across the world in 2020 and has no end in sight at the end of the year. The rapidly spreading coronavirus caused a severe public health crisis, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations and causing large numbers of people to be isolated in their homes for long periods of time. Both work and school moved online for large chunks of the population, making previous face-to-face relationships “virtual” and prompting a boom in the purchase of XR equipment. 993129 NMS0010.1177/1461444821993129new media & societyAitamurto et al. research-article2021","",""

Participants were either represented by a set of virtual hands or had no representation during a VRPT task. Of those with hands, only half were able to choose their skin tone. Results showed that there was no significant advantage to having an avatar representation. However, if participants had an avatar and were able to choose their own skin tone, a higher proportion of participants performed prosocial behaviors and reported higher social presence scores compared with participants who had no choice. Regardless of condition, head rotations significantly predicted petition signatures such that the more participants rotated their heads side to side, the more likely they were to sign the petition. Moreover, when participants do not consistently rotate their head side to side, the proportion of petitions signed is on par with individuals who do not complete a VRPT task at all. ","",""
"2021","Voices of the unsung: The role of social presence and interactivity in building empathy in 360 video"," 360 video is considered an “empathy machine,” in part because it places audiences in the perspective of the other. Despite its popularity, its influence on empathy is not fully understood. Two possible mechanisms driving empathy within 360 video are social presence (sense of being with others) and interactivity (degree of control over media content). To elucidate how 360 videos can encourage empathic outcomes through these factors, a 2 (social presence: high/low) × 2 (interactivity: high/low) between-subjects experiment ( N = 110) was conducted testing 360 videos about Alaskan climate change refugees. Results demonstrate that social presence contributes to prosocial behaviors (donations) through empathic concern, an effect augmented by interactivity. Unexpectedly, the social presence manipulation also contributed to greater perceived interactivity. Collectively, results are promising and elucidate the role of social presence and interactivity in immersive storytelling. ","",""

With virtual reality (VR) headsets increasingly affordable and normalized as a mental health treatment modality, VR is being adopted by prisons around the United States. We argue that the risks and affordances of VR in this political context necessitate centering those with lived experience as creative agents to avoid designing media that re-traumatizes, reduces the complexities of reentry, and reproduces oppressive prisoner–guard dynamics. This article documents and analyzes the design process of a VR reentry program for a state prison to help incarcerated women practice responding to high-stress reentry situations, prior to their release. The resulting VR prototype draws on therapeutic VR work but takes a community-based participatory design approach. We conclude by discussing the institutional and cultural tensions of implementing a participatory design process in a US state prison system. ","",""

However, their creation challenges costume designers and technicians because they demand expertise in interaction design and electronic engineering. This article aims at empowering performance professionals to exploit the full potential of interactive costumes by discussing the creation process from the creators’ perspectives. Insights from expert interviews highlight that costume design combined with interaction design underlies the profile of interactive costume designers, whilst costume construction combined with electronic engineering underlies the profile of interactive costume technicians. Together, these profiles are capable of creating interactive costumes if complemented with expertise in e-textiles and body-centred design and development approaches. The findings suggest that teamwork between disciplines is essential, resulting ideally in transcending disciplinarity through shared practices, and using diverse methods, materials, and knowledge. All of this might evoke a paradigm shift in the practice and education of costume creators and other respective professions.","",""

The objective of this study is to propose a theoretical model describing the links between user experience and creativity. Pre-existing theoretical links have been identified in relevant scientific literature. Two experiments were then conducted in order to identify new links and replicate results. These experiments involved respectively 76 and 42 participants who individually performed a task requiring divergent creativity using virtual reality drawing tools. The results indicate that cybersickness leads to a decrease in fluency, i.e. the number of ideas generated, but also shades the links between flow and the relevance of the ideas generated. On the basis of this result, we propose the CRUX model to lead to recommendations for the design of tools and simulations to support divergent creativity.","",""

The role of digital tools and distributed intelligence in woodblock printmaking practice","ABSTRACT Artists’ adoption of CNC devices and related technologies is making possible novel printmaking processes and variations on techniques. Such changes suggest a need to broaden our understanding of what constitutes a print under contemporary technological conditions. This article looks at the human-machine relationship and the state of creative cognition in the act of woodblock printmaking. Connections between the printmaker’s and programmer’s notions of creating lines indicate different ways of thinking-drawing space and position the resulting 2D print not just as the transfer of ink from block to paper but also existing as lines of code and as a 3D space. By drawing parallels between the embodied yet distributed act of traditional Japanese woodblock printmaking and the experience of CNC computerized carving in the work of Mike Lyon, I explore how woodblock printmaking might facilitate a productive collaboration with digital carving technologies.","",""

Previous cultural heritage-based artworks failed to adopt symbolic narratives. This study adopts a framework based on a narrative structure to apply symbolism to interactive artwork effectively. It proposed the following five narrative structures to create the abovementioned framework: symbol, mission, activity, change, and artistic embodiment. Two prototypes were created for experimental evaluation to test the effectiveness of the proposed framework in immersion, artistic experience, and artistic value. A comparative experiment of the two prototypes with 80 audience members revealed the framework’s significant effect in terms of artistic value. This study has implications for artists and researchers, as applying the proposed framework will improve the artistic value of their artwork.","",""
"2022","Virtual reality and celebrity humanitarianism: Rashida Jones in Lebanon"," The paper brings together two segments of contemporary humanitarian practice – celebrity advocacy and virtual reality (VR) – in order to more fully comprehend the relationship between emergent technologies and humanitarian advocacy efforts. Numerous VR documentaries intended to immerse audiences into the full experience of “distant suffering” have been crafted for audiences in the global North. Between 2015 and 2019, the United Nations invested in at least 21 VR documentaries covering crisis situations around the world. VR’s popularity is premised on the promise of bringing spectators and “distant sufferers” together through immersive experiences. Performances of humanitarian advocacy use traditional representational tools of Western humanitarian discourse. This leads to the question whether advocacy efforts using immersive VR flatten real and material differences that exist between sufferers and spectators in safe zones through the “illusion of co-suffering”? To what extent do such experiences risk “improper distance” by translating the irreducible alterity of other lives into familiar terms? ","",""

"2022","Rage against the empathy machine revisited: The ethics of empathy-related affordances of virtual reality","Virtual reality (VR) has been designated as the ‘ultimate empathy machine’ due to its alleged ability to powerfully immerse users in another’s perspective. As VR has attracted growing attention, criticism of its alleged ‘empathic superpowers' has also gained strength. Critics have recently argued that the empathic VR vision is ethically flawed since it is misleading and denies non-communicable aspects of the Other. Moreover, several scholars argue that VR empathy rhetoric in fact exploits the marginalised targets of empathy, turning them to objects ‘identity tourism’ for the privileged. The paper revisits these claims, arguing that they rely on empathy notions that are dominant in traditional art-media, while overlooking VR’s unique experiential affordances. Drawing on psychophysiological evidence, it argues that the ethical significance of VR lies in the unique ways in which it manipulates the user’s body scheme via multisensory stimulation. These manipulations result in unprecedented empathy-related perceptual and conceptual transformations whose ethical implications require new ethical framing.","",""
"2022","Embodied parallelism and immersion in virtual reality gaming"," This article argues that virtual reality produces a sense of immersion through embodied parallelism – a technical mediation in which the embodied gestures and movements of a player must correspond to what is represented within a VR game, a correspondence which relies on, but exceeds the visual and requires strange requirements for both player (in terms of their gestures and movements) and game (in terms of including particular limits that police the movements of the player’s body). Attending to embodied parallelism refuses several longstanding assumptions about how virtual reality technologies, and media in general, generate the feeling of immersion – namely, the idea that immersion ‘disembodies’ in some way, or denies the existence of physical space beyond the boundary of a mediated simulation. Immersivity is premised on an explicit engagement with – and not exclusion of – both the physicality of the body and the physicality of a medium, if in deeply contradictory ways. As a case study to develop this concept, this article discusses the emerging virtual reality genre of ‘physics games’, games including, but not limited to, Blade &amp; Sorcery, Boneworks and Half-Life: Alyx. These games take great lengths to simulate the physics of objects – they require simultaneously intrusive and yet ‘natural’ interfaces, in which the game demands the body to move as if it were manipulating objects that have a specific mass. Becoming ‘good’ at these games depends on the ability to discipline the body and conform to the demands of movement required by the simulation. Immersion, in this context, depends on a willingness to submit to these machinic, embodied demands, relying both explicitly on technical form but deliberately forgetting the materiality of gesture and mediation at the same time. This seeming contradiction, an engagement with both the materiality of gesture and the materiality of medium, is ‘solved’ through embodied parallelism and how it links player and game. ","",""
"2022","Contiguous identities","In October 2021, Facebook, Inc. changed its name to “Meta Platforms, Inc.” A key part of this rebranding involved Facebook’s long-term focus on virtual reality (VR) and the future of the supposed Metaverse. Significantly, as of November 2021, users have only been able to access the VR space of Meta if they sign in through their social networking account. While Facebook has suggested it will change this in the future, the specifics of this future have yet to be explained. The purpose of this article, therefore, is to explore the implications of identity within VR if identity within this space is tethered to a corresponding social networking account. Here we suggest the virtual self currently being forged in Meta forms a connective tissue between (1) early accounts of online communication enabling the body to be left behind and (2) more embodied approaches to identity in the context of digitality. We then argue that the virtual self is not a singular entity per se but forms a contiguous connection between the lived experience of VR and data gathered through social media about the identity associated with said experience. Finally, we argue conceptualizations of identity in VR (and Meta’s role in identity) will only become more pressing as Meta attempts to build its supposed “Metaverse” in the coming years.","",""

Through a close reading of promotional material, we first describe and analyse the ‘Oculus imaginary’ – the narrative produced by Facebook about the Oculus as integrated into and enhancing the experience of Facebook’s wider suite of social software. The purpose of this narrative, we suggest, is to construct and ‘sell’ a Facebook-specific vision of VR’s potentials – one that is appealing both to end users and platform complementors – and moreover, a vision that appears to be conducive to Facebook’s current methods for accumulating profit and power. Following on, we develop via a study of YouTube user comments posted on promotional videos for the Oculus, an anticipatory account of how the Oculus imaginary is perceived to relate to the lives and values of everyday individuals.

"2022","Effects of immersive storytelling on affective, cognitive, and associative empathy: The mediating role of presence"," Popular claims of virtual reality systems serving as ‘empathy machines’ often fail to consider (a) the cognitive mechanisms driving the effects of technological immersion on empathy and (b) the conceptualization of empathy as a multidimensional construct. More, recent research has yielded mixed empirical support. This study investigates how dimensions of psychological presence—perceived self-location, sense of copresence, and judgments of social realism—mediate the effect of immersion on cognitive, affective, and associative empathy. Findings indicate that experiencing a news story via 360° video on a head-mounted display led to stronger self-location and copresence than engaging with the same video via desktop or reading a text version. While only copresence increased cognitive empathy, both self-location and copresence facilitated affective empathy. Whereas self-location and copresence enhanced associative empathy, social realism decreased it. These results highlight the value of a multidimensional conceptualization of empathy in investigating the prosocial potential of immersive media. ","",""

This study developed a virtual reality (VR) supported lighting sketch tool for vehicle interior designers. The tool incorporated lighting design with drag-and-drop functionality and high-definition vehicle rendering. The tool also used the Wizard-of-Oz method to help design participants easily immerse themselves into the design tasks. Six designers participated in two consecutive hour-long design workshops to evaluate the design tool. Each designer sketched eight scenarios, and the workshop gathered 48 design outcomes. In addition, a thirty-minute post-interview evaluated usability, the immersive experience of the virtual environment, and the expected role of the wizard. Finally, thematic coding was used on both workshop and post-interview verbal records to further evaluate the tool's compatibility. As a result, three vital roles of the tool were identified. First, the tool encouraged the iteration process. The tool also gave realistic design-practice experiences and would be suitable for sketching lighting in the workplace. Finally, the tool allowed designers to immerse themselves in the design space. This research anticipates a well-illustrated virtual context and situations that invite designers into an inspirational lighting design workplace.","",""

This project aims at creating a documentary and artistic experience that departs from conventional immersive journalism by presenting to its viewers a story made out of very small narrative units, and with subjects presented in the form of virtual sculptures devoid of any specific identity. The idea is that by leaving much of the making sense left open, viewers will have to fill in the gaps. The working hypothesis is that this will help create a different emotional, intellectual and political connection with the piece than that a conventional documentary would achieve, particularly to an audience unfamiliar with, or even politically alien to its specific context. Public exhibition of the work and user evaluation showed that the piece was successful in creating such connections.","",""
"2023","The widening rift between aesthetics and ethics in the design of computational things","AbstractIn the face of massively increased technological complexity, it is striking that so many of today’s computational and networked things follow design ideals honed decades ago in a much different context. These strong ideals prescribe a presentation of things as useful tools through design and a withdrawal of aspects of their functionality and complexity. Beginning in the mid-twentieth century, we trace this ‘withdrawal program’ as it has persisted in the face of increasing computational complexity. Currently, design is in a dilemma where computational products can be seen as brilliantly designed and engaging to use yet can also be considered very problematic in how they support hidden agendas and often seem less than trustworthy. In this article, we analyse factors shaping this emergent ethical dilemma and reveal the concept ofa widening riftbetween what computationalthings actually are and doandthe ways in which they are presented as things for use. Against this backdrop, we argue that there is a need for a new orientation in design programs to adequately address this deepening rupture between the aesthetics and ethics in the design of computational things.","",""
"2023","Stretching immersion in virtual reality: How glitches reveal aspects of presence, interactivity and plausibility"," Virtual reality (VR) immerses users in others’ lives, creating empathy and understanding long after the VR scenario has finished. As VR technology has matured, VR scenarios have begun to be used in complex real-world areas such as education, health and organisational change. These scenarios can be of variable technical quality, with limited interactive capacity, unrealistic environments and clunky or absent avatars. In this study, three scenarios related to gender inequality training were constructed with glitches in the core immersive qualities of presence, interactivity and plausibility in order to understand their effect on the immersive experience. Using a multi-step in-depth series of qualitative interviews to examine the whole immersive process, the results show that immersion is not compromised but changed by glitches. Limited interactivity led to uncomfortable interactions that allowed participants to process difficult emotions; implausible situations surfaced buried norms and prejudices; and avatar variation gave rise to a sense presence that also included distance, which gave the user opportunities for critical reflection. These results point towards immersion as a robust and richly textured concept, while interactivity, plausibility and presence can best be understood as dimensions rather than goals. Totally seamless and immersive experiences may not only be utopian but also unnecessary. The glitches in low-end productions can produce powerful communication without expensive technology. ","",""
"2023","Mediatisation, digital spaces and live performance: Understanding Indian stand-up comedy and evolving performance landscapes"," This paper is a reflection on the points of convergence between live performance and the media within Indian stand-up comedy. Traditionally, live performance has been seen in opposition to the media. While the former is defined by spatial and temporal co-presence of the audience and spectators, the latter has neither (Auslander, 2012). While stand-up comedy is primarily live, digital and mass media are used extensively by comedians to build a professional reputation for themselves through their presence and participation on social media. However, after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, much of performance art – including stand-up comedy – has moved online. That is, comedians are experimenting with the online media: Zoom, Instagram Live, Facebook Live and so on, to put up live performances that would otherwise have been performed within a comedy club or café. This paper derives its theoretical basis from Philip Auslander’s postulation of liveness in a mediatised culture and digital liveness which ‘results from our conscious act of grasping virtual entities as live in response to the claims [technology makes] on us’ (2012: 13). The paper attempts a theoretical reflection on how to ‘read’ a stand-up comedy performance for pedagogical purposes in these different contexts as the idea of liveness, mediatisation and our experience of the live evolves with time and context.

"2023","“Through the digits, through the fingers”: Variations on the string figure as imaginary digital medium","This article considers artistic engagements with string figure performance and collection as ‘imaginary’ articulations of digital media. As an object of anthropological inquiry, the string figure emerges in 1888 with a short paper by Franz Boas. Encouraged by more mainstream publications by Caroline Furness Jansen (2008) and Kathleen Haddon (1930), over the course of the 20th century the string figure would become a model through which largely western writers and artists have explored both the anxieties and dreams of ideal, embodied and networked communication technologies. The present article explores, specifically, the collecting projects and films of Harry Smith in the 1960s and 1970s; the video-performance piece of 1974, titled String Games: Improvisations for Inter-City Video, by the interdisciplinary artist Vera Frenkel; and the string figure exhibit at David Wilson’s Museum of Jurassic Technology in Culver City, California. Through a media-archeological lens, the history of string figure fascination takes shape as a repository of dreams about (digital) communication, which, it is additionally suggested in a final section, might yet allow for the expansion and enlargement of conceptions of both digitality and media.","",""
"2023","The promise of beginnings: Unpacking ‘diversity’ at Oculus VR","This paper presents a case study of the inaugural year of Launch Pad, a diversity initiative by Meta’s virtual reality (VR) subsidiary, originally known as Oculus. As industry-led discourse presented VR as a vision of opportunity and change in the tech industry, Launch Pad presented a vision of social progress through improved diversity. However, a variety of contextualizing factors within that first year complicate these visions of progress, including the gendered and racialized norms of the tech industry, the politics of Oculus’s co-founder and the mixed feelings of the first beneficiaries of the program. I argue that even if Launch Pad is a good faith effort to address historical and current forms of marginalization and underrepresentation in the tech industry, such efforts must go much further than mentorship and tokenized inclusion, requiring a genuine recognition of the need for systemic change.","",""
"2023","The new ethical thinking in CGI immersive journalism"," Virtual reality (VR) journalism has become one of the popular formats of journalism, where people experience presence, empathy, and immersion through VR technology in digital environments. Although the term ‘virtual’ may appear to be the opposite of ‘real,’ the boundary between virtuality and reality has become blurred due to the virtual embodiment being part of reality for participants. As VR and real virtuality converge, little is known about the ethical issues in producing computer-generated imagery (CGI) immersive journalism and the viewers’ responses to CGI VR news reporting. Our study applied a concurrent mixed-method approach, including in-depth interviews with eight CGI professionals from the U.K. and a quantitative survey in Taiwan, to understand the production issues, ethical concerns, and audience perceptions toward CGI immersive journalism. Results from the interviews suggested that digital journalists need to rethink their ethical codes, particularly the representation of truth while producing news stories using CGI images and VR. Findings from the post-test survey showed that both immersive presence and interactivity in VR news resulted in a greater formation of believing and motivations to take action regarding the topic presented in the VR news.

The first framework focuses on the relationship between the completeness of the products when they meet the users, the level of users’ design skills, and possible user-intervention types to the product. The second framework focuses on environmental and economic sustainability, considering the benefits and risks of four possible scenarios according to the user-engagement type.","",""

"2024","Technological mediation and 3D visualizations in construction engineering practice","AbstractThe generation and use of 3D images and visualizations through remote sensing, Building Information Modeling, and Augmented Reality technologies, have come to play a significant role in construction engineering practice. Although these technologies are promising, their potential can be misjudged when potential end-users are unaware of key assumptions that were made by developers. Realistic expectations require insights into the ways in which these technologies transform input collected into 3D visualizations and how these visualizations are possibly used on construction sites. This study’s objective is hence to explore the form of technological mediation that the generation and use of 3D images and visualizations provide between a human and objects, or aspects of these objects, that would otherwise be largely imperceptible to professionals in construction practice. We show that algorithms pre- and post-process data through their technological selectivities, which function as mediators. Double mediations of augmented and engaged relationships play a dominant role in the use of 3D images and visualizations and enhance the situational awareness of professionals in construction practice. This is the first study that applies this perspective to increase the understanding of the mediating role of 3D images and visualizations in construction practice.","",""

"2024","Your money or your data: Avatar embodiment options in the identity economy"," In the physical world, choices about self-representation are tied to the body. However, avatar embodiment offers users many more options. These options are often constrained or promoted according to the economic models of the platforms that support different virtual worlds. Still, work on user motivations for avatar embodiment has generally not accounted for these constraints. To help explain users' interest (or lack of interest) in immersive technology, we discuss the mismatch between platform intentions and avatar affordances. We describe how user and platform motivations intersect in the ‘embodied identity economy’, a model in which users either ‘pay’ for access to embodied experiences with data from their physical identity or fund economy with cash payments. We present a framework of avatar embodiment using two dimensions: consistency versus discrepancy with the user’s physical identity, and experiential versus identity-based self-presence. We describe three ways in which avatars can be consistent with the user’s physical body: through appearance, through behavior, and the extent to which avatar data is linked with the user’s identity in the physical world. We relate this concept to recent discussions of a proposed ‘metaverse’ as a hub for life online. ","",""

Female participants customized avatars that merged their physical self with hero, antihero, or villain archetypes and then interacted with a mindful or non-mindful virtual human; 82.8% of participants went above the maximum electric shock intensity. Women who customized hero avatars delivered lower voltage shocks to a virtual human compared with those who customized antihero and villain avatars. Virtual humans’ display of mind did not affect shock intensity, guilt, or negative emotion though participants reported increased shame after shocking a mindful versus a non-mindful virtual human.

We use practice theory perspectives to interpret 30 semistructured interviews with active Dribbble users. We find that the niche site Dribbble, along with the constellation of sites around it, is changing professional design practices, in both positive and negative ways. In this study, the focus looks at the ways the work of design professionals unfolds. Our participants, professional designers on Dribbble report that the site changes how they find inspiration to solve design problems, give and receive design feedback from/for other designers, and look for jobs. Our work suggests that by being a primary source of inspiration for many designers, Dribbble may be influencing trends in the wider industry. In addition, Dribbble may be nudging the design industry into a more global stance with respect to hiring designers. Our work contributes to social media studies by showing a link between a design site such as Dribbble and changing practices in the design industry. It also contributes to the literature by looking beyond Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit into practices on smaller social media sites. ","",""

"2025","Narrative virtual reality as a memory machine","Since 2014, a new narrative medium has been emerging that is delivered through virtual reality headsets. This paper theorizes narrative virtual reality as a new filmic medium with new and unique affordances that facilitate narrating and sharing memories. In contradistinction to the much-discussed concept of VR as an ‘empathy machine’, we propose to think of VR as a memory machine. This capability of VR is reflected in the proliferation of memory-related content in narrative VR and its early adoption in public history. Narrating and sharing individual and collective traumatic memories have featured prominently in narrative VR. Three unique properties enable a recipient of narrative VR, the immersant, to experience someone else’s memories: embodiment, immersion, and interactivity. First, embodiment allows the immersant to assume the role of the person who remembers or a person that is being remembered. Second, immersion enables the virtual transportation to a past setting that is remembered. Third, since VR always offers at least some form of interactivity, narrative VR permits the immersant to have agency within the remembered narrative. These three aspects combine to provide a qualitatively richer experience of memories in VR than was possible in conventional narrative media. We show how creators have leveraged these specific affordances of VR in support of narrating memories by analyzing two case-studies. First, we look at an example of traumatic collective memory in The Book of Distance (2020), which narrates a family history of forced removal and internment of Japanese immigrants in Canada during World War II from the perspective of the victim’s grandson. Second, we discuss Is Anna Ok? (2018), which lets the immersant experience two sisters' memories of traumatic brain injury, once from the perspective of the injured victim and once from the sister who witnessed the accident.","",""

The processes of ushering audience members or users into the virtual experience and out again, to which I refer here as ‘onboarding’ and ‘offboarding’, have been considered within some specific contexts, or on a case-by-case basis, but to date no systematised consideration of VR onboarding and offboarding has been produced. One reason for this is that ambiguities in disciplinary and practical definitions of immersion have obscured the relationship between VR technology and users. Clarification of this relationship results in clear evidence of a need for attention to onboarding and offboarding processes in public-facing contexts. In this paper, I define onboarding and offboarding, and present a framework for considering the onboarding and offboarding experiences of virtual reality audiences that helps stakeholders identify both their responsibilities to audiences and the best way to facilitate the immersive experience. This framework is based upon identifying experience goals, centred on the affordances of virtual reality and principles of immersion and presence, and utilises the Immersive Audience Framework developed by StoryFutures in its interdisciplinary research with immersive audiences since 2019.","",""

Until recently, these approaches were partially dictated by the conventions and limitations of the underlying visual medium: the cinematic screen. Nevertheless, the ongoing technological revolution brings radical changes in the way we approach and consume creative media content and the accompanying soundtracks. Long-established cinematic sound design conventions are challenged and transformed, as emerging cinematic sound systems allow for greater creative freedom and more precise sound spatialisation. At the same time, advanced virtual reality (VR) systems provide an opportunity to break the boundaries of the screen and allow filmmakers to explore new ways of creative expression. With this comes an increased demand for specialised audio content that utilises the unique technological and creative characteristics of the VR medium. Through discussions and commentary based on secondary research and a series of interviews with sound design and filmmaking practitioners, this study aims at identifying some of the creative and practical opportunities and challenges sound designers may encounter when working in VR projects with a cinematic narrative structure and orientation. Ultimately, the study seeks to assist sound designers, VR filmmakers, and immersive media practitioners in better contextualising and defining the potential roles of the soundtrack in VR filmmaking and the associated workflows, contributing to the ongoing dialogue as the language of the new medium is being developed.","",""

Drawing on 12 case studies with participants performing digital tasks, we use Ingold’s four phases of skill (getting ready, setting out, carrying on, and finishing off) to research and represent the rhythm of digital skill. By using medialities of inscription, scripting, and annotation, we demonstrate how researchers can use mediality to perceive rhythms of digital skill without being physically co-located in the performance. As different medialities enable and constrain the perception and descriptions of digital skill, we develop spotlines as a method that combines different medialities particularly well suited for describing and comparing the temporal order of phases for performing digital skill by rendering each performer’s pace and intensity.

"2025","Virtually better: Multi-user experiment on avatar self-representation, self-discrepancies, avatar style and self-perceptions in a VR collaboration","Immersive multi-user virtual reality (VR) enables users to embody a first-person avatar and through them enact agency over their virtual self-representations and identities. Moreover, these visual representations can profoundly impact users’ thinking and behaviour. Despite this, there is a dearth of understanding of how opportunities to create an avatar versus using a preassigned one might affect users. One of the first pre-registered multi-user collaborative VR experiments, this mixed-method study investigates how customisation agency affects self-perceptions, and what role individual and avatar style differences play in this relationship. Results are limited but suggestive of VR avatars potentially serving as an empowerment tool through taking control over shaping one’s self-image, with interacting influences from self-discrepancy perceptions and avatar styles. Moreover, this article highly emphasises the complex relationships between intra- and interpersonal aspects of experiences. Implications are considered in terms of various contextual aspects and individual experiences and differences.","",""
"2025","The Good, Bad, and Ugly in Social Virtual Reality: The Alternative Global Village for Identity Negotiations in VRChat","Social virtual reality (VR) platforms have unleashed new possibilities to reimagine Marshall McLuhan’s classic idea of the “global village” in the digital era. We situated our inquiry in the case of identity negotiation between Chinese mainlanders and diasporas in VRChat, a popular social VR platform. Through a 2-year-long digital ethnography and interviews, this study revealed how Chinese mainlanders and those living abroad have confronted, separated, and integrated each other in identity negotiations. The results highlight the good, bad, and ugly sides of social VR as a novel convergence of VR, Massively-Multiplayer-Online-Role-Playing Games, and social media, particularly how the immersive experience of VR embodiment, avatars, and real-time voice chat may rejuvenate intercultural communication. These findings also illuminate a possible alternative global village enabled by social VR that not only has inherited certain violence from intercultural conflicts but also pioneering new paths to restore constructive communication.","",""
