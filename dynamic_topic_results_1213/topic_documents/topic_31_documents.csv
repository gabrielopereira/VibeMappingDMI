"2000","Neither Male or Female","       Very large numbers of people habitually spend time interacting in online social spaces based on the software developed by Pavel Curtis for Lambda MOO. Although chatting is part of the functionality of these spaces, it is much richer than the functionality given by basic chat rooms. In particular, members of these spaces explicitly declare a gender within the space (I will call it their 'presenting gender'), which may or may not correspond with their offline gender. As well as the traditional options of """"male"""" and """"female"""", it is possible to choose presenting genders such as """"neutral"""", """"royal"""", or """"witch"""". Around 35% of the members of Media MOO and 22% of Lambda MOO have a presenting gender that is neither """"male"""" nor """"female"""" (Danet).       I surveyed active citizens of another such space, Little Italy, by examining 400 characters that had accessed the space during the preceding month. Of these, 72 (18%) had a presenting gender other than """"male"""", """"female"""", and the default, """"neutral"""" (assigned to Little Italians who haven't yet chosen a presenting gender). 11% had default presenting gender. I found that those who had a presenting gender 'other' than """"male"""", """"female"""", or the default were more likely to still be active in Little Italy a year later. This result holds at the 80% significance level -- in other words, there is a less than 1 in 5 probability that the difference observed could have arisen by chance if the distributions were in reality identical. In fact, 'other'-gendered active citizens were 23% more likely than """"male"""" and 32% more likely than """"female"""" active citizens to be still active a year later. This suggests that 'other'-gendered chat may be more a pleasant (or addictive) activity than male- or female-gendered chat. Amazingly, 49% of the 'other'-gendered citizens sampled were still active a year later.        This intrigued me, so I sent a message to currently active Little Italians with presenting genders other than male or female, asking them why they had chosen such a presenting gender. I had 28 responses. Quotations from the responses below are by permission, and translated from the Italian.       A popular idea amongst gender theorists (e.g. Stone) is that choosing a presenting gender other than """"male"""" and """"female"""" is a strategy for people who don't feel they fit precisely into gender stereotypes. This may include most of us to some degree. As the Kinks sang, """"girls will be boys and boys will be girls, it's a mixed-up, muddled-up, shook-up world, except for Lola"""" -- where Lola has ambiguous presenting gender, and thus is the only non-mixed-up one. This is indeed the reason given by one respondent for choosing a presenting gender other than male or female: """"despite being a man, I feel very feminine (since I was small I've always wanted to be a woman)"""". However, no other respondents gave this as their reason.       Another idea from the literature is that of """"gender masking"""" (Jaffe et al. 11-2, and table 1). According to this theory, people, especially women, hide their gender online in order to avoid discrimination and harassment, or gender-related assumptions. Indeed, one respondent described his/her 'masked' character as """"a mind without sex or body, an entity without appearance, as insubstantial as a cloud of smoke"""". On the other hand, the majority of other-gendered Little Italians give some clue that they are either male or female in their character descriptions, and most give some clue when speaking socially within Little Italy. Italian is an inflected language, and has many constructions that reveal whether the speaker is male or female -- it is rare (although not unknown) for a Little Italian to avoid these constructions or to use them ambiguously, as might be expected by someone masking their gender.       To consider another idea, Bruckman (also Reid ch. 3 iii) suggests that the online world can be an """"identity workshop"""" (1), where people can emphasise particular aspects of their personality, or try out new personae, or experience what it is like to be someone completely different. Some Little Italians emphasise part of their real identity through their presenting gender, choosing for example to have a gender such as """"rebel"""", """"dutch"""", or """"angel"""". One respondent suggested, """"I chose 'angel' because I help everyone who asks me -- and some who don't ask -- let's say I like being a guardian angel ;) and because my name is Michelangelo"""". Other Little Italians choose 'other' presenting genders precisely because these genders do not have an offline equivalent. Their choice is a form of creativity or escapism. One such respondent asked, """"if everything is just like reality, what's the point of logging on?"""" This creative aspect becomes clear in the more outr√© genders invented by Little Italians, such as """"\V/amp!"""" for a vampire character, which includes a visual reference to Dracula's high collar, and """"...nothing like the sun"""" (the ellipsis is part of the gender).       One surprise was that several citizens became 'other'-gendered by accident! Offline it is difficult to have a sex-change without realising, but online a badly-designed interface can have this effect. 3% of the sample had gender """"me"""", which is a side-effect of a particular mistake in the use of the space.       Another surprise was the joke gender. If you ask the system for information about a Little Italy character, one line of the answer is of the form """"Sex: &lt;the character's presenting gender&gt;"""". Around 2% of the sample had presenting genders such as """"If only!"""", """"Too much!!"""", and """"Go ahead!!"""". Several other citizens told me their genders were references to in-jokes amongst their online friends.      Some characters had an 'other' gender because the character portrayed was not a human being -- such as a duck with presenting gender """"duck"""", and a character called Harley with presenting gender """"H-D"""". Looking at the 'other' genders in the sample, I was struck by the diversity both of the genders themselves, and of the reasons for which they are chosen. There is no single motive valid for most 'other'-gendered citizens.              I was also struck by their lightheartedness. Gender studies texts tend to treat the choice of presenting gender as something highly serious and important. Several writers deal with gender as performance (Butler interviewed by Osborne and Segal, 109-26) or masquerade (Danet) with playful and ironic characteristics (Haraway 149-81). These writers, however, tend to emphasise a serious purpose underlying the performance. Haraway talks of """"serious play"""" (149) and Butler is interested in performing gender as a subversive practice that aims to undermine the dominant forms of gender. Little Italy shows that in online spaces this need not be the case. The Little Italian with presenting gender """"duck"""" does not think of herself as a duck, she is not critiquing female stereotypes, she is not questioning the idea of femaleness, she is not hiding her offline gender to avoid harassment, she is not asserting her inner duckiness; she's just having a bit of fun. Little Italy is more of an identity playground than an identity workshop.       The creation of 'other' presenting genders in Little Italy is an example of the unexpectedly creative use of public space by members (in this case the space after Sex: in the character information) that was not originally designed with this use in mind. It is perhaps even more fascinating than other examples of folk art in unexpected places, such as graffiti, crop circles, bumper stickers or carved spoon handles, because of the clarity of its relationship with the artists' (lighthearted) construction of their identities.       'Stickiness' -- the likelihood of visitors to continue visiting a Website over an extended period of time -- is a quality much sought after by e-companies. Little Italy is very 'sticky' for all its citizens, but exceptionally so for other-gendered ones. In my opinion, it is the personal creative investment of the other-gendered citizens in Little Italy that makes them especially likely to remain active citizens. 'Other' presenting genders are possible in Little Italy because Pavel Curtis's software does not limit the options to male and female. This research suggests that designers and administrators of commercial Websites who want stickiness should avoid making assumptions about how their visitors may wish to present and express themselves. Rather, they should try to leave spaces open for their visitors' creativity. Many commercial Websites try to control and limit visitors' interaction, using forms and limited-choice menus. But if I am right about the stickiness of personal creative investment, then this may be a mistake. Creative empowerment of visitors may be better for the bottom line.

"2000","A ROM of One's Own or a Home for Sharing?"," In the last few years, new multimedia products have been designed in order to attract female users. Some of these products even reflect some kind of feminist programme to make girls and young women more interested and better qualified to exploit new information and communication technologies. The article analyses two Norwegian examples of such initiatives, a CD-ROM called JenteROM and a webservice called HjemmeNett, based on interviews with the most prominent actors of the respective design constituencies. The analysis focuses on the ways gender is constructed in multimedia form and content, in order to explicate gender as a process of social learning. What is observed is a set of ongoing transformations of gender as well as computers, related to controversies about proper definitions of gender and femininity as well as about how new media content and form should be designed in order to cater to women's interests.

"2002","Conflicting Concepts of Self and The Michigan Womyn's Music Festival","                 In 1991 the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival evicted two female identified transsexual attendees on the grounds that they violated its women only policy of admittance. The Festival, established in 1976 and now the largest of its kind, turned into a """"microcosm of the conflicts that have plagued the women's movement"""" (Rubin 18) and revived widespread debate about the place of trans and non-standard gender performances in feminist activism. A pro-trans event, aptly named Camp Trans, was held outside the Festival's gates with the aim of inciting greater interest in the area. The Festival's founder and on going organiser, Lisa Vogel, responded with a statement in 2001 claiming the """"intention is for the Festival to be for womyn-born womyn, meaning people who were born and have lived their entire life experience as female"""" (Vogel 2000). This resulted in the exclusion of not only trans individuals, but also a plethora of non-conventional gender identities. Bitter debate ensued, revealing the Festival's role not just in appealing to a defined, recognisable demographic, but in constructing and maintaining an entire category of identity.          My initial encounters with the Festival occurred through independent media and the internet. It become particularly widely debated after artists from the Queer orientated Mr Lady record label (most famously Le Tigre, fronted by riot grrl icon Kathleen Hanna) confirmed that they would perform at the event, despite knowledge of the anti-trans policy. Perhaps the most poignant reflection came from Ciara Xyerra's 2001 zine A Renegade's Handbook To Love And Sabotage. She comments that the Festival's intent was to provide """"not only just a 'safe space' for women, but specifically for 'womyn born womyn.'""""                     [‚Ä¶] this essentialist logic is [‚Ä¶] flawed in that it assumes every """"womyn born womyn"""" was socialized in exactly the same way, that differences regarding race, class, ability, personal history, have no bearing on how a woman perceives herself as a woman [‚Ä¶](69).                  Certainly the revised womyn born womyn label is a problematic way of dealing with the situation. The standard woman is assumed not to encounter trans issues, at least not in a way that impacts on her sense of gendered self.          This issue provokes comparisons to the race debates that wreaked havoc through US feminism in early eighties. The sentiments of the Camp Trans protest echo Audre Lorde's 1984 criticism that:                     As white women ignore their built-in privilege of whiteness and define women in terms of their experience alone, then women of Color become 'other', the outsider whose experience is too alien to comprehend (632).                  In retrospect what remains most striking about the race debates is how incredibly poorly they were handled. The period is marked by a tendency towards splinter and separatist groups, evident in the writing of people like bell hooks and Mary Daly. Communication between various factions collapsed amid accusations of racism and ignorance of the wider struggle, leaving ruptures still visible today. (Gubar 884-890)          The emphasis has shifted from presumed racial background to presumed biological characteristics, but at its core this is the same argument about which performances of self are given legitimacy, and which are passed off as outside the interests of the feminist community. Indeed the Festival's anti-trans policy can also be traced back to the early 1980's, stemming from clashes between separatists and post-operative transsexuals entering feminist activism.          In both instances there has been an assumption that the majority of members within the community experience the world from a common perspective, a collective sense of self at the core of the movement, outlining its wider agenda. I am reminded of Gayatri Spivak's comment that """"We take the explanations we produce to be the grounds of our action; they are endowed with coherence in terms of our explanation of self"""" (In Other Worlds 104). Conflict arises when internal factions find their concerns being overlooked, and begin questioning exactly whose experience is taken as the model for the collective self. There is a tendency towards viewing this as a threat to the movement's solidarity. In an effort to maintain wider group cohesion, divergent voices are often dealt with by claiming they arise from entirely different strains of selfhood. New identities, or at the least hyphenated subcategories, proliferate under """"the essentialist's claim that there must be an ultimate (that is, comprehensive), complete, consistent, coherent set of types"""" (Spinosa and Dreyfus 72). These redefinitions explain and dispel difference without actually addressing it.          It would be naive to assume this sort of essentialism exists only for the Festival and older activist methodology. While Queer theory has certainly given us new tools for understanding the issues, its practical application does not necessarily avoid """"knitting out more fashionably an otherwise reconstructed [‚Ä¶] essentialism"""" (Jagose). As people like Martha Nussbaum and Benita Parry have argued, if somewhat problematically, there is a fine line between fluidity and dissolution. Activist and liberal scepticism towards deconstructive methodology contains an at least reasonably justified trepidation towards tinkering with political communities which have proved historically successful. The unfortunate revival of the 'old school' activism versus 'new school' theory attitude, itself founded on an essentialist belief in a single, correct ideological stance, has further complicated matters.          Festival attendee Janel Smith, writing for one of the bastions of 'old school' activism, Off Our Backs, voiced activist scepticism when commenting that post structuralism is """"an entire movement and theory [‚Ä¶] designed to debunk these 'myths' about gender and racial identity."""" She continues:                     We often make sense of other people by categorizing them into labels and boxes that we ourselves feel comfortable with. Dominant discourse tends to dismiss this process as inherently negative, one that limits people and their understanding of self and projected identity (17).                  The criticism of dominant academic discourse is worth consideration. If it """"is not possible for us to describe our own archive, since it is from within these rules that we speak"""" (Foucault 130), we need to be acutely aware of the way we act within culture, and wary of any movement which claims to fully recognise and transcend its boundaries. Our treatment of identity needs to """"avoid the mistake of slipping between 'no absolute truth' and 'absolutely no truth,'"""" as Felicity Newman, Tracey Summerfield and Reece Plunkett suggest.          From the alternate perspective, Aviva Rubin argues """"our activism is characterized by seemingly incompatible inclinations to generalize and to particularize"""" (17). She writes that the Festival's attempt to develop a """"theoretical 'she'"""" with which we """"identify sameness ‚Äì she shares our politics, our goals, our place"""" is fundamentally flawed as """"the notion collapses when confronted with the differences we've deliberately ignored"""" (8).          This leaves the situation double bound. A standard sense of gendered self provides unity and a workable common agenda, but comes into conflict with the identities it has excluded from its definition. The unified self combats repression, but, as Judith Butler so aptly puts it, """"exclusion operates prior to repression"""" (71). However there are certainly areas of common ground. Rubin's """"plea for grey"""", or an area """"between absolutes,"""" (20) is remarkably similar to Smith's endeavour to exist """"somewhere in-between butch and femme"""" (14). Yet, for the Festival, that difference was enough to cause a gap between those who found it """"an atmosphere of unparalleled safety"""" (Smith 13) and the pro-trans attendees who felt they needed """"an escort to get out safely after darkness fell"""" (Wilchins 2000). As these relative similarities exist, it is disappointing to see that the arising differences have met with such aggressively negative reactions. Given the unlikeliness of everyone agreeing on a definitive understanding in the near future, it would seem beneficial to shift the focus away from searches for correct identities and ideologies, and develop new approaches to the debates themselves.          I am again reminded of a comment from Gayatri Spivak, this time from her 1992 essay """"More on Power/Knowledge"""". She comments that """"if the lines of making sense of something are laid down in a certain way, then you are able to do only those things with that something which are possible within and by arrangement of those lines"""" (151). This is as true for our concepts of self as it is for any other issue. If we cannot reach outside of the structures of culture to find more universally true categories, or expect an ideological stance to present entirely new and more correct understandings, how we handle the arising debate is of major importance. Homi Bhabha's comment that """"our political references and priorities [‚Ä¶] are not there in some primordial, naturalistic sense"""" (26) does not necessarily render them null and void. There is a difference between needing to debate an identity or ideology, and needing to discard or reinvent it. Instead of looking for a true model of self or a correct ideology, the problem becomes looking at the cultural structure we have, trying to """"recognise it as best one can and, through one's necessarily inadequate interpretation, to work to change it"""" (Spivak 1988 120).          From this perspective the conflict that emerges from the Festival is as important as the possibilities for final resolution. Rather than treating differences as immediate problems and being """"shocked, disappointed and instantly sidetracked into seeking resolution"""" (Rubin 20), it seems possible to consider the debate important in its own right. In practice this would mean keeping the lines of communication between the various factions open, and treating debate as an integral and on going process, rather than an unwelcome confrontation to be settled as quickly and quietly as possible.          The commitment of the Camp Trans protesters to """"workshops to educate festival goers"""" (Wilchins 2000), and their modest success, indicates that maintaining ongoing debate is a workable and productive approach. On the other hand Vogel's unwillingness to talk to the Camp Trans group is perhaps as open to criticism as her definitions of gender identity. Surely if a definitive concept of self cannot be settled upon easily, the lines of communication between Camp Trans and the Festival can at least be expected to keep the search from stagnating.          The role the Festival has served as """"a locus of political and cultural debate"""" (Delany) combined with its relatively successful negotiations of class and race issues indicates that it can play this role successfully. Although the womyn born womyn policy might not have changed, it is difficult to imagine many other platforms on which trans related debates could occur on such a large scale. In light of this it does not seem unrealistic to think of the debate as beneficial in ensuring continued rethinking of the issues, and not just as part of some potential revision or creation of identities which will hopefully be completed some time in the future.

"2003","Resistances of Gender","                           Online life is embedded within the complexes, organisations, power ratios, and conceptualisations of offline life. The ambiguities of the interaction between online and offline - the testing and questioning, asking and affirming of their match - make a vital part of their current phenomenology. One factor which seems to exert resistance - some form of implacability - however unexpectedly, is that of gender. Other categories, such as politics and nationality, seem to have similar, but more direct, effects.           Online folklore is quite specific, and the folklore can be academic as analysts are affected by the same forces and experiences as other people. Firstly, it is claimed that gender is unimportant online - that you are free to be yourself, or whomsoever you choose. Mark Poster, who is not alone, claims: """"one may experience directly the opposite gender by assuming it and enacting it in conversations"""" (1997: 223), which seems to confuse a temporary imagining with a long term imposed. Secondly, however, there are the repeated tales that online life is full of cross-gender impersonation and that, as a result, it is full of potential betrayal and disillusionment. Kolko writes:                        The stories of online cross-dressing that abound‚Ä¶ often culminate in narratives of betrayal. In this accumulated body of scholarship, participants talk of how their notions of the world and their selves and others has been destabilized, rocked beyond recognition, until they are left feeling adrift, at sea, that they 'cannot trust anyone,' that 'everything online can be a lie,' that 'no one tells who they really are.' (1997: np).                      These stories seem a little contradictory. If gender is unimportant online, then how come it is such a source of anxiety? Often the anxiety seems concealed under a discourse of futurity, in which attention is given to what life online might become - with contradictions deleted - rather than giving attention to what actually happens or has happened. This move maintains the theory that the Internet is free of the effects of offline life, perhaps in compensation for increasing restrictions and insecurities in offline life. It also keeps the Internet in the realm of science fiction, where it is without history, and is cutting edge by default.           People generally seem sure they can detect the gender of others (Suler 1996). A person might use a lot of emoticons and be female (Witmer &amp; Katzman 1998: 6, 9), they might flame and be male (Baym 1995: 158, Herring 1994), they might not know American pantyhose sizes and be male (irrespective of if they come from a country which uses different sizings - most of the rest of the world - or are a woman who does not wear pantyhose). People read books by academics describing how the sexes use language differently in order to detect these differences - while, at the same time, others read them in order to fake better (Wright 2000). If people select gender neutral pronouns in a MOO, then others will not assume they do not have a gender, they will generally attempt to work it out (Kendall 1996: 217), and some research suggests that if a person refuses to reveal their offline gender then they will be dropped from interactions (O'Brien 1999: 90).           Most of these ways of determining 'real gender', use offline gender clich√©s to make that detection, or to manufacture that production. Thus McRae, after arguing in favour of absolute gender freedom, remarks that if someone plays a woman and wants to """"attract partners as 'female' [they] must craft a description within the realm of what is considered attractive"""" (1996: 250). They are likely to exaggerate conventions of gender (as with plastic surgery). As Kendall writes: """"choosing one gender or another does nothing to change the expectations attached to particular gender identifications"""" (1996: 217). In fact, as people online can ignore the gender of those contradicting their expectations of gender, then those expectations may grow stronger. Categories of gender might strengthen rather than weaken.           A performance which follows rules and conventions in order to convey a message, which to some extent any successful performance must, may not challenge the accepted conceptual order at all. As not all the rules and conventions of performance may be conscious or understood by performers, their performance may unintentionally harden those conventions. This is especially so as in Western online social practice, whatever the complexity of our theory, gender seems to be treated as an 'essential' and equated with an offline body.           Further, gender impersonation appears to happen in specific circumstances, namely on IRC, or MOOs, or in games. It rarely if ever happens on Mailing Lists, where anonymity is rarer (names are often given in addresses, and email often signed with a gendered name), and people try to manifest real authentic identities, rather than play with possible identities. An experimental mailing list I was involved in, in which members, previously known to each other from another list, were anonymous and their gender not specified, was short lived. It did not become a site of play with, or 'beyond', gender.           As well, people seem only disturbed when males are thought to be impersonating females - which indicates a degree of gender specificity itself. I have never seen a list of ways to detect whether a male avatar was female, while the opposite is common. This is not just anxiety from heterosexual males seeking sex partners but, in a famous case, occurred when women found that a supposedly female confidant was male (Van Gelder 1996, Stone 1995: 69-81). So why does this happen?           Answers to such questions must be provisional, but it is probably connected with the role of women, in offline life, in maintaining and marking intimacy and support. We might over-quickly say that, offline (outside of male homosexual groups in which gender may function differently), an intimate relationship usually includes one woman. Emotional or support bonding is female. Male bonding has become almost suspect, particularly if it involves intimacy. We also live in a society with a common discourse about the decline of support through kinship, a rise in single person households, increased insecurity in work, and decline in state support for people in times of stress, at the very time that kinship no longer is able to give support (Castells 1997: 97). The Western generative atom of kinship, intimacy and support, approaches being the heterosexual pair bond.           Wuthnow claimed in 1994 that, faced with these kinds of insecurities, 40% of American adults became members of small groups meeting regularly to provide support for members (1994: 45-50). There is no reason to assume the percentage has declined. Internet groups can be seen to function similarly; they are means by which people make contacts, provide help, discuss problems or interests, and sometimes get work - fibreculture being a case in point. There is often, in such groups, a fairly active 'off-group' life of correspondence and contact between particular members. Structurally, life which is off a mailing list, or in a private MOO room, approaches the structure of the dyadic, private and intimate pair bond, which should contain at least one woman. Finding out that a person you have been intimate with was not female, almost automatically changes the relationship from the realm of intimate and private into a public betrayal. Our private role and its vulnerabilities has broken into the public male domain and symbolically been exposed rather than shared.           Gender functions as a way in which people interpret the actions of others. As Ten Have argues (2000), categorisation is one of the ways in which people decide what kinds of messages others are emitting, whether they have much in common and whether they can be trusted. The importance of particular categories can frequently be ascertained by how often they are requested - and gender is one of the most requested when unknown and when people are seeking support or intimacy. Because authenticity, or trying to find the truth of others, is important in Western thought about relationships, this truth becomes anchored in the 'real' body and the customs surrounding it. 'Truth' is confirmed the more private the information, and the more it is received offline. As a result, and because of models of intimacy, 'real gender' then becomes important and is central to current online life. It may also point to other ways in which the tension between the online and offline manifest, or in which an apparently abstract flow meets resistance.

"2003","Too close to see: men, women, and webcams"," Internet studies researchers should consider how internet spectators are addressed and encouraged to engage. In this article, I offer some basic comments about internet spectatorship and present a detailed analysis of the ways in which spectatorship operates in the women‚Äôs webcam form. Webcam spectators may have less control than they expect because women webcam operators exert authority and achieve agency through their visibility. Feminist considerations of spectatorship and the gaze offer important methods for considering these representations, and suggest how viewing positions are being revised. Spectators are in a position that has been associated with women and is believed to be undesirable because of their nearness to the computer screen. The cultural and technological reconceptualization of spectatorship and the particular aspects of women‚Äôs webcams offer some unique opportunities to intervene in the ways that looking at and categorizing bodies produces gender and sexual difference.

"2005","Who Wants to Be a 'Good Parent'?","&#x0D;         &#x0D; &#x0D;  In this paper, I will be looking at how the news media may be both helpful (‚Äògood‚Äô) and a hindrance (‚Äòbad‚Äô) to lesbian and gay parents. While I acknowledge the incommensurable differences between the experiences of lesbian parents and gay parents, I do believe that representations of both lesbian and gay parents in the media tend to focus on any similarities that exist between (and within) the two groups, rather than looking at the important differences. I would suggest that this is the result of the hetero-normative assumptions that inform the news media, which take heterosexual parents to be the norm from which all other parents differ. Such normative assumptions thus suggest that it is important to look at how particular moral frameworks are employed in both pro- and anti-gay news media reports of lesbian and gay parents, the implication being that the former may not necessarily be better than the latter. As lesbian and gay parents, we may thus do ourselves a disservice by uncritically accepting that ‚Äòpositive‚Äô media accounts are useful in our fight for rights. &#x0D; &#x0D;  ‚ÄòGood Parents‚Äô and the ‚ÄòRhetoric of Pseudoscience‚Äô&#x0D; &#x0D;  One of the most central aspects of representations of lesbian and gay parents in the news media is the use of ‚Äòscientific proof‚Äô to legitimate lesbian and gay parenting. Some examples include:&#x0D; &#x0D;    Significant, reliable social scientific evidence indicates that lesbian and gay parents are as fit, effective and successful as heterosexual parents (Judith Stacey reported in http://www.lethimstay.com/wrong_socscience_expert.html).&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;    Because many beliefs about lesbian and gay parents and their children are open to empirical test, psychological research can evaluate their accuracy (American Psychological Association [APA], 1995, http://www.apa.org/pi/parent.html).&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;    Scientific findings debunk the myth that gay men cannot be nurturing parents (http://www.familypride.org/issues/myths.htm).&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;    A comprehensive international review of 25 years of research into lesbian and gay parenting‚Ä¶ shows convincingly that the children of lesbian and gay parents do not demonstrate any important differences from those of heterosexual parents&#x0D; (Gay &amp; Lesbian Rights Lobby, 2002, http://www.glrl.org.au/issues/parenting.htm).&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  One particular strategy of legitimation evident in these extracts demonstrates what Kitzinger has termed the ‚Äòrhetoric of pseudoscience‚Äô ‚Äì disproving your opponents claims to truth by demonstrating their ‚Äòbad science‚Äô (see also Riggs, ‚ÄúPolitics‚Äù). Thus, in the examples above, ‚Äòsignificant, reliable social scientific evidence‚Äô is contrasted with ‚Äòdebunk[ed]‚Ä¶ myth[s]‚Äô. Another example of this is provided in Stacey‚Äôs claim that:&#x0D; &#x0D;    Paul Cameron is the primary disreputable and discredited figure in this [anti-lesbian and gay parenting] literature. He was expelled from the APA‚Ä¶ for unethical scholarly practices, such as selective, misleading representations of research and making claims that could not be substantiated&#x0D; (http://www.lethimstay.com/wrong_socscience_expert.html).&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  Here, Stacey uses the authority of ‚Äògood‚Äô social scientific research in order to disprove the claims of ‚Äòbad‚Äô ‚Äòdisreputable and discredited figure[s]‚Äô. In so doing, while she seeks to support lesbian and gay parents in our fight for rights, she also perpetuates the notion that scientific knowledge is the appropriate arbiter of what counts as ‚Äògood parenting‚Äô. This is reinforced in the statement of the APA, which suggests that ‚Äòmany beliefs about lesbian and gay parents and their children are open to empirical test‚Äô. While this is intended to demonstrate the importance of using psychological research to ‚Äòevaluate [the] accuracy‚Äô of such beliefs, it also demonstrates the risks that we run when using science to determine what will count as ‚Äòtruth‚Äô (Clarke; Riggs, ‚ÄúPolitics‚Äù, ‚ÄúOn Whose Terms‚Äù). Thus, while psychological knowledge in the extracts above is deployed in support of lesbian and gay parents, we only need to look back 30-odd years to see a vastly different story. It is as recently as that that same-sex attraction was classified as a pathology in the American Psychiatric Association‚Äôs Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-II). Thus, as Joshua Gamson (76) suggests, that which is considered ‚Äò‚Äúnormal‚Äù is often a synonym for ‚Äúpower‚Äù‚Äô. &#x0D; &#x0D;  In this regard, the power that is evoked through the use of scientific discourse in news media may also be used against lesbian and gay parents. For example, Bill Maier, a clinical psychologist and vice president of the (right-wing and, anti-gay) Focus on the Family Institute is reported as saying that:&#x0D; &#x0D;    Every responsible psychologist in the APA should be ashamed; the organization is obviously more concerned with appeasing its powerful gay lobby than it is with retaining any semblance of moral and ethical duty&#x0D; (Baptist Press News, http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?ID=18784).&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  Here morality and ethics are constructed as being a priori oriented towards the values of the heterosexual majority. Even if lesbian and gay rights activists are to counter this with ‚Äòproof‚Äô of the normality of lesbians and gay men, this does little to destabilise the hegemony of scientific knowledge and its ability to define what counts as moral and ethical. Indeed, Maier draws attention to a very important point ‚Äì while organisations such as the APA may seek to use psychological knowledge to refute anti-gay claims, they do so without challenging the ideological assumptions that underpin it. As a result, the APA (and those who use psychological knowledge in pro-accounts more generally) are left open to accusations of bias and wilful ignorance of a system of law that is based upon the values of white, heterosexual, middle-class men (Bernstein).  &#x0D; &#x0D;  ‚ÄòTaking Sides‚Äô: Is There Any Difference?&#x0D; &#x0D;  This leads me to ask the following question: Do we as lesbians and gay men actually want to be ‚Äògood parents‚Äô? How might our location within this position only serve to erase the unique experiences of parenting and families that we share? Eldridge suggests that what appear as debates over social issues may more accurately be described as ‚Äòone-sided debates‚Äô, wherein the ‚Äòopposing parties‚Äô are actually arguing very similar points. This is particularly evident in debates over lesbian and gay parenting, as both those for and those against lesbian and gay parents often uncritically accept the notions of ‚Äòscience‚Äô that inhere to the debates. For example, in the previous section we saw Stacey claim that anti-gay researchers have questionable ethics, just as Maier suggested that the support for lesbian and gay issues given by the APA represents a crisis in its ‚Äòethical and moral duty‚Äô.  &#x0D; &#x0D;  While pro-accounts of lesbian and gay parents may be useful in the short term to generate ‚Äòpositive‚Äô representations of lesbian and gay parents in the media (which in some cases may be an important aspect of legal challenges in regards to lesbian and gay adoption rights), they do little to challenge the networks of power within which they are located, focused as they are upon stereotypical representations of ‚Äògood‚Äô lesbian and gay parents who are typically white, able-bodied, and financially secure. As a result, these representations further marginalise those lesbians and gay men who do not fit within this category (for example, due to economic or cultural difference from the white, middle-class majority), in addition to those lesbians and gay men who choose not to parent. These points demonstrate how the fight for ‚Äòpositive representation‚Äô within the media can lead to the further marginalisation of groups of lesbian and gay men who already have little access to such representation (Gamson). &#x0D; &#x0D;  Within this paper, I have demonstrated some of the ways in which ‚Äògood‚Äô representations of lesbian and gay parents may also be ‚Äòbad‚Äô‚Äîthey may render us complicit with discourses of science that have often been used against us, and they also encourage us to conform to a heterosexual model of relationality. In this way, lesbian and gay parents are expected to be ‚Äòas fit, effective and successful as heterosexual parents‚Äô (Stacey). As a result, lesbian and gay parents are encouraged to accept a form of subjectivity that recognises scientific arguments as legitimate, and which thus encourages lesbians and gay men to open their lives to scientific scrutiny, measurement, and objectification. Moreover, it encourages lesbian and gay parents ‚Äònot [to] demonstrate any important differences from‚Ä¶ heterosexual parents‚Äô (Gay &amp; Lesbian Rights Lobby) under threat of being declared, by default, unfit parents.&#x0D; &#x0D;  The converse effect of news media reports of lesbian and gay parents can also be true: ‚Äòbad‚Äô representations may inadvertently draw attention to the problems that inhere to using science to ‚Äòprove the case‚Äô. Thus, as the extract from Maier suggests, naively believing that science is the answer ignores the moral assumptions that shape news media and which further marginalise the often critical moral frameworks of lesbian and gay parents. Obviously, I am not advocating here for more statements like those of Maier. Rather, I am suggesting that as lesbian and gay parents we need to be wary of accepting normative framework when mounting our resistances. In other words, if ‚Äòbad‚Äô is often ‚Äògood‚Äô, and ‚Äògood‚Äô is often ‚Äòbad‚Äô in scientific media accounts of lesbian and gay parents, then it would seem important that we develop alternate ways of accounting for our experiences, at the same time as we critique such accounts in order to demonstrate their moral assumptions.&#x0D; &#x0D;  Acknowledgements&#x0D; &#x0D;  I would first like to acknowledge the sovereignty of the Kaurna people, upon whose land I live in Adelaide, South Australia.

Critical analysis identified three trends: corporate shunning; corporate curiosity and fear; corporate pursuit. Social representation, cultural norms, stereotypes and visibility were explored for each trend, revealing qualitative and quantitative inequality among social groups. Although all GLBTs experienced increased news coverage, gay men received twice the coverage of lesbians. Advertisers and the Times changed from stigmatizing and avoiding homosexuals to promoting stereotypes of gay affluence, creating ‚Äòcontroversial‚Äô ad campaigns with ‚Äòshock value‚Äô, commodifying social identity and establishing a gay market niche. Representations reflect homogenized understandings of sexuality, with bisexuals and trans-persons invisible. Case studies demonstrate the Times‚Äô contribution to norms, values and beliefs characterizing GLBTs, supporting research characterizing the media an active agent shaping cultural production of sexuality. Visibility is argued not to have granted social legitimation but to evidence social change in the status of homosexuality from deviant/stigmatized to selectively commodified and spectacularized.

Informing this examination are arguments that the newfound courting of the ‚Äògay community‚Äô by mainstream marketers represents a repositioning of gays and lesbians in commercial panoptic formations based on the perceived desirability of these populations as niche markets. This position is supported by the Janus-faced design of these online portals, which present themselves as inclusive communities to gay and lesbian consumers while simultaneously presenting themselves as surveilling entities to corporate clients. The marketing strategies deployed by these portals suggest that corporate actors believe that gays and lesbians can be enticed into self-surveillance by distancing solicitations for personal information from their economic aims and rearticulating them with images of community and romance.

Increasingly, information and communication technologies, such as the internet, are playing a particularly significant role, not only in the promotion and packaging of sex tourism but also of a new type of global surveillance of bodies, race and desire.

She was constructed as an exemplar of the highest order, a national heroine to be proud of, and in the vein of a series of British female heroes who punctuate the typically masculine narrative of national achievement. By August she was dead, the victim of a violent storm on the upper reaches of the peak they call the Savage Mountain, K2. The focus of vitriolic media attention, Hargreaves was stripped of her heroic status and condemned for the irresponsibility of leaving her two small children motherless, and so opened a national debate on `motherhood, ambition and risk'. This article explores that debate. In so doing it probes the meaning of heroism, as both a culturally mediated idea of extraordinary actions, and as part of a wider politics of recognition and representation that calls for a consideration of the role of public communication.

"2012","For My Own Pleasure and Delight","IntroductionThis paper addresses two separate notions of embodiment ‚Äì western maternal embodiment and art making as a form of embodied critical resistance. It takes as its subject breeder; my unpublished five minute video installation from 2012, which synthesises these two separate conceptual framings of embodiment as a means to visually and conceptually rupture dominant ideologies surrounding Australian motherhood. Emerging from a paradoxical landscape of fear, loathing and desire, breeder is my dark satirical take on ambivalent myths surrounding suburban Australian motherhood. Portraying my white, heavily pregnant body breeding, cooking and consuming pink, sugar-coated butterflies, breeder renders literal the Australian mother as both idealised nation-builder and vilified, self-indulgent abuser.¬† A feminine reification of Goya‚Äôs Saturn Devouring His Children, breeder attempts to make visible my own grapplings with maternal ambivalence, to complicate even further, the already strained position of motherhood within the Australian cultural imaginary. Employing the mediums of video and performance to visually manifest an ambivalent protagonist who displays both nurturing maternal ideals and murderous inclinations, breeder pushes contradictory maternal expectations to their breaking point and challengingly offers the following proposition: ‚ÄúThis is what you want; but what you‚Äôll get is so much more than you bargained for‚Äù (Grosz 136). Drawing upon critical, feminist theorising that challenges idealised views of motherhood; accounts of motherhood by mothers themselves; as well as my own personal grapplings with maternal expectations, this paper weaves reflexive writing with textual analysis to explore how an art-based methodology of embodied critical resistance can problematise representations of motherhood within Australia. ¬†By visualising the disjuncture between dominant representations of motherhood that have saturated Australian mainstream media since the late 1990s and the complex ambivalent reality of some women‚Äôs actual experiences of mothering, this paper discusses how breeder‚Äôs intimate portrayal of maternal domesticity at the limits of tolerability, critically resists socially acceptable mothering practices by satirising the cultural construct of motherhood as a means ‚Äúto use it, deform it, and make it groan and protest‚Äù (Nietzsche qtd. in Gutting).Contradictory Maternal KnowledgeImages of motherhood are all around us; communicating ideals and stereotypes that tell us how mothers should feel, think and act. But these images and the concepts of motherhood that underpin them are full of contradictions. Cultural representations of the idealised and sometimes ‚Äúyummy mummy‚Äù - middle class, attractive, healthy, sexy and heterosexual ‚Äì (see Fraser; Johnson), contrast with depictions of ‚Äúbad‚Äù mothers, leading to motherhood being simultaneously idealised and demonised within the popular press (Bullen et al.; McRobbie, Top Girls; McRobbie, In the Aftermath; McRobbie, Reflections on Feminism; Walkerdine et al.). Mothers own accounts of motherhood reflect these unsettling contradictions (Miller; Thomson et al.; Wilkinson). Claiming the maternal experience is both ‚Äúheaven and hell‚Äù due to the daily experience of irreconcilable and contradictory feelings (Coward), mothers (myself included), silently struggle between feelings of extreme love and opposing feelings of failure, despair and hate as we get caught up in trying to achieve a set of ideals that promulgate standards of perfection that are beyond our reach. Surrounded by images of motherhood that do not resonate with the contradictory nature of the lived maternal experience, mothers are ‚Äútorn in two‚Äù as we desperately try to reconcile or find absolution for maternal emotions that dominant cultural representations of motherhood render unacceptable. According to Roszika Parker, this complicated and contradictory experience where a mother has both loving and hating feelings for her child is that of maternal ambivalence; a form of exquisite suffering that oscillates between the overwhelming affect of blissful gratification and the raw edges of bitter resentment (Parker 1). As Parker states, maternal ambivalence refers to:Those fleeting (or not so fleeting) feelings of hatred for a child that can grip a mother, the moment of recoil from a much loved body, the desire to abandon, to smash the untouched plate of food in a toddler‚Äôs face, to yank a child‚Äôs arm while crossing the road, scrub too hard with a face cloth, change the lock on an adolescent or the fantasy of hurling a howling baby out of the window (5).However, it is not only feelings of hatred that stir up ambivalence in the mother, so too can the overwhelming intensity of love itself render the rush of ambivalence so surprising and so painful. Commenting on the extreme contradictory emotions that fill a mother and how not only excessive hatred, but excessive love can turn dangerously fatal, Parker turns to Simone De Beauvoir‚Äôs idea of ‚Äúcarnal plenitude‚Äù; that is, where the child elicits from the mother, the emotion of domination; where the child becomes the ‚Äúother‚Äù who is both prey and double (30). For Parker, De Beauvoir‚Äôs ‚Äúcarnal plenitude‚Äù is imaged by mothers in a myriad of ways, from a desire to gobble up the child, to feelings of wanting to gather the child into a fatal smothering hug. Commenting on her own unsettling love/hate relationship with her child, Adrienne Rich describes her experiences of maternal ambivalences as ‚Äúthe murderous alternation between bitter resentment and raw-edged nerves and blissful gratification and tenderness‚Äù (363). Unable to come to terms with this paradox at the core of the unfolding process of motherhood, our culture defends itself against this illogical ambivalence in the mother by separating the good nurturing mother from the bad neglectful mother in an attempt to deny the fact that they are one and the same. Resulting in a culture that either denigrates or idealises mothers, we are constantly presented with images of the good perfect nurturing mother and her murderous alter ego; the bad fatal mother who neglects and smothers. This means that how a mother feels about mothering or the meaning it has for her, is heavily determined by cultural representations of motherhood. Arguing for a creative transformation of the maternal that breaches the mutual exclusivities that separate motherhood, I am called to action by Susan Rubin Suleiman, who writes (quoting psychoanalyst Helene Deutsch): ‚ÄúMothers don‚Äôt write, they are written‚Äù (Suleiman 5). As a visual attempt to negotiate, translate and thus ‚Äúwrite‚Äù my lived experience of Australian motherhood, breeder gives voice to the raw material of contradictory (and often taboo experiences) surrounding maternal embodiment and subjectivity. Hijacking and redeploying contradictory understandings and representations of Australian motherhood to push maternal ideals to their breaking point, breeder seeks to create a kind of ‚Äúmother trouble‚Äù¬†that challenges the disjuncture between dominant social constructions of motherhood designed to keep us assigned to our proper place. Viscerally embracing the reality that much of life with small children revolves around loss of control and disintegration of physical boundaries, breeder visually explores the complex and contradictory performances surrounding lived experiences of mothering within Australia to complicate even further the already strained position of western maternal embodiment.Situated Maternal KnowledgeOver the last decade and a half, women‚Äôs bodies and their capacity to reproduce have become centre stage in the unfolding drama of Australian economic policy. In 1999 fears surrounding dwindling birth-rates and less future tax revenue, led then Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett to address a number of exclusive private girls‚Äô schools. Making Australia-wide headlines, Kennett urged these affluent young women to abandon their desire for a university degree and instead invited them to consider motherhood as the ultimate career choice (Dever). In 2004, John Howard‚Äôs Liberal government made headlines as they announced the new maternity allowance; a $3000 lump-sum financial incentive for women to leave work and have babies. Ending this announcement by urging the assembled gathering of mostly male reporters to go home and have ‚Äúone for the Dad, one for the Mum and one for the Country‚Äù (Baird and Cutcher 103), Federal Treasurer Peter Costello made a last ditch effort to save Baby Boomers from their imminent pensionless doom. Failing to come to terms with the impending saturation of the retirement market without the appropriate tax payer support, the Liberal Government turned baby-making into the ultimate Patriotic act as they saw in women bodies, the key to prevent Australia‚Äôs looming economic crisis. However, not all women‚Äôs bodies were considered up to the job of producing the longed for ‚ÄúGood tax-paying Citizen‚Äù (Tyler). Kennett only visited exclusive private girls‚Äô schools (Ferrier), headhunting only the highest calibre of affluent breeders. Blue-collar inter-mingling was to be adamantly discouraged. Costello‚Äôs 2004 ‚Äúbaby bonus‚Äù catch-cry not only caused international ire, but also implicitly relegated the duty of child-bearing patriotism to a normalised heterosexual, nuclear family milieu. Unwed or lesbian mothers need not apply. Finally, as government spokespeople repeatedly proclaimed that the new maternity allowance was not income tested, this suggested that the target nation-builder breeder demographic was the higher than average income earner. Let‚Äôs get it straight people ‚Äì only highly skilled, high IQ‚Äôs, heterosexual, wedded, young, white women were required in this exclusive breeding program (see Allen and Osgood; Skeggs; Tyler).¬† And if the point hadn‚Äôt already been made perfectly clear, newspaper tabloids, talkback radio and current affairs programs all over the country were recruited to make sure the public knew exactly what type of mother Australia was looking for. Out of control young, jobless single mothers hit the headlines as fears abounded that they were breeding into oblivion. An inherently selfish and narcissistic lot, you could be forgiven for thinking that Australia was running rampant with so-called bogan single mothers, who left their babies trapped in hot airless cars in casino carparks all over the country as they spent their multiple ‚Äúbaby bonus‚Äô‚Äù on booze, ciggies, LCD‚Äôs and gambling (see Milne; O‚ÄôConnor; Simpson and Dowling). Sucking the economy dry as they leeched good tax-payer dollars from Centrelink, these undesirables were the mothers Australia neither needed nor wanted. Producing offspring relegated to the category of bludgerhood before they could even crawl, these mothers became the punching bag for the Australian cultural imaginary as newspaper headlines screamed ‚ÄúThou Shalt Not Breed‚Äù (Gordon). Seen as the embodiment of horror regarding the ever out-of-control nature of women‚Äôs bodies, these undesirable mothers materialised out of a socio-political landscape that although idealised women‚Äôs bodies as Australia‚Äôs economic saviour, also feared their inability to be managed and contained. Hoarding their capacity to reproduce for their own selfish narcissistic desires, these white trash mothers became the horror par excellence within the Australian cultural imaginary as they were publically regarded as the vilified evil alter-ego of the good, respectable white affluent young mother Australian policy makers were after. Forums all over the country were inundated. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù the dominant voices seemed to proclaim: ‚ÄúWe want to build our population. We need more tax-paying citizens. But we only want white, self-less, nurturing, affluent mothers. We want women who can breed us moral upstanding subjects. We do not want lazy good for nothing moochers.‚Äù Emerging from this paradoxical maternal landscape of fear, loathing and desire, breeder is a visual and performative manifestation of my own inability to come to terms with the idealisation and denigration of motherhood within Australia. Involving a profound recognition that the personal is still the political, I not only attempt to visually trace the relationship between popular Australian cultural formations and individual experiences, but also to visually ‚Äúwrite‚Äù my own embodied grapplings with maternal ambivalence. Following the premise that ‚Äúcritique without resistance is empty and resistance without critique is blind‚Äù (Hoy 6), I find art practice to be a critically situated and embodied act that can openly resist the power of dominant ideologies by highlighting maternal corporeal transgressions. A creative destablising action, I utilise the mediums of video and performance within breeder to explore personal, historical and culturally situated expectations of motherhood within Australia as a means to subvert dominant ideologies of motherhood within the Australian cultural imaginary. Performing Maternal KnowledgeReworking Goya‚Äôs Romantic Gothic vision of fatherhood in Saturn Devouring His Children, breeder is a five minute two-screen video performance that puts an ironic twist to the ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù myths of Australian motherhood. Depicting myself as the young white heavily pregnant protagonist breeding monarch butterflies in my suburban backyard, sugar-coating, cooking and then eating them, breeder uses an exaggerated kitsch aesthetic to render literal the Australian mother as both idealistic nation-builder and self-indulgent abuser. Selfishly hoarding my breeding potential for myself, luxuriating and devouring my ‚Äúoffspring‚Äù for my own pleasure and delight rather than for the common good, breeder simultaneously defies and is complicit with motherhood expectations within the suburban Australian imaginary. Filmed in my backyard in the southern suburbs of Perth, Western Australia, breeder manifests my own maternal ambivalence and deliberately complicates the dichotomous and strained position motherhood holds in western society. Breeder is presented as a two screen video installation. The left screen is a fast-paced, brightly coloured, jump-cut narrative with a pregnant protagonist (myself). It has three main scenes or settings: garden, kitchen and terrace. The right screen is a slow-moving flow of images that shows the entire monarch butterfly breeding cycle in detail; close ups of eggs slowly turning into caterpillars, caterpillars creating cocoons and the gradual opening of wings as butterflies emerge from cocoons. All the while, the metamorphic cycle is aided by the pregnant protagonist, who cares for them until she sets them free of their breeding cage. In the left screen, apricot roses, orange trees, yellow hibiscus bushes, lush green lawns, a swimming pool and an Aussie backyard garden shed are glimpsed as the pregnant protagonist runs, jumps and sneaks up on butterflies while brandishing a red-handled butterfly net; dressed in red high heels and a white lace frock. Bunnies with pink bows jump, dogs in pink collars bark and a very young boy dressed in a navy-blue sailor suit all make cameo appearances as large monarch butterflies are collected and placed inside a child‚Äôs cherry red insect container.  ¬†In a jump-cut transition, the female protagonist appears in a stark white kitchen; now dressed in a bright pink and apricot floral apron and baby-pink hair ribbon tied in a bow in her blonde ponytail. Standing behind the kitchen bench, she carefully measures sugar into a bowl. She then adds pink food colouring into the crystal white sugar, turning it into a bright pink concoction. Cracking eggs and separating them, she whisks the egg whites to form soft marshmallow peaks. Dipping a paint brush into the egg whites, she paints the fluffy mixture onto the butterflies (now dead), which are laid out on a well-used metal biscuit tray. Using her fingers to sprinkle the bright pink sugar concoction onto the butterflies, she then places them into the oven to bake and stands back with a smile.   In the third and final scene, the female protagonist sits down at a table in a garden terrace in front of French-styled doors. Set for high tea with an antique floral tea pot and cup, lace table cloth and petit fours, she pours herself a cup of tea. Adding a teaspoon of sugar, she stirs and then selects a strawberry tart from a three-tiered high-tea stand that holds brightly iced cupcakes, cherry friands, tiny lemon meringue pies, sweet little strawberry tarts and pink sugar coated butterflies. Munching her way through tarts, pies, friands and cupcakes, she finally licks her lips and fuchsia tipped fingers and then carefully chooses a pink sugar coated butterfly. Close ups of her crimson coated mouth show her licking the pink sugar-crumbs from lips and fingers as she silently devours the butterfly. Leaning back in chair, she smiles, then picks up a pink leather bound book and relaxes as she begins to read herself into the afternoon. Screen fades to black. ConclusionAs a mother I am all fragmented, contradictory; full of ambivalence, love, guilt and shame. After seventeen years and five children, you would think that I would be used to this space. Instead, it is a space that I battle to come to terms with each and every day. So how to strategically negotiate engrained codes of maternity and embrace the complexities of embodied maternal knowledge? Indeed, how to speak of the difficulties and incomparable beauties of the maternal without having those variously inflected and complex experiences turn into clich√©s of what enduring motherhood is supposed to be? Visually and performatively grappling with my own fallout from mothering ideals and expectations where sometimes all I feel I am left with is ‚Äúa monster of selfishness and intolerance‚Äù (Rich 363), breeder materialises my own experiences with maternal ambivalence and my inability to reconcile or negotiate multiple contradictory identities into a single maternal position. Ashamed of my self, my body, my obsessions, my anger, my hatred, my rage, my laughter, my sorrow and most of all my oscillation between a complete and utter desire to kill each and every one of my children and an overwhelming desire to gobble them all up, I make art work that is embedded in the grime and grittiness of my everyday life as a young mother living in the southern suburbs of Western Australia. A life that is most often mundane, sometimes sad, embarrassing, rude and occasionally heartbreaking. A life filled with such simple joy and such complicated sorrow. A life that in reality, is anything but manageable and contained. Although this is my experience, I know that I am not the only one. As an artist I engage in the embodied and critically resistant practice of sampling from my ‚Äúmother‚Äù identities in order to bring out multiple, conflictive responses that provocatively encourage new ways of thinking and acknowledging embodied maternal knowledge. Although claims abound that this results in a practice that is ‚Äútoo personal‚Äù or ‚Äútoo specific‚Äù (Liss xv), I do not believe that this in fact risks reifying essentialism. Despite much feminist debate over the years regarding essentialist/social constructivist positions, I would still rather use my body as a site of embodied knowledge then rhetorically give it up. Acting as a disruption and challenge to the concepts of idealised or denigrated maternal embodiment, the images and performances of motherhood in breeder then, are more than simple acknowledgements of the reality of the good and bad mother, or acts reclaiming an identity that they taught me to despise (Cliff) or rebelling against having to be a """"woman"""" at all. Instead, breeder is a lucid and explicit declaration of intent that politely refuses to keep every maternal body in its place.References Allen, Kim, and Jane Osgood. ‚ÄúYoung Women Negotiating Maternal Subjectivities: The Significance of Social Class.‚Äù Studies in the Maternal. 1.2 (2009). 30 July 2012 ‚Äπwww.mamsie.bbk.ac.uk‚Ä∫.Almond, Barbara.

"2012","The double bind: Women, honour and sexuality in contemporary Ireland"," Irish women are caught in contradictory sexual discourses which create a cultural double bind. The legacy of Catholic Church teaching, in which the sexual honour of women revolves around their innocence and subservience, still lingers. This is gradually being replaced by media messages and images which portray women as sexually equal and independent. However, the media also portray sexually independent women as a threat to sexual moral order. The double bind reproduces double standards. The cultural contradictions in the way women are portrayed are revealed in an analysis of the reporting of events surrounding a court case involving the sexual assault of a woman. This analysis is put within the context of media reporting of other cases of sexually transgressive women. ","",""

Justifying her approach and theoretical framework, Buchanan suggests that rhetoric has been absent from examining motherhood and has only ‚Äúbegun to explore the topic‚Äù (p. 11). As such, the text observes motherhood as a rhetorical constraint and analyzes the ‚Äúslippery rhetorical terrain for women‚Äù (p. xvii), defining maternity as an obstacle in certain circumstances and as an advantage to employ in others. Buchanan explores three case studies utilizing a rhetorical theoretical frame and draws from a variety of feminist scholarship on motherhood.","",""
"2013","A SITE FOR FRESH EYES","The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that at least some portion of the digital ‚Äògender gap‚Äô is a rhetorical construction that measures digital literacy by possession of legacy knowledge‚Äìknowledge co-constructed within the technology field where women are largely absent. This paper describes some culturally situated discourses and practices that shape the development of online spaces in subtly gendered ways. It describes Pinterest, a popular social bookmarking site overwhelmingly populated by women, and its design features that largely do not rely on legacy knowledge for engaged member participation. This paper finds that, first, the culturally situated practices of technologists introduce hegemonic narratives through design features that marginalize some female users. Second, some descriptions of the gender gap are rhetorically constructed, relying on evidence of legacy knowledge rather than examining the outcomes of women's online practices. Third, narrowing the gender gap will require a re-seeing and re-thinking about how ‚Äòdigital literacy‚Äô is defined and measured. This paper offers insights into some of the barriers between women and digital fluency that are inadvertently constructed by the tacit knowledge of those who develop technologies ‚Äì knowledge that is often inaccessible to women. Digital literacy theorists, instructors, and technology professionals may engage this research to either alter their end products so that the operation of those products does not assume tacit, legacy knowledge, or, alternatively, they may find ways to make this tacit knowledge more visible so that end users may actively engage the hegemonic narratives encoded in the products rather than passively consume them.","",""

"2014","The Geography of LGBTQ Internet Studies","Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) Internet studies have grown exponentially during the last 10 or 15 years. Apart from original book-length contributions by single authors (Campbell, 2004; Enteen, 2010; Fox, 2012; Gray, 2009; Kuntsman, 2009; Mowlabocus, 2010), a number of special journal issues (Alexander, 2002; Comella & Sender, 2013; Fotopoulou & O‚ÄôRiordan, 2014; Kuntsman & Al-Qasimi, 2012), and edited books (Berry, Martin, & Yue, 2003; O‚ÄôRiordan & Phillips, 2007; Pullen & Cooper, 2010) have all contributed to the advancement of our knowledge of this diversifying field. In this short article, I offer a review of three edited books, recognizing their important collective contributions to LGBTQ Internet studies. The three volumes are surely not the very latest publications in the field and they have already been reviewed by a number of scholars (e.g., de Ridder, 2012; Erni, 2009; Hamming, 2008; Scott, 2008). However, in this review I would like to take one more look at the articles published in those books with a particular focus on what contexts they are anchored in and to what extent they acknowledge the importance of the contexts. In doing so, I aim to critically reflect on the geography of LGBTQ Internet studies.","",""

We consider the ways that emergent practices in new media bring to the fore and make more explicit some previously submerged practices. In identity construction, in spatial practices, and in the productive labor of users of new media, we see examples of how the fluidity of gender can be highlighted, the cultural specificity of some often taken for granted and naturalized practices can be more readily understood as constructed, and ironically, how the overt and self-congratulatory crowing of some gamer and geek cultures draws attention to their misogyny, creating a much bigger and more easily identifiable target for counterstrategies. The intersection of emergent technologies and sociocultural practices creates new areas of gendered negotiations. ","",""

This article examines trans culture on the website Tumblr during the period from March 2011, when the authors began researching the platform, to May 2013, when Yahoo! paid creator David Karp over a billion dollars for the site. Through auto-ethnographic dialogue about the loose social networks within Tumblr to which the authors contributed during this phase, the article explores ephemeral aspects of self-representation at the intersection of postmodern art practice, sexual politics, and queer subjectivities. From at least 2011 to 2013, people collectively oriented in opposition to dominant discourses of gender and sexuality used Tumblr to refashion straight cisgender norms and to create everyday art in a hybrid media space.

"2014","Transitioning Online"," In the past decade, the websites of Thai tourist agencies have expanded their offerings to include medical tourism, and medical tourism online has experienced dramatic changes in packaging and marketing. These shifts suggest a move from Thai-style surgical offerings that were defined as primarily cosmetic to tourist-package style sex/gender-related surgeries under the category of sexual reassignment surgery (SRS). The existence of these websites and the changes in the promotion of sex/gender-related medical tourism over time reveal nuanced interplay of discontinuous sex/gender regimes. By examining the changes on a single website during an eighteen-month period, I indicate larger trends in the Thai medical tourism industry online that I have collected in a three-year period. ‚ÄúTrans‚Äù theory‚Äîtranslation, transnational, transsexual, transactional, and transitive‚Äîis the framework from which I describe these dynamic, discontinuous, dialogic transitions.

"2015","Producing Television and Reproducing Gender"," In a case study of Irish television, gendered production processes are created through the channeling of women and men into different types of roles where they receive differential rewards and opportunities from their work. Gender also impacts in complex ways on the routines of production, where it shapes the perspective applied to media content and expectations regarding the behavior of staff. Gendered production routines and role allocations become embedded over time and eventually form a gendered culture of television production that prohibits Irish women‚Äôs equal participation. Despite the reproduction of gendered work roles, routines, and cultures, women offer evidence of sustainable and valued careers in production. However, women‚Äôs adaptations to the constraints of gendered work processes and practices are founded on a neoliberal and postfeminist sensibility that denies the gendered nature of their work and refers responsibility for survival in the industry onto the individual worker, who in turn denies the relevance of gender to their careers.

"2016","Pinning the feminine user: gender scripts in Pinterest‚Äôs sign-up interface"," Popular social media site Pinterest is known for its strong female user base, something often attributed to the links, images, and ideas available on it. We argue that Pinterest‚Äôs popularity with women can also be attributed to a kind of gendering that occurs during the sign-up process. We see the sign-up process as a ‚Äògender script‚Äô that inscribes specific gender performances into Pinterest itself by ‚Äòpre-scribing‚Äô adherence to a dualistic conception of gender and encouraging users to cooperate rather than to compete with each other, to curate content rather than to create it, and to interact affectively with images rather than with text. These behaviors have connections in the broader public imaginary to traditional performances of femininity, thus the kind of introduction and instruction the new user receives when signing up encourage a perception that Pinterest is for women, a perception that is then materialized in user behaviors. We close by arguing for the sign-up interface as an important site of study in new media scholarship and by discussing the ways in which gender scripts might be resisted. ","",""
"2016","Queering alienation in digital media","Marx‚Äôs concept of alienation, particularly as articulated in Dallas Smythe‚Äôs audience-commodity thesis, is central to critical studies of the political economy of digital media and its exploitation of user labour. However, in its application within critical studies of Internet economies, the concept often becomes limited to alienation from ‚Äòspecies-being‚Äô or autonomous self-actualisation. Drawing on mostly queer, but also some feminist, critiques this paper seeks to challenge this application of the alienation concept. It uses examples of the mediation of gay and queer sexualities through online hook-up apps to illustrate its position, concluding with some suggestions for how queering the subject of the alienation thesis may shape further analysis.","",""
"2016","Disturbing Hegemonic Discourse: Nonbinary Gender and Sexual Orientation Labeling on Tumblr"," In this article, I examine lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer/questioning, intersex, and asexual (LGBTQIA) Tumblr bloggers‚Äô bio boxes and ‚ÄúAbout Me‚Äù pages to show the ways gender and sexual orientation identities are constructed through community-regulated and community-generated labeling practices. Tumblr encourages counter-cultures (and labeling practices) to not only form but also to thrive due to its distinctive affordances including tagging and blog formatting. This article examines not only how these affordances shape usage and, subsequently, identity construction on Tumblr but also the ways in which Tumblr bloggers have embraced affordances to create community-accepted conventions of identity construction. Additionally, building upon online identity scholarship by Bargh, McKenna, and Fitzsimons and Tiidenberg, this article discusses true self and nonbinary gender and sexual orientation labeling as forms of identity construction that allows LGBTQIA identifying individuals a method for nuanced descriptions of feelings and desires. However, far from perfect, these labeling practices are also grounded in hegemonic female/male, feminine/masculine binary discourse. In a Foucauldian sense, bloggers construct discourse within existing power structures that ignore or erase LGBTQIA as sexual ‚Äúabnormalities.‚Äù Although it is nearly impossible to fully break away from the dominant discourse, these labeling practices can be a useful starting point for conversations about genders and sexualities that lie outside of the hegemonic binary.

"2016","Baking Gender Into Social Media Design: How Platforms Shape Categories for Users and Advertisers"," In recent years, several popular social media platforms have launched freeform custom gender fields. This decision reconstitutes gender categories beyond an oppressive binary only permitting ‚Äúmales‚Äù and ‚Äúfemales.‚Äù In this work, we uncover many different user-facing gender category design strategies within the social media ecosystem, ranging from custom gender options (on Facebook, Google+, and Pinterest) to the absence of gender fields entirely (on Twitter and LinkedIn). To explore how gender is baked into platform design, this article investigates the 10 most popular English-speaking social media platforms by performing recorded walkthroughs from two different subject positions: (1) a new user registering an account, and (2) a new advertiser creating an ad. We explore several different spaces in social media software where designers commonly program gender‚Äîsign-up pages, profile pages, and advertising portals‚Äîto consider (1) how gender is made durable through social media design, and (2) the shifting composition of the category of gender within the social media ecosystem more broadly. Through this investigation, we question how these categorizations attribute meaning to gender as they materialize in different software spaces, along with the recursive implications for society. Ultimately, our analysis reveals how social media platforms act as intermediaries within the larger ecosystem of advertising and web analytics companies. We argue that this intermediary role entrusts social media platforms with a considerable degree of control over the generation of broader categorization systems, which can be wielded to shape the perceived needs and desires of both users and advertising clients.

"2017","The Bisexual Seen: Countering Media Misrepresentation","IntroductionJohn Berger provides a compelling analysis in Ways of Seeing on how we‚Äôve been socialized through centuries of art to see women as objects and men as subjects. This way of seeing men and women is more than aesthetic choices but in fact shapes our ideologies of gender. As Berger asserts: ‚ÄúThe art of the past no longer exists as it once did‚Ä¶ In its place there is a language of images. What matters now is who uses that language for what purpose‚Äù (33).What happens when there are no historical images that represent your identity? How do others learn to see you? How do you learn to represent yourself? This article addresses the challenges that bisexuals face in constructing and contending with media representations of non-normative sexualities. As Berger suggests: ‚ÄúA people or class which is cut off from its own past is far less free to choose and to act as a people or class than one that has been able to situate itself in history‚Äù (33). This article seeks to apply Berger‚Äôs core concepts in Ways of Seeing studying representations of bisexuality in mainstream media. How bisexuality is represented, and therefore observed, shapes what can ultimately be culturally understood and recognized.This article explores how bisexuals use digital media to construct self-representations and brand a bisexual identity. Bisexual representations are particularly relevant to study as they are often rendered invisible by the cultural hegemony of monosexuality. Cultural norms ideologically shape the intelligibility of representation; bisexuality is often misinterpreted when read within the dominant binaries of heterosexuality and homosexuality in Western European culture. This work addresses how users adapt visual, textual, and hyperlinked information in online spaces to create representations that can be culturally recognized. Users want to be seen as bisexuals.¬†The research for this article examined online social spaces created by and for bisexuals between 2013-2015, as well as mainstream media addressing bisexuality or bisexual characters. The social spaces studied included national and regional websites for bisexual organizations, blogs dedicated to bisexual issues and topics, and public bisexual groups on Facebook and Tumblr. Participant observation and semiotic analysis was employed to analyze how bisexual representation was discussed and performed. ¬†Learning to See Bisexuality Bisexuality is often constructed within the domain of medical and psychological classification systems as a sexual identity situated between one polarity or the other: between desiring men or desiring women as sexual partners or between being gay or being straight in sexual orientation, as most widely put forth by Alfred Kinsey in the 1950s (Kinsey et al., 1948; e.g., Blumstein, 1977; Diamond, 1993; Weinberg, 1995). This popularly held conception has a particular history that serves to reinforce the normative categories of heterosexuality and monosexuality.This history does not reflect bisexual‚Äôs accounts of their own experiences of what it means to be bisexual. Bisexuals in the spaces I study express their sexuality as fluid both in terms of gender (objects of desire do not have to identify as only male or female) as well as in terms of the lifespan (desire based on sex or gender does not have remain consistent throughout one‚Äôs life). As one participant remarked: ‚ÄúI think of bisexual as a different orientation from both homosexuals (who orient exclusively towards same-sex romance/sexuality) and heterosexuals (who orient exclusively toward opposite-sex romance/sexuality). Bisexuals seem to think about the world in a different way: a world of ‚ÄòAND‚Äô rather than a world of ‚ÄòOR‚Äô.‚Äù Or as another participant noted: ‚ÄúI saw video a couple of months ago that described ‚Äòbi‚Äô as being attracted to ‚Äòsame and different sexed people.‚Äô I considered my internal debate settled at that point. Yes, it is binary, but only in the broadest sense.‚ÄùThis data from my research is congruent with data from much larger studies that examined longitudinal psycho-social development of bisexual identities (Klein, 1978; Barker, 2007; Diamond, 2008). Individuals‚Äô narratives of a more ‚Äúfluid‚Äù identity suggest an emphasis at the individual level less about fluctuating between ‚Äútwo‚Äù possible types of sexual partners than about a dynamic, complex desire within a coherent self. Nevertheless, popular constructions of bisexuality in media continue to emphasize it within hegemonic monosexual ideologies.Heterosexual relationships are overwhelmingly the most dominant relationship type portrayed in media, and the second most portrayed relationship is homosexuality, or a serial monogamy towards only one gender. This pairing is not only conveying the dominant hegemonic norms of heterosexuality (and most often paired with serial monogamy as well), but it is equally and powerfully reproducing the hegemonic ideal of monosexuality. Monosexuality is the romantic or sexual attraction to members of one sex or gender group only. A monosexual person may identify as either heterosexual or homosexual, the key element being that their sexual or romantic attraction remains consistently directed towards one sex or gender group. In this way, we have all been socialized since childhood to value not only monogamy but monosexuality as well. However, current research on sexuality suggests that self-identified bisexuals are the largest group among non-heterosexuals. In 2011, Dr. Gary Gates, Research Director of the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law, analyzed data collected from nine national health surveys from the USA, United Kindgdom, Canada, Australia and Norway to provide the most comprehensive statistics available to date on how many people self-identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender. While the population percentage of LGBT people varied by country, the ratio of lesbian, gay and bisexuals among LGBT people remained consistent, with self-identified bisexuals accounting for 40-60% of all LGBT populations regardless of country. This data is significant for challenging the popular assumption that bisexuals are a small minority among non-heterosexuals; indeed, this data indicates that non-monosexuals represent half of all non-heterosexuals. Yet we have learned to recognize monosexuality as dominant, normal and naturalized, even within LGBT representations. Conversely, we struggle to even recognize relationships that fall outside of this hegemonic norm. In essence, we lack ways of seeing bisexuals, pansexuals, omnisexuals, asexuals, and all queer-identified individuals who do not conform to monosexuality. We quite literally have not learned to see them, or‚Äîworse yet‚Äîlearned how to not see them.Bisexual representations are particularly relevant to study as they are often rendered invisible in cultures that practice monogamy paired with hegemonic monosexuality. Members of bisexual spaces desire to achieve recognition but struggle to overcome bisexual erasure in their daily lives.Misrepresention: The Triad in Popular MediaWhen bisexuality is portrayed in media it is most commonly portrayed in a disingenuous manner where the bisexual is portrayed as being torn between potential lovers, on a pathway from straight to gay, or as a serial liar and cheater who cannot remain monogamous due to overwhelming attractions. Representations of bisexuals in media are infrequent, but those that are available too often follow these inaccurate stereotypes. By far the most common convention for representing bisexuality in visual media is the use of the triad: three people convey the (mis)representation of bisexuality as a sexuality in the ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù of heterosexuality and homosexuality. For the purpose of this article, data analysis will be limited to print magazines for the sake of length and clarity.The 2014 New York Times Magazine article ‚ÄúThe Scientific Quest to Prove Bisexuality Exists‚Äù (Denizet-Lewis) addresses the controversial nature of bisexuality. The cover image depicts a close-up of a man‚Äôs face, separated into two halves: in one half, a woman is nuzzled up to the man‚Äôs cheek, and the other half a man is nuzzled up to his ear. Presumably the man is bisexual and therefore split into two parts: his heterosexual self and his homosexual self. This visual depiction of bisexuality reifies the notion that bisexuals are torn between two polar desires and experience equal and concurrent attraction to more than one partner simultaneously. Furthermore, the triad represented in this way suggests that the essential bisexual is having simultaneous liaisons with heterosexual and homosexual partners.Within the convention of the triad there is also a sub-genre closely connected with hypersexualization and the male gaze. In these cases, the triad is commonly presented in varying states of undress and/or in a bed. An article in The Guardian from 11 April 2014 with the headline: ‚ÄúMake up your mind! The science behind bisexuality‚Äù (Browne) includes an image with three attractive young people in bed together. A man is sitting up between two sleeping women and smoking a cigarette ‚Äì the cigarette connotes post-coital sexual activity, as does the smirk on his face. This may have been a suitable image if the article had been about having a threesome, but the headline‚Äîand the article‚Äîare attempting to explain the science behind bisexuality. Furthermore, while the image is intended to illustrate an article on bisexuality, the image is fundamentally misleading. The women in the image are asleep and to the side and the man is awake and in the middle. He is the central figure ‚Äì it is a picture of him. So who is the bisexual in the image? What is the image attempting to do? It seems that the goal is to titillate, to excite, and to satisfy a particularly heterosexual fantasy rather than to discuss bisexuality. This hypersexualization once again references the mistaken idea (or heterosexual male fantasy) that bisexuality is only expressed through simultaneous sex acts.Many of these examples are salacious but they occur with surprising regularity in the mainstream media. On 17 February 2016, the American Association of Retired Persons posted an article to the front page of their website titled ‚ÄúAm I Discovering I'm Bisexual?‚Äù (Schwartz, 2016). In the accompanying image at the top of the article, we see three people sitting on a park bench ‚Äì two men on either side of a woman. The image is taken from behind the bench so we see their backs and ostensibly they do not see us, the viewer. The man on the left is kissing the woman in the center while also holding hands behind the back of the bench with the man sitting on her other side. The man on the right is looking away from the couple kissing, suggesting he is not directly included in their intimate activity. Furthermore, the two men are holding hands behind the bench, which could also be code for behind the woman‚Äôs back, suggesting infidelity to the dyad and depicting some form of duplicity.¬† This triad reinforces the trope of the bisexual as promiscuous and untrustworthy.Images such as these are common and range from the more inoffensive to the salacious. The resulting implications are that bisexuals are torn between their internal hetero and homo desires, require simultaneous partners, and are untrustworthy partners. Notably, in all these images it is never clear exactly which individuals are bisexual. Are all three members of the triad bisexual? While this is a possible read, the dominant discourse leads us to believe that one of person in the triad is the bisexual while the others adhere to more dominant sexualities.Participants in my research were acutely aware of these media representations and expressed frequent negative reactions to the implications of the triad. Each article contained numerous online comments expressing frustration with the use of ‚Äúthreesomes.‚Äù As one commentator stated: ‚ÄúWithout a threesome, we‚Äôre invisible. It‚Äôs messed up. I always imagine a t-shirt with 3 couples stick figure like: girl + girl, girl + boy, and boy + boy. and it says ‚Äú6 bisexuals.‚Äù What is made clear in many user comments is that the mainstream social scripts used to portray bisexuality are clearly at odds with the ways in which bisexuals choose to describe or portray themselves.¬†Seeing through CapitalismOne of the significant conclusions of this research was the ways in which the misrepresentation of bisexuality results in many individuals feeling underrepresented or made invisible within mainstream media. The most salient themes to emerge from this research is participants‚Äô affective struggle with feeling """"invisible.‚Äù The frequency of discourse specific to invisibility is significant, as well as its expressed negatively associated experiences and feelings. The public sharing of those reactions among individuals, and the ensuing discourse that emerges from those interactions, include imagining what visibility ‚Äúlooks‚Äù like (its semiotic markers and what would make those markers ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù for visibility), and the articulation of ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù to counter perceived invisibility. Notably, participants often express the desire for visibility in terms of commodification. As one participant posted, ‚Äútheir [sic] is no style for bi, there is no voice tone, unless I'm wearing my shirt, how is anyone to know?‚Äù Another participant explicated, ‚ÄúI wish there was a look. I wish I could get up every day and put on the clothes and jewelry that identified me to the world when I stepped out of my apartment. I wish I was as visible on the street as I am on facebook.‚Äù This longing for a culturally recognizable bisexual identity is articulated as a desire for a market commodification of ‚Äúbisexual.‚Äù But a commodified identity may be a misguided desire. As Berger warns: ‚ÄúPublicity is not merely an assembly of competing messages: it is a language in itself which is always being used to make the same general purpose‚Ä¶ It proposes to each of us that we transform ourselves, or our lives, by buying something more‚Äù (131). Consumerism‚Äîand its bedfellow‚Äîmarketing, aim to sell the fantasy of a future self whereby the consumer transforms themselves through material objects, not transforming the culture to accept them. Berger further elicits that marketing essentially convinces us that we are not whole the way we are and sells us the idea of a wholeness achieved through consumerism (134). Following Berger‚Äôs argument, this desire for a commodified identity, while genuine, may fundamentally undermine the autonomy bisexuals currently have insomuch as without a corporate brand, bisexual representations are more culturally malleable and therefore potentially more inclusive to the real diversity of bisexual identified people.However, Berger also rightly noted that ‚Äúpublicity is the culture of the consumer society. It propagates through images that society‚Äôs belief in itself‚Äù (139). Without any publicity, bisexuals are not wrong to feel invisible in a consumer culture. And yet ‚Äúpublicity turns consumption into a substitute for democracy. The choice of what one eats (or wears or drives) takes the place of significant political choice‚Äù (149). A commodified identity will not likely usher in meaningful political change in a culture where bisexuals experience worse mental health and discrimination outcomes than lesbian and gay people (LGBT Advisory Committee, 2011).¬†Bisexuals Online: New Ways of SeeingThe Internet, which was touted early as a space of great potential for anonymity and exploration where visibility can be masked, here becomes the place where bisexuals try to make the perceived invisible ‚Äòvisible.‚Äô Digital technologies and spaces provide particularly useful environments for participants of online bisexual spaces to negotiate issues of invisibility as participants construct visible identities through daily posts, threads, videos, and discourse in which bisexuality is discursively and visually imagined, produced, articulated, defended, and desired. But most importantly these digital technologies provide bisexuals with opportunities to counter misrepresentations in mainstream media. In the frequent example of intimate partners in the physical world rendering a bisexual‚Äôs identity invisible, participants of these online communities grapple with the seeming paradox of one‚Äôs offline self as the avatar and one‚Äôs online self as more fully integrated, represented, and recognized. One participant expressed this experience, remarking:I feel I'm more out online that offline. That's because, in the offline world there's the whole ''social assumptions'' issue. My co-workers, friends, etc, know I have a boyfriend, wich [sic] equals ''straight'' for most ppl out there. So, I'll out myself when the occasion comes (talking abt smn I used to date, the LGBT youth group I used to belong to, or usually just abt some girl I find attractive) and usually ppl are not surprised. Whereas online, my pic at Facebook (and Orkut) is a Bisexual Pride icon. I follow Bi groups on Twitter. I'm a member of bi groups. So, online it's spelled out, while offline ppl usually think me having a bf means I'm straight.The I Am Visible (IAV) campaign is just one example of an organized response to the perceived erasure of bisexuals in mainstream culture. Launched in January 2011 by Adrienne McCue (nee Williams), the executive director of the Bi Social Network, a non-profit organization aimed at bringing awareness to representations of bisexuality in media. The campaign was hosted on bisocialnetwork.com, with the goal to ‚Äústop biphobia and bi-erasure in our community, media, news, and entertainment,‚Äù Prior to going live, IAV implemented a six-month lead-up advertising campaign across multiple online bisexual forums, making it the most publicized new venture during the period of my study. IAV hosted user-generated videos and posters that followed the vernacular of coming out and provided emotional support for listeners who may be struggling with their identity in a world largely hostile to bisexuality. Perceived invisibility was the central theme of IAV, which was the most salient theme for every bisexual group I studied online.Perhaps the most notable video and still image series to come out of IAV were those including Emmy nominated Scottish actor Alan Cumming. Cumming, a long-time Broadway thespian and acclaimed film actor, openly identifies as bisexual and has criticized ‚Äògaystream‚Äô outlets on more than one occasion for intentionally mislabeling him as ‚Äògay.‚Äô As such, Alan Cumming is one of the most prominently celebrated bisexual celebrities during the time of my study. While there are numerous famous out gays and lesbians in the media industry who have lent their celebrity status to endorse LGBT political messages‚Äîsuch as Ellen DeGeneres, Elton John, and Neil Patrick Harris, to name a few‚Äîthere have been notably fewer celebrities supporting bisexual specific causes. Therefore, Cummings involvement with IAV was significant for many bisexuals. His star status was perceived as contributing legitimacy to bisexuality and increasing cultural visibility for bisexuals.These campaigns to become more visible are based in the need to counteract the false media narrative, which is, in a sense, to educate the wider society as to what bisexuality is not. The campaigns are an attempt to repair the false messages which have been ‚Äúlearnt‚Äù and replace them with more accurate representations. ¬†¬†The Internet provides bisexual activists with a tool with which they can work to correct the skewed media image of themselves. Additionally, the Internet has also become a place where bisexuals can more easily represent themselves through a wide variety of semiotic markers in ways which would be difficult or unacceptable offline. In these ways, the Internet has become a key device in bisexual activism and while it is important not to uncritically praise the technology it plays an important role in enabling correct representation.¬†¬†ReferencesBarker, Meg.

This mixed-methods participatory research included a nationwide organizational survey with 231 respondents, 19 expert interviews, and a series of workshops with project partners and advisers. We found that despite scarce resources, many LGBTQ and Two-Spirit organizations have an intersectional analysis of linked systems of race, class, gender, sexual orientation, and other axes of identity and structural inequality. Many seek to do media work that develops the critical consciousness and leadership of their communities, create media in ways that are deeply accountable to their social base, use participatory approaches to media making, are strategic and cross-platform in their approach, and root their work in community action. We call this combination of characteristics transformative media organizing, and we believe it describes an emerging paradigm for social movement media practices in the current media landscape.

I argue that the gender binary has regulated Facebook‚Äôs design strategy while the co-existence of binary and non-binary affordances has enabled the company to serve both users and advertising clients simultaneously. Three findings are revealed: (1) an original programming decision to store three values for gender in Facebook‚Äôs database became an important fissure for non-binary possibilities, (2) gender became increasingly valuable over time, and (3) in the deep level of the database, non-binary users are reconfigured into a binary system.

"2018","(Not) getting the credit: women, liminal subjectivity and resisting neoliberalism in documentary production"," Women experience positive engagements with documentary as an enclave that values their gendered contribution, but also suffer negative encounters with it as a genre that restricts their full involvement, by promoting masculinist practices as normative. This gendered dynamic means that women occupy a liminal space with regard to documentary. Women‚Äôs liminal status is experienced negatively in a number of ways: first, during commissioning, where their approach to narrative, budgets and directing are questioned; second, in terms of work relationships where they are required to be relentlessly ‚Äòlikeable‚Äô; and third, when credits for work performed are withheld. Women‚Äôs subjective identities are constructed around this negative liminal positioning but it can become a position or form of positive adaptation to gendered and neoliberal subjectivity in their working lives. Resistance occurs when women conduct practices such as, first, enhancing the status of affective labour; second, when they undo or reject working through normative hierarchies; and third, when they collaborate in documentary production to negate neoliberal logics of individualization. Liminality, thus, constitutes both a way of understanding women‚Äôs negative experiences of gender inequality in documentary production but also a potentially positive form of resistance to the gendered precarity that characterizes creative labour.

"2018","Locating Femme Theory Online","Paying close attention to the Internet has revelatory potential for femme theory. Femme, a queerly feminine sexual and gender identity, has so far been under theorized and is often treated as unimportant or even suspect in queer and feminist studies (Martin, 1996; Harris and Crocker, 1997; Maltry and Tucker, 2002; Dahl, 2017). Work on femme has proliferated in response to this (mis)treatment of femme (Volcano and Dahl, 2008; Rose and Camilleri, 2002; Harris and Crocker, 1997; Duggan and McHugh, 1996; Nestle, 1992b), and looking to the Internet reveals a rich tradition of femme theorizing. In this paper I argue that femme theory is often produced through cultural and community forms and emphasize the potential of blogs and social media as sites of this knowledge production. Femme theory found online challenges the masculinist standards of queerness and, I argue, the masculinist standard of inquiry. I rely on a range of feminist, cultural, and queer theorists who engage with theories of epistemology to shift our understanding of the concept ‚Äútheory‚Äù itself in order to make space for femme epistemology. In addition to challenging the superiority of masculinity, hegemonic femininity and patriarchal gender roles, and defying stereotypes about femmes, femme theory also complicates several aspects of formal knowledge production. Looking to the Internet is a crucial way to locate femme knowledge and attend to gaps in feminist and queer theory.","",""

The Internet of Bawdies is the Internet of too much body. My working description of the Internet of Bawdies is, the (forced) digitization and onlining (publication, connectivity, searchability) of previously non-digital/not-onlined (Cowan &amp; Rault 2018) ephemera of trans- feminist and queer (TFQ) community-based expressive cultures, including but not limited to drag, burlesque, kink shows, porn and erotica across medium, spoken word, slam and other text-based performance forms, and cabaret, whether is explicitly sexual or not, as well as the internet of sex work and other modes of consentual, adult online embodiment that exceed, transgress, resist or transform heteronormative, monogamous, reproductive bodies. While there are many sexes, genders and orientations in the Internet of Bawdies, here I focus on the ethics of TFQ digitization in this context. ‚ÄúTransmedial drag‚Äù is what I have identified as a method of study, knowledge production and citational practice developed on/in/of/with the Internet of Bawdies in mind. Transmedial drag are the processes involved in moving across media/mediums (for example: from live performance, to video documentation, to digital archive to online platform), which creates a sort of pastiche of the ‚Äòoriginal,‚Äô denaturalizing its status as ‚Äòoriginary‚Äô and teaching us something new about the excesses and limitations of each media form. In particular, transmedial drag is a method for ethical engagements that researchers working with TFQ in the online environment, especially re-mediating materials to an online environment, might find they are already doing. There is a story in the moving across media, and transmedial drag is set of practices to tell those stories.","",""

It is based on 5‚Äâyears of cyberethnographic research in queer Tumblr circulations as well as multi-year rounds of qualitative interviewing with queer youth informants. Several informants experienced drastically negative consequences, to the point of being disowned by their families, because of what this article calls a design bias toward ‚Äúdefault publicness‚Äù that shapes user experience on social media such as Facebook. This article identifies four design decisions that create ‚Äúdefault publicness‚Äù on social media platforms, viewing these decisions through queer, feminist, and critical race theories that have argued that the ‚Äúpublic‚Äù is never neutral terrain. It understands these design decisions as imperatives of ‚Äúplatform capitalism,‚Äù which extracts robust and verifiable user data for monetization, and structures these spaces accordingly. ","",""

This study explores the nascent field of social media work through an analysis of job recruitment ads‚Äîtexts, we contend, that provide insight into a key discursive site of imagining the ideal digital laborer. Drawing upon a qualitative textual analysis of 150 adverts, we show how employers construct workers through a patterned set of features, including sociability, deft emotional management, and flexibility. Such industrial imaginings incite workers to remain ever available, juggle various roles and responsibilities, and engage in persistent emotional labor‚Äîboth online and off. These expectations, we argue, allude to the increasingly feminized nature of social media employment, with its characteristic invisibility, lower pay, and marginal status within the technology field.

The papers in this panel each explore the kinds of approaches suited to researching queer ‚Äúde/stabilizations‚Äù in and of digital culture; that is, to projects of tracing, mapping, and making, queerer worlds via digital cultural research. ‚ÄúTrustworthy‚Äù systems are, in one important sense, systems that are relatively stable, reliable, and that work somewhat predictably. But in algorithmic digital cultures ‚Äúreliability‚Äù and ‚Äúpredictability‚Äù are not always characteristics to be trusted: digital media scholars have examined how algorithmic systems ‚Äúbuild in‚Äù, intensify, and thus stabilize a-priori discriminatory practices, cultural associations, and stereotypical representational meanings, thus helping to cement social inequalities via increasingly ubiquitous practices of quantification, as Paper 4 explores in relation to digital extracted data on ‚Äúgay‚Äù genomics and faces. On a different register, ethnographic research on youth, social media, and gender and sexuality has also evidenced the kind of stabilizations of hetero-patriarchal dominant meanings of, for example, digitally shared images of bodies, as Papers 1 and 2 highlight. Important tensions arise in digital cultural research, particularly among scholars concerned with gender and sexuality, around desires to trace, and make manifest stable, strong, and more broadly and inclusively ‚Äútrustworthy‚Äù systems, communities, and meanings in digital cultures, and the associated risks of capture and exclusion pertinent to marginalized groups and bodies (Paper 3).

Clearly, it has garnered an international reputation as ‚Äúbeing culturally tolerant of gender variance‚Äù (p. 16), in particular, for transgendered women or ladyboys. However, they are still considered marginalized in Thai society and are not well-accepted for many Thais. Since the rise of networked technology, some Thai transgender women have lived online, formed likeminded-groups, and shared support. This paper argues that their blogs serve as counter-publics for the unheard voices to be publicly visible. At the intersection of technology, identity and online participation literatures, this research extends microcelebrity literature and borrows second-wave feminist value, ‚Äúpersonal is political‚Äù to examine transgender women beauty bloggers and their blogs and understand how (their) personal is political. For this project, I had in-depth interviews with seven transgender women beauty bloggers in Thailand, taken in 2-hour period each during December 2016 and February 2017. Findings show that, Thai transgender female beauty blogs serve as ‚Äúsocial-conscience-style activis[t]‚Äù (Vromen, 2006) who build their own bodies, friend their fans (regardless of how many followers they have accumulated), and become inspiring idols. The blogs lend themselves to serve as informational and emotional support to their followers, especially transgendered followers.

Drawing on recent work by Matzner (2016) on the performative dimensions of Big Data, I argue that Big Data‚Äôs potential to perform and create Queerness (or its opposites) in the absence of embodiment and intentionality necessitates a rethinking of phenomenological or affective approaches to Queer ontology. Additionally, while Queerness is often theorized as an ongoing process of negotiations, (re)orientations, and iterative becomings, these perspectives presume elements of categorical mobility that Big Data precludes. This paper asks: what happens when our data performs Queerness without our permission or bodily complacency?

While Cassils primarily conceptualized PISSED/Fountain as a queering of binary, essentialist understandings of gendered embodiment, I draw on performance, queer, and critical ethnic studies to illustrate that these pieces simultaneously challenge other kinds of oppositional embodiments, particularly health versus disease and citizen versus alien and/or terrorist; conceptualizations the state frequently deploys to surveil and control marginalized populations. PISSED/Fountain offer audiences a new strategy for both exposing and contesting state violence: these pieces can be read as a politically strategic disidentification with the state's classification of certain bodies and their excretions as ``deviant'' and ``toxic'' in order to purposefully ``terrorize'' the state's bio- and necropolitical aims.","",""

By exploring how this film deploys not only the visual cues of beautiful male bodies to create bodily responses in its largely female audience but also querying how the sound cues create sonic visibility, I aim to illustrate how MMXXL enables women viewers from a cross section of intersectional identities the opportunity to not only feel seen but also desired.","",""
"2020","Gender Representations on &lt;em&gt;YouTube&lt;/em&gt;","Introduction Media and gender are intricately linked in our society. Every day we see representations of women and men on the screen, read about politicians in the press, watch influencers on YouTube or go to the cinema where we meet screen heroes. Our images and notions of gender draw on these media narratives and role models. Children and young people are socialised with these views and cultivate their own identity and gender roles accordingly. Ideas of gender are not static. They are produced discursively in an ongoing process. Gender is understood as a social category, and this perspective is interwoven with an observation of people‚Äôs social behaviour, their ‚Äúdoing gender‚Äù (West and Zimmerman). From a social constructivist, the focus lies on the production processes connected with the construction of gender representations through the media. The question of how masculinity and femininity, concepts of ‚Äúbeing a man‚Äù or ‚Äúbeing a woman‚Äù, represented on a platform such as YouTube become relevant. Our research interest lies exactly in this: How gender inclusive is the video platform YouTube? Are male and female representations equally visible‚Äîor do we find exclusion mechanisms that hinder this? Literature Review Europe-wide studies show that children and adolescents are online for an average of 2.4 hours a day (Hasebrink et al.). Eighty-seven per cent of young people report watching videos (e.g. on YouTube) at least once a week (ibid., 11). This applies for Germany as well (MPFS). Considering the relevance YouTube has for adolescents, the question arises as to which role models are portrayed through YouTube and how diverse the representations of gender are depicted there. Initial analyses, primarily for the English-language YouTube platform, see its potential to counteract gender stereotypes (Maloney et al.), but generally show an unequal visibility of the genders on YouTube. These studies find that women are underrepresented, receive more hostile feedback and present themselves in stereotypical forms (Wotanis and McMillan; D√∂ring; Molyneaux et al.). D√∂ring and Mohseni showed in their current nine-country comparative analysis that men dominate the popular YouTube across countries and women are more likely to give up after hostility. The existing research usually examined the English-language, mainly US YouTube, it analysed gender performance, stereotypes in selected genres such as advertising or gaming, the stigmatisation of obesity, the representation and experiences of black women on YouTube, and the staging of alternative images of masculinity (see Hussin et al.; Kataria and Pandey; Wotanis and McMillan; Casabianca; Maloney et al.; Sobande). Molyneaux et al. noted in their landmark study gender-specific differences: female YouTubers tend to focus on private matters and interact more frequently with their users. Male YouTubers, on the other hand, share opinions and information and avoid emotions (Pedersen and Macafee). In addition, female vloggers are more often criticised for their appearance than for the content of their videos (Molyneaux et al.). Even though YouTube is an international medium, its use remains limited to language and nation. For example, the most popular YouTube stars among German children and young people are predominantly German-speaking influencers or sportsmen and women. In 2019, girls between the ages of 6 and 13 most often name Bibi, Dagi Bee, Shirin David, Lisa &amp; Lena, and Miley; boys at the same age Julien Bam, Gronkh, Die Lochis, LeFloid and Manuel Neuer (IZI). All these are German YouTube or sports stars. YouTube itself shows in its recommendations under the heading ‚Äúmost popular videos in Germany‚Äù exclusively German-language videos, music videos, or sporting events (YouTube). Therefore, YouTube also needs to be examined in national contexts, as well as in cross-national context. Our study will focus on the national German context to examine whether there are similar gender differences in the German-speaking YouTube as have been identified for the English-speaking YouTube. For German-speaking YouTube, few studies are available. D√∂ring and Mohseni examined male and female operators of the top 100 YouTube channels in nine different countries. The results show that women make up 25 per cent of the top 100 German YouTube channel operators, a distribution which is similarly uneven in other countries. Usage data shows that the German-speaking YouTube appears to have a greater relevance among boys than girls. Boys (93%) use YouTube more often on a regular basis, than girls (86%), and rank it higher as their favourite app (MPFS). Other than for traditional media such as television or film, where intensive research has for decades shown a wide gender gap in the visibility of women (Prommer and Linke; Linke and Prommer), research on German-speaking YouTube is rare (D√∂ring and Mohseni). Hypotheses In reflection of the research outlined above on representations of gender in media and the stereotypical portrayals of men and women in film and television, we assume that these gender role depictions are carried over into online videos on social media platforms. The fact that girls use YouTube somewhat less often, consider themselves less competent in the necessary Internet skills, and anticipate greater risks related to communicative aspects suggests that female operators might have been held back and that the female perspective might be marginalised in public (self-)portrayals. The following hypotheses will therefore guide our study:  H1: Fewer women are channel operators of Germany‚Äôs most popular YouTube channels, and they are more limited in their choice of genres. H2: Women are less visible than men in popular YouTube videos. H3: Women portray themselves more often as connected to stereotypically female topics or are depicted as such in videos. H4: Men stage themselves as professionals.  Methods and Sample Following these hypotheses, we conducted a two-step research. The first research step was to analyse to what extent women and men produce popular content. For this, we looked at the ratio of female to male YouTubers among the 1,000 most successful German channels. These YouTubers are called either creators or channel operators by the industry. Both terms are used synonymously here. To identify the most popular YouTube channels, we acquired the viewing and ranking data from the market research company Social Blade, which is one of the very few sources for these data. We measured the popularity of the channels by the number of subscribers to a channel. The success of individual videos was measured by individual views. We coded the 1,000 most successful German YouTube channels, with a standardised quantitative content analysis. This method is frequently applied in existing studies on gender representations in YouTube (D√∂ring; D√∂ring and Mohensi). Different to existing research, we looked at a larger number of channels. This quantified analysis was combined with a more qualitative, but still standardised analysis of visibility of gender and concrete content and presentation forms (Prommer and Linke). For the second step we used the Audio-Visual Character Analysis (ACIS) developed by Prommer and Linke as a method that is able to code any audio-visual content in order to describe visibility and diversity of the depicted people. Here, the analysis considered the individual video as the unit of analysis. For 20 videos from each of the top 100 YouTube creators, we chose the 10 of most recent videos plus the 10 videos with the most views to be analysed. In total, 2,000 videos were analysed. For the qualitative analysis, looking at the visibility of gender, we excluded channels operated by institutions, such as radio and TV broadcasters, music labels, and other commercial entities. These were not considered since there is no individual person responsible. We also excluded ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Play‚Äù videos, since these often do not show the operator, but only show game play from video games. Results H1: Fewer women are operators of Germany‚Äôs most popular YouTube channels, and they are more limited in their choice of genres. As the analyses show, if the non-individual channel operators are included in the statistics, we see that 27 per cent of the top popular channels in Germany are hosted by institutions (270); this leaves 172 channels operated by women (17%), 525 channels by men (53%), and 25 (3%) by mixed-gender teams. Further on, we will only consider the top 1,000 channels produced by one or more individuals; of these, one quarter (24%) of channel operators are female (fig. 1). This shows that, for every channel in the list produced by a woman, three are produced by men. Only three per cent of the channels are produced by men and women together, constituting a mixed-gender team. The YouTube genres, according to the YouTube classification, also show significant gender differences. Women can be seen first and foremost in tutorial channels (women: 61; men: 9). However, because only 24 per cent of channels in which an individual operator could be identified are contributed by women, all other genres except for tutorial channels are produced disproportionally more often by men. Gaming videos are solid male territory, as almost all """"Let‚Äôs Play"""" channels are operated by men (women: 6; men: 150). Here, there are 25 men for every one woman who operates a gaming channel. This is particularly remarkable, as women make up 46 per cent of gamers (ISFE), and their underrepresentation can generally not be explained by lack of interest. Men operate channels in a wide variety of other genres, such as music (women: 9; men: 80) and sports (women: 4; men: 20). The genres of comedy, film, and education show only one female operator each‚Äîoutnumbered from 10 to 1 to as much as 20 to 1. Examining the statistics for men and women separately reveals that men do not only operate the majority of the top 1,000 channels, but they are also visible in a wider variety of genres. Female YouTubers have primarily limited themselves to entertainment channels (50% of all women) and how-to channels (35% of all women). Male channels are more diverse and include entertainment (38% of all men), games (29% of all men), and music (15% of all men), as well as all other genres. Only in tutorial channels men are rarely seen (2%). The genre definitions of the YouTube channels used here are derived from YouTube itself, and these definitions are not in line with other genre theories and are overly broad. Nevertheless, these results confirm the first hypothesis that fewer women are operators of popular YouTube channels, and that women are more limited in their genre diversity.  Fig. 1: Gender distribution of the top 1,000 YouTube channel creators‚Äîindividuals only (n=722) H2: Women are less visible than men in popular YouTube videos. From the list of the top 1,000 channels, the top 100 most successful channels produced by individuals were analysed in more depth. Of these top 100 channels we analysed 20 videos each, for a total of 2,000 videos, for the visibility and appearance of men, women, and non-binary persons. If we count the main protagonists appearing in these 2,000 videos, we see for every woman (979; 29%) more than two men (2,343; 69%). Only two per cent (54) of the people appearing in these videos had a non-binary gender (intersexual, transsexual, or other). Interestingly, this is a similar imbalance as we can detect in television as well (Prommer and Linke). In other categories, there is more diversity than in television: in total, 44 per cent of channel operators have a recognisable ‚Äúmigration background‚Äù, which is more commonly seen in men (49%) than in women (32%). ‚ÄúMigration background‚Äù is the official German definition of people with a foreign nationality, people not born in Germany, or having parents with these criteria. This confirms the second hypothesis, according to which women are visible in popular Web videos less often than men. H3: Women portray themselves more often in connection to stereotypically female topics or are depicted as such in videos. In the 2,000 videos from the top 100 channels, female YouTubers are primarily visible in service-oriented tutorial channels (on topics like beauty, food, and the household). Female YouTubers are predominantly represented in video blogs (vlogs: 17%), battles/challenges (16%), sketches/parodies (14%), and tutorials (11%). The haul/unboxing format, in which presenters unpack acquired products or gifts, is almost exclusively female. Men are visible in a wide array of formats such as battles/challenges (21%), sketches (17%), and vlogs (14%), including music (9%), opinions/positions (6%), interviews (2%), music parodies (3%), and question-answer formats (2%). The wide range of content produced by male YouTubers, compared to the limited range of female YouTubers, becomes even more obvious when we consider the topics of the individual videos. The results show that men engage with a variety of themes. Women‚Äôs topics, on the other hand, are limited: female YouTubers address beauty (30%), food (23%), relationships (23%), fashion and family, as well as household topics (15%). As fig. 2 shows, men present a bigger variety of topics such as music, relationships, family and fashion, and they also address politics (7%), gaming, and much more. The men‚Äôs list is significantly more comprehensive (21 topic areas instead of 15). The data thus confirm the third hypothesis, according to which female YouTubers are more often represented in popular videos with stereotypically female themes. It also becomes clear that their spectrum of topics is significantly more limited than that of male actors.  Fig. 2: Topic and subject areas of main actors by gender (3,322), statistics for all women and all men; multiple answers possible H4: Men stage themselves as professionals The following results reveal selected characteristics of the staging with which the main female protagonists portray themselves in the 2,000 videos analysed, and which we understand as an expression of professional versus non-professional ability. Female YouTubers appear predominantly in private settings, and their relationships to (almost exclusively male) partners and to their families play a larger role in their appearances than with the male protagonists. Their activities in the videos are described more frequently by the women themselves as personal passions and hobbies, and they rarely discuss their activities as connected to a career. Women talk about their passions, while men thematise their professional abilities. While fewer than a quarter of female YouTubers (22%) address their careers, almost two thirds of men (61%) do so. When looking at hobbies and passions the reverse is true: while only a third of male YouTubers (32%) mention these themes, two thirds of women (64%) create this context in their videos. Also, public spaces and professional contexts are predominantly reserved for male protagonist on YouTube. This means that women shoot their videos in what appears to be their homes or other private environments, while men are also visible in offices or other professional environments (e.g. fitness studios). The settings in which most people are visible on YouTube are private houses and apartments, where most women (71%) and more than half of male actors (57%) are shown. Settings in the public sphere, in contrast, are chosen by male YouTubers twice as often (34%) as by females. This confirms the fourth hypothesis, which states that men communicate and stage themselves as professionals in their videos, measured by the choice of public settings, references to professional activity, and thematisation of emotions. Limitations This study represents a first step toward a quantified analysis of gender portrayals on YouTube. Although a large number of channels and videos were included in the analysis, it is not a comprehensive assessment of all of the most popular videos, nor a random sampling. Limiting the scope to the most popular content necessarily excludes videos that may show alternative content but receive fewer clicks and subscribers. The content analysis does not allow conclusions to be drawn regarding the videos‚Äô actual reception among adolescents. Even though the data prove the platform‚Äôs popularity among children and young adults, the audience groups for the individual videos we analysed could not be broken down by sociodemographics. The gender-typical depictions can thus only be understood as an offering; no statements can be made as to their actual acceptance. Discussion The results show that Web videos favourited by children and young adults on the YouTube platform adopt and propagate similar role models to those that previously existed in television and film (G√∂tz et al.). Female channel operators are significantly underrepresented in the most popular videos, they are more limited in their range of topics, and they appear predominantly in and with topics with a stereotypically female connotation. Further, most of women‚Äôs (self-)portrayals take place in private settings. Here, the new Web formats have not created a change from classical depictions on television, where women are also predominantly shown in their personal and private lives. Web videos emphasise this aspect, as female actors refer often to their hobbies rather than to their careers, thus characterising their actions as less socially legitimised. This shows that in their favourite new media, too, adolescents encounter traditional gender stereotypes that steer the engagement with gender onto traditional tracks. The actual variety of gender identities and gender roles in real life is not presented in the popular YouTube videos and therefore excluded from the mainstream audience. Clearly, the interplay of the structure of YouTube, the market, and audience demand does not lead to the inclusion and visibility of alternative role models. References Casabianca, Barbara.

"2020","Digital Gender Disidentifications: Beyond the Subversion Versus Hegemony Dichotomy and Toward Everyday Gender Practices","The 21st century has seen the emergence of new practices of gender diversity that eschew a rigid gender binary and proliferate new gender labels, including ‚Äúnonbinary,‚Äù ‚Äúgenderfluid,‚Äù and ‚Äúagender.‚Äù Digital media have played a crucial role in this process as the new labels often originate and become popular in online social networks. Academic discussions on digital gender diversity suggest that the new labels either resist or reproduce the dominant gender ideology. I contribute to these discussions by challenging the subversion versus hegemony dichotomy, and by demonstrating a wide spectrum of practices of gender diversity. Drawing on six interviews with gender-diverse migrants and building on the concept of disidentification, I update the concept to include increasingly digital societies and new gender practices, challenge the dichotomous thinking about digital gender diversity, and stress the importance of cultural and media contexts for understanding how new gender labels are being practiced in everyday life.","",""

We argue that transgender subjectivity has become a part of a larger hegemonic struggle to define the purpose and modalities of contemporary politics and has become a key moment in political power struggles between hegemonic projects. We provide a detailed and closely analyzed example of how articulation allows us to parse apart the linkages through which signifiers are given meanings. We display how different political actors articulate the same signifier within diverging discourses, showing how gender identities are caught up within relations of power that seek to exclude and marginalize.","",""

Motherhood has been attributed as a determining factor of female under-employment or unequal representation in the creative industries, a problematic claim that distracts attention from operational excluding structures. The article considers why motherhood has become an identified explanation for female under-representation by considering the question: what sort of mother are we referring to when we talk of the creative worker? Revising the genealogy of literature on maternal practice from second wave up to recent concepts of neoliberal feminism, this article explores how class-based practices associated with motherhood have an influence on how all women are valued as creative workers. This is in direct contrast to men whose employment value increases following parenthood. The term ‚Äòvalue‚Äô explores how individual choices emerge in response to wider structural issues, providing a framework to consider the relationship between gender and class in the context of the neoliberal, creative industry.

"2020","Camping it up and toning it down: gay and lesbian sexual identity in media work"," By its make-up, Irish screen production is heteronormative. This can be seen in terms of output, representation and production. Accordingly, this article argues that heteronormativity is a structuring dynamic in the identities of gay and lesbian media workers. Its impacts are two-fold and somewhat contradictory. On the one hand, it results in bias and discrimination towards many media labourers, while on the other hand, heteronormativity offers gay and lesbian workers some opportunities to overcome or challenge overbearing structures wrought by heteronorms within media industries. To demonstrate this argument, we maintain that disclosure and the formation of networks play a role in the maintenance of gay and lesbian identities in media work, whereas bias and discrimination serve to other and discipline gay and lesbian media workers for not meeting heteronormative expectations. The article concludes by exploring how gay and lesbian media workers can manage and co-opt their sexual minority identity in a way that can challenge heteronormative expectations, providing a common ground in media work. Furthermore, this article builds on the growing field of Queer Production Studies by contributing towards the field‚Äôs expanding set of empirical practices and diversifying the contexts in which Queer Production Studies research takes place.

"2020","MEDICALIZED MASCULINITIES","While studies of masculinities often trace processes of either medicalization or mediatization, few interrogate masculinities at their very intersection. Doing so is the main contribution of this panel, which brings together cases that illustrate the effects these large-scale changes in digital and medical technologies have on masculinities today. Theoretically, the panel is based on the notion that society and everyday life are increasingly intertwined with and enrolled in both the logics of the health and pharmaceutical industry and in communication technology and media. Femininities have long been the subjects for the (bio)medicalizing, and conversely, up until the release of Viagra, privileged or hegemonic masculinities were left seemingly unaffected. At the same time, to understand masculinity today we must also consider how media technologies take part in the negotiation, practice, and affect of masculinities. To do so the panel presents four cases of mediatized and medicalized masculinities: Mie Birk Jensen uses analyze thousands of spam emails for their affective and normative production of virile masculinity; Tobias Raun and Michael Nebeling Petersen use ethnographic archive analysis of Youtube communities to understand peer learning and monetization of hair-loss products; and Kristian M√∏ller uses participant observation to capture the sexual intensification in an online gay drug scene.","",""
"2020","STOR(Y)ING DESMADRE ON THE INTERNET: THE POLITICS, AFFECT AND ETHICS   OF ONLINE QUEER LATIN AMERICAN CABARET ARCHIVES","In this paper I discuss my doctoral research-creation project: the design of an online archive of the community materials of a Mexico City-based queer cabaret collective active between 2006-2012, called Burlesquimeras, which I was a member of. While digital photographs and social media certainly existed in the years Burlesquimeras was active, it was before the two were seamlessly integrated (at least in the Mexican context) through the ubiquity of smartphones and unlimited data. That is, an online search of Burlesquimeras does not yield a significant collection of photographs that can be potentially culled or scrapped from social media. Most of the digital photographs and other ephemera, have been stored by its members in the mess or clutter of the homes and hard drives of the community members. Moreover, I explain a concept I coined: ‚Äústor(y)ing‚Äù. It is influenced by theoretical structures and praxes that challenge and expand notions of evidence, sources and the possibilities of historic narratives, such as Hartman‚Äôs Critical Fabulation (2008, 2019), Cowan‚Äôs Cabaret Methods (Forthcoming) and Navarrete Linares‚Äô use of Mesoamerican myth and cosmohistoria (2011, 2018). I propose that the very act of caring for these materials by their queer creators, albeit in a messy way, and precisely because it is in a messy way, is already an act of story-telling. I refer to this practice as stor(y)ing: a storage of materials that itself articulates a story.","",""

Following the conference theme, this presentation will focus on the use of online methods for documenting subcultural life, and online subculture‚Äôs ability to make life more liveable for marginalized subjects. In this project, I define ‚Äúfemme‚Äù as a queer identity that is marked by a critical and political engagement with femininity that manifests through one‚Äôs style and values. I used Ulrika Dahl‚Äôs (2011) femme-inist ethnography methodology to conceptualize a study of ‚Äúone‚Äôs own community.‚Äù In this presentation, I will focus on key findings about femme memes and online femme networks. My research demonstrates that through a study of a subculture‚Äôs memes, we can come to learn much about the group‚Äôs values, norms, and boundaries. Memes allow individuals to see one‚Äôs self, identity, or experiences reflected, or be ‚Äúin on the joke.‚Äù Femmes recognize the experiences specific to femme subjectivity (ie. femme invisibility) communicated through memes and feel a sense of connection with one another. In addition, my research offers further evidence of the value of online communities for marginalized subjects. The femmes in my study used online connections to combat geographical isolation, create intergenerational bonds, and even find a reason to stay alive. My research shows that the technological affordances of Instagram continue to make online communities valuable. In addition, online methods are valuable tools to develop deeper insight into existing subcultures, especially those that are marginalized in more mainstream and/or public arenas.","",""

"2020","Data for queer lives: How LGBTQ gender and sexuality identities challenge norms of demographics"," In this article, we argue that dominant norms of demographic data are insufficient for accounting for the complexities that characterize many lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ, or broadly ‚Äúqueer‚Äù) lives. Here, we draw from the responses of 178 people who identified as non-heterosexual or non-cisgender to demographic questions we developed regarding gender and sexual orientation. Demographic data commonly imagines identity as fixed, singular, and discrete. However, our findings suggest that, for LGBTQ people, gender and sexual identities are often multiple and in flux. An overwhelming majority of our respondents reported shifting in their understandings of their sexual identities over time. In addition, for many of our respondents, gender identity was made up of overlapping factors, including the relationship between gender and transgender identities. These findings challenge researchers to reconsider how identity is understood as and through data. Drawing from critical data studies, feminist and queer digital media studies, and social justice initiatives like Data for Black Lives, we call for a reimagining of identity-based data as ‚Äúqueer data‚Äù or ‚Äúdata for queer lives.‚Äù We offer also recommendations for researchers to develop more inclusive survey questions. At the same time, we address the ways that queer perspectives destabilize the underlying logics of data by resisting classification and ‚Äúcapture.‚Äù For marginalized people, the stakes of this work extend beyond academia, especially in the era of algorithms and big data when the issue of who is or is not ‚Äúcounted‚Äù profoundly affects visibility, access, and power in the digital realm.

"2020","Soft Femme Theory: Femme Internet Aesthetics and the Politics of ‚ÄúSoftness‚Äù"," Twenty years ago, the figure of the femme appeared on a book cover wielding a knife; more recently, the femme has appeared on Instagram crying in a Polly Pocket skirt. Online, femme is increasingly called ‚Äútender,‚Äù ‚Äúradically vulnerable,‚Äù and ‚Äúsoft.‚Äù In this article, I examine soft femme digital culture on Instagram, and argue that the discourse of ‚Äúsoftness‚Äù is used to articulate belonging and to resist neoliberal, masculinist logics. Through an analysis of Instagram images and interviews with femmes, I develop an understanding of softness as a combination of emotionality, vulnerability, relationality, and hyperfemininity. I argue that soft femme is an aesthetic form and a theoretical position that expands the category of femme to be more inclusive of diverse subjects. Soft femme theory fills the gaps in femme theory left by critiques of existing femme identity theory that centers performance, irony, and the figure of the hard femme. Through the discourse of softness, femme becomes something one can be like, rather than something one just looks like. ","",""
"2020","From ‚ÄúMine‚Äù to ‚ÄúOurs‚Äù: Gendered Hierarchies of Authorship and the Limits of Taylor Swift‚Äôs Paratextual Feminism","AbstractThis article analyzes paratextual strategies deployed by Taylor Swift in her transition from country to pop in the context of her articulation of her authorship as a female songwriter. This was a transition complicated by the gendered hierarchies of pop music, wherein male producers carry significant discursive weight. The article frames the ‚ÄúVoice Memos‚Äù included with her 2014 album 1989 as a form of paratextual feminism, reiterating the authenticity she developed as a country star and pushing back against claims her collaboration with male producers like Max Martin and Ryan Tedder threaten her autonomy as a female voice in the music industry. However, the article goes on to consider how these and other paratextual feminisms are inherently tied to neoliberal values of post-feminism, demonstrating that their potential as a gendered critique of the media industries is limited by the lack of actualization within Swift‚Äôs broader star text and industry practice.","",""

Through the memories of 29 activists who were involved in the LGBT political movement of the time, this article explores how LGBT communities used potentially harmful media stereotypes to their own advantage and how they worked to purposefully manage their representation as well as media production. Activists depended on diagnostic, prognostic, and motivational framing to amplify, extend, bridge, and transform what it meant to be LGBTQ in New Zealand. At the time, the media represented a very mainstream, and conservative, vision of the LGBT community. The media frames and media representations used at the time were systematic processes to reaffirm intended realities of social, economic and political power. The early work of these activists managed to change their intended reality through dogged determination.","",""

This exploration is followed by a content analysis of the series starring and produced by Frances McDormand, which tells the story of a middle-class teacher in her senior years. Through the application of a gender perspective, contributions from ageing studies or age studies, and an examination of the professional context in which the series was made, this study offers a critical reading both of the process of portraying older women in film and television productions and of their role in the industry; this series is particularly interesting for the dialogue it establishes between the actor/producer‚Äôs biography and the story of the character she portrays.","",""

"2021","Swapping Gender is a Snap(chat)","In May 2019 the photographic cellphone application Snapchat released two company-generated image filters that were officially dubbed ‚ÄúMy Twin‚Äù and ‚ÄúMy Other Twin,‚Äù though users and media labeled them as feminine and masculine, respectively. While touted in most commentary as a ‚Äúgender swap‚Äù feature, these digital imaginaries represent a unique opportunity to consider what features contribute to classification of faces into binary gender buckets. After all, the commonly considered ‚Äúmale‚Äù filter makes various modifications‚Äîincluding a broader jaw and addition of facial hair‚Äîto whichever face is selected in the photograph. It does not ask and cannot detect if that face belongs to a man or woman (cis- or transgender) or to a non-binary individual. Instead, the augmented reality that it offers is a preprogrammed algorithmic reinscription of reductive gendered norms. When interacting with a novel face, humans similarly implement algorithms to assign a gender to that face. The Snapchat ‚ÄúMy Twin‚Äù filters‚Äîwhich are not neutral, but rather human-designed‚Äîoffer an analyzable projection of one such binarization, which is otherwise rarely articulated or visually recreated. Here I pair an ethnographic exploration of twenty-eight transgender, non-binary, and/or gender diverse individuals‚Äô embodied experiences of facial gender legibility throughout life and with digital distortion, with a quantitative analysis of the ‚ÄúMy Twin‚Äù filter facial distortions, to better understand the role of technology in reimaginations of who and what we see in the mirror.","",""
"2021","Gender of the Interface","For many cosmopolitan urban Germans and Europeans in Berlin in the late 2000s, social media platforms were a site where gender and class were enacted through articulations of emergent nerd masculinity or hip, ironic femininity. But these platforms, such as Facebook or Pinterest, encoded normative assumptions about masculinity and femininity in their visual and interaction design, excluding women and acceptable femininity as subjects of technological expertise. Sites that presented themselves as neutral spaces for connection and interaction, like Twitter or Facebook, instantiated gendered understandings of technology that rendered public space implicitly masculine, white, and middle class. Visually based sites like Pinterest and Etsy, in contrast, were marked as domains of feminine domesticity, representing not only a shift to visual communication but to visual modes of interaction that structured gender online. Although many young people resisted hegemonic notions of gender, their social media practices stabilized their class status as aspiring urban cosmopolitans. In this article, I consider how gender and class stabilized temporarily through material-semiotic engagements with technology interfaces.","",""
"2021","Beyond ‚ÄúCommercial Realism‚Äù: Extending Goffman‚Äôs Gender Display Framework to Networked Media Contexts","Abstract                Erving Goffman‚Äôs gender display framework is a typology of nonverbal posing codes that connote the subordination of women in commercial imagery and a prominent tool for assessing visualizations of gender stereotyping in mass media. Researchers have recently begun to apply the advertisement-based framework to a new context: user-generated social media photos. Despite findings that gender display appears prevalent in such images, deeper critical examinations of how the framework changes when applied across media contexts have not been meaningfully undertaken. Drawing from the interplay of Goffman‚Äôs concepts of hyper-ritualization and commercial realism, I argue that the manifestations and interpretive implications of gender display are contingent upon the standard of realism at play, proposing a standard of networked realism that differently modulates gender display in user-generated photography. Ultimately, I suggest that gender display must be more thoroughly contextualized in networked media research and provide a groundwork for future feminist studies of visual gender stereotyping.","",""

In this study, we interviewed 20 transgender social media users to examine transgender identity management across the social media ecosystem. We found that transgender social media users curate their social media experiences to fit their needs through creating accounts on different platforms, maintaining multiple accounts on individual platforms, and making active decisions about content they post, networks they are connected to, and content they interact with. In this way, transgender people‚Äôs social media curation is not limited to their own identity presentations, but also involves curating the content they see from others and whom they include in their networks. Together, these two types of online curation enable transgender social media users to craft social media worlds that meet their social and self-presentational needs. ","",""

Research shows how this effect leads to a particular treatment of gender in computer systems development, a treatment which lags far behind the rich understanding of gender that social studies scholarship reveals and people across society experience.¬†Many people do not relate to the narrow binary gender options of male or female, and many people express their gender identity in much richer ways than the sex/gender binary female/woman and male/man Boolean terms will allow. We ask:¬†are¬†‚Äúborn-digital‚Äù¬†gendered datasets¬†in¬†digital systems experienced as¬†marginalising¬†by¬†those who express their identity beyond the male/female binary? Case Study: Ireland.

"2022","‚ÄòThis app can help you change your voice‚Äô: Authenticity and authority in mobile applications for transgender voice training"," Mobile applications for transgender voice training seek to help trans people alter their speaking voices, often with the goal of alignment with one or another pole of binary gender expression (i.e., voice ‚Äòfeminization‚Äô or ‚Äòmasculinization‚Äô). These apps offer instruction, audio tools and feedback mechanisms that allow users to record, evaluate and track their progress relative to a desired ‚Äì and gendered ‚Äì goal.

In the following paper, we undertake a critical discourse analysis of five mobile voice training apps for transgender people. We find that rather than offering expansive or open-ended conceptions of gender, these apps reproduce ideals of gender as not only binary but also white, affluent and able-bodied. We also offer a critique of the apps‚Äô characterization of transition as reifying the normative authority of clinical and technoscientific knowledge and conditioning ‚Äòauthenticity‚Äô on an ability to conform to (racialized, classed and ableist) binary gender norms.

"2022","Subverted agency: The dilemmas of disempowerment in digital practices"," A common view is that marginalized groups benefit substantially from strategic use of digital technologies. An intersectionality perspective, however, suggests that these outcomes may vary depending on individuals‚Äô social positionality. We propose the concept of ‚Äúsubverted agency‚Äù to emphasize that use of digital technologies may be personally empowering but might reinforce normative regimes contributing to sociostructural marginalization. We investigated digital practices of 17 online-soliciting transfeminine sex workers through semi-structured interviews in Singapore, where attitudes toward gender diversity and sex work remain conservative. We highlight three dilemmas of digital media environments, namely, presentation of gender identity and embodiment, intimate relationships characterized by persistent liminality, and competitive pressures related to authenticity of identity. The subverted agency perspective suggests that digital practices do not straightforwardly transform unequal sociostructural conditions; instead, it offers a frame to rethink inclusion by attending to contextual intersections of marginalization.

Said roundtable begins with a critical self-positioning of the participants‚Äô (inter)disciplinary and embodied locations using examples from their own research. The conversation then progresses to how these researchers have employed contemporary theories, conceptual vocabularies, methods, and analyses of gender, sexuality, and embodiment in digital spheres to then conclude with some ethico-political notes about collaborations between scholars and (digital) activists.","",""
"2023","Ayo, Bisexual Check","Introduction A 2021 listicle pronouncing ‚Äú10 Things That Are Bisexual Culture‚Äù concludes that ‚Äúclaiming that random things are ‚Äòbi culture‚Äô is the most bi-culture thing of all‚Äù (Wilber n.p.). While posed as tongue-in-cheek, the assignment of status as a signifier of bisexuality to seemingly arbitrary actions and items reinforces the notion that bi people seek a distinct visual and cultural identity and struggle to make one. We consider how creators on the algorithmically driven social media platform TikTok responded to an open-ended 2019 prompt (‚Äúayo, bisexual check‚Äù) to show off styles and accessories that project a bisexual display, and how these videos, understood collectively, contribute to the cohesion of a prototype for a bisexual social uniform. By social uniform, we refer to informally standardised clothing that identifies members of a group but lacks the bureaucratic regulation of an institutional uniform (Joseph). This lens is productive for interpreting subcultural dress norms, including those of queer identities at various scopes¬† (e.g. Nelson, ‚ÄúHere‚Äù; Stines). The development of these social uniforms can allow for stronger group coherence and provide individuals with ‚Äúself-esteem through conformity‚Äù with one‚Äôs group and ‚Äúself-regard by conflict‚Äù with other groups (Joseph 74). There is added utility to this signalling for queer people as a means to seek community and partnership against a societal backdrop of stigmatisation (Brennan). Being able to identify who is like oneself at a glance lets one know when and where one is safe to outwardly present an authentic version of oneself (Huxley and Hayfield; Rostosky et al.; Wang and Feinstein). Bisexual communities notably lack such a uniform (Hayfield, Bisexual; Hayfield, ‚ÄúInvisibility‚Äù; Hayfield, ‚ÄúNever‚Äù; Hayfield and Wood; Huxley et al.). While bi people have expressed interest in having a distinct, coherent aesthetic or set of visual markers to express their bisexuality and recognise others as specifically bisexual, they have encountered obstacles towards the establishment of such a bi uniform (Madison, ‚ÄúRepresenting‚Äù; Nelson, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù). The conception of homosexuality and heterosexuality as a binary leaves little room for the notion of bisexuality at all (Nelson, ‚ÄúHere‚Äù). In instances when people do attempt to stake a claim to a specifically bisexual visual identity, the result tends to be read binaristically nonetheless (Daly et al.; Hartman; Hayfield, Bisexual; Morgan and Davis-Delano; Nelson, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù). Attempts to visually ‚Äúsplit the middle‚Äù of established gay and straight styles have thus historically failed, with onlookers (even bisexual onlookers) either assuming the bi person in question is gay or straight (Hartman). Rosie Nelson goes so far as to contend that ‚Äúthe body of the bisexual is incapable of declaring itself outwardly bisexual to a monosexist society‚Äù (‚ÄúHere‚Äù 87). In other words, Nelson argues that a distinctly bi visual identity‚Äîa bi social uniform‚Äîmay be impossible so long as bisexuality remains invisible in broader discourses of sexual orientation and that only improved or increased representations of bisexuality in media, law, research, and culture can foment the conditions for bisexual visibility in the most literal sense (‚ÄúHere‚Äù). TikTok‚Äôs Bisexual Displays Within this context of binary assumptions of gender and sexual orientation, Julie Hartman-Linck conceived the ‚Äúbisexual display‚Äù (Hartman 39). By analogy with gender display as theorised by Lorber and building on Goffman‚Äôs construction of identity performance, the bisexual display refers to attempts to project a bisexual identity ‚Äúusing the accoutrements of gender, as well as more direct visual and verbal cues‚Äù (Hartman 43). Bisexuality is discursively erased, and even seemingly straightforward attempts to make bi identities known are often misconstrued by observers, either through ignorance (e.g., unfamiliarity with the significance of the bi pride flag) or through willful disbelief (e.g., doubt in the authenticity of bisexuality / the bisexual; see Alarie and Gaudet). Therefore, analysis of bisexual display focusses on the intended effect of the performer rather than on the actual understandings of their audiences: bisexual display offers a productive theoretical lens through which to consider how a bisexual identity is intentionally fashioned, even if attempts to fashion the bisexual identity may be misunderstood or ignored. Emiel Maliepaard, in his research on bisexual geographies, argues that bisexual spaces are ‚Äútemporal, local and (often) unplanned‚Äù (47). We identified one such space on TikTok, an algorithmically driven video-centric social media platform. TikTok affords creators a great deal of power to respond to and remix other creators‚Äô content, most prominently with the ‚Äúuse this sound‚Äù function which lets creators incorporate audio either originating from or used in another video (colloquially a TikTok) into their own (Abidin and Kaye). The memetic process of (re)using a sound with some amount of variation generates a constituency of creators and other users whose participation in the video creation and engagement process aligns with what Zulli and Zulli theorised as TikTok‚Äôs imitation publics: ‚Äúa collection of people whose digital connectivity is constituted through the shared ritual of content imitation and replication‚Äù (1882). These imitation publics in turn may spawn these temporal, local, and unplanned spaces, including virtual bisexual spaces. Here, we conducted a content analysis of 50 short videos posted in 2019 with over 1,000 likes using the ‚Äúayo, bisexual check‚Äù (‚ÄúABC‚Äù) sound, which was first uploaded in late March 2019. The originator of the sound posted a video of themselves saying ‚Äúayo, bisexual check‚Äù and then showing off certain elements of clothing and reifying or countering certain stereotypes about bi identity. When other creators subsequently began to use the sound and associated format to do the same, they constituted the ‚ÄúABC‚Äù sound‚Äôs imitation public. While there are multiple possible ways creators might have understood the prompt of a ‚Äúbisexual check‚Äù (e.g., as encouraging them to dress in a way that projects their own bisexuality; to dress in a way that projects bisexuality most legibly to other bisexual or nonbisexual people; to dress in a way that feels most comfortable to them, as a bisexual; etc.), the intention behind these videos can be understood broadly to display some bisexual identity. The simple and direct nature of the prompt (‚Äúbisexual check‚Äù) generates the virtual ‚Äúbisexual space‚Äù, both ‚Äúhighly temporal and specific‚Äù (Maliepaard 59). This space both offers an open-ended venue for creators to engage with a culture of visual identity, and maximises the potential for audiences to read what transpires in the videos as demonstrative (if not constitutive) of bisexual identity. By creating these TikToks, users are not waiting for more or better bisexual representation on TikTok but instead are actively embodying it, responding to the need identified by Nelson. Elements of the Bisexual Check At the broadest level, creators in the 50 sampled videos primarily showcased discrete fashion elements or accessories, rather than entire outfits. The structure of ‚ÄúABC‚Äù TikToks allowed creators to draw attention to specific pieces of clothing, jewelry, haircuts and styles, makeup looks, and ways of fashioning clothes (see fig. 1 for an example). This mode of engaging with the ‚Äúbisexual check‚Äù challenge differs from the mode of engagement we saw in videos using the ‚ÄúABC‚Äù sound posted after 2019; while onscreen text, closed captions, and video descriptions in TikToks posted in 2019 were primarily in English, text in videos posted in 2020 and later was mostly in Tagalog. This suggested that 2019 and post-2019 TikToks emerged from distinct and separate cultural contexts; despite using the same ‚ÄúABC‚Äù sound, they represented different imitation publics. The post-2019 videos tended to show their creators posing for one or several shots without focussing on particular elements of their outfits, instead displaying their looks as a whole. The later videos offer a useful variation in memetic content and stance (Shifman), a contrast which permits us to understand the 2019 ‚ÄúABC‚Äù videos as attempts to display bisexuality chiefly through discrete visual markers (e.g., fashion elements).  Fig. 1: A screencap from the authors‚Äô mocked-up ‚ÄúABC‚Äù TikTok in which the creator uses a fingergun to showcase their cuffed jeans. Studies of bi people in the past two decades (almost all of which have been about bi women; see Clarke et al., though see Rogers for a recent exception) have identified several ways bi subjects attempt to make their bisexuality known in the face of overwhelming invisibility. Hayfield summarised research about bi women‚Äôs fashion, documenting styles that are ‚Äúfunky, flamboyant, or associated with alternative looks and looking (e.g., hippie, Goth, punk, and so on) including through piercings and tattoos‚Äù (‚ÄúInvisibility‚Äù 180). Hartman-Linck recorded bi women using bumper stickers, pride flags and pride flag iconography, pins, and jewelry using the pink-purple-blue bi pride flag design, as well as a general playfulness with specific gendered markers (Hartman). Madison likewise found bi people using the bi pride flag design and colours on clothes and jewelry, as well as bi-specific iconography like the biangles (overlapping pink and blue triangles that generate a smaller purple triangle between them), interlocking Mars and Venus signs (‚ö§), and pun-based symbols like the ‚Äúbisexuwhale‚Äù (‚ÄúRepresenting‚Äù 151‚Äì3). More recently, the Internet has been a fruitful venue for discussions among bisexuals about a visual culture (Madison, ‚ÄúBisexual‚Äù); discourse among bisexual people on social media sites like Twitter and Tumblr has generated some seemingly novel styles and fashions that have been highlighted as specifically bi looks. A 2017 tweet about jeans cuffed at the ankles (see fig. 1) and baggy shirts tucked in at the waist being ‚Äúbisexual culture‚Äù has been mentioned in numerous popular news articles and blogs (e.g., Cao; Wilber). A Tumblr post from around the same time with images of three fictional characters sporting neck-length hairstyles cut straight at the bottoms appears to have been the genesis of the ‚Äúbisexual bob‚Äù, a bob haircut worn by a bi person (usually a woman) that received similar coverage and discussion to the cuffed jeans and tucked-in shirts tweet (e.g., Locke; Vandervalk; Wilber). Other items identified in listicles as constituting ‚Äúbi culture‚Äù include: being unable to sit in chairs ‚Äúcorrectly‚Äù, dyed pink hair, puns, Converse brand shoes, plaid shirts, outer space, (excessive) use of the bi pride flag and colours, and anxiety disorders. Within our sample, we identified an uptake of these nascent bi fashions, with 62% of videos featuring clothing being cuffed (most frequently jeans), 36% of videos highlighting shirts tucked into pants, and 20% of videos demonstrating bi bobs. More explicit iconography like bi pride flags and colours (what Hartman-Linck referred to as ‚Äúsign equipment‚Äù in her conceptualisation of bisexual display) appeared in 16% of videos, compared to more general rainbow iconography, which showed up in 20% of them (Hartman). Button-down shirts appeared in 34% of videos, and both floral print shirts and Converse shoes appeared in 18% of the total corpus. Nose piercings actively contributed to the ‚Äúbisexual check‚Äù in 12% of sampled TikToks, while a full-body dress appeared in just one video (2%). We identified no instances of biangles, interlocking Mars and Venus signs, or punny sign equipment. Display Becoming Prototype, Prototype Becoming Uniform Interpreting ‚ÄúABC‚Äù videos as bisexual displays on the individual level and conceptualising the community of ‚ÄúABC‚Äù creators and engagers as an imitation public allows us to understand the process taking place as social identity work, ‚Äúthe construction of identities for groups of people‚Äù (Eschler and Menking 2). Eschler and Menking (drawing upon Donath as well as Schwalbe and Mason-Schrock) argued that for social identities (like bisexuality), certain memes can offer prototypes: ‚Äúa set of minimal social cues that a person can use to infer other information about an individual‚Äôs social world‚Äù (9). Similarly, Joseph argued that for any complex of sartorial meaning, there is a minimal symbol: ‚Äúthe least symbol necessary to suggest a uniform‚Äù (24). By their nature, prototypes (or minimal symbols) will be limited to the fewest key elements required to demarcate a social identity. TikTok creators have the capacity to share their own ‚Äúbisexual checks‚Äù with the ‚Äúuse this sound‚Äù feature or duet other creators‚Äô videos to mirror or counter elements of the original creators‚Äô checks in their own lives. Further, even if not posting their own ‚ÄúABC‚Äù content, users have the ability to share, comment on, and like TikToks to engage with a creator‚Äôs bisexual display. Each new ‚ÄúABC‚Äù video accomplishes what Rogers identified in his research on images of bi men on Instagram: they ‚Äúadd to a discourse and visual culture of bisexuality that both describes and prescribes the visual forms in which bisexuality appears‚Äù (366). Each contribution introduces a new, or more likely reifies an existing (if nascent) indicator of a bisexual identity. It is no surprise, then, that visual indicators that had already garnered some popular support within online bisexual spaces (bi bobs, cuffed jeans, tucked-in shirts) were among the most common in our sample. Still, a fashion choice having already entered the bisexual public consciousness does not solely explain why it recurred in our sample while other choices and items mentioned in listicles did not. The userbase of creators who tend to achieve virality on TikTok skews young, white, wealthy, and female (Boffone; Kennedy), so styles favoured by bi people who share at least some of these identities (e.g., white teen or twentysomething girls and women with personal or familial wealth) are likely to recur more frequently and receive increased engagement from the broader TikTok userbase, which also skews young and female (Cyca). Anecdotally, this demographic picture of TikTok mirrored our sample, suggesting that markers posited by creators and received by users were most likely to reflect the tastes and norms of young, white, and female creators. Indeed, one of the few nonwhite ‚ÄúABC‚Äù creators was the only person in our sample to use the sound to argue against the core premise of the videos, contending that all one needed to be bisexual was attraction to people of multiple genders rather than any of the specific visual markers posed by others in the sample. While a universal ‚Äúbisexual check‚Äù is suggested by the sparse wording of the challenge, the resulting videos nonetheless demonstrate a specific racially, temporally, and culturally positioned understanding of bi identity. Just because anyone has the capacity to contribute their own vision of the ‚Äúbisexual check‚Äù does not mean that all ‚ÄúABC‚Äù videos will land with equal frequency on users‚Äô For You Page feeds (TikTok‚Äôs ‚Äúhomepage‚Äù where videos are algorithmically delivered to users; see Simpson and Semaan), nor enjoy the same volume of attention from TikTok‚Äôs userbase. Eschler and Menking consider the prototype to be ‚Äúthe least common denominator‚Äù (9), meaning that users will take the few most common elements shared amongst the ‚ÄúABC‚Äù videos as symbols of a bisexual style. That the top ‚ÄúABC‚Äù videos (those we sampled) heavily skew young, white, and female means that a bi uniform emerges from elements favoured by users sharing those demographics. Our mode of investigating this sound‚Äôs videos (moving systematically through all the videos using the ‚ÄúABC‚Äù sound from most liked to less liked) does not contravene the affordances of TikTok‚Äôs platform but is somewhat outside of the app‚Äôs environment of expected use (Light et al.), which we understand to be either scrolling through the user‚Äôs For You Page or receiving and viewing TikToks messaged privately by friends. Still, users in these settings served two or more ‚ÄúABC‚Äù videos are likely to consciously or unconsciously begin to identify the prototypical elements of a bisexual look as being those shared across multiple videos: the most frequently recurring markers creators choose to share as part of their bisexual displays reify existing styles already identified as ‚Äúbi looks‚Äù or introduce new ones to the viewer. Through the continuous and repeated proposal of bisexual looks, the prototype emerges for a bisexual uniform. These accoutrements (cuffed sleeves and pantlegs, especially on jeans, bi bob haircuts, tucked-in shirts) point towards a bi uniform that is put-together and favours clothes like jeans and button-down shirts that are commonly worn across genders. That a bisexual uniform that may be comfortably worn by members of any gender follows logically from the necessity for a bi look that is both shaped by and liable to be worn by bisexuals, who may be of any gender. Further, this bi uniform emphasises alterations that may be undertaken on items commonly already held rather than distinct new pieces that must first be acquired. This may be one reason that creators favoured these styles, rather than more blatant sign equipment like pins or shirts with bi iconography on them: they were simply more likely to have jeans in their closet than a biangles T-shirt. The creators in our sample, regardless of the specific accoutrements displayed, answered Nelson‚Äôs call for increased and better bisexual representation, building one of many possible images for how bi people can fashion themselves (‚ÄúHere‚Äù). The ‚ÄúABC‚Äù imitation public‚Äôs collagic vision of a bisexual uniform may, in the future, be adapted, rejected, or serve as inspiration for others in the endlessly cyclical process of identity formation and reinforcement. Conclusion We have sought to understand what TikTok users have accomplished through the creation of and engagement with ‚ÄúABC‚Äù videos, both specifically (i.e., what are the predominant visual indicators across the most popular videos) and generally (i.e., what processes are taking place and how they contribute towards the establishment of a bisexual social uniform). Creators are unlikely to have set out with a larger project of developing a bi uniform in mind when posting their 15-second ‚Äúayo, bisexual check‚Äù videos, but as part of one of TikTok‚Äôs innumerable imitation publics, their personal bisexual displays nonetheless offer prototypes for what a bisexual uniform could be. Any single ‚ÄúABC‚Äù video is an example of a creator using TikTok‚Äôs affordances to respond individually to an open-ended prompt, but taken collectively, a consensus about the least common denominators for a bisexual uniform begins to emerge. Whether this online effort to cohere bisexual style results in bi people being able to identify one another (and/or be identified by nonbisexuals) remains to be seen, but we hope this article provides both a useful record of styles favoured by bisexuals on TikTok in 2019 and a productive explanation of the way individual posts in TikTok‚Äôs ecosystem of imitation publics may begin to constitute a social uniform for a community whose members have historically lacked one.

"2023","EXPLORING THE CURRENT LANDSCAPE OF TRANS TECHNOLOGY DESIGN","Transgender people face substantial challenges in the world, such as discrimination, harassment, and lack of access to basic resources. Some of these challenges could be addressed to some extent with technology. In this paper I examine the world of trans technology design through interviews with 115 creators of trans technologies: apps, games, health resources, and other types of technology. I demonstrate that trans technology design processes are often deeply personal, and focus on the technology creator‚Äôs needs and desires. Thus, trans technology design can be empowering because technology creators have agency to create tools they need to navigate the world. However, in some cases when trans communities are not involved in design processes, this can lead to overly individualistic design that speaks primarily to more privileged trans people‚Äôs needs.","",""
"2023","Amplification and the limits of visibility: Complicating strategies of trans voice and representations on social media"," In this article, we explore how the concepts of listening and voice influence trans communication and how communicators give voice to their identities and lived experiences through the communication work they perform. We examine amplification as a strategy for elevating historically marginalized voices within institutional and mediated spaces. Through interviews with trans communicators, findings reveal gaps that strategies of visibility leave unfilled, drawing attention to symbolic and material resources that are needed for generating effective change. We find that visibility-based strategies, such as amplification, can be instrumental in producing an inequitable distribution of power and exacerbating the burden of representation that complicates transgender communicators‚Äô ability to navigate organizational politics.

"2023","Silencing Tactics: Pronoun Controversies in a Community Questions and Answers Site","Understanding how and why online professional knowledge sharing communities develop issues with gender inclusion is essential to building safe and respectful environments. Trans and nonbinary gender identities are under constant threat and scrutiny, and trans people frequently face harms in online environments. Through digital ethnography, I explore how an international online programming community, Stack Exchange, responded to the challenges of implementing trans and nonbinary inclusive language policies. I discuss the rhetorical strategies and silencing tactics deployed by the community in response to policy changes. The analysis draws on Dotson‚Äôs concept of testimonial smothering to argue that epistemic violence prevents dialogue about the importance of respecting preferred pronouns. The paper concludes with reflections on the implementation of pronoun policies in international communities.","",""
"2023","‚ÄúShe is as feminine as my mother, as my sister, as my biologically female friends‚Äù: On the promise and limits of transgender visibility in fashion media","AbstractAs transgender media representation continues to gain traction, trans scholars and activists have contended with the double-edged sword of visibility: while trans visibility has the potential to familiarize cisgender audience with trans experiences, it also risks reinforcing normative ideas about gender expression. Taking fashion media as a case study, I look at trans representation between 2013 and 2020 in the print editions of U.S.-based fashion publications Vogue, Harper‚Äôs Bazaar, and Women‚Äôs Wear Daily. I argue that trans representation in fashion magazines produces competing discourses about trans identity as simultaneously conforming to gender norms and subverting the gender binary. Further, fashion magazines employ a neoliberal logic of visibility and self-empowerment, positioning trans individuals‚Äîparticularly trans women of color‚Äîas exceptional figures and role models. Finally, I find a recent shift towards a social justice framework as trans activists of color are given greater voice in the pages of fashion magazines.","",""

"2024","Combining motherhood and work in the creative industries: Mothers have the problem"," This article examines film and television workers‚Äô experience of mothering in Ireland and argues that not only are mothers constructed as a ‚Äòproblem‚Äô in these Creative Industries workplaces because of their care work duties, but the ‚Äòproblem‚Äô of work‚Äôs incompatibility with motherhood is presented as one to be ‚Äòsolved‚Äô by mothers themselves. Drawing from the scholarship on motherhood in film and television work and 12 interviews with workers in the film and television Creative Industries sectors who are mothers, we undertake a thematic analysis to uncover common experiences and insights that are reflective of but depart in some ways from the literature. We identify four themes that suggest that motherhood remains Othered in film and television work and that balancing care work and motherhood remains a form of additional labour that mothers (almost exclusively) must undertake: managing pregnancy at work; maternity leave and the return to work; care for children while working; and mothers‚Äô finding solutions.

"2024","A queer kind of dwelling: Digital throwness and existential security among sexual minorities in Russia"," This article asks what it means to habituate a queer orientation in a world permeated by digital connectivity. In doing so, it takes media phenomenology away from the mundane towards the momentous, drawing on queer phenomenology, and existential media studies. Using life-narrative interviews with sexual minorities in Russia, the article sheds light on the ‚Äúwork of queer habituation‚Äù in a straight world, and the contemporary significance of digital media technologies within this process. Digital media‚Äôs ability to multiply space is defined a key feature which offers sites to ‚Äústay with‚Äù the disorienting experience of queer dispositions. Through longer periods of discrete ‚Äúqueer digital dwelling,‚Äù individuals who have been associating their queer desires with ontological threats are able to find space for existence and existential security. By locating others in close proximity, some are also allowed to appropriate local territory in ways that make it more livable. ","",""
"2024","‚ÄúYou Could Hear a Hair Pin Drop‚Äù: Queer Utopianism and Informal Knowledge Production in the <i>Gaylor</i> Closeting Conspiracy Theory"," Rumors about Taylor Swift‚Äôs sexuality have persisted since the early days of her career. They have coalesced into an online subculture known as ‚ÄúGaylor.‚Äù Gaylor is a novel kind of conspiracy theory known as a ‚ÄúCloseting Conspiracy Theory‚Äù (CCT). CCTs involve speculating about a public figure‚Äôs sexuality, gathering pertinent evidence, and producing fan knowledges, often informally, on social media. Like shipping and slash fiction (which they often involve) CCTs are largely feminized. Through a qualitative content analysis of 200 TikTok videos, this article situates Gaylor as a CCT that has developed into a kind of knowledge culture. Analyzing this knowledge culture using Emily Coccia‚Äôs notion of too-close reading and Jos√© Mu√±oz‚Äôs queer utopianism reveals specialized practices of knowledge production, including informal boundary work. As Gaylors get ‚Äútoo close‚Äù to Swift‚Äôs star text, triangulating lyrics and music videos with images and videos from Swift‚Äôs life, they produce folk literary criticism. Mu√±oz‚Äôs queer utopianism saturates Gaylor discourses, with many Gaylors engaging in a specific type of conspiracy-inflected queer utopianism: the doomsday coming-out. The doomsday coming-out pushes the date of the Swift‚Äôs purported coming out back further and further after each anticipated album or music video release, not unlike the date of the apocalypse in a doomsday cult. Ultimately, the function of producing CCT knowledge in the Gaylor community is propelled forward by imagining queer futures, reflecting on personal identity, building community, and pushing back against heterosexist consensus.

However, literature shows that in South Africa there are more people migrating internally than those migrating into South Africa from other countries. In this article, I draw on 15 interviews with BlackQueers who moved from rural to urban areas in South Africa to explain their Queer-centric motivations for migrating internally, which enabled them to ‚Äúconfront what it means to be Queer‚Äù through physical and digital interactions. The digital world is important because it surpasses fixed geographies. Digital spaces offer a refuge that may not be available in offline spaces even when there are legal protections that state that this should not be the case. This article provokes transnational scholarship to pay equal attention to movements within countries and digital spaces as it does to cross-country flows.","",""

Affinity groups, including those designed to support LGBTQ employees, have become a regular feature of most Fortune 500 companies. These groups seek to represent the interests of particular employee audiences, while also helping the company to advance its profit-driven goals. Drawing on interviews with queer professionals working for multinational technology companies, I signpost the promises and limitations of LGBTQ activism when it becomes (re)located within the context of a corporation.","",""
"2024","Transnational queer cultures and digital media: an introduction","Abstract                Queer cultures have long been transnational and in times of rapid technological advancements, large migration flows, and intense cross-cultural exchanges, queer connections are evolving in new forms and meanings. These developments occur at the intersection of various intertwined geopolitical scales: urban, regional, national, continental, and global, as well as physical and digital. This introduction synthesizes various theoretical and methodological discussions to highlight the ambivalences of contemporary queer cultures, focusing on their intrinsic transnational and digital conditions. The authors contributing to this issue demonstrate that understanding queer cultures in the digital age requires examining the roles of various actors, including big tech employees, online platform volunteers, queer influencers, audiences, and migrants. They also highlight how queer digital cultures transcend national borders and challenge oppositional binaries, such as local vs. global and the West vs. the Rest, all while maintaining a critical perspective on the ambivalences of digitality.","",""
"2024","Glitchy transnationalism: When queer migrants meet the state online","Abstract                Drawing on ethnographic research I conducted between May 2022 and January 2024 with queer migrants in Athens, Greece, I offer the conceptualization of ‚Äúglitchy transnationalism‚Äù as a corrective to the transnational promise of queer digital media‚Äîthe notion that these platforms can seamlessly facilitate connections across national boundaries among queer individuals (e.g., Grindr). I explore how this promise falters for two queer migrant individuals, Ziri and Tilila‚Äîboth of whom I interpret as encountering two glitches. I argue that understanding these perceived transnational ‚Äúfailures‚Äù as glitches showcases the interplay of factors such as legal status, migrancy, race, sexuality, and gender identity in shaping the lived realities of queer migrants within transnational digital spaces. Ultimately, this research underscores the relationship between state dynamics and digital media in the lives of queer migrants, urging scholars to adopt a lens that recognizes glitches as diagnostic of power dynamics within queer digital realms.","",""

Practices of gender representation within a transnational online community","Abstract                The continuing digitization and datafication that our society is undergoing are having a significant impact on our daily lives, giving rise to new possibilities but also entailing significant risks for people who are discriminated against or marginalized. Queer communities are particularly affected by these processes; therefore, it is crucially relevant to research transnational digital projects that involve them. In the Wikidata Gender Diversity (WiGeDi) project, we are looking at practices of gender representation in the Wikidata knowledge base, a collaborative online project managed by a worldwide community. Working from the idea that gender is a complex social construct, we investigate how the Wikidata community has approached the complex issue of modeling and populating gender data, progressing from a very narrow interpretation of gender as a binary to a representation that is more inclusive of a multiplicity of gender identities.","",""

In this brief exploration, I navigate through the realms of queer African studies, African digital humanities, and African literary studies, using them as my guiding framework to uncover the digital emergence of an African transgender refugee diaspora. I suggest that this diaspora is producing content explicitly aimed back at the African continent to shape and deploy the reality of what it means to be transgender and African. In so doing, they are actively authoring themselves into existence.","",""
"2024","The Ambivalence of Mother Love: Navigating Maternal Subjects Through the TV Drama <i>A Love for Dilemma</i>"," The TV drama A Love for Dilemma (2021) has sparked widespread debates on motherhood and gender in China. This article explores the intricacy of the show‚Äôs representation of ‚Äúbad mother.‚Äù While conventional perspectives often view motherhood as a realm of private intimacy, insufficient attention has been given to the distinctiveness of Chinese-style motherhood and its intersection with family, neoliberalism, and state politics. This article addresses the importance of analyzing the televisual representation of motherhood to gain insight into how the interplay between patriarchy, the market and the state configures maternal subjectivity, particularly under the leadership of Xi Jinping. By examining the emotional meaning of motherhood produced by the TV series, this study unveils the inherent contradiction of mother love as a site of political investment. It argues that the ambivalence surrounding mother love stems from its entanglement with patriarchal expectations, the burdens of emotional labor, and the state‚Äôs vested interests. ","",""

Conservative groups have worked to frame their efforts as ‚Äúparents‚Äô rights,‚Äù common-sense restrictions on ideas and language not suitable for young audiences, starting with campaigns to keep books with sexual topics out of public school libraries. Opponents of the bans argue that eliminating access to books suppresses the voices of non-heteronormative groups. One of the most frequently banned books became an especial focus in the early 2020s, and its author‚Äôs voice featured in British stories but rarely American news. Juno Dawson and her work This Book Is Gay became a voice for other authors of banned books, but our analysis shows authors‚Äô voices are rarely heard in these stories and news outlets tend to frame the debate in somewhat predictable ways, setting opponents and ban supporters against each other with librarians caught in the middle.

In this article, we interrogate avian datafication practices and introduce Salvaging Birds, a multimodal project proposing ‚Äúqueer data surrogacy‚Äù as a method for generating ‚Äúqueer ecological data,‚Äù that is data resisting normative environmental frameworks. Here queer data surrogates were produced by creatively subverting AI toward generating speculative missing birds. Bridging critical data and archival studies with queer ecology, we argue that data logics demand examination at nonhuman sites and scales. ","",""
