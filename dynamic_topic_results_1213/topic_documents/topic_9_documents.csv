"2001","Sick Cell","                                              The mobile telephone, or cellular telephone as it is called in North America, is the fastest-growing consumer product of the past decade. [1] Despite its popularity, metaphors of risk, contamination, and illness frequently run through stories about cellphone use. These representations are based mostly on a lingering but unproven link between brain cancer and cellphone use. Despite numerous scientific studies, none have definitively ruled out the risk and none have found conclusive evidence of harm. The claim that cellphone use is potentially dangerous or downright carcinogenic is supported instead by plenty of anecdotal evidence, rumour, urban myth, and """"junk science.""""            What is interesting to me is that these different representations of cellphone use as a practice that poses relative, absolute and no risk can coexist and persist, despite obvious contradictions. I suggest that Donna Haraway's concept of breached boundaries and Ulrich Beck's notion of """"risk society"""" can be employed superficially to make sense of how we negotiate these different representations.            In order to begin a discussion about why cellphone use in North America continues to be represented as a potentially risky practice, it is necessary to mention one story that is frequently credited as being the starting point for the narrative of fear and anxiety informing these representations. In spite of its germinal status, the story is but the latest embodiment of the narrative.            It begins in August 1988 in Florida when David Reynard gave his wife Susan the gift of a cellphone. Seven months later, a medical scan revealed a tumour in Susan's brain. She claimed that as a result of being bombarded by radiation from the cellphone, the damaged cells either caused her tumour or accelerated the growth of an existing tumour. In April 1992, Susan launched a lawsuit against the phone's manufacturer, the company that provided the cellular service, and the retail store that sold the phone. A month after filing the lawsuit, Susan died of brain cancer.            In January 1993, David Reynard was interviewed on the highly-rated CNN show Larry King Live. The interview sent shockwaves through the telecommunications industry. Stock prices of the major cellphone companies fell and some subscribers cancelled their contracts and returned their phones. Spokespeople for the industry countered David's accusations with claims that electromagnetic energy is as harmless as the oxygen we breathe. In fact, they said, it is already all around us in natural and artificial forms, including in emissions from the earth and sun.            A spokesperson for Motorola, a major cellphone manufacturer, predicted that Susan's lawsuit would fail because """"thousands"""" of studies had been conducted, which proved that radiation emitted by cellphones was not dangerous to users. In fact, no such studies existed. The lie was revealed when journalists and Susan's lawyer asked to see the studies. Almost as if to make up for the lie, the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association,[2] a lobby group for North American cellular service providers, created the Wireless Research Center. Not surprisingly, the Center produced findings during its six-year mandate that were mostly favourable to the industry.            In 1995, Susan's lawsuit was dismissed by a judge who said no reliable scientific evidence had been presented to link cellphone use to cancer. Expert witnesses for the defence had argued that the evidence presented on her behalf was merely wild speculation, """"junk science,"""" and a perversion of science masquerading as real science.            Over a dozen similar lawsuits have been filed in the U.S. and the U.K. since. Few of them have surpassed Susan's lawsuit in notoriety and none have earned a favourable ruling. While it is still both mocked and venerated in the popular media and is the focus of derision in the telecom industry press and in medical science journals, the question central to the case (but does it cause cancer?) is still unresolved and so are the contradictions now associated with it.            Did Susan's own body generate her tumour or was it generated by cellphone radiation? Where is the line between junk science and real science? Is artificial radiation from a cellphone as harmless as natural radiation from the earth or sun? These questions are indicative of some of the boundary breakdowns that Haraway claims are causing disorder and contradiction in late twentieth-century Western culture, namely between human and machine, between the physical and non-physical, and between natural and artificial.            According to Beck, the degeneration of these boundaries are also indicative of a risk society characterised by environmental degradation. Because this degeneration is both perceived and potential, it hardly matters anymore what is rational or irrational, legitimate science or junk science. Both factual and fictional texts contribute to our knowledge of risks surrounding cellphone use as a biohazard that is a threat to individual bodies and to the social body.            A series of events occurring throughout the 90s in North America added to the ambiguity and mystery surrounding cellphone use. Numerous rumours circulated about the practice sparking explosions at petrol stations and causing interference with car brakes, airbags, and electric wheelchairs. In addition, Health Canada and the U.S . Food and Drug Administration issued several bulletins to alert the public that cellphone use could cause heart pacemakers, hospital monitoring equipment, and aeroplane navigational instruments to malfunction.            Susan's lawsuit ended when the court imposed closure, but the narrative embodied by the lawsuit continued in these rumours and warnings. The lawsuit was an event with a clear beginning and end. The narrative of fear and anxiety about contamination that could lead to illness, disease, and death preceded the lawsuit and was already embodied in other stories, particularly ones surrounding cancer and AIDS.            When Susan launched her lawsuit, in some media reports, the cellphone was called the """"new cancer villain"""" and the potential link between cancer and cellphone use was deemed the """"yuppies version of AIDS."""" The comparison of cellphone use to cancer and AIDS functions both as a cultural and biological metaphor. It links the practice explicitly with disease and implicitly with death, and it also recalls the narrative of fear and anxiety surrounding cancer and AIDS, two potentially fatal diseases which preceded the introduction of cellphones.            Seventeen years have passed since the cellphone became widely available in North America. Currently, almost nine million Canadians, or one in three people, own a cellphone. In the United States, there are 108 million users. Subscriptions there are increasing at the rate of approximately 46,000 each day or about one new owner every two seconds.            The recent flood of private talk in public places in North America is being represented in popular media as a contamination of the social body, a morally repugnant practice, and a menace to civil society. A moral panic has arisen over cellphone use because it allows conversations to be audible and the user to be visible where before they were inaudible and the user was invisible by virtue of being hidden away in homes, offices, and phone booths. In public places the voice of the cellphone user extends the self and claims more space, which in turn impinges on the personal space of others. It is like a stranger's unwelcome touch.            Proof that the moral panic has reached a new level in Canada may be evident in a request from the federal government last March for public opinion on whether devices known as silencers or jammers should be licensed for use so that businesses and institutions can disable cellphones within a particular radius when necessary.            As a result of the popular use of the term """"cellphone"""" in North America, a neat conflation of meaning is occurring between cellphone use as a potential threat to biological cells in the human body and the practice as a perceived threat to the physical spatial cells of personal spaces that comprise the social body.            Stories about cellphone use as hazard articulate a narrative of fear and anxiety we share that cannot simply be dismissed as absurd. How people respond to cellphone use and the health questions and moral panic surrounding it cannot be decided by medical or legal experts alone. Consequently, in a risk society characterised by a peculiar synthesis of """"empirical knowledge"""" and """"indefinite uncertainty,"""" the question """"does it cause cancer?"""" becomes irrelevant. According to Beck, it may be more useful to ask """"how do we want to live?""""                       Endnotes           [1] """"Cellphone"""" (a contraction of cellular and telephone) is the popular term for """"mobile telephone"""" in North America. """"Mobile phone"""" usually refers to car phones with an antennae mounted on the roof or window of the car.

"2001","Progress in Communication Sciences, Volume XV: Advances in Telecommunications","The latest volume in the Progress in Communication Sciences series is a welcome reminder that telephone technology—the backbone of the contemporary new media infrastructure—deserves far more attention in media research.1 In the introduction, editors Harmeet Sawhney and George Barnett lay out the ambitious goal of creating a sequel to Ithiel Pool’s seminal 1977 collection, The Social Impact of the Telephone, which has been the best work to date on the social uses and cultural context of the telephone. Chapters in the present volume are meant to overcome what the editors argue has been an overemphasis in telecommunications research on telephone regulation and pricing. The editors aim for a balance among macro-scale studies of national and international systems and institutions (such as legal systems, markets or international regimes and treaties), and micro-scale studies of telephone uses and behavior. Several chapters are particularly useful overviews of the research to date. Robert LaRose’s comprehensive and very readable account of research on personal telephone use and the chapter by the late Robert Hopper on studies of telephone conversation should both be required readings in any course on the social aspects of information and communication technologies. Harmeet Sawhney’s chapter is a theoretical discussion of sociotechnical infrastructure as embodied in telephone systems. Aharon Kellerman’s contribution, which is largely an updated synopsis of his book Telecommunications and Geography (Wiley, 1993), introduces the invaluable perspective of human geography to analyzing the spatial reach of telephone systems. This volume raises an interesting question, that is, why telecommunications generally and telephony particularly continue to be relatively neglected objects of social research, especially within the discipline of communication. Put differently, why aren’t we studying and teaching the telephone? The question is particularly puzzling given today’s popular fascination with all aspects of new media, and the inclusion of the term telecommunications in the names of a growing number of communication programs in the United States and abroad. One answer may be that telephone systems, with their uses and cultural signi cance, do not neatly  t the production–consumption framework of most traditional research on media institutions and systems. Indeed, the relatively larger body of work on telephone economics, markets, and regulation (very ably represented here in chapters by Ruby Dholakia, Robin Mansell and Edward Steinmueller, Jorge Schement, and Steven Wildman) focuses mainly on the telephone as a service to be produced and consumed, rather than as a context for complex social interactions or in terms of the meanings attributed to the telephone in everyday life and interpersonal relations. Despite recent claims to the contrary, media research still often conceals a linear model of communication at its core that is not always appropriate for studying social networks. And telecommunications surely resembles the contingent, complex topography of social networks more closely than it does the conventional model of channels piping messages to wide audiences. It is unsurprising, therefore, that a number of leading telecommunications researchers— including George Barnett and James Danowski, who have chapters in the present volume—are specialists in social network analysis. Overall, this volume is an important and wide-ranging addition to the unfortunately small library of social research in telecommunications. It may in fact help us to teach the telephone, and it deserves a wide audience.","",""
"2001","Mobile Media","With media convergence, new forms of media use have emerged: userscan enhance a media encounter by controlling the streams of informationand have the ability to interact with not only the media itself, but also thecontent provider and other users. Technical developments have alsoresulted in affordable off-the-shelf production equipment. Today it isprobably easier to set up a worldwide accessible radio station on theinternet than it is to get employment in a traditional radio station. Hencecontrol over media production is diverging and new, sometimes lesstraditional, content providers are entering the media industries. However,research on media convergence has mostly addressed stationary settings.But with the growing phenomenon of mobile information technology(IT), it is becoming increasingly important to consider mobility as adimension of media convergence and mobile media as a new researchfield.","",""
"2001","The World According to Sound"," Through the analysis of Walkman use I propose a reevaluation of the significance of the auditory in everyday experience. I argue that the role of sound has been largely ignored in the literature on media and everyday life resulting in systematic distortions of the meanings attached to much everyday behaviour. Sound as opposed to vision becomes the site of investigation of everyday life in this article. In focusing thus, I draw upon a range of neglected texts in order to provide a dialectical account of auditory and technologically mediated experience that avoids reductive and dichotomous categories of explanation. I propose a new evaluation of the relational nature of auditory experience whereby users manage their cognition, interpersonal behaviour and social space. The Walkman is perceived as a tool whereby users manage space, time and the boundaries around the self. ","",""
"2002","The mobile phone: Towards new categories and social relations1","Abstract The debate over the social use of the mobile phone has been enriched by a large amount of information and reflection as to how this instrument has modified interpersonal relations, changed roles in the family, re‐defined the limits of communicative possibilities, rewritten the present functioning of institutions such as hospitals and schools, as well as the modus operandi of criminal organizations, intensified work rhythms, rationalized the organization of work relations, in a word, how the use of the mobile has profoundly changed society.2 On the contrary, less attention has been dedicated to the reconstruction and analysis of the impulse that its users have given the mobile (see its unexpected transformation, from the king of orality to a means of writing and reading). The main thesis of this article is that the mobile is changing not only society, but above all the framework in which society lives. This framework is made up of space and time as its primary determinations, which are able to integrate, stabilize and structure reality. The mobile changes reality in its widest sense, or rather its social representation. Let us remember with McLuhan (1964), Meyrowitz (1985) and many other scholars, that the medium is not only the message, but also a specific concept of time and space, that is, a specific dimension of existence. In the following sections, above all the changes that have been brought about to space and time will be dealt with, and then how the statute of the presence and absence of individuals in social space is modified will be analysed, how the relation between modern citizens changes radically with public space, and finally how the democratic process is enriched by further implementations.","",""
"2002","In touch: Young people, communication and technologies","Abstract This paper explores the place of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the everyday lives of young people with a focus on the emergence of new and transitory cultures of sociality associated with the use of the mobile phone. It explores how differences of class and culture shape the meaning and use of mobile telephones, distinguishing between the phone as a commodity within material culture and as a medium of social capital, most apparent at the moment of leaving school. The potential of the telephone for reworking the boundaries between public and private spheres is considered, including its role as a technology of romance and of parenting. The paper suggests that mobile telephones can be understood as an individualizing technology, placing young people in the centre of social networks, yet also making them available to reciprocal obligations. There are gendered dimensions to this process with young women appearing to make the most of freedoms offered by this technology and young men emphasizing constraints. The paper cautions against investing this technology with particular characteristics suggesting that distinct potentials are realized in relation to particularities of class, age, culture and circumstance. The paper is based on a qualitative longitudinal study of young people's transitions to adulthood conducted in contrasting locations in the UK between 1999 and 2001.","",""
"2002","On the Move: Technology, Mobility, and the Mediation of Social Time and Space","The current explosion in mobile computing and telecommunications technologies holds the potential to transform """"everyday"""" time and space, as well as changes to the rhythms of social institutions. Sociologists are only just beginning to explore what the notion of """"mobility"""" might mean when mediated through computing and communications technologies, and so far, the sociological treatment has been largely theoretical. This article seeks instead to explore how a number of dimensions of time and space are being newly reconstructed through the use of mobile communications technologies in everyday life. The article draws on long-term ethnographic research entitled """"The Socio-Technical Shaping of Mobile Multimedia Personal Communications,"""" conducted at the University of Surrey. This research has involved ethnographic fieldwork conducted in a variety of locales and with a number of groups. This research is used here as a resource to explore how mobile communications technologies mediate time in relation to mobile spaces. First the paper offers a review and critique of some of the major sociological approaches to understanding time and space. This review entails a discussion of how social practices and institutions are maintained and/or transformed via mobile technologies. Ethnographic data is used to explore emerging mobile temporalities. Three interconnected domains in mobile time are proposed: rhythms of mobile use, rhythms of mobile use in everyday life, and rhythms of mobility and institutional change. The article argues that while these mobile temporalities are emerging, and offer new ways of acting in and perceiving time and space, the practical construction of mobile time in everyday life remains firmly connected to well-established time-based social practices, whether these be institutional (such as clock time, """"work time"""") or subjective (such as """"family time"""").","",""

"2002","Webcams, TV Shows and Mobile phones: Empowering Exhibitionism","The roles of visual representations have been multiplied. In contrast of being targets of the ever-increasing surveillance, people seek to play an active role in the production of images, thus, reclaiming the copyright of their own lives. In this article, three examples of this development are examined. 'Reality shows' in TV aim to create an impression of the viewer participating in crime control. Mobile phones with cameras enable individuals to become active subjects in circulating images and to participate in 'counter-surveillance'. 'Home webcams' present daily lives of individuals in the Internet, generating new subjectivities. They change the conventional code of what can or cannot be shown, and thus, expose cultural tensions surrounding epistemological conceptions of vision, gender, identities, and moralities. By revealing their intimate lives, people are liberated from shame and the 'need' to hide, which leads to something called 'empowering exhibitionism'. These deliberately produced images contest many of the conventional ways of thinking how visibility and transparency connote with power and control. To be (more) seen is not always to be less powerful. By rebelling against the shame embedded in the conception of the private, people refuse to be humble. They may gain power, but it does not head for control over others but, rather, blur and mix the lines of control. Televisualisation, cyberspace presentation, and mobile phone counter observation also raise new questions considering 'traditional' surveillance. Images can be played with, and can work as a form of resistance. Sometimes it is more radical to reveal than to hide.","",""
"2003","Mobile Organizing Using Information Technology (MOBIT)","Both at the corporate level and in the government sector, we are currently witnessing a transformation towards mobile organizing using information technology (MOBIT). The mobile technology wave is challenging the fundamentals on organizational thinking on four accounts: (1) organizational platforms that support productive and efficient collaboration and enable self-development, experimentation and innovative behaviour; (2) balancing the need for managerial control and action with privacy rights for the individual workers related to digital transactions and storage; (3) strategies for having workers and external users (i.e. customers, citizens) at home, in a satellite office, or at the headquarters/front office; and (4) knowledge creation, replication, adaptation, and utilization in organizations glued with IT.","",""
"2003","Real Time and Recall Measures of Mobile Phone Use: Some Methodological                Concerns and Empirical Applications"," This article discusses the development, reliability, and validity of real-time measures of mobile phone use by means of Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology, in comparison with traditional questionnaire-generated recall measures. The sample consisted of 211 Israeli adult mobile phone subscribers subdivided by gender and by the amount of airtime that they normally use. The measurements were applied to three questions to which the participants responded via IVR following their incoming and outgoing mobile phone calls during a five-day period: the identity of the person with whom they spoke; their location during the call; and the urgency of the call. These data were compared with recall measures obtained earlier from questionnaires. The article discusses the merits of the IVR real-time data versus those obtained from traditional recall questions asking for past or habitual behaviors. ","",""
"2004","‘mobile text’","               Mobile                   In many countries, more people have mobile phones than they do fixed-line phones. Mobile phones are one of the fastest growing technologies ever, outstripping even the internet in many respects. With the advent and widespread deployment of digital systems, mobile phones were used by an estimated 1, 158, 254, 300 people worldwide in 2002 (up from approximately 91 million in 1995), 51. 4% of total telephone subscribers (ITU). One of the reasons for this is mobility itself: the ability for people to talk on the phone wherever they are. The communicative possibilities opened up by mobile phones have produced new uses and new discourses (see Katz and Aakhus; Brown, Green, and Harper; and Plant).        Contemporary soundscapes now feature not only voice calls in previously quiet public spaces such as buses or restaurants but also the aural irruptions of customised polyphonic ringtones identifying whose phone is ringing by the tune downloaded. The mobile phone plays an important role in contemporary visual and material culture as fashion item and status symbol. Most tragically one might point to the tableau of people in the twin towers of the World Trade Centre, or aboard a plane about to crash, calling their loved ones to say good-bye (Galvin). By contrast, one can look on at the bathos of Australian cricketer Shane Warne’s predilection for pressing his mobile phone into service to arrange wanted and unwanted assignations while on tour.        In this article, I wish to consider another important and so far also under-theorised aspect of mobile phones: text. Of contemporary textual and semiotic systems, mobile text is only a recent addition. Yet it is already produces millions of inscriptions each day, and promises to be of far-reaching significance.        Txt       Txt msg ws an acidnt. no 1 expcted it. Whn the 1st txt msg ws sent, in 1993 by Nokia eng stdnt Riku Pihkonen, the telcom cpnies thought it ws nt important. SMS – Short Message Service – ws nt considrd a majr pt of GSM. Like mny teks, the *pwr* of txt — indeed, the *pwr* of the fon — wz discvrd by users. In the case of txt mssng, the usrs were the yng or poor in the W and E. (Agar 105)        As Jon Agar suggests in Constant Touch, textual communication through mobile phone was an after-thought. Mobile phones use radio waves, operating on a cellular system. The first such mobile service went live in Chicago in December 1978, in Sweden in 1981, in January 1985 in the United Kingdom (Agar), and in the mid-1980s in Australia. Mobile cellular systems allowed efficient sharing of scarce spectrum, improvements in handsets and quality, drawing on advances in science and engineering.        In the first instance, technology designers, manufacturers, and mobile phone companies had been preoccupied with transferring telephone capabilities and culture to the mobile phone platform. With the growth in data communications from the 1960s onwards, consideration had been given to data capabilities of mobile phone. One difficulty, however, had been the poor quality and slow transfer rates of data communications over mobile networks, especially with first-generation analogue and early second-generation digital mobile phones. As the internet was widely and wildly adopted in the early to mid-1990s, mobile phone proponents looked at mimicking internet and online data services possibilities on their hand-held devices. What could work on a computer screen, it was thought, could be reinvented in miniature for the mobile phone — and hence much money was invested into the wireless access protocol (or WAP), which spectacularly flopped.        The future of mobiles as a material support for text culture was not to lie, at first at least, in aping the world-wide web for the phone. It came from an unexpected direction: cheap, simple letters, spelling out short messages with strange new ellipses.        SMS was built into the European Global System for Mobile (GSM) standard as an insignificant, additional capability. A number of telecommunications manufacturers thought so little of the SMS as not to not design or even offer the equipment needed (the servers, for instance) for the distribution of the messages. The character sets were limited, the keyboards small, the typeface displays rudimentary, and there was no acknowledgement that messages were actually received by the recipient. Yet SMS was cheap, and it offered one-to-one, or one-to-many, text communications that could be read at leisure, or more often, immediately.        SMS was avidly taken up by young people, forming a new culture of media use. Sending a text message offered a relatively cheap and affordable alternative to the still expensive timed calls of voice mobile. In its early beginnings, mobile text can be seen as a subcultural activity. The text culture featured compressed, cryptic messages, with users devising their own abbreviations and grammar. One of the reasons young people took to texting was a tactic of consolidating and shaping their own shared culture, in distinction from the general culture dominated by their parents and other adults. Mobile texting become involved in a wider reworking of youth culture, involving other new media forms and technologies, and cultural developments (Butcher and Thomas).        Another subculture that also was in the vanguard of SMS was the Deaf ‘community’. Though the Alexander Graham Bell, celebrated as the inventor of the telephone, very much had his hearing-impaired wife in mind in devising a new form of communication, Deaf people have been systematically left off the telecommunications network since this time. Deaf people pioneered an earlier form of text communications based on the Baudot standard, used for telex communications. Known as teletypewriter (TTY), or telecommunications device for the Deaf (TDD) in the US, this technology allowed Deaf people to communicate with each other by connecting such devices to the phone network. The addition of a relay service (established in Australia in the mid-1990s after much government resistance) allows Deaf people to communicate with hearing people without TTYs (Goggin &amp; Newell). Connecting TTYs to mobile phones have been a vexed issue, however, because the digital phone network in Australia does not allow compatibility. For this reason, and because of other features, Deaf people have become avid users of SMS (Harper). An especially favoured device in Europe has been the Nokia Communicator, with its hinged keyboard.        The move from a ‘restricted’, ‘subcultural’ economy to a ‘general’ economy sees mobile texting become incorporated in the semiotic texture and prosaic practices of everyday life. Many users were already familiar with the new conventions already developed around electronic mail, with shorter, crisper messages sent and received — more conversation-like than other correspondence. Unlike phone calls, email is asynchronous. The sender can respond immediately, and the reply will be received with seconds. However, they can also choose to reply at their leisure. Similarly, for the adept user, SMS offers considerable advantages over voice communications, because it makes textual production mobile. Writing and reading can take place wherever a mobile phone can be turned on: in the street, on the train, in the club, in the lecture theatre, in bed. The body writes differently too. Writing with a pen takes a finger and thumb. Typing on a keyboard requires between two and ten fingers. The mobile phone uses the ‘fifth finger’ — the thumb.        Always too early, and too late, to speculate on contemporary culture (Morris), it is worth analyzing the textuality of mobile text. Theorists of media, especially television, have insisted on understanding the specific textual modes of different cultural forms. We are familiar with this imperative, and other methods of making visible and decentring structures of text, and the institutions which animate and frame them (whether author or producer; reader or audience; the cultural expectations encoded in genre; the inscriptions in technology).        In formal terms, mobile text can be described as involving elision, great compression, and open-endedness. Its channels of communication physically constrain the composition of a very long single text message. Imagine sending James Joyce’s Finnegan’s Wake in one text message. How long would it take to key in this exemplar of the disintegration of the cultural form of the novel? How long would it take to read? How would one navigate the text? Imagine sending the Courier-Mail or Financial Review newspaper over a series of text messages? The concept of the ‘news’, with all its cultural baggage, is being reconfigured by mobile text — more along the lines of the older technology of the telegraph, perhaps: a few words suffices to signify what is important.        Mobile textuality, then, involves a radical fragmentation and unpredictable seriality of text lexia (Barthes). Sometimes a mobile text looks singular: saying ‘yes’ or ‘no’, or sending your name and ID number to obtain your high school or university results. Yet, like a telephone conversation, or any text perhaps, its structure is always predicated upon, and haunted by, the other. Its imagined reader always has a mobile phone too, little time, no fixed address (except that hailed by the network’s radio transmitter), and a finger poised to respond. Mobile text has structure and channels. Yet, like all text, our reading and writing of it reworks those fixities and makes destabilizes our ‘clear’ communication. After all, mobile textuality has a set of new pre-conditions and fragilities. It introduces new sorts of ‘noise’ to signal problems to annoy those theorists cleaving to the Shannon and Weaver linear model of communication; signals often drop out; there is a network confirmation (and message displayed) that text messages have been sent, but no system guarantee that they have been received. Our friend or service provider might text us back, but how do we know that they got our text message?        Commodity       We are familiar now with the pleasures of mobile text, the smile of alerting a friend to our arrival, celebrating good news, jilting a lover, making a threat, firing a worker, flirting and picking-up. Text culture has a new vector of mobility, invented by its users, but now coveted and commodified by businesses who did not see it coming in the first place. Nimble in its keystrokes, rich in expressivity and cultural invention, but relatively rudimentary in its technical characteristics, mobile text culture has finally registered in the boardrooms of communications companies.        Not only is SMS the preferred medium of mobile phone users to keep in touch with each other, SMS has insinuated itself into previously separate communication industries arenas. In 2002-2003 SMS became firmly established in television broadcasting. Finally, interactive television had arrived after many years of prototyping and being heralded. The keenly awaited back-channel for television arrives courtesy not of cable or satellite television, nor an extra fixed-phone line. It’s the mobile phone, stupid!        Big Brother was not only a watershed in reality television, but also in convergent media. Less obvious perhaps than supplementary viewing, or biographies, or chat on Big Brother websites around the world was the use of SMS for voting. SMS is now routinely used by mainstream television channels for viewer feedback, contest entry, and program information. As well as its widespread deployment in broadcasting, mobile text culture has been the language of prosaic, everyday transactions. Slipping into a café at Bronte Beach in Sydney, why not pay your parking meter via SMS? You’ll even receive a warning when your time is up. The mobile is becoming the ‘electronic purse’, with SMS providing its syntax and sentences.        The belated ingenuity of those fascinated by the economics of mobile text has also coincided with a technological reworking of its possibilities, with new implications for its semiotic possibilities. Multimedia messaging (MMS) has now been deployed, on capable digital phones (an instance of what has been called 2.5 generation [G] digital phones) and third-generation networks. MMS allows images, video, and audio to be communicated. At one level, this sort of capability can be user-generated, as in the popularity of mobiles that take pictures and send these to other users. Television broadcasters are also interested in the capability to send video clips of favourite programs to viewers.        Not content with the revenues raised from millions of standard-priced SMS, and now MMS transactions, commercial participants along the value chain are keenly awaiting the deployment of what is called ‘premium rate’ SMS and MMS services. These services will involve the delivery of desirable content via SMS and MMS, and be priced at a premium. Products and services are likely to include: one-to-one textchat; subscription services (content delivered on handset); multi-party text chat (such as chat rooms); adult entertainment services; multi-part messages (such as text communications plus downloads); download of video or ringtones. In August 2003, one text-chat service charged $4.40 for a pair of SMS.        Pwr        At the end of 2003, we have scarcely registered the textual practices and systems in mobile text, a culture that sprang up in the interstices of telecommunications. It may be urgent that we do think about the stakes here, as SMS is being extended and commodified.        There are obvious and serious policy issues in premium rate SMS and MMS services, and questions concerning the political economy in which these are embedded. Yet there are cultural questions too, with intricate ramifications. How do we understand the effects of mobile textuality, rewriting the telephone book for this new cultural form (Ronell). What are the new genres emerging? And what are the implications for cultural practice and policy? Does it matter, for instance, that new MMS and 3rd generation mobile platforms are not being designed or offered with any-to-any capabilities in mind: allowing any user to upload and send multimedia communications to other any.        True, as the example of SMS shows, the inventiveness of users is difficult to foresee and predict, and so new forms of mobile text may have all sorts of relationships with content and communication. However, there are worrying signs of these developing mobile circuits being programmed for narrow channels of retail purchase of cultural products rather than open-source, open-architecture, publicly usable nodes of connection.

"2004","Constructing a Specific Culture: Young People's Use of the Mobile Phone as a                 Social Performance"," This paper presents the main results of an exploratory qualitative study on the functions and meanings of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in young people's everyday life. Specifically, this study concerns teenagers' cultural ways of interpreting the mobile phone and its uses, as they become part of their social world. Through their accounts and narratives about 'young people's use of the mobile phone', teenagers construct their specific cultural model of this communication technology: it is seen as a radically social performance. Insofar as it is conceived as such, the mobile phone (MP) becomes a detonator of social thinking: it provokes reflective thinking on the ethics, etiquette and aesthetics of everyday action and social life. Reflecting upon the forms of use of the mobile phone, teenagers also explore the identity-making processes involved in the presentation of oneself on a public scene. In other words, they interpret and make the uses of the MP work as a social grammar through which people are supposed to define themselves and those around them. In this sense, using an MP in a teenage-appropriate way is not a matter of technical competence; it requires larger communicative skills that are cultural knowledge of when, where, why and, moreover, how to use this technology. Interpreted in the frames of teenagers' specific culture, the uses of the MP are also a tool for constructing the main dimensions of this culture and are used as a laboratory for the development of the skills needed to become competent members of their own community.

"2004","Mobile Communication as a Social Stage"," The spread of mobile communication among Finnish teenagers has been markedly rapid during the latter half of the 1990s. Young people have created and developed a communication culture that incorporates many special features, such as a rise in the use of text-based communication channels. Teenagers’ intersecting and selective use of communication channels has generated multimedial communication. From the theoretical standpoint provided by symbolic interactionism, we can ask whether communication through new media technologies generates new forms of social interaction. If this is the case, how could we describe and analyse these new forms of interaction? The media landscapes created by teenagers serve to articulate their personal space, as well as enabling their presentation of self and defining their relationships to others. This article is based on thematic interview material, and its purpose is to analyse the meanings and use contexts of mobile communication and other multimedial communication culture among Finnish youth.

"2005","A study from a ‘rational actor’ perspective","Authors have noted that young people like to use the Internet and mobile phones for communication purposes. This paper reports results concerning use of the Internet and mobile phones for communication from a survey of 1340 English secondary schoolchildren conducted in 2002 and examines whether the use of either of these forms of communication technologies occurs at the expense of the other amongst this group. In agreement with background literature, it was found that communication via the Internet and mobile phones was popular amongst young people and small but significant positive correlations amongst the sample for measures of the use of the Internet and mobile phones for communication purposes were also discovered. This latter finding implies that these communication media are complementary rather than substitutable amongst young people. This article discusses a number of possible reasons for the popularity of the Internet and mobile phones for communication amongst young people and states that the positive correlations imply that children are ‘rational actors’ where communication via modern technology is concerned. That is, young people use the Internet and mobile phones strategically to meet different communication needs. It is concluded that as both of these forms of communication technology can be employed to achieve different purposes, the result is that neither negates the use of the other amongst this group.","",""

It investigates the importance of the mobile phone as both a communications and performance tool to Western teenagers in their formation of identity. Sociological research into the use of mobile phones by young people often neglects the domestic realm, from where a large proportion of text messages are sent. Combining theory with video data analysis of mobile phone interactions in the living room, the changing role performance of a teenager is traced as he attempts to negotiate his way to a party on a 'school night.' This video ethnography offers readings of how a mobile phone is used by a teenager to strike a 'stance-taking self' amid the contradictions of postmodern home life: the competing attentions of peer and 'family' group, the confusion of public/private spaces, conflicting household rules and moralities, and independence from and dependence on the 'family.'

Commercial mobile narratives engage audiences in a mostly one-way dialogue on the nature of the mobile world and mobile citizenship, which may be broadly viewed as people’s ability to participate in society being coupled to their access to networked ICTs.

Whether we like it or not the mobile phone has become a vehicle for multimedia par excellence. Epitomising contemporary convergence by way of its smorgasbord of applications and multimedia possibilities, it seems almost impossible to get such a device just for voice calling without all the `extras'. But is mobile media a new emerging art form? Is it new media? Or is it a domestic technology? And in an age of convergent media can we distinguish the different media histories? As a symbol of convergent global media, mobile phone practices are also marked by divergence. This divergence is particularly the case in terms of the increasingly tenacious role of the local in informing and adapting the global. The history of the mobile phone as a communication device inflects the localized practices of mobile multimedia, fusing communication with new media discourses. This article will discuss the rise of mobile communication studies and the role of locality, then turn to one of the centres for mobile innovation, Seoul, to discuss the role of mobile media as a domestic new media.","",""

This ethnographically oriented study involved 19 Canadian families. Through a combination of different methods of investigation (individual interviews, family interviews, observations in situ, notebooks on everyday technologically mediated practices) we gathered a multi-faceted portrait of the integration of technologies in everyday life.2 What we found through the analysis of our empirical data (whether ethnographic or discursive), were indications of some form of creative cooperation between users and technologies. We discovered a world where humans and technological artefacts work together to create a variety of specific ‘ways of life’. Some of these were new and totally unexpected, while others were interesting ways to accomplish existing and even traditional social functions. This creative cooperation between people and technologies gave rise to a process of everyday cultural construction.","",""
"2005","Keeping Connected: Travelling with the Telephone"," This paper examines the uses of mobile and fixed telephone communications by travellers and the implications of that use for their experiences of travel. Based on interviews conducted with people travelling in New Zealand, we argue that travellers give specific attention to the accessibility of phone services while planning their travel. Once travellers' journeys and communication with distant friends and families had commenced, travellers made clear distinctions between the relative uses, benefits and drawbacks of using oral phone communications and 'texting' (short message service). Both forms of communication had similar impacts on travellers' sense of an ongoing integration into relationships from which they were temporarily physically distant. However, the two modes of communication differed with respect to what they were seen to offer. That is, oral phone communication was characterised by its 'emotionality', while texting in particular was seen to offer distinctive opportunities for spontaneous contact. ","",""
"2005","The Mobile Effect","In considering the mobile phone I shall here return to a text by Shuhei Hosokawa on an earlier form of mobile media, 'The Walkman Effect'.1 This text, published just a few years after Sony's introduction of the Walkman in 1980, is less about the Walkman as technological artifact than about the emergence of a cultural object at a specific historical moment, with the event of the Walkman or Walkman as event and with the kind of spatial and urban strategies it makes possible. In March 2005 Sony Ericsson unveiled the Walkman phone, but my interest is likewise not in the evolution of the mobile as media player or multifunction device.2 Rather, I shall consider Hosokawa's insights into the relationship between the Walkman and the embodiment and context of Walkman users, and how these can help us to account for the way that the mobile phone operates simultaneously as a node within networks and the point of intersection between the virtual space of telecommunications and physical or embodied space. Like Hosokawa, I am interested less in the object in itself, than in the object 'under use'. I shall approach this by drawing upon a consideration of the practice of artists and technologists exploring social and creative applications of mobile technology, as well as upon certain representations of the mobile phone user within popular culture.","",""

The pocket size and the extreme portability of these technologies facilitate their role as ubiquitous mediators in the growing mobility that characterises modern societies.2 As numerous studies indicate, such technologies, particularly mobile phones, are reconfiguring work and leisure, and the way social interactions take place.3 We propose that two features of portable sound technologies are especially important in these new, increasingly global, arrangements. The first is often overlooked by media researchers. These portable devices are sound technologies. Sound instantly crosses conventional social, visual and physical boundaries and, in doing so, opens up the potential for new, often unanticipated networks of connection. Sound, in a word, travels. When sound devices travel, they further reconfigure the way private and public space is managed by how they and their user moves through them, and by how this affects hearing or overhearing. Sound, in effect, mobilises both space and social arrangements. We explore this further below.","",""

"2006","SMS Riot: Transmitting Race on a Sydney Beach, December 2005","&#x0D;         &#x0D; &#x0D;    My message is this in regard to SMS messages and swarming crowds; this is ludicrous behaviour; it is unAustralian. We all share this wonderful country. (NSW Police Assistant Commissioners Mark Goodwin, quoted in Kennedy)&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;    The cops hate and fear the swarming packs of Lebanese who respond when some of their numbers are confronted, mobilising quickly via mobile phones and showing open contempt for Australian law. All this is the real world, as distinct from the world preferred by ideological academics who talk about “moral panic” and the oppression of Muslims. They will see only Australian racism as the problem. (Sheehan)&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  The Politics of Transmission&#x0D; &#x0D;  On 11 December 2005, as Sydney was settling into early summer haze, there was a race riot on the popular Cronulla beach in the city’s southern suburbs. Hundreds of people, young men especially, gathered for a weekend protest. Their target and pretext were visitors from the culturally diverse suburbs to the west, and the need to defend their women and beaches in the face of such unwelcome incursions and behaviours. In the ensuing days, there were violent raids and assaults criss-crossing back and forth across Sydney’s beaches and suburbs, involving almost farcical yet deadly earnest efforts to identify, respectively, people of “anglo” or “Middle Eastern” appearance (often specifically “Lebanese”) and to threaten or bash them.  At the very heart of this state of siege and the fear, outrage, and sadness that gripped those living in Sydney were the politics of transmission. The spark that set off this conflagration was widely believed to have been caused by the transmission of racist and violent “calls to arms” via mobile text messages.&#x0D; &#x0D;  Predictably perhaps media outlets sought out experts on text messaging and cell phone culture for commentary, including myself and most mainstream media appeared interested in portraying a fascination for texting and reinforcing its pivotal role in the riots. In participating in media interviews, I found myself torn between wishing to attest to the significance and importance of cell phone culture and texting, on the one hand (or thumb perhaps), while being extremely sceptical about its alleged power in shaping these unfolding events, on the other — not to mention being disturbed about the ethical implications of what had unfolded. In this article, I wish to discuss the subject of transmission and the power of mobile texting culture, something that attracted much attention elsewhere — and to which the Sydney riots offer a fascinating and instructive lesson.&#x0D; &#x0D;  My argument runs like this. Mobile phone culture, especially texting, has emerged over the past decade, and has played a central role in communicative and cultural practice in many countries and contexts as scholars have shown (Glotz and Bertschi; Harper, Palen and Taylor). Among other features, texting often plays a significant, if not decisive, role in co-ordinated as well as spontaneous social and political organization and networks, if not, on occasion, in revolution. However, it is important not to over-play the role, significance and force of such texting culture in the exercise of power, or the formation of collective action and identities (whether mobs, crowds, masses, movements, or multitudes). I think texting has been figured in such a hyperbolic and technological determinist way, especially, and ironically, through how it has been represented in other media (print, television, radio, and online). The difficulty then is to identify the precise contribution of mobile texting in organized and disorganized social networks, without the antimonies conferred alternatively by dystopian treatments (such as moral panic) or utopian ones (such as the technological sublime) — something which I shall try to elucidate in what follows.&#x0D; &#x0D;  On the Beach Again&#x0D; &#x0D;  Largely caught unawares and initially slow to respond, the New South Wales state government responded with a massive show of force and repression. 2005 had been marked by the state and Federal enactment of draconian terror laws. Now here was an opportunity for the government to demonstrate the worth of the instruments and rationales for suppression of liberties, to secure public order against threats of a more (un)civil than martial order. Outflanking the opposition party on law-and-order rhetoric once again, the government immediately formulated new laws to curtail accused and offender’s rights (Brown). The police “locked” down whole suburbs — first Cronulla, then others — and made a show of policing all beaches north and south (Sydney Morning Herald).&#x0D; &#x0D;  The race riots were widely reported in the international press, and, not for the first time (especially since the recent Redfern and Macquarie Fields), the city’s self-image of a cosmopolitan, multicultural nation (or in Australian Prime Minister John Howard’s prim and loaded terms, a nation “relaxed and comfortable”) looked like a mirage. Debate raged on why the riots occurred, how harmony could be restored and what the events signified for questions of race and identity — the latter most narrowly construed in the Prime Minister’s insistence that the riots did not reflect underlying racism in Australia (Dodson, Timms and Creagh). There were suggestions that the unrest was rather at base about the contradictions and violence of masculinity, some two-odd decades after Puberty Blues — the famous account of teenage girls growing up on the (Cronulla) Shire beaches. Journalists agonized about whether the media amounted to reporter or amplifier of tensions. &#x0D; &#x0D;  In the lead-up to the riots, at their height, and in their wake, there was much emphasis on the role mobile text messages played in creating the riots and sustaining the subsequent atmosphere of violence and racial tension (The Australian; Overington and Warne-Smith). Not only were text messages circulating in the Sydney area, but in other states as well (Daily Telegraph). The volume of such text messages and emails also increased in the wake of the riot (certainly I received one personally from a phone number I did not recognise). New messages were sent to exhort Lebanese-Australians and others to fight back. Those decrying racism, such as the organizers of a rally, pointedly circulated text messages, hoping to spread peace.&#x0D; &#x0D;  Media commentators, police, government officials, and many others held such text messages directly and centrally responsible for organizing the riot and for the violent scuffles that followed: &#x0D; &#x0D;    The text message hate mail that inspired 5000 people to attend the rally at Cronulla 10 days ago demonstrated to the police the power of the medium. The retaliation that followed, when gangs marauded through Maroubra and Cronulla, was also co-ordinated by text messaging (Davies).&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;    It is rioting for a tech-savvy generation. Mobile phones are providing the call to arms for the tribes in the race war dividing Sydney. More than 5000 people turn up to Cronulla on Sunday … many were drawn to the rally, which turned into a mob, by text messages on their mobiles (Hayes and Kearney).&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  Such accounts were crucial to the international framing of the events as this report from The Times in London illustrates: &#x0D; &#x0D;    In the days leading up to the riot racist text messages had apparently been circulating calling upon concerned “white” Australians to rally at Cronulla to defend their beach and women. Following the attacks on the volunteer lifeguards, a mobile telephone text campaign started, backed up by frenzied discussions on weblogs, calling on Cronulla locals to rally to protect their beach. In response, a text campaign urged youths from western Sydney to be at Cronulla on Sunday to protect their friends (Maynard).&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  There were calls upon the mobile companies to intercept and ban such messages, with industry spokespeople pointing out text messages were usually only held for twenty-four hours and were in many ways more difficult to intercept than it was to tap phone calls (Burke and Cubby).&#x0D; &#x0D;  Mobs and Messages&#x0D; &#x0D;  I think there are many reasons to suggest that the transmission of text messages did constitute a moral panic (what I’ve called elsewhere a “mobile panic”; see Goggin), pace columnist Paul Sheehan. Notably the wayward texting drew a direct and immediate response from the state government, with legislative changes that included provisions allowing the confiscation of cell phones and outlawing sending, receipt or keeping of racist or inflammatory text messages. For some days police proceeded to stop cars and board buses and demand to inspect mobiles, checking and reading text messages, arresting at least one person for being responsible for transmitting banned text messages. &#x0D; &#x0D;  However, there is another important set of ideas adduced by commentators to explain how people came together to riot in Sydney, taking their cue from Howard Rheingold’s 2002 book Smart Mobs, a widely discussed and prophetic text on social revolution and new technologies. Rheingold sees text messaging as the harbinger of such new, powerful forms of collectivity, studying emergent uses around the world. A prime example he uses to illustrate the “power of the mobile many” is the celebrated overthrow of President Joseph Estrada of the Philippines in January 2001:&#x0D; &#x0D;    President Joseph Estrada of the Philippines became the first head of state in history to lose power to a smart mob. More than 1 million Manila residents, mobilized and coordinated by waves of text messages, assembled … Estrada fell. The legend of “Generation Txt” was born (Rheingold 157-58).&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  Rheingold is careful to emphasize the social as much as technical nature of this revolution, yet still sees such developments leading to “smart mobs”. As with his earlier, prescient book Virtual Community (Rheingold 1993) did for the Internet, so has Smart Mobs compellingly fused and circulated a set of ideas about cell phones and the pervasive, wearable and mobile technologies that are their successors.&#x0D; &#x0D;  The received view of the overthrow of the Estrada government is summed up in a remark attributed to Estrada himself: “I was ousted by a coup d’text” (Pertierra et al. ch. 6). The text-toppling of Estrada is typically attributed to “Generation Txt”, underlining the power of text messaging and the new social category which marks it, and has now passed into myth. What is less well-known is that the overriding role of the cell phone in the Estrada overthrow has been challenged. &#x0D; &#x0D;  In the most detailed study of text messaging and subjectivity in the Philippines, which reviewed accounts of the events of the Estrada overthrow, as well as conducting interviews with participants, Pertierra et al. discern in EDSA2 a “utopian vision of the mobile phone that is characteristic of ‘discourses of sublime technology’”:&#x0D; &#x0D;    It focuses squarely on the mobile phone, and ignores the people who used it … the technology is said to possess a mysterious force, called “Text Power” ... it is the technology that does things — makes things happen — not the people who use it. (Pertierra et al. ch. 6)&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  Given the recrudescence of the technological sublime in digital media (on which see Mosco) the detailed examination of precise details and forms of agency and coordination using cell phones is most instructive. Pertierra et al. confirm that &#x0D; &#x0D;    the cell phone did play an important role in EDSA2 (the term given to the events surrounding the downfall of Estrada). That role, however, was not the one for which it has usually been praised in the media since the event — namely, that of crowd-drawer par excellence … less than half of our survey respondents who took part in People Power 2 noted that text messaging influenced them to go. If people did attend, it was because they were persuaded to by an ensemble of other reasons … (2002: ch. 6)&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  Instead, they argue, the significance of the cell phone lay &#x0D; &#x0D;     firstly, in the way it helped join people who disapproved of Pres. Estrada in a network of complex connectivity … Secondly, the mobile phone was instrumental as an organizational device … In the hands of activists and powerbrokers from politics, the military, business groups and civil society, the mobile phone becomes a “potent communications tool” … (Pertierra et al. 2002: ch. 6)&#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  What this revisionist account of the Estrada coup underscores is that careful research and analysis is required to understand how SMS is used and what it signifies. Indeed it is worth going further to step back from either the celebratory or minatory discourses on the cell phone and its powerful effects, and reframe this set of events as very much to do with the mutual construction of society and technology, in which culture is intimately involved. This involves placing both the technology of text messaging and the social and political forces manifested in this uprising in a much wider setting. For instance, in his account of the Estrada crisis Vicente L. Rafael terms the tropes of text messaging and activism evident in the discourses surrounding it as:&#x0D; &#x0D;    a set of telecommunicative fantasies among middle-class Filipinos … [that] reveal certain pervasive beliefs of the middle classes … in the power of communication technologies to transmit messages at a distance and in their own ability to possess that power (Rafael 399). &#x0D;  &#x0D; &#x0D;  For Rafael, rather than possessing instrinsic politics in its own right, text messaging here is about a “media politics (understood in both senses of the phrase: the politics of media systems, but also the inescapable mediation of the political) [that] reveal the unstable workings of Filipino middle-class sentiments” (400). &#x0D; &#x0D;  “Little Square of Light”&#x0D; &#x0D;  Doubtless there are emergent cultural and social forms created in conjunction with new technologies, which unfreeze and open up (for a time) social relations. As my discussion of the Estrada “coup d’text” shows, however, the dynamics of media, politics and technology in any revolution or riot need to be carefully traced. &#x0D; &#x0D;  A full discussion of mobile media and the Sydney uprising will need to wait for another occasion. However, it is worth noting that the text messages in question to which the initial riot had been attributed, were actually read out on one of the country’s highest-rating and most influential talk-radio programs. The contents of such messages had also been detailed in print media, especially tabloids, and been widely discussed (McLellan, Marr). What remains unknown and unclear, however, is the actual use of text messages and cell phones in the conceiving, co-ordination, and improvisational dynamics of the riots, and affective, cultural processing of what occurred. &#x0D; &#x0D;  Little retrospective interpretation at all has emerged in the months since the riots, but it certainly felt as if the police and state’s over-reaction, and the arrival of the traditionally hot and lethargic Christmas — combined with the underlying structures of power and feeling to achieve the reinstitution of calm, or rather perhaps the habitual, much less invisible, expression of whiteness as usual. The policing of the crisis had certainly been fuelled by the mobile panic, but setting law enforcement the task of bringing those text messages to book was much like asking them to catch the wind. &#x0D; &#x0D;  For analysts, as well as police, the novel and salience appearance of texting also has a certain lure. Yet in concentrating on the deadly power of the cell phone to conjure up a howling or smart mob, or in the fascination with the new modes of transmission of mobile devices, it is important to give credit to the formidable, implacable role of media and cultural representations more generally, in all this, as they are transmitted, received, interpreted and circulated through old as well as new modes, channels and technologies.&#x0D; &#x0D;   References&#x0D; &#x0D;    The Australian. “SMS Message Goes Out: Let’s March for Racial Tolerance.” The Australian. 17 September, 2005. 6.

"2006","Always Articulating: Theorizing on Mobile and Wireless Technologies","Through this article we theorize on the nature and effects of articulation work relative to the take-up and use of information and communications technologies (ICT). Articulation work is “work that enables other work”: that which links people, processes, and technologies within organizations. Articulation work in organizations is both common and too often invisible from a managerial or budgetary perspective. Drawing on data from a study of the introduction and implementation of mobile computing technologies into criminal justice organizations, we highlight two findings: (1) There exist ongoing but unmet articulation needs present in any organization or work system. (2) Articulation is cumulative. We find, that as work becomes more complex (such as adding new work tasks and using new technologies), there is more articulation needed. These findings raise issues with assessing the costs of articulation on individuals, and making arrangements to accommodate explicit and implicit articulation in organizational work, particularly around the take-up and ongoing use of ICT-based systems.","",""
"2006","Changes in the self resulting from the use of mobile phones"," The present work examines the potential consequences of the use of mobile telephones on people’s behaviour and identity. In doing so, we start from the premise that, even though this technology may have different effects in different cultural contexts, it promotes and foments certain patterns of behaviour and of understanding one’s own identity. It is suggested that this new identity goes hand in hand with a spatial-temporal recomposition of the context in which actions take place. On the opening up of an almost continuous virtual space, conflicts may arise between the different roles played by an individual which were previously differentiated as a function of space. Similarly, increased flexibility in arrangements leads to the appearance of a new concept of time, which we might call the ‘present extensive’. We also discuss the possible superstitions the use of this new technology may bring with it. As a result of these analyses, it is considered that the mobile phone not only emerges within a postmodern society, but also, along with other technological developments, feeds a postmodern mentality.

"2006","3G to Web 2.0? Can Mobile Telephony Become an Architecture of Participation?"," Telecommunications companies (telcos) paid too much for European 3G licences on the basis that they would be able to reach mobile consumers directly with web content. The subsequent reluctance of consumers to pay for commercial content and the debts and devaluations afflicting the post-tech-boom telcos has had several consequences. Besides an undercapitalized 3G infrastructure, there has been increasing consternation about the absence of a must-have service ‘killer app’ that would lead to the uptake of 3G products, and determined efforts to find one, as evidenced at events like ‘Mobile Content World’, an industry conference and trade fair held in London in October 2005. But the efforts to sell 3G spectrum (and the entire 3G experiment) may be based on a misapprehension of the nature of users’ relationships with ICTs and web content. This article presents an overview and commentary on the progress of the 3G mobile content industry. In part it is based on a review of presentations at ‘Mobile Content World’, and in part on a review and synthesis of the most recent literature covering 3G and mobile content from the fields of media studies, cultural studies, economics and business.

"2006","User Design and the Democratization of the Mobile Phone","When the mobile phone was first introduced into Italy, it was considered an arrogant and vulgar technology used only by those at the top of society. Today, however, the mobile phone is used across all Italian social classes and is considered highly fashionable. This transformation in perceptions of this technology — and, therefore, its uses — can usefully be understood as, simultaneously, the democratization of the mobile telephone. One of the most important factors that made this technology more acceptable in Italian society was its redesign as a material object, undertaken in response to the actual needs and practices of users. Once individual users found their own identities and desires reflected in the mobile telephone, they were far more likely to incorporate this technology into their personal ecologies. Even though mobile telephones are very much the product of large industrial organizations, this case also demonstrates the contribution of users to design of the technological environment that then in turn governs their own behaviors.","",""
"2006","Sampling mobile opinion: A contextual postcard questionnaire study","Understanding requirements of mobile communities is challenging because of their geographical distribution and frequent movement. We present a study of backpackers travelling in Australia which utilizes a research method called contextual postcard questionnaires. The method uses brief, open–ended questions to solicit contextual responses from backpackers that are relevant for development of tourism and mobile communication technologies.  Eight hundred postcards were distributed via hostels and a travel agent, questioning travellers about their current situation. Questions asked how they had heard about their present location, what kinds of virtual–graffiti they would leave there, and what their greatest worry currently was, among others. Results indicated that backpackers have a great deal of practical and serious concerns to contend with as they travel. They are physically cut off from family and friends and rely on a range of communications media to stay in touch and exchange emotional support. They have a great deal of practical travel experience that would be useful to other travellers, but which is currently only conveyed haphazardly via word–of–mouth. Practical usage of the contextual postcard questionnaires is discussed and design recommendations for mobile group products are offered.","",""

Based on a survey of Taiwanese college students, we found that the cell phone supplements the fixed telephone as a means of strengthening users’ family bonds, expanding their psychological neighborhoods, and facilitating symbolic proximity to the people they call. Thus, the cell phone has evolved from a luxury for businesspeople into an important facilitator of many users’ social relationships. For the poorly connected socially, the cell phone offers a unique advantage: it confers instant membership in a community.

A survey of college students in the United States and Japan was conducted to demonstrate empirically the relationship between fashion attentiveness and the acquisition, use, and replacement of the mobile phone. The results suggested that young people use the mobile phone as a way of expressing their sense of self and perceive others through a ‘fashion’ lens. Hence it may be useful to investigate further how fashion considerations could guide both the rapidly growing area of mobile phone behavior, as well as human communication behavior more generally.

"2007","Texting Love","&#x0D;         &#x0D; &#x0D;  The mobile phone found its way to the Philippines when the first generation of Global Systems for Mobile Communication or GSM handsets was introduced in the country in 1994. This GSM protocol eventually developed to introduce a faster and more efficient means of storing, manipulating, and transmitting data by allowing data to be translated into a series of ones and zeroes. Digital technology furthered the mobile phone’s potentials from being a mere “talking device on the move” (Leung and Wei 316) to a more dynamic participant in the new information age. The capacity to merge all forms of binary data enabled mobile phones to allow convergent services such as chatting, voice-mail, news updates, e-mailing, Internet browsing, and even the dissemination of image and audio files. Apart from the allure of the possibilities of digital communication, the mobile phone was also welcomed in the Philippines because of its convenience; it provided the country, especially the rural areas where telephones are unavailable or inaccessible, with a modern means of communication. A survey conducted by the Social Weather Station (SWS) in 2001 reveals the extent of the dissemination of this technology in the Philippines: “Out of the 15 million households in the Philippines, an estimated 2.5 million have a cellular phone, of which 2.3 million have text-messaging capacity. For the entire nation, text-messaging is available to 15% of all households in general, but it is available to 53% of ABC households in particular. Of the 2.3 million text-capable households in the nation, 800 thousand are in Metro Manila.” Of the 80 million Filipinos, there are now 22 million mobile phone owners in the country compared to only 6.7 million subscribed landlines (Lallana 1).   Of the various digital applications of the mobile phone, text messaging is still considered to be the most exploited service in the Philippines. A voice call placed through the mobile phone would typically cost around six to seven pesos per minute while a text message costs a peso per message. Corollary, a typical Filipino now sends an average of ten messages every day, contributing to a daily traffic of over 300 million text messages (Pertierra 58). This has led to the popular notion of the Philippines as the “texting capital of the world” (Pertierra et al. 88).   In Text-ing Selves, a study that examines the use of mobile phones in the country, Pertierra and other researchers argue that texting has made it possible to create new unsurveilled and unconventional human relationships. In one case cited in the book, for example, a male and a female texter met after an accidental exchange of text messages. Although initially they were very reserved and guarded, familiarity between the two was fostered greatly because the medium allowed for an anonymous and uncommitted communication. Eventually, they met and shortly after that, got engaged. A second instance involved a person who exchanged phone numbers with his friends to pursue strangers and win new friends by texting. He engaged in virtual or text-based “affairs” with women, which would later on result to actual physical sex. Another case examined was that of an 18-year old bisexual who met “textmates” by participating in interactive Text TV chatrooms. Although he eventually met up with individuals to have sex, he professed to use the Text TV mainly to create these virtual relationships with persons of the same sex. (Pertierra et al. 64-89)   It is because of the considerable popularity of the medium and the possible repercussions of such curious relationships and interpersonal communication patterns that the phenomenon of mobile phone use, particularly that of texting, in the Philippines is worthy of systematic scrutiny. Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine the relational context being created through this wireless messaging system. An exploratory study, this research examines the contributions of the texting technology that allowed development of romantic relationships among its users. Ultimately, this paper aims to identify what makes texting a novel romantic device in the Philippines.   The framework in the understanding of relationship development through texting incorporates Malcolm Parks’ theory of relationship life cycle and network (352). In his proposal, interpersonal relationships of all types are usually conceptualized as developing from the impersonal to the personal along a series of relatively specific dimensions: increases in interdependence, in the variety and intimacy of interaction, in interpersonal predictability and understanding, in the change toward more personalized ways of communicating and coordinating, in commitment, and in the convergence of the participants’ social networks. According to Parks (359-68), relationships move within the constructive character of communication that involves the interaction of the structure and content of communication between the participants. Thus, the researcher would like to identify the relationship between these seven factors of relationship development and the texting technology.    This research identified the attributes of the texting technology along the seven dimensions of Park’s theory of relational development. Qualitative data was obtained and explored in the light of the concepts presented in the related literature, particularly the theoretical discourses of Paul Levinson and Raul Pertierra et al. A total of 43 respondents, 21 males and 22 females, were selected through purposive sampling to derive exploratory data through the in-depth interview method.   Texting and Interdependence   Unwritten Rule of Texting   Respondents revealed that their relationships developed with their respective partners because texting made them more dependent on each other. “It became a habit” (Emmy). Partners texted each other as often as they could, until they have established themselves as regular textmates. One respondent’s day would also be influenced by his partner’s text message: “Kapag hindi siya nakakapagtext, nami-miss ko siya (If she doesn’t text, I miss her). Her simple ‘good morning’s’ can really help me start my day right.” At this level of the relationship, texters always had the compulsion to keep the communication constantly moving. One respondent attributed this to the “unwritten rule of texting.” Clara elaborated:      You know there’s this unwritten rule in texing: once a person has texted you, you have to reply. If you don’t reply, the person will automatically think you ignored him or her on purpose. So you have to reply no matter what. Even when you really have nothing to say, you’re forced to come up with something or give your opinion just to keep the conversation going.     Immediacy and Accessibility   Some respondents exhibited interdependence by “reporting” or informing each other of the happenings in their individual lives. Arnel shared:      Ang ilang pinakanatulong sa amin ng texting ay to inform each other kung saan na kami at kung anong pinagkakaabalahan namin at a specific time, especially kung hindi kami magkasama. (One of the greatest aid of texting in our relationship is that it enables us to inform each other about where we are and what we are doing at a specific time, especially if we are not together).     He also added that texting allows them to organize their schedules as well as to logistically set meeting times or inform the other of one’s tardiness.    Texting also allowed for the individuals in the relationship to influence each other’s thoughts, behaviors, and actions. “Kapag nagkukuwento siya kung anong nangyari sa kaniya tapos tingin ko mali, pinagsasabihan ko siya (If she tells me stories about what happened to her and then I see that there’s something wrong with it, I admonish her)” (Jesus).    Jack summarized how the texting technology facilitated these indicators of interdependence between romantic partners:      There’s a feeling of security that having a cellphone gives to a certain person, because you know that, more often than not, you can and will be reached by anyone, anywhere, anytime, and vice versa. So when I need comfort, or someone to listen, or I need to vent, or I need my boyfriend’s opinion, or I need his help in making a decision, it’s really relieving to know that he’s just a text or phone call away.      These responses from the participants in a texting romantic relationship confirm Paul Levinson’s arguments of the mobile phone’s feature of accessibility. In the book Cellphone: The Story of the World’s Most Mobile Medium and How it has Transformed Everything! he mentions that the mobile phone technology, particularly texting, permits users to make instant, immediate and direct delivery of messages. He further explains that texting can be a romancing tool because before there was the mobile phone, people placing call through the telephone had to make sure that the persons they are asking out on a date are at home when the phone rings (Levinson 97).    Texting and Depth: Privacy and Levinson’s Silence   Texting also facilitated an efficient exchange of a variety of important, intimate, and personal topics and feelings for most of the respondents. A number of respondents even confessed that they could go as intimate as exchanging sexual messages with their partners. One respondent revealed that he could text his partner anything “kahit nga text sex pwede rin eh (even ‘sex text’ is allowed).”   But mostly, the text exchanges consisted of intimate romantic feelings that one could not manage to say in person. Richard shared: “For example, through text we can say ‘I love you’ to each other. Aside from that, nasasabi ko rin yung mga problems na hindi ko masabi ng harapan (I could tell her about my problems that I could not say face-to-face).”    Arnel, a homosexual, attributed this ease of transmitting intimate and personal topics and feelings to the texting technology’s unique feature of privacy. “Kasi wari bang nakakalikha ng pribadong espasyo yung screen ng phone mo na kahit na magkalayo kayo” (Because the mobile phone screen is able to create a private space that even if you are far from each other) physically, the virtual space created by that technology is apparent. Because no one can hear you say those things or no one else can read [them], assuming na hindi pinabasa sa ibang tao o hindi nakita (that it is not allowed to be read or seen by others) (Arnel).    Arnel’s discussion of the private space that allows for intimate exchanges links up with Paul Levinson’s silence as one of the biggest benefit of the texting technology. Texting permits receivers to view their messages in private as opposed to having others in the environment hear and know about their particular communication or simply even just the fact that they are communicating (Levinson 112-14).   Anonymity   RJ would associate this capability to swap intimate information between partners to texting’s provision for anonymity.      In texting, there is the element of anonymity, thus, you can feel more comfortable with sharing more intimate messages. As opposed to a face-to-face conversation wherein you would tend to hold back some feelings or thoughts because of fear of outright rejection. Personally, I consider that factor as a very important element in the development of our relationship. Because I am not really the aggressive-frank type of guy, I tend to hold back in telling her intimate things face to face.     The feature of anonymity that the respondents mentioned seems to refer to one characteristic that Pertierra, et al. (91) outlined in their book. They wrote that communication through texting has also efficiently incorporated meaning, intention, and expressions allowing texters to say what is normally unsayable in face-to-face contexts. This clearly points to the comfort that the respondents identified when they’d share about intimate details like their exes and other information that a typical “non-aggressive-frank guy, who fears outright rejection,” would.   Autonomy   Perhaps an additional feature that might be closely related to privacy and anonymity is the autonomous nature of the texting technology. Homosexuals like Jetrin took advantage of this feature to facilitate unconventional same-sex affairs: “Unlike pagers, mobile phones are not monitored, therefore I can pretty much say what I want to the other person. I get to express myself more clearly and intimate[ly]”. Because of this absence of censorship, texters can confidently say “’I love you’ or ‘I want to throw you against the wall and make you feel like a cheap whore’ (Jetrin)” without having to concern themselves about a third-party processing their messages.   Texting and Breadth   Expressing Real and Virtual Emotions   Because of these various constraints, respondents started to locate other avenues to communicate with their partners. Thus, the breadth of the relationship increased. Other means of communication that the respondents mentioned are face-to-face encounters, voice phone calls (either landline or mobile phone), e-mail, chat (YM, ICQ, Web cam, etc.), and even snail mail. However way they decided to extend their communication beyond texting, almost all of them declared that it is still texting that instigated this movement to another medium. One respondent said “Of course text ang taga-initiate (initiates) and then more ways [follow] after.”   Although texting employs a dualistic nature of beneficial anonymity and uncertainty between exchanging partners, a number of respondents still express optimism about the texting technology’s capacity to bridge the gap between expressing real and virtual emotions. Some claimed that “even [in] text [there is] personality; smiling face, exclamation points, feelings are still communicated.” RG also expressed that “yung mga smileys nakakatulong sa pag-express ng emotions (smileys help in expressing emotions).” Jake added that “qualities like the smiley faces and sad faces you can make using the punctuation marks, etc. can really add warmth and depth to text messages.”    Texting and Commitment   Regularity   Since most of the couples in a romantic relationship did not have the luxury of time to meet up in person or talk over the phone regularly, the frequency of texting became a distinct indication about their commitment to their relationships. “To commit is to be there for the person, 24/7. Texting helps in achieving that despite of the barriers in time and distance” (Von). Didith showed the other end of this phenomenon: “When he texted less and less in the course of the relationship, it made me doubt about … his commitment.” This regularity of texting also provided for strengthening the bond and connection between partners that ultimately “As we share more and more of our lives with each other, more trust develops…and the more trust you instill in each other, the more you expect the relationship to be stronger and more lasting” (Jack).    Convenience and Affordability   Some respondents pointed out texting’s convenient nature of linking partners who are rather separated by physical and geographical limits. Richard used texting to contact his partner “kasi malayo kami sa isa’t-isa, lalo na kapag umuuwi siya sa Bulacan. Texting ang pinakamadali, cheapest, and convenient way para makapag-communicate kami (because we are far from each other, especially if she goes home to Bulacan. Texting is the fastest, cheapest, and convenient way for us to communicate).” This “presence” that strengthens the commitment between partners, as suggested by most of the respondents, indicates the capacity of the mobile phone to transform into an extension of the human body and connect partners intimately.    Texting, Predictability and Understanding   Redundancy   Some of the respondents agreed that it is the regularity of texting that enabled them to become more capable of understanding and predicting their partner’s feelings and behaviors. Tina articulated this: “Probably due to redundancy, one can predict how the other will react to certain statements.” Jake also expressed the same suggestion:      Texting in our relationship has become a routine, actually. Texting has become like talking for us. And the more we text/talk, the more we get to know each other. Nagiging sanay na kami sa ugali at pag-iisip ng isa’t-isa (We become used to each other’s attitudes and thinking). So it’s inevitable for us to be able to predict one another’s reactions and thoughts to certain topics. Because we get to a point wherein we feel like we know each other so well, that when we are able to correctly predict a feeling or behavior, we find it amusing.     In the end, the regularity of the interaction brought about learning. “I’ve learned much of her from texting. I knew that she becomes disappointed with certain things or she really appreciates it when I do certain things. It became easier for me to learn about her thoughts, feelings, etc.” (RJ)   Managing of Contextual Cues   A lot of the respondents mentioned that their understanding and predictability of their partners was also heightened by the context of the construction of the messages that were being transmitted. “If there are smiley faces, then we’re okay. No cute expressions mean we’re in a serious mode” (Didith). “Either an added word, a missing word, or a word out of place in the message gives me the clue” (Jake). The textual structure and signs became instrumental into the translation of how to perceive another’s feelings or reactions. “For example, pag normal, sweet words yung nasa text, may mga ‘I love you,’ mga ganon. Pero kung galit siya, may iba. Minsan  ‘Oo’ lang yung sagot. Kaya mas nakikilala ko pa siya through text (For example, on a normal circumstance, her text would contain sweet words like ‘I love you.’ But if she’s mad, it’s different. At times, she would just reply with a mere ‘yes.’ That’s why I get to know her more through text)” (Richard).    Texting and Communicative Change   Own Private World   Texting allowed respondents to create special languages that they used to interact with their own partners. It is an inherent characteristic of texting that limits messages up to 360 characters only, and it becomes almost a requirement to really adapt a rather abbreviated way of writing when one has to send a message. In this study however, it was found that the languages that respondents created were not the usual languages that the general public would use or understand in texting – it even went beyond the usual use of the popular smileys. Respondents revealed that they created codes that only they and their respective partners understood in their “own private world” (Jackie, Emma).  “How I text him is different from how I text other people so I don’t think other people would understand what I’m telling him, and why the manner is so if they read our messages” (Anika). Leana shared an example:      My partner and I have created special nicknames and shortcuts that only the two of us know and understand. Kunyari (For example), we have our own way of saying ‘I love you’ or ‘I miss you.’ To send a kiss… we use a set of characters different from the usual. Basta secret na namin ‘yon (It is our secret).     Fun   Majority of the respondents identified communicative code change as the most exciting and fun part in texting. “It is one of the best things about relating with someone through texting. It is one of the most fun things to do” (Mario). And the amusement that this interaction caused was not only limited in the virtual environment and the textual context. “It is one of the fun things about our texting and it even carries over when we are together personally” (Justin). “Since words are what we have, we play with them and try to be creative. Para masaya, exciting (So that it is fun and exciting)” (Charm). Incidentally, this sense of fun and excitement is also one of the attributes that Pertierra and his co-authors mentioned in their book Txt-ing Selves (Pertierra et al. 140): “Many see texting as an opportunity for fun.”   Texting and Network Convergence   Texting also made network convergence possible among partners, and their respective social circles, in a romantic relationship. Because the respondents engaged in non-stop texting, their friends and family started to notice their change in behavior. “People become curious… They want to know the person I text with every minute of every day… I guess people can tell when a person’s in love, even when it has only developed through texting” (Clara). Jake shared a very likely scenario: “If you get text messages when you’re with your friends/family and you laugh at the message you receive, or just react to whatever you receive, you’d have to make kwento (tell) who you’re texting to make sense of your reactions.” Others though, readily announced their relationships to everyone: “I’ll text my friends first na ‘Uy, may bago ako.’ (I will text my friends first that: ‘Hey, I have a new girlfriend.’)” (Richard).   But sometimes, texters also introduced their partners to people outside their friends and family circles. “Sometimes, it even goes beyond personal. Example, if my ‘new partner’ who has never met any of my friends and family need help with something (business, academic, etc.) then I introduce him to someone from my circle who can be of help to him” (Jetrin).   Network convergence could also take place through and within the medium itself. Respondents revealed that their family and friends actually interact with each other through texting without necessarily having the opportunity to meet in person. Pauline shared: “Ate (My older sister)… used to send text messages to him before to ask where I am. And my mom stole his number from my phone ‘just in case’.” Didith and her boyfriend also experienced having their friends involved in the dynamics of their relationship: “During our first major quarrel, he texted and called my friend to ask what I was mad about. Likewise, when we have a minor spat, I call his friend to vent or ask about him.”    Conclusion   This study establishes the texting technology’s capacity as a romancing gadget.  As the interview participants pointed out, because of the technology’s capacity to allow users to create their own world capable of expressing real and virtual emotions, and managing contextual cues, texters were able to increase their dependence and understanding of one another. It also allowed for partners to exchange more personal and intimate information through an instant and private delivery of messages. The facilitation of communicative change made their relationship more exciting and that the texting medium itself became the message of commitment to their relationship. Finally, texting also led the partners to introduce one another to their families and friends either through the texting environment or face-to-face. Ultimately, texting became their means to achieving intimacy and romance.    Texting offered a modern communication medium for carrying out traditional gender roles in pursuing romance for the heterosexual majority of the respondents. However, the messaging tool also empowered the homosexuals and bisexuals involved in the study. The highly private and autonomous textual environment enabled them to explore new and unorthodox romantic and even sexual relations.   Moreover, texting may be considered as a venue for “technological foreplay” (Nadarajan). Almost all of those who have used texting to sustain their intimacy indicated the choice to expand to other modes of communication. Although relationships set in a purely virtual environment actually exist, the findings that these relationships rarely stay virtual point to the idea that the virtual setting of texting becomes simply just another place where partners get to exercise their romance for each other, only to be further “consummated” perhaps by a face-to-face contact.    Data gathering for this research revealed a noteworthy number of respondents who engage in a purely virtual textual relationship. A further investigation of this occurrence will be able to highlight the capacity of texting as a relationship gadget. Long distance relationships sustained by this technology also provide a good ground for the exploration of the text messaging’s potentials as communication tool.     References    Lallana, Emmanuel.

"2007","Going Live","&#x0D;         &#x0D; &#x0D;  Introduction   Australia’s mobile communications industry has been slower to embrace the convergence of digital communication technology compared to other areas of the Asia-Pacific region, in particular Japan. However, the introduction of new mobile networks and spread of broadband (albeit still limited in some areas) has given Australians opportunities to experience the new technosocial communications. As a result mobile communication resources have become embedded within a sociocultural infrastructure that is at once mobile, personalised and consumerist. This paper examines how the iGeneration (or ‘Internet Generation’, those born in the first half of the 1980s and who were the first to grow up in a networked and communications media driven society) of young Australians have taken up and embraced the mobile technologies as part of their everyday sociability.    This journal issue is concerned to understand the significance of the convergence of mobile media. In this paper ‘mobile’ is taken to refer to the range of digital media that are owned and used by the iGeneration. These can include mobile phones, laptops, computers alongside an array of other digital social software and Web 2.0 resources such as email, Social Networking Systems (SNS), e.g. Facebook, that enable individuals to situate themselves and communicate across their social networks. The discussion that follows will touch on all of these mobile communication resources. It is argued that these should be seen as more than technical tools, as they offer a constant ‘tether’ to personalised and intimate connections (Ito et al, 2005). This in itself is significant because the emphasis is on a digitally mobile and connected sociability rather than any single device or piece of software. It will be concluded that this connected sociability means that for the iGeneration there is a seamless movement across what has been previously depicted as an off/online and disembodied dichotomy.    Researching the iGeneration   The paper draws on the data from 40 in-depth and open-ended interviews with undergraduate students who were in the last term of their first year at University in Australia in 2006. The conventions of anonymity have been followed to ensure that no individual may be identified. All interviews were digitally recorded (with permission) and detailed analysis undertaken utilising AtlasTi.  The analysis involved identifying themes and issues as they emerged from reading and re-reading of the data.    This group was chosen as they had established non-university social networks and new connections amongst university peers. The focus on what constitutes one of the more privileged sections of young people in terms of education, if not material resources, is appropriate in a study that seeks to explore those who are likely to be able to take advantage of innovative communications technology. Extracts from the interview data for this paper, are not intended to be representative, but rather are used for illustrative purposes.    Mobile Life   The diffusion of communications media has become ubiquitous amongst the iGeneration who are socially, temporally and spatially mobile and likely to immerse themselves in their social connections. This is a generation that has been said to “inhabit a different world” (Muller), where seemingly unregulated flows of information and methods of staying in touch with others ‘situate’ social lives as part of mobile sociability. Part of this more mobile sociability is the crossover between global and localised connections. Indeed, globalisation theorists have emphasised how the world is characterised by the flows of such information. Urry has paid particular attention to the forms of mobility that take place in a society characterised by the exchange and sharing of information and communication practices. This paper has a narrower focus and is concerned with what might be thought of as ‘local’ communicative practices between people situated in the same city and at the same, but dispersed, institutions. Mobile communications technology takes on an increasingly ‘invisible’ sociotechnological power that underlies the structure and shapes the experience of everyday sociability and relationships (Graham). Identified as “Digital Natives” by Prensky these individuals ‘thrive’ on their constant connectivity to one another. The following quote reflects the sentiments of many of the students interviewed:     I would never be without my phone, or at least having some way of being in touch with my friends. People tend to have ties everywhere now and I find that I am always in touch at the click of a button anytime. (Jon)     Key to social interaction for the iGeneration is to be constantly ‘switched on’ and available to others. Significantly, the mediated aspects of mobile technology means that social connections are valued for their ‘liveness’, whereby interactions are expected to take place in ‘real time’. In this way the iGeneration have become both the producers and consumers of ‘live’ content where personal engagements are ‘active’. This ensures that individuals are (and are seen to be) socially and digitally engaged. The new social practices that form part of an ‘on-the-go’ and ‘ever-current’ lifestyle means that to be ‘in touch’ has taken on a new symbolic and social form. All 40 of the students interviewed mentioned that they could not ‘imagine’ being detached from their social networks, or without some form of communication device on their person. The relationship between previously defined on and offline lives, or ‘real’ and ‘virtual’ situations are not separate entities in this context. Instead they are inextricably linked together as the individual is continually socially connected. Individuals are part of a constant present-ness and engagement to what is experienced as a lived or ‘worldspace’, rather than static ‘real’/’virtual’ world duality (Steinberg cited by White). As a result members of the iGeneration have to maintain two active and dynamic social presences, one that is ‘real’ world and the other that is virtual. They are always ‘situated’ in both their embodied and disembodied digital lives, and yet this is a duality that many do not consciously recognise as they move ‘seamlessly’ across different venues for sociability. In order to remain ‘up-to-date’ communication strategies are employed, as one student explained:      Things are changing so fast, like you go away for just one day and you are just so out of the loop, things change continually and it’s nice to be part of that. It’s hard if you miss a message because then you are behind and don’t know what’s going on… you have to continue to make the effort if you want to stay in touch. (Kim)     In Goffman’s classic analysis of face-to-face interaction he revealed the complexity of social communication and the nuanced use of ‘props’ and ‘backstage work’. In a similar fashion the mediated and real time interaction amongst the iGeneration is full of symbolic meanings and rituals. Ironically in what is often thought of as a disembodied sociability, where time and place cease to matter, it is the immediacy or live presence that is valued. Thus social life rotates around the emergence of a set of continually updated communications between individuals. Social relationships are ‘reworked’ as mobile communications introduces a new layer of social connectiveness. The process of communicating with someone is not just about what is expressed, but includes a set of subjective meanings as to the ‘whom’ an individual is and value of a relationship. Successful communication and development of relations through technology require the engagement of the self with shared social conventions and representations. Mobile technology has enabled a whole generation to mobilise relationships and connections whilst ‘on the move’ in a way that strengthen social bonds and facilitates a sense of social connectedness (Wei and Lo).   Getting to Know Each Other    For members of the iGeneration traditional forms of social meetings, and indeed settings, have become modified to take into account constant social connectivity. Students employ technologies to provide new ways of ‘getting-to-know’ others and to develop relationships. In particular, SNS is used to find out about potential new friends by drawing on the profiles and connections that are displayed on resources such as Facebook. Profiles involve the creation of a virtual ‘identity’ that represents an individual and may include digital photographs, music, a detailed self-description, lists of interests and of other ‘friends’ etc. Sites such as Facebook are popular because (at the time the research was undertaken) they require an email address from an academic institution in order to join. Consequently, users trusted the information displayed on these sites and rarely questioned whether the descriptions that they read were accurate (Jones and Soltren). Not only would it be seen as breaking communicative norms to, for example fabricate an identity on Facebook, it would also be a fabrication that would be difficult to maintain across the various media that are in use. Indeed it would be ultimately pointless in terms of a sociability that moves across media and between the virtual and non-virtual domains. Such sites are geared to the student population and it is often taken-for-granted that amongst students that they will have a Facebook profile. Reflecting this university clubs and societies distribute notices of events and so forth through Facebook. Individual profiles may also display mobile phone numbers and other points of contact so that the online descriptions of the self are linked to other forms of connection. As this Melbourne student explains, these resources provide new means of ‘getting to know’ others.      The way in is different now if you are getting to know someone, before maybe you went out a few times and got to know their circle of friends, but now you can check out their MySpace profile, or send them a message on Facebook BEFORE you meet up. Just by messaging each other you know that there’s no awkwardness or danger of gaps in conversation before you get together. (Tom)     In effect the individual is digitally represented in a range of digital spaces so that a stranger can imagine or construct a sense of the ‘real’ person without ‘knowing’ or engaging with them. Such imaginings represent an important means of being on familiar terms with others and the ‘social value’ or individuals ‘place’ within a social network (Gotved). In the early stages of becoming acquainted with someone the status of the individual was related to the how frequently they were contacted and the form of interaction that took place. As noted earlier Goffman’s (1978 [1959]) work is useful as social ceremonies and rules for interaction can be detected although these are often taken-for-granted unless people are prompted to talk about how they communicate with others. They are perhaps best exemplified by the following descriptions from students talking about how they ‘got-to-know’ one another at the beginning of the university term:     When you are getting to know someone it’s interesting to see if they’ll message you or call, then your like ‘oh he’s a caller’ and can go from there. (Emma)       If I don’t know the person well I like to text, I am not good on the phone and so it creates a way to say ‘hi’ without the danger of awkward gaps. Then you find yourself messaging back and forth and can meet up later… (Katie)       You have to play to their agenda otherwise you never hook up. (Stu)       Instant messaging like on MSN or texts or whatever totally helps with getting to know someone. Before you meet up you can find out whether you’ll get on or not and whether it’s worth you while meeting up. Kind of like a filtering process. (Dan)     This mediated process may involve text messages, emails and mobile calls before individuals meet offline. Members of the iGeneration therefore use an integrated set of devices and software resources to initiate and maintain friendship networks. In effect the often-rich descriptions created in SNS reflect a visualisation of what Bourdieu has described as ‘habitus’. This notion of habitus, that can basically be seen as set of acquired dispositions is appropriate, as “when habitus encounters a social world of which it is the product, it is like a “fish in water” ... it takes the world about itself for granted” (Bourdieu and Wacquant 127). This neatly describes how the iGeneration incorporates mobile communications technology into their everyday lives.   An Etiquette for Mobility   The ‘rules’, attitudes and expectations, that come into play as part of these new mobile communication practices continue to remain tied to a recognised and preconceived social ordering. Indeed, one of the most important aspects of this kind of mobile communication is the adherence to a set of social rules through which individuals continually control the process of interaction itself. This includes for example, the pace of communication, when to text, to make a voice call, or to email, and so forth. Galloway has argued that there is a “decidedly playful” aspect to mobile interaction. However, a range of communicative strategies underwrites this ‘play’ as periods of non-contactability have to be ‘justified’ or explained. If such episodes are not explained these can become problematic, generate misunderstandings or cause anxieties within networks and emergent relationships. Indeed, the “simple fact of carrying a mobile phone generates in the carrier the expectation of being immediately available” (Licoppe and Heurtin 100). For this reason a sense of disappointment, or cause for concern, may be experienced if an individual receives for example no text messages for a period of time. Amongst those students who were in regular contact with one other a set of what can be thought of as ‘communicative regimes’ is negotiated. These arise out of social practices for connectivity that are part of virtual and face-to-face meetings. Such negotiations may be largely implicit but occur out of a shared sense of ‘knowing’ the other.  Actions or non-actions such as not answering a voice call or responding to a message straight away can be seen as a social distancing. For example, a student talked about how he always immediately returned a text message to his housemate because “it was expected” and to delay a response without an explanation would not be seen as an appropriate response to a “close mate” (Riley). Consequently communication regimes are developed around relationships and may be layered in terms of status within a peer group. For the iGeneration such practices reflect what in pervious times would have been thought of as etiquette. It is interesting to note that at the time of writing this paper there were 11 global groups with some 2,870 members on Facebook dedicated to what is described as ‘Facebook etiquette’.    Conclusion    A purpose of this paper is to suggest that recent changes in the provision of information and communications services in Australia have created new opportunities for an iGeneration to incorporate the technologies within their everyday lives. There are similarities here with the practices found amongst young people in Japan, South Korea and other counties that have some of the most advanced publicly available communications infrastructures (Ito et al). It is worth noting that 3rd Generation mobile phones, and video technologies are less common in Australia, hence future convergence remains open to speculation and dependent upon improved network infrastructures and marketing. The emphasis in Australia is on the seamless use of different mobile communications technologies and the embedding of these within broader social practices. The convenience and ‘pocketability’ of communications devices has become one of the most important innovations for an iGeneration that desires communication, information and entertainment accessible in the palm of their hand, a first step “towards a digital paradise” (Standage). However, care has to be taken to differentiate between media and marketing hype and actual social practices.    Commentaries and research in the early days of the Internet tended to focus on the possibilities it offered to escape the fleshy body through the screen into new identities, genders and bodily forms (Turkle; Haraway). While there are resources such as Second Life that provide a means to escape form the embodied self the main concern of the iGeneration is to promote sociability across the digital and real worlds. One reinforces and reflects the other so that the virtual self is always anchored in the embodied self. It is the convergence of the self through such representations that whilst not exactly embodied in a physical sense refer to a ‘real’ physicality and presence. This suggest that in terms of social practices for the iGeneration the virtual/place dichotomy is unhelpful and as Daniel Miller and Don Slater note “we need to treat Internet media as continuous with and embedded in other social spaces” (5).   The convergence of mobile communicative resources highlighted in this paper and their embodiment into social practices suggests that users may have little more to gain in terms of sociability from, for example, streaming video on mobile phones. The emotive experience of being ‘in touch’ with one another remains a fundamental amongst the iGeneration who draw upon a range of mobile media and social software to form and sustain interactions. Such connections are conducted through a more or less nuanced set of communicative regimes that move across what for them is a seamless landscape of mediated and off line resources and relationships.

"2007","Superstition or Modernity?","&#x0D;         &#x0D; &#x0D;  This paper is sponsored by Asia Culture Academy, Seoul, South Korea.   Introduction   The belief in the magic of numbers can be found everywhere in Asian cultures. For instance, in the present Chinese culture: people are very superstitious about numbers that are divided into lucky (e.g. 8) and unlucky (e.g. 4) ones.  From the date people choose to get married to license plate numbers of cars, the preference to lucky numbers in social life suggests that certain numbers are culturally more valuable than others. Coincidently or not, in Korea, there are also lucky numbers, like 7, which are believed to bring good luck, and bad numbers like 4, which are widely avoided.   More recently, with the rapid diffusion and penetration of mobile phones in China, the superstitious claims based on numbers have found a hotbed in the new technology. These superstitious claims based on numbers have found another outlet in these new technologies. The enthusiastic embrace of mobile phones and the widespread invocation of lucky mobile phone numbers have become a trendsetting popular culture in China. In 2006, a mobile phone number that ended with the digits 8888, and was enlightened and sanctified by abbots in Shaolin Temple was auctioned for 81,000 Yuan.    When the mobile phone has become an icon of China’s accelerated twin processes of modernization and globalization, the social craze for lucky mobile phone numbers seem to signal an opposite wave towards rationality, the core ideology of modernity.  In this context, it is legitimate to ask: Is the unflinching belief in lucky mobile phone numbers a continuity or renewal of Chinese traditional culture? Is the mysterious ethnoscape a manifestation of sub-cultures against modernization?   Greatly influenced by Chinese Confucianism, Korea bears cultural proximity to China to certain extent. However, in South Korea, where over half of the entire population use a mobile phone (Kim), the belief in lucky numbers has not so extensively penetrated into the mobile phone market. Thus, South Korea seems to provide a mirror for investigating Chinese society in terms of continuity and changes as far as mobile phone and lucky numbers are concerned.    This qualitative research tries to explore the socio-cultural roots of the social craze for lucky mobile phone numbers in China. Can such phenomenon be found outside of China in other locations in the region?   Whilst in Korea on an Asia Cultures Academy fellowship I began to observe some similarities between Chinese and Korean relationships to numbers and superstition. Both countries boast high mobile phone penetration rates and are centres for the manufacturing, production and exporting of global mobile technologies. Both countries, also, demonstrate particular modes of contextualising the mobile device into everyday life. During this Korean fellowship, I was prompted by these observations to conduct a qualitative cross-cultural comparison between individuals in both China and Korea to ascertain what types of rituals and associations could be paralleled. This sample study is not meant to be indicative of all Chinese or Korean experiences but, rather, a meditation on some of the ways in which tradition is used to localise and domesticate mobile technologies.    In tracing the continuity and changes of the social practice of lucky numbers, I take South Korea, which has a certain cultural proximity to China, as a comparison with China for this study. The findings, which were based on semi-structured interviews with informants from both China and South Korea, suggest that this invented tradition is a consequence of severe social transformation and the rise of consumerism in China. My analysis also reveals that the invented tradition of lucky mobile phone numbers is not a superstition against rationality, but a manifestation of modernity.   Literature Review   1. Traditions and Invented Tradition   Traditional Chinese culture has a whole system of supernatural claims ranging from an individual’s birth, marriage, and death (such as geomantic omen, eight characters about one’s birth, etc.). As far as numbers are concerned, 3, 5, and 9 are culturally favored numbers: 3 is the most prominent figure which generates everything on earth according to Taoism; 5 means five essential elements of the cosmos and was incorporated into the theories of Chinese herbalism; 9 is a homophony with longevity which is a basic component of Fu Lu Shou culture (material secularism).    However, the traditionally favored numbers 3 and 5 do not stand out as lucky numbers in the everyday lives of most contemporary Chinese people. In an age dominated by market economy thinking, 6, 8, and 9 are more frequently regarded as lucky numbers.  Among these, 8 is the luckiest, and is adulated for its power to bring good fortune and generate wealth.    Although the belief in the magic power of words has existed in Chinese culture for a long time, the social craze for lucky numbers is a recent phenomenon. It originated in Hong Kong and Guangdong Province, right after the open-up policy, which itself signaled a nationwide shift towards the pursuit and worship of wealth and fortune. Unlike the Western belief in the number 13 as an ominous sign, which is deeply rooted in the history of Christianity, the current Chinese numerology is originally eradiated from a provincial/local culture to the whole country and diasporas Chinese. The basis for associating numbers with auspice mainly lies on pronunciations or homophony. For instance, in Cantonese, the number of 8 sounds the same with “fortune” (发). The number of 6 sounds like the word for “to flow” (溜) which means “everything goes smoothly”.    Applying the concept of “invented traditions”, the seemingly traditional superstitions in lucky mobile phone numbers are seen as being constructed and emerging within a datable period with great rapidity (Hobsbawm and Ranger). “The peculiarity of ‘invented’ traditions is that the continuity with it [its past] is largely fictitious” (Hobsbawm and Ranger 1).  Hobsbawm further argues that invented traditions occur more frequently at times of dramatic social transformation when old traditions are evaporating. Indeed, the ongoing social economic reforms in China appears to have uprooted individuals from “the hold of traditions”, resulting in a social “anxiety” (Giddens 17-39).   In this context, religion and supernatural claims are practices of daily habits which relate to “ontological security”, one of the key concepts elaborated by Anthony Giddens. He also points out that “creativity, which means the capability to act or think innovatively in relation to pre-established modes of activity, is closely tied to basic trust. Trust itself, by its very nature, is in a certain sense creative, because it entails a commitment that is a ‘leap into the unknown,’ … “. (41) Hence, associating numbers with fortune is closely associated with ontological security and control of anxiety.    2. Colonialization of Life-World and Symbolic Tokens   The Chinese and Korean terms for the mobile phone, shou ji and hyu dae pon, respectively meaning the hand phone, indicate its “portability” and “personal accessory” to human bodies that enable a person to stay within their social networks anytime, anywhere (Ito). Inasmuch as the mobile phone affords person-to-person connectivity (Wellman) and increases individuality (Fortunati), it also establishes itself as an instrument of self-expression or expression of individuality. In China, the connection between digits and individuality is strengthened by commercial agents in the process of global consumerism.    As a dimension of modernity, the essence of capitalism is the process of consumerism or commoditization that established itself as “the cultural logic of late capitalism” (Jameson). The penetration of the flow of capital into the areas of culture and unconsciousness heralds a transition from use value and exchange value to “symbolic value” by which the “real” has been reduced to the free-floating and self-referential signs of its existence (Baudrillard; cf. Turner).   It seems appropriate here to recall what Karl Marx foretold two centuries ago, that when post-traditional society experienced a commercialization of traditional cultures and values, people would eventually live in a society where “all that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned” (6). To be sure, the free market principle “opens the world’s spiritual arena as an opportunity for spiritual exploitation” and appropriation (York). Thus, the modern age experiences a process of demystification and disenchantment.   Similarly, Habermas stresses the corrosive effects of the state and the market on the socio-cultural life-world. He deals with the “colonization of the life-world,” arguing that cultural consumption and “pulverisation” of the cultural sphere may lead to the decline of public sphere and cultural impoverishment (555). “Commodification is one of the “marks of colonization when play the primary role in the the action-coordination of any life-world institution” (Cohen and Arato 135). The colonialization of this life-world is pervasive and intangible, resulting in a situation where people emancipated from traditional ties and institutions become dependent upon the market “in all dimensions of living” (Beck 131-135).    The pursuit of lucky mobile phone numbers can be viewed as a form of “conspicuous consumption”, associated with social status (Veblen 68-101) and presentation of social identity.  In this way, lucky mobile phone numbers are endowed with social meanings in respect to social distinction and “impression management” (Goffman 249-255). As such, mobile phone numbers function as “symbolic tokens” to a certain extent (Giddens 18). This process manifests the disembedding mechanism of modernity (Giddens).   Thus, based on the symbolic values constructed and recognized by the mobile phone market and consumers, the consumption of intangible commodity like lucky mobile phone numbers enables us to investigate the hybrid interaction between the global trend of consumerism and the utilization of local, traditional cultural resources. As consumers of commodities where the global and local are thus interconnected, mobile phone users achieve hybrid identities. Hopefully, “where there is consumption there is pleasure, and where there is pleasure there is agency” (Appadurai 7). From this perspective, we may see the opposing orientations between the colonialization of life-world and the autonomy of individual actors.    Methodology   The research presented here is exploratory and qualitative in its approach. Semi-structured interviews and convenience sampling are applied. Specifically, 10 Chinese informants and 10 Korean informants were selected based on the balance of their gender. Semi-structured interviews with Chinese informants were conducted via online, using in particular the internet-based instant chatting service OICQ (A popular Internet chat software in China).   The on-line interview is effective since informants are able to negotiate and seek clarification with interviewers when they fail to understand questions, while interviewers are also empowered to delve into detailed issues though instant chatting.  Alternatively, semi-structured interviews with Korean informants were carried out face-to-face. Two versions of questionnaires (both in English and Korean) were provided and informants were given the choice of answering in either language.   Semi-structured interviews were chosen mainly for the purpose of overcoming language barriers (in the case of Korean informants), and spatial restraints (in the case of Chinese informants, where I was able to include informants from both southern and northern provinces).   One limitation of the present research method was the age distribution of potential informants who were familiar with the use of the chatting service OICQ. That is, the age bracket of Chinese informants for this research was limited to 25 to 38, since most OICQ users tend to belong to this younger cohort. Thus, I was not able to compare the difference between older and younger generations.   Findings and Discussion   1. Personal vs. Social   Previous studies reveal that the mobile phone is essentially an individual technology. As the mobile phone affords person-to-person connectivity (Wellman) and increases individuality (Fortunati), it establishes itself as a way of expressing personal identity. Interviews in China and South Korea show similar results. Both groups of informants have invented ways to personalizing mobile phone numbers.   For example, Sungniang, a Korean graduate student put out her mobile phone and showed me through the keypad how some of her friends’ mobile phone numbers were made special:     One of my friend has a number specially arranged into a form of diamond, you see, 2684. Another [friend] has a number just in opposite order, and also in a form of diamond: 2486. Another has a number ordered to a Korean alphabet L, that is 1478. And some other friend whose family name is Kim, chose her mobile phone number: 1236, which is in the form of the Korean alphabet ﹃, the first syllable [of her family name].     Although 7 is regarded by all Korean informants as a lucky number due to the Western influence, it should be pointed out that in Korea, mobile phone users are allowed to choose the last four digits free of charge when they purchase mobile service. This is significant because more personal and diverse spaces are available when the digital resources are not mobilized and utilized by collective forces. Thus, many mobile phone users deliberately select numbers that are personally significant and coincide with their birthdays or marriage anniversaries. Most of my Korean informants state that the appreciated mobile phone number is the one easy-to-remember.     [My mobile phone number] is related with my phone at home. [My] house phone number is: 9972, then my phone number is: 9961. Of course if it is just the same with my house phone number, it would be better. But that number was not available when I registered to KTF [one of the mobile service providers in South Korea].     On the other hand, there are also cases among Chinese informants who associate personal meanings with their mobile phone numbers. A 33-year-old anthropologist says:     I don’t want to spend extra money on selecting a distinguished mobile phone number. But I will try to choose a significant one among the free choices. My current mobile phone number is meaningful because it is 5165, pronounced like ‘I desire 65’ which is the year my husband was born. Therefore, these four digits bear the weight of my love to him. I like the number very much. (Yanzi)     However, most of Chinese informants highly evaluate the number of “8”.  For example, one informant, a PhD-holding associate professor, admitted that she is quite superstitious and adores the number of “8” without particular reasons:      My mobile phone number ***8776685, sounds like ‘as a wife, I will make a big fortune smoothly’. I do believe in the number of 8 and 6. No reason! No…And 4 is a taboo to me. I will pay extra money to get the number I like. And this number is the one I really like and will not change it wherever I go. (Hua Xi)     Both groups of Chinese and Korean informants were asked what their impressions would be of a set of mobile phone numbers ending with 8888 (in the case of China), or 7777 (in the case of Korea), which are the luckiest numbers in their respective cultures. Their answers were dramatically and systematically different. Most Korean informants considered phone numbers with “7777” as little more than an easily remembered number, whereas their Chinese counterparts regarded phone numbers with “8888” as a sign of high social status. Apart from acknowledging that the host is probably quite rich, half of the Chinese informants went as far as trying to infer the implicit meaning of the number they were shown:     This guy is probably a business man, and superstitious and traditional. He pays much attention to business and [is] little bit unconfident. (Yanzi)       This guy must be an extremely successful man (niu ren). (Liu Hui)       This is really a nice number. I feel quite amazed, ah! This guy must be a very capable man. I wonder why he has this number. (Feng er)      Their answers to this question reveal that this particular number is quite impressive, since they all assign positive associations with it in terms of identity and social status:     It seems to me that mobile lucky number indicates one’s social identity. People unconsciously or consciously choose something, and these [imply] their desires and expectations out of their sub-consciousness. (Yanzi)       Lucky numbers are convenient to remember and sometimes they represent our identity. Generally, people who have better and broader social relations tend to have better numbers. For example, my rich friends have numbers like 6789, 0789, 3488, 4588. And my own number is 3488, same with my motorcycle number. (Lee xian)     While there are similarities in how lucky numbers are given attention among different cultures such as China and South Korea, differences related to the social practices and functional consequences connected to these lucky numbers are much more striking and thought-provoking. In South Korea, there’s no such a thing as number selection fee. The lucky numbers are open to all mobile phone users. Korean mobile phone users more likely personalize their mobile phone numbers. Thus, the merits of luckiest number of 7 in Korea are not collectively adored or pursued, remaining no more than a lucky number.   However, in China, lucky numbers have become a scarce resource, meaning that capital determines their distribution.  Indeed, the social craze for lucky numbers is further legitimized and promoted by commercial institutions. The number selection fee in China (practiced mainly by mobile card retailers) appropriates and exploits the symbolic values of numbers by associating them with social status. Within this socio-cultural context, people – whether they are superstitious or not – tend to recognize the social functions of those privileged numbers as markers of success and wealth.    2. Continuity and Change   The East Asian culture has developed by sharing common grounds with Chinese Confucianism ethics (Chong). Korean culture, under the influence of fundamental principles of ancient Chinese science and philosophy, bears much similarity to Chinese culture such as the deeply rooted paterfamilias social structures.  Moreover, 80% of Korean vocabulary has its origin in Chinese. As a result, Korean and Chinese languages have many words that have similar pronunciations. For example, the number of 4 is detested in both cultures because it sounds like death. One Korean informant tells me that Korean people are so superstitious about the number of 4 that they even try to avoid using 4 for labeling the floors or apartments in some buildings.    Meanwhile, we find similar evidence of this dislike in the response of this Chinese informant, an anthropologist.  She elaborates:      I particularly reject and hate numbers ended with 4. ‘54’ means ‘I will die’, ‘74’ means ‘[my/his] wife will die’, ‘24’ means ‘my son will die’. (Yanzi)     When people in both cultures have access to the selection of their preferred numbers either free or by means of payment, they spontaneously turn away from unlucky ones. For those Chinese informants who are less wealthy or not willing to pay extra fee, they more likely have numbers encoded with more unlucky ones. Nonetheless, these “victims” of the mobile service market demonstrate a positive creativity in interpreting the unlucky numbers.      I don’t mind having a number ended with 4444. Anyway, it’s special and easy to remember. I don’t want to spend money like water, you know, I cannot afford such a luxury. (Zhou Jia)     Inventing ways to associate unlucky numbers with positive interpretations is not a new or novel practice for Chinese people. For instance, the number of 4 should be interwoven into auspicious combinations such as “four seasons blessed with fortune” if it can not be avoided. This kind of creative combination greatly alleviates the anxiety felt by those individuals who are excluded from selecting more desirable number combinations due to financial constraints.   From this creative interpretation of the unlucky number, I gained new insight into the recent superstition surrounding the magical and mystical allure of the number of 8. Instead of being an ungrounded claim based on tenuous linkages between certain numbers and auspicious incidents, the popularization of lucky numbers is borne out of faddism and fetishism. Accordingly, instead of being overwhelmed by the uncontrollable unknown power, mobile phone users display their agency and autonomy in manipulating the arbitrary meanings of numbers, thus relieving their anxiety.     I believe in lucky numbers. My own number is 13**8888888. [The incident that makes me believe in lucky number is that] my colleagues have numbers ended 110 and 119, [which] greatly impressed clients. I think those who have more 8s more likely have better networking…They may spend a lot of money on the number, but in return, they may be rewarded by more profits. (Wei Xiao)     In the age of market economy, belief in lucky numbers is practical and material rather than superstitious. From a matter of pure belief or disbelief, the number of 8 becomes popular by giving off an aura of wealth that is adored and recognized by population across classes:     I don’t really believe in lucky numbers. My number ends with 8, because personally I like the [number of] ‘8’. It’s so cheerful. But I also don’t care if I have number ended with 4444 because it is easy to remember. You know, mobile phone number is related to your identity. Only rich guy will buy high-priced special number. Those who have number like ***88888 are certainly very rich people. (Wei Da)     This trend of fetishism becomes more visible if the historical social context if we consider the socio-historical context in which it emerged, as well as how it is related to changing social values. As a Chinese ballad goes: In 1950s, it was wise to marry a hero; in 60s, a poor peasant; in 70s, a military man; in 80s, a college graduate; in 90s, a rich guy. This enables us to trace back the dramatic changes of social values that have occurred in China in the last half a century. Especially from 1960s to 90s, severe social transformations have taken place during a transition from Cultural Revolution and planned economy to reforms and opening to the outside world. With the market economy develops in China, financial well-being becomes the priority in the agenda of the nation as well as individual families. Indeed, money becomes the only standard for measuring success in the present Chinese society.   Diachronically, the enthusiastic consumption of mobile phones in China is a continuation of popular worship at the altar of high-tech and material culture. In the 1980s, a man who as preparing for his wedding was expected to purchase “4 major items” (bicycle, watch, sewing machine and fan). On the one hand, while these 4 items have continued to change over time (TV, washing machine, refrigerator, and stereo set in 1990s) in tandem with societal and technological progress towards a more advanced and modern society, on the other hand, Chinese people have never failed to associate cultural and social meanings to the newly introduced technologies that become symbols of wealth, success, and social status. In a similar fashion, the intangible commodity of lucky mobile phone numbers has developed to function as a label of social distinction when the device permeated every strata of the population.   3. Imagining Success and Symbolic Tokens   The mobile phone has rapidly penetrated into every aspect of daily life due to its “portability” and power to connect a person to social networks anytime, anywhere (Ito). Different from “door-to-door connectivity”, the era of “person-to-person connectivity” suggests an increasing importance of mobile phone numbers as accesses of daily communication (Wellman).     In both cultures, informants show a similarity in their reluctance to change mobile phone numbers. One Korean informant Choe (female) says:     There is no reason for me to change my mobile phone number. All of my friends know my number. If I change, I will cause inconvenience to them and myself. I have to inform them all. Besides, I think I’m satisfied with this company’s service.     The Chinese informant Wei Xiao regards the mobile phone number as a core platform for his work:     I haven’t changed my number for 4 years. You know, if you change your number, it means you will lose some of the clients’ information. The more you change the number, the more possible you lose contact with some of them. If I stay in Shenzhen for my job, I will never change it. If I move to another city, it is quite possible for me to have a new number.     Indeed, increase in domestic migration within China has become the main reason that people will change their mobile phone numbers, in that roaming service charges are very expensive.      I constantly change my mobile phone number. Each time I move to a new place, I have to get a local service. I have had 3 numbers in the last two years. Actually, the cost of changing mobile phone number is very high. I lost contact with many of my friends in Beijing when I got a new number here in Changsha. The reasons for change are mainly because of migration to another city due to job-jumping. Sometimes, I also hope I can change my number if I don’t want to be harassed by people I don’t like. But the main reason is location [change]. (Yanzi)     A stable mobile phone number indicates the routine maintenance of social networks. By the same token, the frequent change of mobile phone numbers may lead to loss of contact and contract. To some degree, permanent mobile phone numbers even imply the user’s credibility. Mobile phone numbers are thus become symbolic tokens that bracket time and space. Considering the current trend where mobile phones are starting to be linked to personal services such as credit cards, library cards and certain kinds of VIP (membership rewards) cards, it is not illogical to predict that mobile phone numbers are poised to become even more tightly interwoven into the presentation of ones social identity.   In terms of mobile phone numbers as symbolic tokens, the difference is that in China, mobile phone numbers convey implied information beyond of mere connectivity. As discussed above, lucky mobile phone numbers are apparatus of impression management (Goffman); accordingly, they are a way of imagining success which has become important in determining or measuring an individual’s happiness:     Many rich bosses have these kinds of number. I think numbers also represent class and money. As far as I know, those rich bosses and government officials I met in my life tend to have more lucky numbers. I will not spend 10,000 yuan to have a lucky number. But, you know, if I am rich enough, I will buy that number too. Who knows? (Fenger)     The junior publisher works hard to become rich and successful:     I don’t really like my [present] mobile phone number. But you have to pay more for a good number. And I have to save every penny for my apartment amortization now. I guess I will pick up a good number ended with 88 if I make more money next year. Lucky mobile phone number is a game played by successful people only. I want to be successful, or at least to make such an impression. Ha ha. (Liu Hui)     Thus, mobile phone numbers function as symbolic tokens in the present Chinese society. Mobile phone numbers bracket time (because the steady mobile phone numbers indicate the accumulation and maintenance of social networks and the frequent change of phone numbers may result in loss of contact and contract) and space (because lucky mobile phone numbers offer an aura of success and power beyond of spatial restraints and across social classes). In this context, based on their symbolic values, the conspicuous consumption of lucky mobile phone numbers suggests a new social stratification or polarization in an economy market era.    Conclusions   The dual purposes of this study are to answer the question of whether a belief in lucky mobile phone numbers is an old superstition or a manifestation of modernity, and to explore the socio-cultural roots of the phenomenon. The findings not only support that this invented tradition is a part of the process of modernization, but also reveal how the particularistic conditions in China interact with the universal mechanism of modernity.   The complex interaction of the past and the present increases the difficulty in mapping out the contours of continuity and innovation of belief systems in numbers. However, the cases of China and South Korea, who have a certain cultural proximity but manifest different social practices regarding lucky mobile phone numbers, provides a valuable comparative perspective in exploring the socio-cultural roots and implications of the newly constructed social craze for lucky mobile phone numbers in China. In all, the dramatic difference between these two countries in terms of pursuing lucky mobile phone numbers suggests that this is an invented tradition that is itself a consequence of two key factors: severe societal changes and the legitimization of commercial agents in China.    First, the invented tradition (Hobsbawm and Ranger) in lucky mobile phone numbers has become highly fashionable trends in the popular culture of China because it is compatible with the ongoing social transformation in China. When a country is strongly driven to “build prosperous material civilization” and firmly determined to discard feudalistic religions or superstitions as unscientific and irrational ones, individuals and the society as a whole begin to seek for spiritual sources that can provide a sense of “ontological security” and stability (Giddens 35-69).    The fetishism and faddism of lucky mobile phone numbers in present Chinese society reveal that the social structural vacuum in imaginary domain is filled up by widespread worship of gods of fortunes. That is, associating numbers with fortune and interpreting of unlucky numbers positively are creative activities by which people are provided with ontological security. By selecting numbers, mobile phone users demonstrate autonomy and spontaneity in expressing their desire to command their future and fortune.    As discussed above, when the possession of wealth signifies success, lucky mobile phone numbers acquired as a form of conspicuous consumption become a way of imagining success. The social meanings of lucky mobile phone numbers in China thus suggest a national priority and social anxiety towards “being rich”. As a result, the old superstition in the magic of numbers is transformed into a new “superstition” related to “fortune” that is regarded as bulwark against insecurity and the unknown, especially in an era of social reforms.    Second, by exploring and exploiting symbolic values of lucky mobile phone numbers, commercial agents of mobile phone market assist in transforming the supernatural belief into cultural commodities. This is the very part of the colonialization of life-world (Habermas). When they are associated with culturally specific meanings, mobile phone numbers are empowered to connect a mobile phone user with his/her social identity. The dichotomy between tradition and modernity is blurred because of the colonialization of life-world when cultural resources are accessible to the principle of profit maximization. Therefore, rather than transforming a hierarchical society to a liberal one, this process demonstrates a new social stratification or polarization based upon the distribution of wealth and resource, which is also applicable to the distribution of mobile phone numbers.    The empirical research also reveals that belief in lucky numbers in old time is superstition, but now is rationality and a manifestation of modernity. The new “superstition” in wealth and re-sacralizing of commerce results in a real opposition between tradition and commercialism rather than between superstition and rationality. This suggests the universal mechanism of modernity and its concomitants such as global consumerism.   More specifically, on the one hand, the decision of selecting the lucky mobile phone number is part of individualization accompanying modernity (Beck); on the other hand, lucky mobile phone numbers are legitimized by commercial establishments which are no less than faces/images of modernity. As discussed above, lucky mobile phone numbers are often rationally used as a symbol of success and wealth to distinguish meanings of social status. In so doing, lucky mobile phone numbers become symbolic tokens that not only are used to maintain and develop social networks, but function to manage personal impression and convey meanings of social distinction. As symbolic tokens, mobile phone numbers transcend the restraints of time and space to certain degree, and thus manifest disembedding mechanism of modernity (Giddens). This indicates clearly that the invented tradition of the social craze for lucky mobile phone numbers is not a sub-culture of superstition against modernity, but a very expression of it.

"2007","Approaching the Mobile Culture of East Asia","&#x0D;         &#x0D; &#x0D;  What are commonly perceived as  ‘Western’ and ‘Eastern’ cultures differ greatly from food to communication, including the way one’s postal address is written, as aptly described by Uh-Ryoung Lee in Digilog Manifesto (89).  In the West, one’s name comes first, followed by the street address, city, state, and the country; in contrast, in the (North-) East, one needs to write their address in the completely reverse order, starting with the country name and ending with the person’s name. Yet, Lee further asserts, such disparity is annihilated in the World Wide Web, as each individual must uniformly write their address in the form of id@domain. However, such uniformity and/or convergence cannot be applied to the Internet as a whole; in fact, the situation is the opposite of that. Cultural traits of offline environments to which each user belongs affect those online and the reverse process occurs simultaneously; in other words, society develops technology as much as technology develops society. From a geographical perspective – although this is not the only and entirely valid way of cultural classification – there are qualities that are unique to East Asia, and this is true for each sub-geographical component of the region.    Convergence is a term that has been gaining increasing attention across the globe. Conceptually situated between technological and socio-cultural domains – as has been intensely debated between the technological and social determinists since the birth of computer mediated communication (CMC) – mobile culture is no exception. It is powered by inter-operable and multi-functional mobile telecommunication technologies, which are also becoming increasingly high functional especially via fixed-mobile convergence, interconnecting fixed and wireless broadband networks. Wide diffusion and convergence of digital communication technologies – wired and wireless – in recent years have resulted in the emergence of two key paradigmatic convergences: between technology and sociality, and between productivity and play. I will first elucidate these convergences; I will then discuss cultural characteristics of specific East Asian cultures, focusing on South Korea, China, and Japan.    I would like to clarify at the outset that it is not my intention to essentialise or generalise about a pan-East Asian culture. I believe that such an attempt is an unproductive and misinformed generalisation. This is especially so in the lexicon of today’s transforming global culture with the rising notion of networked-identity (see Boyd and Heer) and transnationalism. Instead, my general statements about cultural characteristics of East Asia derive from the results of my study on Cyworld, the most popular social-networking service (SNS) in Korea, in 2004. The study was inter-disciplinary in nature; it involved a quantitative analysis of one hundred randomly selected Mini-Hompies (Cyworld blogs) and twenty hybrid email questionnaires, which included a mixture of closed and open-ended questions. The results confirm that the basis of Cyworld’s success is not only in its accommodating newly forming individualistic predispositions of Korean youth, but also in its appeal to traditional attributes of collective Korean culture. From the initial motivations for joining to interactions within and attitudes toward Cyworld, users utilise and seek the existing and potential ways to communicate themselves in a traditional cultural context; for example, amalgamations of multimedia elements are used as a form of high-contextual social cue provision to express the user’s current status as the interdependent self within collective in-groups.    These findings can be further extrapolated to other East Asian cultures as evidenced not only in comparable traditions but also in some of the recent parallel techno-social developments in the region. Examples include the Korean Wave that has swept across Asia in recent years (see Shim on the Korean Wave and Chua Beng Huat on the emergence of East Asian identity through consumption of popular cultural products); and flourishing of SNSs that are based upon offline social networks – such as Cyworld and Mixi – showing strong collective in-group tendencies in the region. In this article, I conceptually base the findings from my earlier study to contextualise the mobile phone use in East Asia and conclude with an emphasis on three crucial elements of consideration in understanding mobile culture(s) of today.    Technology/Sociality   Though not designed purposely for computer-mediated or inter-cultural communication, one of the most frequently cited theories in the field of communication is the two communication models suggested by James Carey in which he proposes the transmission and ritual models of communication. According to the former model, communication is defined by such terms as imparting, sending, transmitting, and giving information to others, projecting communication as “the transmission of signals or messages over distance for the purpose of control” (Carey 15). The latter model, in contrast, is described by terms such as sharing, participation, association, fellowship, and the possession of a common faith. Unlike the former, this model is “directed not toward the extension of messages in space but toward the maintenance of society in time; not the act of imparting information but the representation of shared beliefs” (ibid. 18). At this point, however, it should be reminded that these two models are not to be perceived as opposing modes but rather as views neither of which “necessarily denies what the other affirms” (ibid. 21). Just as “a ritual view does not exclude the processes of information transmission … even writers indissolubly wedded to the transmission view of communication must include some notion … of ritual action in the social life” (ibid. 21).     In the domain of digital communication, Leaning (22) suggests that CMC entails participation in a social unit in which information (meaning) is constantly recreated, and thus the Internet should be “regarded as a social area or messages.” Consequently, online communication highlights the ritual view of communication, and functions as an extension of existing offline social networks, which supports Matei and Ball-Rockeach’s (410) claim that differences in social connection on and offline can be influenced by social contexts and by value orientations inherent in the individual’s cultural background. Conversely, because computer-mediated communication occurs in a “technological system,” technology reflects the social aspects of both the individual and community. This clearly demonstrates that researching digital communication should focus on techno-social contextualisation: the interplay between technological and social development, rather than the differentiation.   Productivity/Play   Carey’s communication models can also be applied to the productivity/play concept. Initially, the main use of CMC technologies was to efficiently facilitate and coordinate emergency tasks among geographically distanced individuals or groups (Liu), which corresponds to the transmission model of communication. In this case, the communication is initiated and conducted for a specific goal or a task, which is to share particular information. On the other hand, with an increased level of interactivity via multimedia communication, CMC has been proving to be more and more a social activity, involving the user as both the producer and consumer in a loop of distributed information construction process (see Jenkins; Rheingold; Mann and Niedzviecki). In particular, Mann and Niedzviecki (181) describe the effect of this process as “an entirely different kind of synergy between the individual and the community,” which emphasises the socio-emotional dimension of distributed digital communication.    Furthermore, such a process is clearly evident in the decreasing use of the term “media consumer” in today’s society, as the audience now acts as an active participant in the media production cycle in which the desired object of consumption is not only the product itself, but also, and more importantly, the experience. Bruns aptly frames the phenomenon as “produsage.” This term, according to Bruns, differs from Alvin Toffler’s now commonly used idea of “prosumers,” which denotes the advanced knowledge of consumers yet without altering their status as consumers. The most active produsers today, or “digital natives” in Prensky’s term, are undoubtedly the youth. Currently, and more so in the near future, these digital natives will be further empowered by the advancement of mobile network technologies, which allows ubiquitous multi-modal communication amongst individuals. Such mobile communication takes place regardless of, yet paradoxically in relation to, the user’s current spatiotemporal and social contexts as the communication concurrently takes account of the virtual – created in and through the mobile device – and the physical – where the user is physically located – realities. Reality construction, as proven in various fields of research, differs procedurally and configuratively from culture to culture.    Cultures of East Asia   Korea, China, and Japan share a traditionally collective (Hofstede), interdependent (Markus and Kitayama), and high-contextual (Hall) culture, as opposed to individual, independent, and low-contextual cultures, which are predominantly evident in the West. As East Asian nations, they are heavily influenced by Taoist, Buddhist, and Confucian ideologies and therefore often embrace rigid social hierarchy or class distinction, conformity, and dedication to one’s duties within one’s own position (study for students, for example). An illustrative case of this is the intense social focus on the university entrance exam in these countries. The most important cultural value is in keeping the harmony within one’s in-groups, in which the self is defined in relation to one’s significant others, or in-group members, and communicate in an implicit non-verbal manner. This is a more textual – and also ritual in Carey’s definition, as alluded earlier – way of communication, which assumes more demands on the listener to actively infer social cues implied in the message, as compared to explicit low-contextual, and transmissional communication. The following three cultural characteristics play particularly crucial roles in making East Asian culture unique:    Polychronic Perception of Time   According to Hall, low-context cultures focus on explicit linear communication, so time is managed and rationed through the use of schedules (Smith and Bond). On the other hand, a polychronic tendency is evident in many high-context cultures, in which harmonious maintenance of selective relationships is more valued over prompt time management. This temporal dimension becomes even more substantial when applied to the everyday context of mobile phone use. The mobile phone acts as a “remote control” that allows the user to switch from one reality to another by connecting the user to other people, applications, or contents. The omnipresent mobile phone embodies perpetual identity management. Clearly, this is a polychronic way of life. East Asian users’ familiarity with polychronism, therefore, is expected to lead to forms of interaction that are eminently dissimilar to those that occur in monochronic societies.   Interdependent Self-Definition   In most cases, it is possible to say – at least in theory – that each individual exists as a physically separate entity in society, yet retains their rights as a human being. This is to say that the significance of an individual, or a node in the human social network, is automatically accorded to the individual from their existence as a human being. However, the system of digital networks does not allow such automatic awarding of meaning to a particular node unless the node is “alive,” or “active,” in the network that it constitutes. The Internet consists of individual nodes interconnected in “an unconstrained, weblike way” (Berners-Lee 3).Therefore, nodes that are not in interconnection with other nodes within the network are considered not in existence from the network’s perspective, and “thus must be ignored (if it is not relevant to the network’s task), or eliminated (if it is competing in goals or in performance)” (Castells 15). This view of digital network configuration shares fundamental similarities with the concept of interdependent self-construals. In interdependent cultures, the self is primarily formed and sustained by its social environment (Kim 73). This is the fundamental aspect that is analogous to digital network systems. Naturally, implications regarding the acceptance and utilisation of digital communication are expected to be different in cultures with different predispositions within the independent – interdependent dichotomy.   Facework   As has been discussed in this article, Western and non-Western cultures can be fundamentally distinguished by applying the dialectic dimensions of collectivism–individualism, which subsequently relate to the interdependence-independence and high context–low context dimensions. Across these three key dichotomies, a disparity is found in the way self is defined in different cultures. Ting-Toomey and Kurogi’s face-negotiation theory highlights this phenomenon. While every individual endeavours to keep a relatively positive and respectable face in society, the key distinction lies in the objective of the maintenance of face, or in Toomey and Kuroi’s term, “facework” (188).   In individualistic cultures, the self remains the predominant focus of facework over others; therefore, the nature of facework is self-oriented in most communicative situations. Conversely, in collectivistic cultures, focus exists in duality: firstly to maintain one’s face as an appropriate member of the social network; and secondly, to save the faces of the significant others in a similar manner (Gudykunst and Matsumoto; Ting-Toomey and Kurogi). This particular aspect is manifested in many different customs of East Asia. In Chinese culture, this dual facework functions as one of the cardinal element of guanxi (关系), a central concept of social relation; in Japan, it is socially expected of a mature individual to have honne (本音) – true feelings that one is expected to keep inside only – and tatemae (建前) – socially expected face; in the case of Korea, nunchi (눈치) – ability to interpret others’ social cues – is an essential social component. What needs to be emphasised here is that the self that is constructed, sustained, and distributed via network technologies – the mobile phone provides a more immediate means than wired devices – is consequential to the user’s facework strategies. Hjorth and Kim’s study on young people’s performative gendered representation of the self on Cyworld is an exemplary case of such virtual facework.    Digital Youth of Asia   Youths have always played a significant role in the reception and production of new technological phenomena. In many cases, it was young people, especially females, who transformed the pragmatic purpose of the technology to essentially social purposes and avail themselves to new technologies as seen in the evolution of the mobile phone from a business technology to social necessity (see Matsuda; Miyata et al.; Okada). A tendency for value transformation is also evident in their increasing individualism and capitalist ideologies, as reported in Tesoro’s article. Na and Duckitt’s  study on cultural consensus and diversity shows similar findings, but some traditional values such as conformity and benevolence are mutually shared across generations and genders. This indicates that traditional collectivist and interdependent qualities still remain inherent in Asian youth culture.    My study of Cyworld shows that technological innovations are built upon existing social values, and further developed by youth to tactfully project both traditional and new facets of their identities. A similar observation is made in Weber’s analysis of identity negotiation of urban Chinese youth – “functional coexistence of individualistic and collectivist values systems” (347) – through Wei Hui’s semi-autobiographical novel Shanghai Baby. In the case of Japan, escapist and social deviance are found to be predominant results of youth’s struggle at the nexus between the traditional and new individualistic social values. Examples include Aoki’s photographic depiction of youth identity negotiation through Shibuya street fashion in Fruits and Fresh Fruits; Ito and Okabe’s  study, in which students are found to use their mobile phones to create virtual layers of reality separate from the traditionally rigid social hierarchy apparent in the physical reality; and Hikikomori phenomenon, a mental affliction affecting over 1 million young Japanese, of which sufferers typically lock themselves up in their rooms and only interact with digital media such as television and video games (Jones; Ogino; Murakami).    Mobile Phone: Access and Uses   According to a recent press release from Nokia, the global penetration rate of the mobile phone is expected to grow to three billion by 2008. Eighty percent of this growth will come from new growth markets, particularly China and Asia-Pacific region, which are expected to make up 50 percent of the next billion subscribers. These statistical data clearly confirm that the mobile phone is clearly now the most prominent universal form of wireless communication technology, especially with the global diffusion of 3G contents and applications.    From a macro, statistical perspective, each of the three nations shows a high level of technological access and presents unique areas of strengths in the sphere of mobile use. Japan, one of the global frontiers of technological developments, has been one of the most successful countries in mobile data penetration, especially since the introduction of i-mode by NTT Docomo in early 1999. Korea is catching up fast with an increasing 3G penetration rate, which currently exceeds 40% (3G). Considering the synergistic potential of national mobile phone manufacturers such as Samsung and LG with the nation’s high broadband penetration rate – one of the highest in the world – Korea presents an exciting research case as evident in recent technological developments such as DMB (Digital Multimedia Broadcasting) and WiBro (Wireless Broadband). China’s strength, on the other hand, lies mostly in the enormous number of mobile phone subscribers, which currently exceeds 400 million, making the nation the world’s largest mobile market (Gonsalves).    Low technological barrier of the mobile phone allows for no noticeable divergence in access to the multi-functional mobile technologies amongst many countries around the globe. This has been evidenced in the UN’s wireless universal connectivity initiatives to reduce the global digital divide in recognition of the mobile phone’s cost-effective deployment and hardware distribution (Wireless Internet Institute). Therefore, the uniqueness of East Asia in mobile access comes from the social access rather than technological; more specifically, it is in the robust social motivation and acceptance of the technology that distinguishes the region from the others. The mobile culture of Europe and the “keitai culture” of Japan, for example, do not only differ in names. Ericsson’s senior market analyst Atsuhiko Ohkita puts it this way: “In Europe, a mobile phone is still a phone … In Japan, the ke-tai means web access, e-mail, games, and so on – that’s the definition. Voice is just a very small part of the handset’s function” (Ericsson). Therefore, interpreting experiences that occur through the mobile phone necessitates a significantly increased focus on individual-level communication that takes account of socio-cultural and cognitive contexts.    Emergence of Mobile Media   Previous studies on the uses of the mobile phone showed proclivity to place a focus on empirical research on youth’s mobile use in various cultural backgrounds, including Japan (Ito and Okabe), UK (Berg, Taylor and Harper), and Finland (Oksman and Turtiainen). These studies present a surprisingly large number of similar (if not identical) findings, particularly in the magnitude of text messaging practice as compared to that of voice call. This provokes two assumptions: firstly, the cost of mobile messaging is generally lower and more controllable than voice calling; and secondly, factors such as lifestyle, established social norms and regulations make the act of text-messaging more appropriate than the act of making and receiving voice calls. A point that should be emphasised here is that mobile text messaging normally takes a form of linear interpersonal communication between two participants. However, rapid developments in wireless network and multimedia technologies – mobile Internet and DMB, for example – present additional dimensions to mobile communication beyond such communicative linearity. In a pragmatic sense, the era of mobile media has truly begun at least in some countries such as Korea, Japan, and the USA.   Two emerging areas in the growing mobile media research are personal identity formation and location-based applications. With the proliferation of social network sites – such as Cyworld and MySpace – and media sharing sites – such as Flickr and YouTube – came an escalating interest in research on visual self-projection online. Much of the literature on Korean mobile media is found in gender-related issues, with most of studies examining the young women’s use of camera phone (see Hjorth; Hjorth and Kim; D.-H Lee; Yoon). This frame of analysis then bifurcates into the gendered technology discourse and the male gaze in relation to feminine beauty.    Kim (Cited in Hjorth and Kim 51) claims that although the initial take up of the mobile phone was led by males, its flourishing, especially through social convergence via social network sites like Cyworld – was and still is pioneered by young females. Lee and Sohn (cited in D.-H. Lee) provide empirical support for Kim’s standpoint by showing that women are more active in adopting multimedia functions than men. Lee  states that there is evidence that women are aware of the male gaze and conform to gender roles by means of performative identity presentation through digital imaging. However, the fact that women do not passively consume culture but actively participate in production, Lee asserts, signifies an optimistic start in gender equality in traditionally patriarchal Korean society. The issue of gender performativity in Korea has been discussed in various contexts, ranging from plastic surgery (Woo) to mobile photography (Hjorth) in which women are found to actively perform their gender identity through aesthetics – physical alteration or creating the atmosphere of “cuteness.” Paradoxically, women were also found to be more comfortable with and actively engage in projecting their individuality through mobile photography than men. Okabe and Ito’s  ethnographic study on camera phone use in Japan also demonstrates more individual or “intimate” approach to mobile imaging. They attribute this propensity to the portable, ubiquitous, and private/selectively shared quality of the mobile phone.    The freedom of mobility afforded by the mobile phone did not nullify the spatial dimension of its use. Instead, it brought about an increased attention to and attempts for connecting mobility and space and objects within the space. In his presentation “Pervasive Mobile Gaming,” Julian Bleeker argues that pervasive games can invoke increased awareness to objects and subjects that are often ignored, and thus provoke new social perspectives (Cited in Harvey 2). One example of this development is Silverstone and Sujon’s Urban Tapestries project, which explores the inter-relations amongst the human, technology, and space. Using a wireless location-based application called Urban Tapestries, the user is able to embed textual or audio narratives to places that inspired them. The user can also view and interact with other users’ narrative trails on the map, thereby creating a multi-layered shared history of the city. The noted findings of this project are as follows:    Human-technology relationship is both liberating and constraining. Technologies as extensions of the self are now crucial parts of one’s identity. However, humans still desire control over technologies. Creativity emerges from playing. Urban Tapestries is one way to create cultural “meanings” through the mutual relationship amongst people, technology, and place.   In a different context, following their previous work on mobile camera use in Japan, Okabe et al. present another anthropological study that is ostensibly counter-conceptual to the former: investigation on the location-specific photo taking and modding culture of Japanese youths, at the centre of which is Purikura, the sticker photo booth. The studies of Silverstone and Sujon and Okabe et al. are inventive and up-to-date empirical efforts to examining playful interactions connecting the human, technology, and space, in relation to (or in contrary to) mobility. They also address an important role that sociality and pleasure play in user-led cultural productions. However, they do not – as is the case with the current literature in general – offer much needed insight into some fundamental questions: what does “mobility” and “playfulness” mean to the user? What is the motivation for participation? How is the participation negotiated in every context? And what are the implications of such participatory culture for technological and socio-cultural domains?    These are some of the questions that need to be answered in order to understand and construct the future of the multifarious mobile culture(s), which is found in the area of convergence amongst multiple layers of virtual and physical realities. These realities can be constructed and entered into via a network device – both wired and wireless – on a voluntary basis. Here, the two converging dichotomies of technology/social and productivity/play become unequivocally explicit. By entering the mobile media network, the user automatically turns into an active node of the network society, a participant in transforming the ever-evolving media ecology of various strata. As Jenkins et al. assert, “it matters what tools are available to a culture, but it matters more what that culture chooses to do with those tools” (7). In studying transformations of contemporary society, there are at least three fundamental elements of consideration stemming from today’s prevalent and expanding mobile interactivity: mobility, playful participation, and techno-social contextualisation. The intersection of these elements is precisely where the fundamental sources of future socio-cultural transformations can be found, and therefore where rigorous inter-disciplinary explorations must take place.

"2007","Understanding the Design of Mobile Social Networking","&#x0D;         &#x0D; &#x0D;  Introduction   Exhausted after a working day, a fatigued New Yorker may be desperate to find a place to relax and meet friends. With the help of Dodgeball and a series of text messages back and forth on his mobile phone, he immediately knows that two of his buddies are in a pub three blocks away from his office. Across the Pacific Ocean, in Tokyo, Japan, a group of twenty-something girls may be also exploiting the similar service, ImaHima, to check out their friends’ location, activity and mood while they are arranging a spontaneous meeting on their way out.  In Taiwan, a large number of mobile users, young and old, are involved in EzMoBo’s EzDating and EzFriend to express themselves and make acquaintances via texts, pictures and video clips. Aggregately, this is how the emerging mobile social networking service works.    Given the relative youth of mobile social networking, and the fact that few extant studies are dedicated to this subject, a case study of exploratory nature is deemed a preferred approach in order to understand its use. There are several reasons explaining the selection of the Taiwanese case-EzMoBo. In terms of evidence, Taiwan’s mobile penetration rate was 97.37% in 2005 and the SMS volume reached 2,796 million in the same year (“Penetration Rate” 1; “SMS Volume” 1). In addition, 36.4% of all Taiwanese mobile phone users have used the mobile phone for non-voice services, such as Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) and SMS (“Proportion in the Number” 1). These figures generally represent mature mobile culture in Taiwan. In other words, the mobile use in Taiwan has played a role in human communication in various aspects. This fact makes Taiwan a perfect social setting to observe the adoption of mobile social networking and extrapolate it to the explanation of similar cases in other cultural contexts. Particularly, EzMoBo was selected due to its large user base of 400,000 as well as its relatively developed mobile social network application since 2001.    As the enquiry unfolds, four major components are found to be associated with the use of mobile social networking, which are Taiwanese cultural contexts, personalized mobile communication, the formation of unique mobile community and the value of visual content and texting. When it comes to the adoption of a new communication technology, a connection should be made to users’ existing and typical media uses. In Taiwan, media culture is characteristic of highly popular uses of mobile phones, BBS (bulletin board system) and online gaming. Through contextualization of these three aspects of Taiwanese media uses, a better understanding of EzMoMo’s design can be achieved. It is also reasonable that, due to this consideration, the local contextual associations occupy a relatively large portion of the analyses.    Meanwhile, in order to provide explanations of this observation, a number of academic studies are referred to. First, Barry Wellman’s study of cyberspace has provided insights into the effects of mobile communication and subsequent social changes (“Physical Place” 227). Among several aspects he mentioned, two of which, wireless portability and personalization of technology, are germane to the topic of interest in this paper. Considering the important feature that mobile social networking serves to enable people to manage community on the go based on their common interest, therefore, the third part of the analysis is focused on the formation of mobile community. The investigation will include the characteristics of the mobile community and its relation to the design principle as well as cultural factors. Lastly, in the technical aspect, the role of Short Messaging Service (SMS, or text messaging) and Multimedia Messaging Services (MMS) is discussed regarding their functional and symbolic contribution in achieving human interactions. SMS is the main technical standard of text message transmission between mobile devices whereas MMS is the upgraded version of SMS by incorporating image, video, picture and other forms of messages.    Case Study of EzMoBo   The data is obtained from a semi-structured interview with Irene Liu, senior project manager of EzMoBo, as well as from the relevant documents provided by EzMoBo. As the first inter-operator mobile community service, EzMoBo started business in September 2002 and positioned itself as a content platform provider.  Featuring various forms of mobile community services, such as social networking, mobile online games and picture/video albums, EzMobo’s most popular services, EzFriend and EzDating, are considered to be composite mobile communities. Applying multiple interfaces, such as SMS, MMS, location-based service (LBS), Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), avatar and RPG, EzFriend and EzDating make good use of user-centered contributions in various forms. In other words, without directly providing contents, EzFriend and EzDating relied on users to generate the content and share it among the entire community. For example, users can participate in writing entries in the blog area, posting messages in BBS, joining chat rooms, and communicating with personalized pictures and video clips.     EzFriend, launched in September 2002, is EzMoBo’s first generation of mobile community service. Compared with less sophisticated EzFriend, EzMoBo later introduced the second generation mobile community-EzDating, which incorporates the concept of role-playing game (RPG) and avatar. According to EzMobo’s estimate, the user base of these two community services has reached 400,000 as of July 2006, which crowns EzMoBo’s success as the largest mobile community service in Taiwan. Furthermore, its service map has expanded to China and Singapore in 2005 and 2006, respectively.    Similar to web-based instant messaging, in EzFriend and EzDating, once users are logging into the portal, their online status will be updated. The only difference is that this mobile community is a public discussion forum without a separate conversation window for the pair-based discussion, as in the web-based instant messaging. In terms of community interface, as shown in Figure 1, each user is generally presented with their nickname, mood status, the number of e-coins, their level (EzDating), the number of online users and online friends, and the number of new messages. The level, ranging from one to twenty, represents the overall evaluation of one’s appeal index and force index (see Figure 2). For example, if users receive a mail, they will be able to gain ten points. If they use real-world money to purchase accessories for the avatar, their appeal index will increase by 300-1000 points.    According to EzMoBo, the presentation of one’s level is an incentive for users to be more actively involved in various mobile community activities, including sending and receiving messages, creating a message board, initiating a vote topic and sending a gift. For instance, every time one’s picture is downloaded by other users, they will get 10 e-coins. Alternatively, this mechanism encourages users to make efforts to strengthen their currency stock as well as monitoring other users’ level. There are some cases that users complained to EzMoBo about other users’ abnormal level presentation and the number of virtual currency revealed.   Investigating further, EzMoBo’s large user base is ascribed to its creation of a competitive and playful environment, which encourages users to vie with each other to accumulate virtual currency and use it to exhibit one’s appeal and force ranking as well as purchase virtual gifts. For example, users can spend virtual currency they earn on staging a promotion show. In the case of EzDating, there is evidence showing that many users tend to user real-world money to purchase expensive avatar accessories and send them as virtual gifts to their friends.  The recipients then will get a MMS notification, which inquires them whether to wear the new accessories received. If the recipients deem the new gift redundant, they could pawn it to get virtual currency in return.  This mechanism has delicately rendered the separation of the virtual world and the real world indistinguishable. It is not surprising to find that users are accustomed to the use of virtual currency as part of gift exchanges, especially on the occasion of making new friends and making impression on people they admire.     In the aspect of user demographics, the users cover a wide range of ages, from 15-year-olds to 70-year-olds. Those 21-30 years of age are the major user group, followed by those ages 31-40.  Approximately, 38.8% of EzFriend users and 20.1% of EzDating users are 21-30 years of age while those ages 31-40 occupy 12.8% and 6% of these two services, respectively. Nonetheless, those in their 60s or 70s are found to be the highly loyal users of these two services. In terms of gender differences, males dominate the usage with the ratio of six to four, as compared with the female users. Geographically, the usage of these two mobile community services is still ahead in the northern metropolitan areas, with roughly 35% of users concentrating in Taipei and other northern developed cities. Lastly, another aspect concerning user category is intriguing. According to EzMoBo’s investigation, army officers, janitors, and 24-hour open convenient store clerks are the chief members of these two mobile communities.    Analysis of the Case   1. Cultural Contexts – Mobile Phones, BBS and Online Gaming     Interestingly, the use of mobile social networking could be better understood by explaining its association with three prevalent cultural practices in Taiwan, which are mobile phones, BBS and online gaming. First, the importance of mobile phones in daily life of Taiwanese people is manifested in several aspects. Wei and Lo’s study on Taiwanese college students revealed that mobile phones have replaced the traditional means of maintaining family bonds and significant relationships (68). In a broader sense, sharing similar national culture background and the Confucian tradition, the use of mobile phones in Taiwan, China, Japan, and Korea are somewhat tinted with entertainment (Ishii and Wu 96). In Taiwan, diverse uses of mobile phones for entertaining purposes are common. For example, college students use mobile phones mainly to chat with their close friends about mundane things (Lin, Cheng and Lin; Cheng). According to a survey conducted by the official research institute FIND in 2005, almost 40 percent of Internet users used their mobile handsets for Internet activities and 35 percent of these uses occurred on public transport, waiting queues or any idle time. SMS, screen graphics and ring tone downloading, mobile games, and MMS were the top popular five applications (“Taiwan Mobile Internet Survey 2004”). What renders these applications popular is attributed to their interactivity, customization and entertaining features. Taken together, these descriptions point out Taiwanese people’s tendency of accepting diverse and entertainment-oriented mobile applications.   Secondly, the unique element of Taiwanese Internet culture, BBS, is found to mesh well with user practices employed in EzFriend and EzDating. The Telnet-based BBS incorporates multiple functions that have been applied in the web-based instant messenger and online games. Once users register, they are able to create a plain profile and nickname for their identity. Then, they can post messages, participate in a wide range of topical discussions, talk with friends, exchange emails and initiate a vote topic. Evidently, these practices derived from BBS are observable in the use of EzFriend and EzDating. Moreover, in well-established BBS, board masters are required for establishing board rules and maintaining order among the virtual BBS community. In EzFriend and EzDating, similar mechanism is also present, which helps create a coherent spirit among the mobile community. More advanced BBS has already introduced online games and the trade mechanism of exchanging virtual treasure and token (Ishii and Wu 100). Through pure textual communication, BBS users pay attention to their e-signatures and writing styles in order to exhibit their personal characteristics. The influence of BBS on Taiwanese society is notable in that it has become a subculture among the Taiwanese Internet world (Ishii and Wu 100; Hsueh; Fu and Wang).    The third parallel social factor is related to Taiwanese online gaming culture, which has evolved with the use of mobile phones and BBS. In Taiwan, teenagers are generally constrained by the social rules of pursuing academic achievements. Playing online games with a few friends in a cyber café thus becomes an identifiable vehicle for relaxing (Ishii and Wu 101; Huang; Chai). This background explains why various forms of electronic games easily garnered notable popularity among Taiwanese young people. Particularly, the younger Taiwanese generation is found to have been growing with online games, which are alternatively viewed as a subculture among teenagers (Chen; Pan). In fact, propelled by the high penetration rate of broadband Internet, online game playing becomes the dominant activities among Taiwanese Internet users across all age brackets, with the youngest age group of five (Pan). According to the latest survey on a national scale, 64 % of the Internet population is involved in online games, with students and 15-19 year-olds as the major users (Y. Lin). In the same survey, it identifies that role-playing is the most popular online game categories, followed by action and strategy. Role playing games enable users not only to exercise creative learning but also to make friends and find partners to cooperate and connect with (“From PC to Mobile Phones, Avatar Enables Friend-Making”).    Among the various mechanism of role-playing gaming, avatar has been widely used, whether in Internet forums or online games. Avatar is the digitalized representation of individuals and is usually denoting the “paper doll” game mechanism (J. Lin). With the aid of avatar, users are exposed themselves to a more intimate environment and are able to express themselves as well as communicate with other people. The popularity of avatar in Taiwan is basically rooted in Korea, where avatar is the equivalent of email communication. Wayi, an online game developer in Taiwan, partnered with Koreas developers and introduced “Noritel” in Taiwan, which won over 50,000 users within two months of its introduction in July 2003. The inclusion of avatar is well accepted among the Taiwanese online game population as well as the mobile phone users. Taiwan Mobile and FarEas Tone both provided a mobile social networking service called “e7Play Love City,” enabling mobile users to participate in the process of making friends through decorating avatars and personal rooms (e7Play Love City). Another mobile social networking service, Pet Sweety, offered by Taiwan Mobile, FarEas Tone and Chunghwa Telecom, has similar functionalities. These are only two of a number of examples of avatar-embedded mobile applications in Taiwan. In general, within this local context of online gaming culture, the successful adoption of EzFriend and EzDating can be linked to its integration of role-playing games, virtual currency and avatar mechanisms since Taiwanese consumers have familiarized themselves well with these online games practices over time. Nonetheless, it is still too early to conclude whether there is any overlapping or migration occurring between the online game and the mobile social networking population.    According to the foregoing analysis, a majority of online gamers are under the age of 15. In Taiwan, those target groups of teenagers and children are not allowed to purchase mobile phones themselves and thus, they are more likely to use pre-paid cards or financed by their parents. Drawing upon this fact, obviously, either the pre-paid mechanism or the parental control is a barrier of using advanced mobile applications since young users are more inclined to spare the limited minutes for voice communication. Conceivably, in this phase, it is appropriate to state that the feature of online gaming is only one of the many incentives offered to use mobile social networking. Another two contextual factors, the highly penetrated mobile usage and mature development of BBS should also account for the popularity of EzFriend and EzDating.    2. Wireless Ubiquity and Personalization of Technologies   Mobile technologies, from mobile phones to text messaging, have transformed interpersonal connections, which are independent from the fixed location, and have resulted in the phenomenon of “situated nowhere,” in which communication occurs everywhere (Wellman, “Physical Place” 230). The ubiquitous form of communication allows people to micro-coordinate activities without prearranging an agreed-upon time and space (Ling and Yttri 2). This consideration of ubiquity is evidenced by the characteristics of the main user groups of EzFriend and EzDating. According to EzMoBo’s survey, the major users, such as soldiers and convenient store clerks, are characterized by having inadequate access to PC and web-based social networking. Thus they are attracted by the anytime-anywhere wireless capability enabled by mobile social networking.   In addition to the wireless aspect, the personalization of technologies plays a role in influencing the way people interact with each other. Specifically, the use of personalized software, such as setting the preference for matching persons nearby and limiting the number of recipients to receive message, is therefore shifting community ties from “linking people-in-places” to “linking people where they are,” or namely personal communities (Wellman, “Physical Place” 238). The emphasis on personalized communication is reflected in the multi-interface design of EzFriend and EzDating, which incorporates multiple modalities of communication, such as verbal communication through voice and text messaging, and non-verbal communication by way of picture and video messaging. Furthermore, users of EzFriend and EzDating are armed with the capability of managing their contextual information through the modification of availability status and of optimizing their competitive advantage through the accumulation of virtual currency. Particularly, the user-generation content is considered as another solution to intertwine the mobile technology with human need to express themselves and communicate with each other. This nicely explains EzFriend and EzDating’s dependence on user-generated content. Whether using it for moblogging, communicating with a large group of community members or uploading personalized picture profiles or video clips, users have relatively more freedom to make use of mobile social networking as a benefit.   3. The Embodiment of Mobile Community   Technically, mobile instant messaging, text messaging, voice communication, moblogging, and photo messaging are the available means serving community members’ various needs. In a broad sense, mobile social networking can be defined in parallel with the mobile community. Rheingold defined that the mobile virtual community is characterized by blending the features of virtual communities and mobile communication, which are characteristic of affinity-based and local-acquaintance-based social communication (“Mobile Virtual Community”). More specifically, mobile virtual communities are known as a platform for many-to-many communication, a platform for coordinating activities in geographic space, and an arena for gaming and socializing. In the case of EzFriend and EzDating, groups were formed in a spontaneous manner through the cooperation of a few initiators. For example, a group of users once initiated a roll call to encourage its group members to cling to the service, according to EzMobo’s observation. In addition, by incorporating various forms of user-generated content, such as BBS and the decoration of the avatar, the group formation in EzFriend and EzDating makes good use of the value of chat messages. According to Taylor and Harper, the value of chat message lies in its ability to help people establish chat groups, which serves to cement alliances with groups and sustain a sense of place in a virtual space (294).    In general, reflecting upon these characters of mobile community, a discernible fact is detected as to the difference between mobile-enabled community and mobile community. The former refers to the conventional social networks communicating with each other using mobile phones whereas the latter focuses on the interest-based virtual group mediated through mobile phones. Similar to online social networking, membership of a mobile community, for the most part, is built on the commonality, either expressing oneself or making friends. This observation corresponds to Rheingold’s delineation of mobile social networking. He envisioned that the mobile community, which combines user-controlled social network information, locative media, and mobile telephony, is expected to take shape as the way “virtual communities, online markets, and self-organized dating services emerged from wired cyberspace” (Rheingold, “Mobile Social Presence”).   In addition to the forgoing BBS factor, the unique spending behavior among the users of EzFriend and EzDating helps to form coherence as a community. According to EzMoBo’s investigation, the users tend to expend a large amount of money on their participation. Unlike the web-based users accustomed to free service, these mobile community users naturally accept the payment mechanism for participation. For example, with the aim to court the admiring girls, some male users are eager to purchase expensive virtual gifts. On the design level, EzMoBo encourages users to be involved in various community activities, such as creating a message board or initiating a vote topic to increase virtual currency, which is viewed as an incentive for the formation of mobile community. In other words, the concept of community underlies the mechanism of EzFriend and EzDating.     4. The Value of Visual Content and Texts as Gifts   Technically, the main mechanism used across the platform of mobile social networking is messaging, including text, graphic, picture and video. In particular, most of the extant studies concern the influence of text messaging. There are two reasons explaining why the discussion of messaging is important. The first one is in relation to the functional orientations of text messaging. Compared with synchronous voice communication, asynchronous text messaging gives participants more control over the timing and content of their self-disclosures (Walther 199). Moreover, from the perspective of cultural consideration, it is agreed that text messaging is greatly assisting people that are reserved in expressing their feelings, such as Taiwanese people.    Concurrently, another reason is concerned with the symbolic significance, in which messaging acts as a form of embodying memories and feelings that can be recalled through later readings (Colombo and Scifo 98; Taylor and Harper 275). Not merely an exchange of physical words or pictorial expression, the action of sending/receiving messaging itself also represents an offering of commitment to the relationship (Taylor and Harper 276; Thurlow). Correspondingly, this emotional significance is found in the multimedia message use of EzFriend and EzDating. It is obvious that the rich meaning enabled through MMS constitutes the main reason of the success of EzFriend and EzDating services. This attitude of adoption is also reflected in the user habit. The users of EzFriend and EzDating are characterized by adeptness of communicating with SMS and MMS.   In addition, the embedded mechanism of gift-giving in EzFriend and EzDating can be associated with Johnsen’s discussion of digital gift-giving. In Johnsen’s argument, the gift in the form of text messages has been observed in playing a role in nurturing social ties and connections (166). In a more materialized manner, the gift performance in EzFriend and EzDating is observed in the exchange of multimedia messages as well as virtual gifts, such as flowers and avatar accessories. With multiple purposes, these gift exchanges allow users not only to manage their social relationships but also to increase their appeal and force index.    Conclusion   Based on the case study of EzMoBo in Taiwan, four aspects of the use of mobile social networking are discussed, which are Taiwanese cultural contexts, personalized mobile communication, mobile community and mobile messaging. The uses of mobile phones, BBS and online gaming are prevalent in Taiwan society in the past two decades. Relevant users practices acquired through using these three communication technologies are found to extend to the utilization of mobile social networking. For instance, it is observable that the design of EzFriend and EzDating combines virtual currency, role-playing gaming and avatar mechanisms, which fit in with Taiwanese online gaming culture. The fact that users of EzFriend and EzDating are spontaneously forming group-oriented communication provides evidence of the orientation of community in human interaction, be it web-based, or mobile interface. Certainly, this is also related to the dominant user practices and community formation embedded in Taiwanese BBS culture. Finally, in terms of mobile messaging, EzFriend and EzDating are composite mobile social networking mediated through multimedia messaging. In addition to matchmaking, users are primarily counting on this forum to express themselves in text, picture and video forms. The value of visual content and text messaging finds its place in the realization of emotional connection and commitment to relationships.    Since these innovative services are still in the early-adopted stage, related social issues and consequences might become more evident after they reach the full-adopted phase. Therefore, when that happens, the conclusion derived from the singular case study in Taiwan would be a starting point of analyzing mobile social networking in other cultural contexts, such as those in Japan, South Korea and the United States. It is needless to say that the support from further empirical research is necessary to provide an excellent complement to this exploratory study. In addition, some aspects pertaining to the development of location-based applications, such as emergency services, location-enabled advertising and travel guides, are subjects of interest for future studies. For instance, these topics would deal with cultural dimensions and their relationships with the usage patterns of these emerging services. By this way, the difference in the user interface would be rationalized using a more comprehensive perspective.

"2007","Modernity and the Mobile Phone","&#x0D;         &#x0D; &#x0D;  Introduction   As the country with the fifth largest population in the world, Indonesia is a massive potential market for mobile technology adoption and development. Despite an annual per capita income of only $1,280 USD (World Bank), there are 63 million mobile phone users in Indonesia (Suhartono, sec. 1.7) and it is predicted to reach 80 million in 2007 (Jakarta Post 1). Mobile phones are not only a symbol of Indonesian modernity (Barendregt 5), but like other communication technology can become a platform through which to explore socio-political issues (Winner 28).    In this article we explore the role mobile phone technology in contemporary forms of social, intimate, and sexual relationships in Indonesia. We argue that new forms of expression and relations are facilitated by the particular features of mobile technology. We discuss two cases from contemporary Indonesia: a mobile dating service (BEDD) and mobile phone pornography. For each case study, we first discuss the socio-political background in Indonesia, then describe the technological affordances of the mobile phone which facilitate dating and pornography, and finally give examples of how the mobile phone is effecting change in dating and pornographic practices.     This study is placed at a time when social relations, intimacy, and sexuality in Indonesia have become central public issues. Since the end of the New Order whilst many people have embraced the new freedoms of reformasi and democratization, there is also a high degree of social anxiety, tension and uncertainty (Juliastuti 139-40). These social changes and desires have played out in the formations of new and exciting modes of creativity, solidarity, and sociality (Heryanto and Hadiz 262) and equally violence, terror and criminality (Heryanto and Hadiz 256). The diverse and plural nature of Indonesian society is alive with a myriad of people and activities, and it is into this diverse social body that the mobile phone has become a central and prominent feature of interaction.   The focus of our study is dating and pornography as mediated by the mobile phone; however, we do not suggest that these are new experiences in Indonesia. Rather over the last decade social, intimate, and sexual relationships have all been undergoing change and their motivations can be traced to a variety of sources including the factors of globalization, democratization and modernization. Throughout Asia “new media have become a crucial site for constituting new Asian sexual identities and communities” (Berry, Martin, and Yue 13) as people are connecting through new communication technologies. In this article we suggest that mobile phone technology opens new possibilities and introduces new channels, dynamics, and intensities of social interaction.    Mobile phones are particularly powerful communication tools because of their mobility, accessibility, and convergence (Ling 16-19; Ito 14-15; Katz and Aakhus 303). These characteristics of mobile phones do not in and of themselves bring about any particular changes in dating and pornography, but they may facilitate changes already underway (Barendegt 7-9; Barker 9).   Mobile Dating   Background   The majority of Indonesians in the 1960s and 1970s had arranged marriages (Smith-Hefner 443). Education reform during the 70s and 80s encouraged more women to attain an education which in turn led to the delaying of marriage and the changing of courtship practices (Smith-Hefner 450). “Compared to previous generations, [younger Indonesians] are freer to mix with the opposite sex and to choose their own marriage,” (Utomo 225). Modern courtship in Java is characterized by “self-initiated romance” and dating (Smith-Hefner 451). Mobile technology is beginning to play a role in initiating romance between young Indonesians.    Technology   One mobile matching or dating service available in Indonesia is called BEDD (www.bedd.com). BEDD is a free software for mobile phones in which users fill out a profile about themselves and can meet BEDD members who are within 20-30 feet using a Bluetooth connection on their mobile devices. BEDD members’ phones automatically exchange profile information so that users can easily meet new people who match their profile requests. BEDD calls itself mobile social networking community; “BEDD is a new Bluetooth enabled mobile social medium that allows people to meet, interact and communicate in a new way by letting their mobile phones do all the work as they go throughout their day.” As part of a larger project on mobile social networking (Humphreys 6), a field study was conducted of BEDD users in Jakarta, Indonesia and Singapore (where BEDD is based) in early 2006. In-depth interviews and open-ended user surveys were conducted with users, BEDD’s CEO and strategic partners in order to understand the social uses and effects BEDD.   The majority of BEDD members (which topped 100,000 in January 2006) are in Indonesia thanks to a partnership with Nokia where BEDD came pre-installed on several phone models. In management interviews, both BEDD and Nokia explained that they partnered because both companies want to help “build community”. They felt that Bluetooth technology such as BEDD could be used to help youth meet new people and keep in touch with old friends.    Examples   One of BEDD’s functions is to help lower barriers to social interaction in public spaces. By sharing profile information and allowing for free text messaging, BEDD can facilitate conversations between BEDD members. According to users, mediating the initial conversation also helps to alleviate social anxiety, which often accompanies meeting new people. While social mingling and hanging out between Jakarta teenagers is a relatively common practice, one user said that BEDD provides a new and fun way to meet and flirt. In a society that must balance between an “idealized morality” and an increasingly sexualized popular culture (Utomo 226), BEDD provides a modern mode of self-initiated matchmaking.    While BEDD was originally intended to aid in the matchmaking process of dating, it has been appropriated into everyday life in Indonesia because of its interpretive flexibility (Pinch &amp; Bjiker 27). Though BEDD is certainly used to meet “beautiful girls” (according to one Indonesian male user), it is also commonly used to text message old friends. One member said he uses BEDD to text his friends in class when the lecture gets boring. BEDD appears to be a helpful modern communication tool when people are physically proximate but cannot easily talk to one another. BEDD can become a covert way to exchange messages with people nearby for free.    Another potential explanation for BEDD’s increasing popularity is its ability to allow users to have private conversations in public space. Bennett notes that courtship in private spaces is seen as dangerous because it may lead to sexual impropriety (154). Dating and courtship in public spaces are seen as safer, particularly for conserving the reputation young Indonesian women. Therefore Bluetooth connections via mobile technologies can be a tool to make private social connections between young men and women “safer”. Bluetooth communication via mobile phones has also become prevalent in more conservative Muslim societies (Sullivan, par. 7; Braude, par. 3). There are, however, safety concerns about meeting strangers in public spaces. When asked, “What advice would you give a first time BEDD user?” one respondent answered, “harus bisa mnilai seseorang krn itu sangat penting, kita mnilai seseorang bukan cuma dari luarnya” (translated: be careful in evaluating (new) people, and don’t ever judge the book by its cover”). Nevertheless, only one person participating in this study mentioned this concern. To some degree meeting someone in a public may be safer than meeting someone in an online environment. Not only are there other people around in public spaces to physically observe, but co-location means there may be some accountability for how BEDD members present themselves.    The development and adoption of matchmaking services such as BEDD suggests that the role of the mobile phone in Indonesia is not just to communicate with friends and family but to act as a modern social networking tool as well. For young Indonesians BEDD can facilitate the transfer of social information so as to encourage the development of new social ties. That said, there is still debate about exactly whom BEDD is connecting and for what purposes. On one hand, BEDD could help build community in Indonesia. One the other hand, because of its privacy it could become a tool for more promiscuous activities (Bennett 154-5). There are user profiles to suggest that people are using BEDD for both purposes. For example, note what four young women in Jakarta wrote in the BEDD profiles:          Personal Description         Looking For          I am a good prayer, recite the holy book,    love saving (money), love cycling… and a bit narcist.         Meaning of life          Ordinary gurl, good student, single, Owen    lover, and the rest is up to you to judge.         Phrenz ?! Peace?! Wondeful life!          I am talkative, have no patience but so    sweet. I am so girly, narcist, shy and love cute guys. Check my fs    (Friendster) account if you’re so curious. Well, I am just an ordinary girl    tho.         Anybody who wants to know me. A boy    friend would be welcomed.          Play Station addict—can’t live without    it! I am a rebel, love rock, love hiphop, naughty, if you want proof dial    081*********             phrenz n cute guyz        As these profiles suggest, the technology can be used to send different kinds of messages. The mobile phone and the BEDD software merely facilitate the process of social exchange, but what Indonesians use it for is up to them. Thus BEDD and the mobile phone become tools through which Indonesians can explore their identities. BEDD can be used in a variety of social and communicative contexts to allow users to explore their modern, social freedoms.    Mobile Pornography   Background   Mobile phone pornography builds on a long tradition of pornography and sexually explicit material in Indonesia through the use of a new technology for an old art and product. Indonesia has a rich sexual history with a documented and prevalent sex industry (Suryakusuma 115). Lesmana suggests that the country has a tenuous pornographic industry prone to censorship and nationalist politics intent on its destruction. Since the end of the New Order and opening of press freedoms there has been a proliferation in published material including a mushrooming of tabloids, men’s magazines such as FHM, Maxim and Playboy, which are often regarded as pornographic. This is attributed to the decline of the power of the bureaucracy and government and the new role of capital in the formation of culture (Chua 16). There is a parallel pornography industry, however, that is more amateur, local, and homemade (Barker 6). It is into this range of material that mobile phone pornography falls.    Amongst the myriad forms of pornography and sexually explicit material available in Indonesia, the mobile phone in recent years has emerged as a new platform for production, distribution, and consumption. This section will not deal with the ethics of representation nor engage with the debate about definitions and the rights and wrongs of pornography. Instead what will be shown is how the mobile phone can be and has been used as an instrument/medium for the production and consumption of pornography within contemporary social relationships.    Technology   There are several technological features of the mobile phone that make pornography possible. As has already been noted the mobile phone has had a large adoption rate in Indonesia, and increasingly these phones come equipped with cameras and the ability to send data via MMS and Bluetooth. Coupled with the mobility of the phone, the convergence of technology in the mobile phone makes it possible for pornography to be produced and consumed in a different way than what has been possible before. It is only recently that the mobile phone has been marketed as a video camera with the release of the Nokia N90; however, quality and recording time are severely limited. Still, the mobile phone is a convenient and at-hand tool for the production and consumption of individually made, local, and non-professional pieces of porn, sex and sexuality.   It is impossible to know how many such films are in circulation. A number of websites that offer these films for downloads host between 50 and 100 clips in .3gp file format, with probably more in actual circulation. At the very least, this is a tenfold increase in number compared to the recent emergence of non-professional VCD films (Barker 3). This must in part be attributed to the advantages that the mobile phone has over standard video cameras including cost, mobility, convergence, and the absence of intervening data processing and disc production.    Examples   There are various examples of mobile pornography in Indonesia. These range from the pornographic text message sent between lovers to the mobile phone video of explicit sexual acts (Barendregt 14-5). The mobile phone affords privacy for the production and exchange of pornographic messages and media. Because mobile devices are individually owned, however, pornographic material found on mobile phones can be directly tied to the individual owners. For example, police in Kotabaru inspected the phones of high school students in search of pornographic materials and arrested those individuals on whose phones it was found (Barendregt 18).    Mobile phone pornography became a national political issue in 2006 when an explicit one-minute clip of a singer and an Indonesian politician became public. Videoed in 2004, the clip shows Maria Eva, a 27 year-old dangdut singer (see Browne, 25-6) and Yahya Zaini, a married 42 year-old who was head of religious affairs for the Golkar political party. Their three-year affair ended in 2005, but the film did not become public until 2006. It spread like wildfire between phones and across the internet, however, and put an otherwise secret relationship into the limelight.   These types of affairs and relationships were common knowledge to people through gossip, exposes such as Jakarta Undercover (Emka 93-108) and stories in tabloids; yet this culture of adultery and prostitution continued and remained anonymous because of bureaucratic control of evidence and information (Suryakusuma 115). In this case, however, the filming of Maria Eva once public proves the identities of those involved and their infidelity. As a result of the scandal it was further revealed that Maria Eva had been forced by Yayha Zaini and his wife to have an abortion, deepening the moral crisis. Yahya Zaini later resigned as his party’s head of Religious Affairs (Asmarani, sec. 1-2), due to what was called the country’s “first real sex scandal” (Naughton, par. 2).   As these examples show, there are definite risks and consequences involved in the production of mobile pornography. Even messages/media that are meant to be shared between two consenting individuals can eventually make their way into the public mobile realm and have serious consequences for those involved. Mobile video and photography does, however, represent a potential new check on the Indonesian bureaucratic elite which has not been previously available by other means such as a watchdog media. “The role of the press as a control mechanism is practically nonexistent [in Jakarta], which in effect protects corruption, nepotism, financial manipulation, social injustice, and repression, as well as the murky sexual life of the bureaucratic power elite,” (Suryakusuma 117). Thus while originally a mobile video may have been created for personal pleasure, through its mass dissemination via new media it can become a means of sousveillance (Mann, Nolan and Wellman 332-3) whereby the control of surveillance is flipped to reveal the often hidden abuses of power by officials.    Whilst the debates over pornography in Indonesia tend to focus on the moral aspects of it, the broader social impacts of technology on relationships are often ignored. Issues related to power relations or even media as cultural expression are often disregarded as moral judgments cast a heavy shadow over discussions of locally produced Indonesian mobile pornography. It is possible to move beyond the moral critique of pornographic media to explore the social significance of its proliferation as a cultural product.   Conclusion   In these two case studies we have tried to show how the mobile phone in Indonesia has become a mode of interaction but also a platform through which to explore other current issues and debates related to dating, sexuality and media. Since 1998 and the fall of the New Order, Indonesia has been struggling with blending old and new, a desire of change and nostalgia for past, and popular desire for a “New Indonesia” (Heryanto, sec. Post-1998). Cultural products within Indonesia have played an important role in exploring these issues. The mobile phone in Indonesia is not just a technology, but also a product in and through which these desires are played out. Changes in dating and pornography practices have been occurring in Indonesia for some time. As people use mobile technology to produce, communicate, and consume, the device becomes intricately related to identity struggle and cultural production within Indonesia.    It is important to keep in mind, however, that while mobile technology adoption within Indonesia is growing, it is still limited to a particular subset of the population. As has been previously observed (Barendregt 3), it is wealthier, young people in urban areas who are most intensely involved in mobile technology. As handset prices decrease and availability in rural areas increases, however, no longer will mobile technology be so demographically confined in Indonesia.    The convergent technology of the mobile phone opens many possibilities for creative adoption and usage. As a communication device it allows for the creation, sharing, and viewing of messages. Therefore, the technology itself facilitates social connections and networking. As demonstrated in the cases of dating and pornography, the mobile phone is both a tool for meeting new people and disseminating sexual messages/media because it is a networked technology. The mobile phone is not fundamentally changing dating and pornography practices, but it is accelerating social and cultural trends already underway in Indonesia by facilitating the exchange and dissemination of messages and media. As these case studies show, what kinds of messages Indonesians choose to create and share are up to them. The same device can be used for relatively innocuous behavior as well as more controversial behavior. With increased adoption in Indonesia, the mobile will continue to be a lens through which to further explore modern socio-political issues.

"2007","Mobile Intimacy","&#x0D;         &#x0D; &#x0D;  So here is one of the paradoxes of mediated globalization: at the same time as it connects people, it also distanciates them. (Rantanen 10)   Introduction   Mobile technologies are changing personal relationships and intimacy. While many authors critique the benefits of globalization from either corporate or cultural perspectives, I follow Anthony Giddens and Zygmunt Bauman in assessing globalization from the standpoint of the personal. ‘Mobile intimacy,’ the ability to be intimate across distances of time and space, is a global phenomenon. Oddly enough, the sociability of mobile telephony is not homogenous across the world. How the mobile phone is used to extend personal relationships in Asia/Pacific is unique compared to the rest of the world. As Misa Matsuda notes in her discussion of mobile phone (keitai) phenomenon in Japan, this technosocial dynamic is creating a dependency of ‘fulltime intimacy.’   At its crux, this essay applies Giddens’s cornerstone of time-space distanciation to research on mobile telephony to demonstrate how globalization threatens some personal relationships. An ‘economics of emotion’ arises where capitalistic uses of technologies alter power within personal relationships. Love becomes a commodity which is subject to economic rules of supply and demand. Love, however, is not synonymous with intimacy; it is only a component. Ultimately, I see globalization leading towards not a homogenized identity (Schiller) but an obfuscating of identity, where some individual float through a consumerist abyss marked by the acquisition of goods (Lasn). If the non-linearity of late modernity has transformed love into a commodity, then how does the commoditization of love into the realm of the mobile affect how one negotiates intimacy?   This essay begins with a summary of time-space distanciation literature. From there, it challenges Giddens’s (“Transformation”) postmodern concept of the ‘pure relationship’ and how it differs from Victorian intimacy. The main argument then expresses how technologies like mobile phones sever some emotional relationships while solidifying others. Last, this paper concludes by analyzing how globalization has created what I term ‘stable instability,’ whereby the ‘disjuncture’ of modern times allows some cosmopolitans to establish emotional order through being in constant flux. In short, the utopia of global communications, particularly in Asia, is to some extent a fallacy when one considers how new technologies hinder some personal relationships.   Time, Space, and Place in Globalization   The reallocation of time, space, and place through new media is the bedrock for mobile intimacy. It is necessary to summarize some key theories to contextualize my argument. In The Consequences of Modernity, Giddens coins ‘time-space distanciation’ as a prerequisite for modernity. He describes it as “the conditions under which time and space are organised so as to connect presence and absence,” (14). Critical to his argument is ‘disembedding,’ which he defines as “the ‘lifting out’ of social relations from local contexts of interaction and their restructuring across indefinite spans of time-space” (Ibid: 21). Similarly David Harvey (“Postmodernity” 201-308; “From Space to Place) writes of ‘time-space compression’ where new phases of technologies decrease the space between places and thereby reduce the time between those places. He adds an economic stance by incorporating Baudrillard and Ford as examples of how commodities’ origins cease to matter as time and space compress and give rise to global markets. John Tomlinson, Terhi Rantanen, and Malcolm Waters critique the differences between time-space distanciation and compression. Distanciation remains a crucial theoretical gripe for Tomlinson because it overvalues the need for proximity within both identity and communication. Although Waters presents a valid argument over the connotation of “distanciation,” for the purposes of this paper, the terms will be used interchangeably. Place becomes less significant because the time traditionally required to cross a distance shrinks, removing the added value an action receives when it takes more time. Time remains a commodity which adds emotional significance to place. Proximity therefore becomes a crucial variable in the economics of emotion.   New media yield different types of communication. For place to lose significance, mediation must gain value. “Mediation is therefore seen as, fundamentally, a matter of bridging time and space in communication” (Tomlinson 152). John B. Thompson (81-118) demarcates communication into three types:    Face-to-face interaction (henceforth FtF) – dialogical, spatial-temporal co-presence multiplicity of symbolic cues. Mediated interaction – dialogical, spatial-temporal distancing, limited symbolic cues. Mediated quasi-interaction –monological, spatial-temporal ambiguity, limited symbolic cues.   While the nineteenth and twentieth centuries brought increases in mediated quasi-interaction like newspapers and television, the twenty-first century charges towards interactivity. There is now an eruption in dialogical and multi-flow communications rather than the traditional one-way flow of mass media dissemination. Through new technologies like instant messaging and VoIP, people (with access) are increasingly redefining their interactions in mediated space. Rather than adopting a technologically deterministic view like Walter Ong and McLuhan whereby the technologies themselves denote the societal effects, Silverstone (“Sociology of Mediation”) argues that digital communication provides more choices which require ethical decisions. In short, Thompson’s three types of communication are necessary to have a sense of place and identity.    In The Transformation of Intimacy, Giddens surveys how late-twentieth-century love has evolved from Victorian ideals due to time-space distanciation. Do changes in love also affect intimacy? Gross and Simmons (533) agree with Giddens’s argument that trust has become the more valued commodity as mediation places greater emphasis on “physically absent others.” Unlike Giddens, Gross and Simmons’s study empirically evaluates how ‘expert systems’ affect personal relationships and that trust is no longer a necessity (534). Giddens argues that globalization has brought about a volte-face from ‘romantic love’ to the ‘pure relationship,’ which he defines as:     A social relation is entered into for its own sake, for what can be derived by each person from a sustained association with another; and which is continued only insofar as it is thought by both parties to deliver enough satisfactions for each individual to stay within it. (58)     His view of Victorian ‘romantic’ love as a supernatural extension of eroticism is limiting as it only focuses on one facet of love. “Giddens’s… treatment of the transformation of intimacy in modern societies focuses on personal ‘face-to-face’ sexual and love relations and has nothing to say about mediated experience,” (Tomlinson 170).    Surprisingly, Gross and Simmons’s research concurs with Giddens that the ‘pure relationship’ offers the potential for greater happiness; however, their data do not support the dystopian risks Giddens advocates:     Our study failed to turn up any evidence that the transformation of intimacy is in fact a double-edged phenomenon. People in pure love relationships are, so far as our data indicate, happier with their relationships and no worse off on a number of psychological measures than those in more traditional relationships… We suspect that Giddens may be overestimating the psychological importance of habit, routine, and predictability in people’s lives. (551-2)     Although their study bears its own methodological limitations, it provides a counterexample to Giddens’s argument. Despite their results, I am skeptical to discount Giddens’s argument so quickly. Some of the research in Asia indicates that habitude is epicentral to intimacy. Mobile intimacy decreases habitude for many people. In Habuchi’s discussion of technologies in Japan, he notes that this reduction of the habitual is creating a phenomenon of shrinking social capital which he dubs ’telecocooning.’   The Battle over Proximity   Proximity remains important around the world, and new corporate technologies like HP Halo and Cisco Telepresence typify the desire to have digital communication simulate FtF communication. In Harold Innis’s pioneering work on types of communication, he demarcates ‘orality’ as the first form of communication with FtF as the primordial communicative medium. Innis understood that proximity is essential to many facets of life. Similarly, Thompson acknowledges that FtF communication allows for the subtle reading of body language. On the other hand, Tomlinson believes that people overvalue proximity because they consider only its sexual nature (163-4). He prefers to consider proximity from the point of view of the ‘global village’:     [Proximity] describes a common conscious appearance of the world as more intimate, more compressed, more part of everyday reckoning – for example in our experience of rapid transport or our mundane use of media technologies to bring distant images into our most intimate local spaces (3)     The quandary arises over whether proximity facilitates the communication of emotion. For example, saying “I love you” and texting “I love you” have different connotations based on body language. One cannot discount the value of nonverbal cues.   Within corporate cosmopolitanism, global nomads seldom gain proximity to local culture because they are constantly in a ‘new floating world’ (Gergen) or in a bubble of global consumerist culture of Hilton hotels and McDonalds (Tomlinson 7). Tomlinson (111) disagrees with Augé, arguing that non-places like airports, train stations, hotels, chain restaurants, cafes, and shopping malls create new ‘authentic’ places for experience and intimacy. For Bauman, “The difference between one place and another, one set of people within your sight and corporeal reach and another, has been cancelled and made null and void,” (59). Likewise, Giddens advocates that if one is in the same room as a person who is on the telephone, it does not mean that the two in the room are more intimate than the two on the phone:     A person may be on the telephone to someone twelve thousand miles away and for the duration of the conversation be more closely bound up with the responses of that distant individual than with others sitting in the same room” (“Modernity and Self-Identity” 189).     The interpersonal connection with which Giddens writes may represent an extension of love, but can one define such mediated presence as “intimacy” proper? It seems that “intimacy” itself does not sufficiently denote these new levels of mobile connections. There remains a difference over mediated versus non-mediated intimacy. Perhaps mobile affection or mobile love or mobile desire are more germane terms than “mobile intimacy?” To argue that mediated and non-mediated intimacy are both forms of intimacy is pluralistically limiting. While this paper focuses on ‘mobile intimacy’ the term itself is an oxymoron because intimacy cannot be mobile. Technologies can aid in simulating intimacy or they can replace some components of intimacy. The lexicon itself is therefore limiting.   Gergen (237-8) believes that mobile telephony strengthens endogenous relationships. In other words, the cell phone allows one to simulate proximity (i.e., ‘absent presence’) with one’s circle of friends, family, and co-workers rather than to foster new intimacies at distance. On the other hand, Thompson writes:     In the case of mediated interaction, such as that sustained through the exchange of letters or thorough telephone conversation, individuals can establish a form of intimacy which is reciprocal in character but which lacks some of the features typically associated with the sharing of a common locale (208).     This assessment is less pluralistic than that of Tomlinson because it reiterates that different forms of mediation bear different benefits and limitations.   How Mediation Affects Power in Relationships   For some personal relationships, ‘the medium is the message.’ In the case of the mobile telephony, one must negotiate who calls whom, when, and how. Although international long distance rates have reached their nadir over the last decade, they still remain more of an economic hurdle than local calls. If one lives in New York and one’s acquaintance lives in Sydney, only a small window of time exists that is convenient for both parties to communication. Distance and physics still matter; time zones cannot be conquered.   Negotiations over these time factors affect relationships in some cosmopolitan intimacy. A sense of imbalance arises if one party is always initiating communication. The timing of such communications also bears significance. A shortcoming of cosmopolitan intimacy is that proximity can lead to more dialogue as Matsuda’s aforementioned notion of “fulltime intimacy” demonstrates. Shared events, just as in ‘imagined communities,’ become the bedrock for relationships. When one inserts distance into the equation, a cleavage forms between the capacity for sharing mutual daily events. For instance, if intimacy can be sustained at distance, then the lack of tactile intimacy could cause an individual to be adulterous. In such a scenario, although globalization allows for intimacy at distance, it could also allow for heartache due to infidelity. Again, these are not new phenomena – only an intensification of issues that otherwise could occur at the local.   Many aspects of intimacy are derived from media portrayals. Hardly anyone is taught how to behave on a date or how to kiss or what gifts to give or that a person typically gets down on a knee to propose marriage (Jagger). These symbolic goods and ‘cultural capital’ (Couldry) come from Hollywood depictions, word of mouth, and popular literature. The negotiations over the commodification of emotions are not different with distance relationships. In Asia, the mobile phone arguably communicates symbolically as extension of one’s identity and community as much as it is used literally for actual communication (Hjorth). Media teach us life behavior, and people are consumers of media’s education.    Cosmopolitan Intimacy and the Mobile Phone in Asia   There is a wealth of literature on new ICTs and how they affect sociability. These studies typically focus on a single country or demographic. Sometimes the studies sample groups from several countries to simulate a global representation. The research often focuses on uses and gratifications, adoption, domestication, fashion, content, customization, time management, and sociability. Love is almost always absent. When personal relationships are considered, it is often from the guise of peer networks and parent-child relationships. Few studies exist on ‘cosmopolitan intimacy’ (Beck), which is the crux of this essay, with the exception of Gerard Goggin’s (126-140) ribald chapter on infidelity and text messaging. Some of the findings in Asia are worth noting because they contradict common findings in North America and Europe. In addition, it is important not to forget that of the nearly 2 billion mobile phone subscribers worldwide, over 790 million come from Asia where China Mobile is the world’s largest provider (Goggin 2).   Hjorth and Kim summarize some of the fallacies about mobile telephony in Korea. For example, prolific cell phone adoption and use increases sociability with old friends while allowing opportunities to meet new people as well, despite the common belief to the contrary. Katz and Sugiyama (2006) continue Katz’s research on Apparatgeist, ‘The spirit of the machine that influences both the designs of the technology as well as the initial and subsequent significance accorded them by users, non-users and anti-users’ (Katz et al. 305). They observe many correlations between fashion and mobile adoption, most notably that fashion is preferred over battery life for active users. Wei studies mobile use in Taiwan and concludes, “Those respondents who were motivated to use the cell phone to express affection and to take advantage of its access, but not to socialize or to make a fashion statement, tend to call their loved ones more frequently,” (64) and that “Female users tend to use the cell phone for expression of affection and to take advantage of the mobility of the wireless technology, whereas male users appear to use cell phones to seek information” (64-7).    Yoon also studies Korea where he finds that youths take traditional values and cultural practices and extend them through mobile telephony rather than taking on a culture of “individualization.” Humphreys finds Yoon’s conclusion to be true worldwide and not just in Korea; she goes on to examine how people use mobile phones in public spaces and how that affects sociability. In China, Wei focuses on the growing upper-middle class and yuppies who seek to distinguish themselves from their countrymen by having mobile phones as status symbols. Ling, Elwood-Clayton, and Ito et al. have studied the effects of mobile telephony on (youth) cultures in Norway, the Philippines, and Japan, respectively. Their findings demonstrate that users have a degree of technological ‘domestication’ (Silverstone and Hirch; Haddon) and that in many cases youth cultures have adopted mobile telecommunications almost ubiquitously leading to a recalibration of youth power within the domestic sphere. Tomita’s (2005) study of Japanese mobile telecom or keitai (‘something you carry with you’) discusses how new ICTs have facilitated new interpersonal connections and what he calls the ‘interpersonal stranger.’ Although mobile telephony allows for ubiquitous connectivity, not all relationships should be sustained. The proxy of mediation can allow some relationships to be sustained where they typically would not be in the proximate. While many of mobile telephony’s benefits include coordination of social activities, there are some negative consequences like dependency and addiction (Park; Snowden; Wilska; Benson; Ling).    The Case of the Distanciated Identity   Both Tomlinson (134) and Giddens (“Modernity and Self-Identity”) write of a “distanciated identity.” By this, they mean that time-space distanciation creates an era where cosmopolitanism and the global mobility of individuals threaten identity. This is what Giddens posits as ’ontological insecurity’ and Meyrowitz labels ‘no sense of place.’ Constant travel physically displaces individuals. Identity was formerly place-bound; as place devolves, identity transforms. In addition, most people develop a rapport with locations and places. Even if one has an ‘oppositional’ (Hall) view towards Los Angeles because of its crime, urban sprawl, and celebrity superficiality, one still has a relationship with it. Places provide significance which mediated environments cannot. Traditional intimacy becomes more problematic once it has been distanciated because intimacy then bears an inherent fear of abandonment. For one with a distanciated identity, to love is to love for only a short while or to disembed a lover from a locale. Both results are polemic. To be a cosmopolitan, therefore, is to sometimes experience intimacy at distance or through simulations of intimacy (Baudrillard; Bauman).   In The Consequences of Modernity, Giddens outlines how modernity is not a linear process but one of constant change. Progress and globalization are not necessarily beneficial; something newer is not better than something old – only different. The Victorian ideals of linearity still permeate emotions. Thompson (215) describes the linearity of emotion in terms of a ‘coherent life-project.’ Even in the most picaresque of settings, love is a commodity that one acquires as a pivotal point along the journey towards introspection. Media convey that love is necessary for happiness. If this linear course begins to erode in the globalizing world, then love can no longer be a ‘critical juncture’ en route to self-completion. In a disjunctured, mosaic world, if love becomes nonlinear, then it can occur at various points in one’s life. Love no longer partially defines life.   Intimacy becomes segments in a complex sphere of relationships and events marked more by the consumption of goods (i.e. education, employment, real estate, automobiles, jewelry, etc.) than by the passing of time. All these factors contribute to why there is an increase in clinical depression in the West, particularly by teenagers. New technologies lead some to emotional spires of depression and loneliness. Studies by Ling and Stivers do not support that the Internet creates emotional disorders, but that it exacerbates those disorders for many people. Similarly, Thompson writes of the ‘double-bind of media dependency’ whereby “the more the process of self-formation is enriched by mediated symbolic forms, the more the self becomes dependent on media systems which lie beyond its control,” (214). The studies indicate that people who are social tend to use new ICTs for coordinating social activities and expanding their scope of interests by linking with other individuals of shared social interests. Conversely, those more anti-social individuals use facets of the World Wide Web to regress from the physical world but that they actually tend to foster intense relationships with online individuals (Caplan). In this capacity, the Internet creates a space where people with little physical community gain virtual forms of community.    Stable Instability   At this time, I would like to put forth the notion of ‘stable instability’ as it pertains to ontological construction. For some people, to have a stable sense of self is to be in constant instable flux. The increase in the nonlinearity of time is affecting some traditional views the world. Akin to chaos theory where chaos is necessary for order, instability is now sometimes necessary for stability. An underlying factor I attribute to the growth in emotional instability is that globalization places more emphasis on the individual. The Becks (72-3) have written on the growth of individualization as a corollary of globalization. One should not misinterpret the Becks’ discussion of individualization as being about individual selfishnessm but rather as a restructuring of time around personal rather than communal schedules. Bugeja correlates this to a reduction in the value of FtF communication: he explains that time-space distanciation has led to a decline in communities, which can only rely on FtF communication to sustain themselves. In order to establish a sense of self within a vast array of ‘imagined communities’ (Anderson), one must put identity in flux. When Appadurai applies his notion of ‘disjuncture’ to personal relationships, the concept of ‘imagined worlds’ (33) arises. According to Humsinger (40), it is only through a sharing of imagined worlds that an ontological global sense is born and that “people experience stability through ceaseless movement.” Some cosmopolitans experience disjuncture in ways where the stability of ‘traditional, structured’ life is unsettling. For this reason, Gross and Simmons partially contradict Giddens’s claims about the ‘pure relationship’:     Whatever one thinks of claims of affinity between contemporary culture and post-Fordist production regimes… it is not hard to imagine that people today, having become connoisseurs of experiential variety, might feel stymied by personal relationships they view as standardized and utterly predictable (552).     Like McLuhan’s explanation of how the mechanical clock brought worldwide chronological order, the compressing of time mandates instability to traditional systems.   Ling (181) explains how the sociological change from collective to individual complicates one’s overall role in the global system: “From the perspective of the individual, there is a freedom associated with this development [of customizable technologies], but there is also the need for the individual to do the job of placing him – or herself into the social order.” This plethora of customizable choices correlates to a disembedding of emotion whereby to gain stability as an individual is to create one’s place within an instable realm of emotional choices.   New technologies allow individuals to time-shift communication. For instance, although the mobile phone facilitates ubiquitous connectivity to others, Ling explains that there is an increased desire to decline phone calls. In a consumer culture where services migrate towards ‘on demand,’ from TiVo to iTunes, the same demand-based mentalities seep into the psychology of emotions. A consumer culture has been the American mindset since the Second World War, but with a burgeoning aristocracy and middle class in China that is equally consumeristic, the need to question what constitutes emotional stability and happiness becomes paramount. Ultimately, schedules, regularity, and order challenge the mindset of the late-modern cosmopolitan. As advocates of thematic messages in TV behemoth Sex and the City elucidate, the show empowers women and puts them on equal playing ground with men by objectifying men in the ways that men have traditionally objectified women in media representations (Kim). While such an argument in the confines of female equality is both valid and crucial, a potential consequence is a group of men and women unable to construct meaningful relationships. Elina Furman recently wrote a journalistic piece “Women Who Can’t Commit?!” who outlines seven criteria why some women are as equally unwilling as men to commit to another. This disjuncture of emotion creates People On-Demand, so to speak. Click. Friendship. Scroll. Sex. It is the crux of the difference between Giddens’s (“Transformation”) Victorian ‘love of romance’ and his modern ‘pure relationship.’ The disposability of commodities in everyday life, particularly in the West but also now in the East, facilitates why some people create a disposability of intimacy. This disposability allows for instability to arise.   A disjunctured, nonlinear world can no longer expect individuals to have linear love. As video media migrate to ‘on demand’ formats, it is reasonable to presume that commodities like intimacy will become equally fragmented. Stable instability arises as digital mediation eradicates FtF communities. At its crux, I am proposing that the growing instability of placelessness, distanciated identities, and ontological insecurity requires a constant nonlinear view of affection. One would then expect love to be on demand in whichever given place the cosmopolitan citizen temporarily resides. Since love and affection cannot be on demand in the same way as iTunes, there is a rise in loneliness and addictions, which Stivers elucidates.   What happens when love enters the equation of the displaced cosmopolitan? There arises a discord between the stable and the instable. As Ellwood-Clayton notes in her study on mobile technologies and constructions of intimacy in the Philippines, technology provides a vehicle for already existing localized notions of love. This is also elaborated on by Raul Pertierra in his ethnographic study of the use of ICTs to establish and develop intimate relationships (particularly amongst strangers). As Pertierra observes, “CMICTs have consequences on notions of individualism and cosmopolitianism… [but] contrary to expectation, cellphones also encourage authentic relationships,” (59).The tenets of consumerism and individualism do not concur with the reciprocity and ebb and flow that traditionally exist within Victorian intimacy (Altick). This argument is not to romanticize the past; the present is not ‘better’ or ‘worse’ – only different. Part of the reason there is less happiness is because lives are more dependent on mediation (Lupton 1998) and the discord of stable love discombobulates the instability of cosmopolitanism and globalism.    Conclusion   Although examples have been made to demonstrate how globalization creates opportunities to threaten personal relationships, this paper does not advocate that globalization is eroding personal relationships. The goal has been to elucidate how the compression of time and space has led to an intensification of mediation, best visible through new ICTs. The optimistic possibilities of globalization also carry numerous emotional pitfalls like Internet-related depression and loneliness, as well as the formation of ‘stable instability.’ Negotiations over which medium one employs affects relationships in late modernity.    While this essay poses some new concepts, the ideas themselves are not so much new as redirected. The ubiquitous consumer-based lifestyle that typifies some twenty-first-century cosmopolitans has aided creating an atmosphere of disposable relationships. The once-venerated Victorian love ceases to function in this ‘disjunctured’ cosmos of ‘imagined worlds’ where mediated interactions lead to an increase in placelessness and an erosion of ‘ontological security.’ This paper has argued that the non-linear nature of globalization mandates a recalibration of personal relationships. Future research featuring both ethnographic studies and quantitative surveying must examine how globalization is altering the ways people interact at intimate levels. In short, the globalizing forces that have intensified corporate, political, and cultural moves over the last century have also attributed to changes in emotion. I assert that globalization brings an intensification of communication, as well as pain and pleasure, relative to the physical distance between two bodies.

"2007","Collect Calls","&#x0D;         &#x0D; &#x0D;  Synonymous with globalism, the mobile phone has become an integral part of contemporary everyday life. As a global medium, the mobile phone is a compelling phenomenon that demonstrates the importance of the local in shaping and adapting the technology. The adaptation and usage of the mobile phone can be read on two levels simultaneously – the micro, individual level and the macro, socio-cultural level. Symbolic of the pervasiveness and ubiquity of global ICTs (Information and Communication Technologies) in the everyday, the mobile phone demonstrates that the experiences of the local are divergent in the face of global convergence.    The cultural significance of mobile technologies sees it often as a symbol for discussion around issues of democracy, capitalism, individualism and redefinitions of place. These debates are, like all forms of mediation, riddled with paradoxes. As Michael Arnold observes, mobile media is best encapsulated by the notion of “janus-faced” which sees an ongoing process of pushing and pulling whereby one is set free to be anywhere but is on a leash to whims of others anytime. This paradox, for Arnold, is central to all technologies; the more we try to overcome various forms of distance (geographic, temporal, cultural), the more we avoid closeness and intimacy. For Jack Qui, mobile technologies are indeed the ultimate “wireless leash”. These paradoxes see themselves played in a variety of ways.   This is particularly the case in the Asia-Pacific region, which houses divergence and uneven adoption, production and consumption of mobile technologies. The region simultaneously displays distinctive characteristics and a possible future of mobile media worldwide. From the so-called ‘centres’ for mobile innovation such as Tokyo and Seoul that have gained attention in global press to Asian “tigers” such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan that demonstrate high penetration rates (Singapore has a 110% penetration rate), the region often plays out its dynamics through mobile technologies.    The Philippines, for example, is known as the ‘texting capital of the world’ with 300 million text messages sent per day. Moreover, the region has taken central focus for debates around the so-called democratic potential of the mobile phone through examples such as the demise of President Joseph Estrada in the Philippines and the election of President Roh in South Korea (Pertierra, Transforming Technologies; Kim). Through the use of mobile technologies and the so-called rise of the “prosumer” (consumer as producer), we can see debates about the rhetoric and reality of democracy and capitalism in the region.   In the case of nascent forms of capitalism, the rise of the mobile phone in China has often been seen as China’s embrace, and redefinition, of capitalism away from being once synonymous with westernisation. As Chua Beng Huat observes, after the 1997 financial crisis in the region notions of consumerism and modernity ceased to be equated with westernization. In the case of China, the cell phone has taken on a pivotal role in everyday life with over 220 billion messages – over half the world’s SMS – sent yearly in China.    Despite the ubiquity and multi-layered nature of mobile media in the region, this area has received little attention in the growing literature on mobile communication globally. Publications often explore ‘Asia’ in the context of ‘global’ media or Asia in contrast to Europe. Examples include Katz and Aakhus’s (eds.) seminal anthology Perpetual Contact, Pertierra’s (ed.) The Social Construction and Usage of Communication Technologies: European and Asian experiences and, more recently, Castells et al., Mobile Communication and Society: A Global Perspective. When publications do focus specifically on ‘Asia’, they single out particular locations in the region, such as Ito et al.’s compelling study on Japan, Personal, Portable, Pedestrian: Mobile Phones in Japanese Life and Pertierra’s eloquent discussion of the Philippines in Transforming Technologies: Altered Selves.   This issue of M/C Journal attempts to address the dynamic and evolving role of mobile technologies in the Asia-Pacific region. By deploying various approaches to different issues involving mobile media, this issue aims to connect, through a regional imaginary, some of the nuances of local experience within the Asia-Pacific.   As a construct, the region of the Asia-Pacific is ever evolving with constantly shifting economic and political power distributions. The rapid economic growth of parts of the region (Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Korea, Hong Kong, and now China, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia) over the last two to three decades, has led to increasing linkages between these nations in creating transnational networks. The boundaries of the Asia-Pacific are indeterminate and open to contestation and social construction. Initially, the Asia-Pacific was a Euro-American invention, however, its ‘Asian’ content is now playing a greater role in self-constructions, and in influencing the economic, cultural and political entity that is the Asia-Pacific.   There have been alternative terms and definitions proffered to describe or delimit the area posited as the Asia-Pacific in an attempt to acknowledge, or subsume, the hierarchies inherent within the region. For example, John Eperjesi has critiqued the ‘American Pacific’ which “names the regional imaginary through which capital looked to expand into Asia and the Pacific at the turn of the [last] century” (195). Arif Dirlik has also suggested two other terms: ‘Asian Pacific’ and ‘Euro-American Pacific.’ He suggests, “the former refers not just to the region’s location, but, more important, to its human constitution; the latter refers to another human component of the region (at least at present) and also to its invention as a regional structure.” (“Asia-Pacific Idea”, 64). Together, Rob Wilson and Arif Dirlik use the configuration ‘Asia/Pacific’ to discuss the region as a space of cultural production, social migration, and transnational innovation, whereby “the slash would signify linkage yet difference” (6). These various terms are useful only insofar as they expose the ideological bases of the definitions, and identify its centre(s).    In this emphasis on geography, it is important not to obscure the temporal and spatial characteristics of human activities that constitute regions. As Arif Dirlik notes, “[an] emphasis on human activity shifts attention from physical area to the construction of geography through human interactions; it also underlines the historicity of the region’s formations” (What Is in a Rim?, 4).    The three-part structure of this issue seeks to provide various perspectives on the use of mobile technologies and media – from a macro, regional level, to micro, local case studies – in the context of both historical and contemporary formations and definitions of the Asia-Pacific. In an age of mobile technologies we see that rather than erode, notions of place and locality take on increasing significance.   The first four papers by Jaz Hee-jeong Choi, Gerard Raiti, Yasmin Ibrahim, and Collette Snowden &amp; Kerry Green highlight some of the key concepts and phenomena associated with mobile media in the region. Choi’s paper provides a wonderful introduction to the culture of mobile technologies in East Asia, focusing largely on South Korea, China and Japan. She problematises the rhetoric surrounding technological fetishism and techno-orientalism in definitions of ‘mobile’ and ‘digital’ East Asia and raises important questions regarding the transformation and future of East Asia’s mobile cultures.    Gerard Raiti examines the behemoth of globalization from the point of view of personal intimacy. He asks us to reconsider notions of intimacy in a period marked by co-presence; particularly in light of the problematic conflation between love and technological intimacy.    Yasmin Ibrahim considers the way the body is increasingly implicated through the personalisation of mobile technologies and becomes a collaborator in the creation of media events. Ibrahim argues that what she calls the ‘personal gaze’ of the consumer is contributing to the visual narratives of global and local events. What we have is a figure of the mediated mobile body that participates in the political economy of events construction.    The paradoxical role of mobile technologies as both pushing and pulling us, helping and hindering us (Arnold) is taken up in Collette Snowden and Kerry Green’s paper on the role of media reporting, mobility and trauma. Extending some of Ibrahim’s comments in the specific case of the reporting of traumatic events, Snowden and Green provide a wonderful companion piece about how media reporting is being transformed by contemporary mobile practices. As an integral component of contemporary visual cultures, camera phone practices are arguably both extending and creating emerging ways of seeing and representing.   In the second section, we begin our case studies exploring the socio-cultural particularities of various adaptations of mobile media within specific locations in the Asia-Pacific. Randy Jay C. Solis elaborates on Gerard Raiti’s discussion of intimacy and love by exploring how the practice of ‘texting’ has contributed to the development of romantic relationships in the Philippines in terms of its convenience and affordability. Lee Humphreys and Thomas Barker further extend this discussion by investigating the way Indonesians use the mobile phone for dating and sex. As in Solis’s article, the authors view the mobile phone as a tool of communication, identity management and social networking that mediates new forms of love, sex and romance in Indonesia, particularly through mobile dating software and mobile pornography.    Li Li’s paper takes the playful obsession the Chinese and South Koreans have with lucky numbers and locates its socio-cultural roots. Through a series of semi-structured interviews, the author traces this use of lucky mobile numbers to the rise of consumerism in China and views this so-called ‘superstition’ in terms of the entry into modernity for both China and South Korea.    Chih-Hui Lai’s paper explores the rise of Web 2.0. in Taiwan, which, in comparison to other locations in the region, is still relatively under-documented in terms of its usage of mobile media. Here Lai addresses this gap by exploring the burgeoning role of mobile media to access and engage with online communities through the case study of EzMoBo.    In the final section we problematise Australia’s place in the Asia-Pacific and, in particular, the nation’s politically and culturally uncomfortable relationship with Asia. Described as ‘west in Asia’ by Rao, and as ‘South’ of the West by Gibson, Yue, and Hawkins, Australia’s uneasy relationship with Asia deserves its own location. We begin this section with a paper by Mariann Hardey that presents a case study of Australian university students and their relationship to, and with, the mobile phone, providing original empirical work on the country’s ‘iGeneration’.   Next Linda Leung’s critique of mobile telephony in the context of immigration detention centres engages with the political dimensions of technology and difference between connection and contact. Here we reminded of the luxury of mobile technologies that are the so-called necessity of contemporary everyday life. We are also reminded of the ‘cost’ of different forms of mobility and immobility – technological, geographic, physical and socio-cultural. Leung’s discussion of displacement and mobility amongst refugees calls upon us to reconsider some of the conflations occurring around mobile telephony and new media outside the comfort of everyday urbanity.    The final paper, by Peter B. White and Naomi Rosh White, addresses the urban and rural divide so pointed in Australia (with 80% of the population living in urban areas) by discussing an older, though still relevant mobile technology, the CB radio. This paper reminds us that despite the technological fetishism of urban Australia, once outside of urban contexts, we are made acutely aware of Australia as a land containing a plethora of black spots (in which mobile phones are out of range).    All of the papers in this issue address, in their own way, theoretical and empirical ‘black spots’ in research and speak to the ‘future’ of mobile media in a region that, while diverse, is being increasingly brought together by technologies such as the mobile phone.     Lastly, we are pleased to include a photo essay by Andrew Johnson. Entitled Zeitgeist, this series of artworks sees Johnson exploring the symbolic dimensions of the hand phone in South Korea by drawing on the metaphor of the dust mask. According the Johnson, these images refer to ‘the visibility and invisibility of communication’ that characterises the spirit of our time.   The cover image is by Larissa Hjorth as part of her Snapshots: Portrait of the Mobile series conducted whilst on an Asialink residency at Ssamzie space (Seoul, South Korea) in 2005.

"2007","The Wireless Leash: Mobile Messaging Service as a Means of Control","Mobile messaging, including short-messaging service (SMS) and multimedia messaging service (MMS), is an asynchronous mobile phone service that is too often deemed as a tool for entertainment and consumption at the micro individual level. This paper, however, examines the more structural aspects of mobile messaging being socially, economically, and politically shaped as a means of control. It first establishes conceptual connections between existing mobile communication studies and the historical tendency for information and communication technologies (ICTs) to be used for surveillance and authoritarian power projects. This discussion is substantiated by a brief global overview of related incidents occurring in Malaysia, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Hong Kong, all in 2005. The paper then focuses on mobile messaging and social control in China, where a massive IT industrial complex has emerged since 2000 to serve the control needs of the power elite, especially with regard to SMS. There is both macro institutional formations at the national and transnational levels and more specific organizational developments, such as in the workplace for purposes of labor control or at the interface between broadcast stations and audiences in order to reduce the political risk of phone-in programs. The overall argument is that, the political function of mobile messaging has to be understood as part of the existing institutional structures of a given society; and that only by fully recognizing problems in the political status quo, in power projects at micro, meso, and macro levels, can we seize the opportunity for social change.","",""
"2007","Perceptions of Mobile Phone Use in Public Settings: A Cross-Cultural Comparison","This study entailed a cross-cultural comparison of perceptions of mobile phone use in select public settings, including a movie theater, restaurant, bus, grocery store, classroom, and sidewalk. A sample of participants from the U.S. Mainland, Hawaii, Japan, Taiwan, and Sweden was surveyed for social acceptability assessments of talking on a mobile phone in each of these locations. As hypothesized, settings involving collective attention were considered least acceptable for talking on a mobile phone. Results also revealed numerous cultural similarities and differences. Taiwanese participants tended to report more tolerance for mobile phone use in a theater, restaurant, and classroom than did participants from the other cultural groupings. Japanese participants also tended to be more tolerant of mobile phone use in a classroom, but less tolerant of use on a sidewalk and on a bus than were the other participants. The discussion offers theoretical implications of the findings.","",""

"2007","Mobile Selves: Gender, ethnicity and mobile phones in the everyday lives of young Pakistani-British women and men","This paper focuses on mobile phone use by a young minority ethnic group as a medium through which to explore diversity and technology use in everyday life. Recent research with young people has shown that mobile phones are instrumentally, socially and emotionally important but few have problematized the homogeneous concept of ‘youth’. This paper argues for increased recognition of the intersections of social categories such as youth, gender and ethnicity with technologies, specifically mobile phones, in order to understand complexity of use. Drawing on new empirical, qualitative data from an urban area in the North East of England we explore the focus group narratives of young Pakistani-British Muslim women and men focusing on the notion of ‘shifting’ gendered and cultural identities and social practices, developed and reworked in relation to the use of mobile phones. We look at the gendered dynamics of mobile use, including gender talk and text, and ask whether the young women and men experience mobiles differently in everyday life. We also explore the ways in which mobiles are used to create ‘space of one's own’ and the gendered dynamics of remaining connected, especially to key peer groups. The paper concludes with the assertion that in order to fully explore the mutability of youth cultures across space and time, we need to develop a more dynamic concept of ‘mobile selves’ by exploring the place and meaning of technologies such as mobile phones in the rich tapestries of young people's lives.","",""
"2007","Global Nomads' Network and Mobile Sociality: Exploring New Media Uses on the Move","This paper explores the convergence of communication and travel and the emergence of a mobile and network sociality, through investigating new communication practices based on the internet and mobile phone enacted by backpackers while on the move. These global nomads produce and maintain mobile spaces of sociality, founded on a complex intersection of face-to-face interaction and mediated communication, co-presence and virtual proximity, corporeal travel and virtual mobilities. Personal communities become a mobile phenomenon, relocalized in a plurality of online and offline social spaces. It is thus argued that network relationships are reshaped and mobilized through reconfigurations of co-presence, proximity and distance in relation to the use of new media. Exploring new media uses on the move can thus provide a useful insight into the emerging social model of the network and mobile society.","",""
"2007","Phones R Us","Mobile phones are everywhere, and researchers of mobile society have not been far behind. Two recent edited collections, Thumb Culture and Mobile Communications, give different views of the state of research on mobile phone use. Like the phones themselves, these articles span the range of modern life. They discuss situations varying from the dramatic (sexual liberation in India, bomb detonation in Madrid, and bomber capture through camera phones in London) to the unbelievably mundane (the daily messages of teenagers). They address questions at the grandest of scales (are mobiles an “antievolutionary” device causing a return to “premodern” patterns of social life?) and at the smallest (what are the word frequencies in Norwegian text messages?). These two books provide a way to take stock of where the research is today. What are seen as the important social and cultural questions about mobile phones? What do we know? And what might we be missing? Thumb Culture has a media studies and communications flavor. The discussions tend to take on more of the larger cultural and structural questions. Hans Geser’s chapter worries that mobile phone users are too focused on maintaining existing social bonds, not leaving themselves open to new relationships and experiences. James Katz wonders whether people can be left alone with their thoughts anymore, now that every idle moment can be filled with conversation, mostly within a close circle of family and friends. Blurring boundaries between private and public life, the joy and stress of being “always on,” and the question of whether companies are getting more work for free are examples of the social and cultural issues under discussion. Jonathan Donner’s chapter on Rwandan entrepreneurs is particularly powerful. The difference that a mobile phone can make for the livelihood of an African baker, hair-braider, or restaurant owner is truly life changing. Thumb Culture also benefits from including industry, as well as academic, perspectives. The industry voices remind us just how dramatic and unexpected the success of the mobile phone has been, particularly text messaging. They attribute the success of mobile phones to not just giving people the freedom to communicate, but also the freedom not to communicate—text messaging and call screening allow people to reassert control over when and how communications take place. With their amazement at success, however, comes a continuing frustration at the industry’s inability to find successful new data services. Paul Golding argues that new third-generation data services are still the future, while Nick Foggin counters that 98% of mobile phone revenues still come from traditional services (voice, voice mail, and text messaging) and that the industry should spend more time on basics like reliability and high quality audio. Mobile Communications offers a computer-supported cooperative work focus, with more emphasis on microinteractions, psychology, and language use. Goffman is the theorist cited frequently here. The idea of human selfpresentation as a theater with a front stage and back stage is used across chapters to understand the detailed practices of mobile phone use in public places. Studies of word counts, grammar changes and abbreviations in text messages, and the use of humorous versus practical “away” messages concentrate on detailed language shifts in mobile phone use. The commercialization section of the book takes on the question of new data services, with one study finding that personal expressiveness was more important than instrumental benefits for explaining the adoption of a new parking payment service.","",""
"2007","Japan's mobile technoculture: the production of a cellular playscape and its                 cultural implications"," The reception of mobile communication and internet by Japan’s youth in the late 1990s has determined the shaping of the mobile communication market in this country. From a business-oriented device, mobile phones were transformed into an intensely personal part of the users’ lives, particularly notable for offering a spectacular interactive playscape that challenges the tyranny of everyday life. Rather than being a trivial mechanism of stress release or a means to make the in-between temporalities of everyday life more enjoyable, this playscape has come to be a cultural arena that both reflects as well as induces socio-cultural change. In reconstructing the cultural production of Japan’s cellular playscape, this article focuses on two sets of issues. The first is the contextualization of the mobile communication market in Japan within broader cultural processes in which youths have become the new cultural avant-garde of urban lifestyles. The second is an analysis of how the merging of play into everyday life through mobile communication technologies is creating new modes of relating to the social, technological and urban environments.

"2007","The Mobile Phone and the Public Sphere"," This article seeks to explore the influence of the mobile phone on the public sphere, in particular with regard to its effect on news agendas, gatekeepers and primary definers. Using the examples of the Chinese SARS outbreak (2003), the south-east Asian tsunami (December 2004) and the London bombings (July 2005), the author questions the extent to which the mobile phone is challenging conventional and official sources of information. At times of national and personal calamity, the mobile phone is used to document and report events from eyewitnesses and those closely involved. Using multimedia messages (MMS) or text messages (SMS) to communities of friends and families, as well as audio phone calls, mobile phone users may precede and scoop official sources and thwart censorship and news blackouts. They can also provide valuable evidence of what actually occurred. Users are able to take pictures and short films and transmit these rapidly to others along with reports of what is happening where they are; they are also able to access other media broadcasts and the internet. They are what have become known as `citizen journalists'. The evidence suggests that mobile phone usage is contributing to the public sphere and in some instances is circumventing official repression or inadequate information. There is also an indication that the `mobcam' is capturing images that would otherwise be lost. However, the mainstream media has been quick to take advantage of this citizen journalism and mediate it within its own parameters. ","",""
"2007","The hermeneutic circle of cellphone use: four universal moments in a Malaysian narrative of continuing contact"," Telephone users are teleological or future-oriented — temporarily apart, anticipatory, they articulate and appropriate meaning. Often, gender and generational cultures are held to differ in their accessing of phone formats and functions (call, data download, email, internet, multimedia and short message services). Drawing upon hermeneutic theory of understanding, the article argues that despite this diversity, there are four underlying universal cognitive moments characterizing the process of receiving and responding to handphone content: (1) perceiving and simultaneously (2) projecting potential narrative; (3) producing a coherent call, message or text; and (4) positioning the significance of cellphone meaning for a life-world. Referring to this fourfold ludology of immersion and inferring content allows us to consider in conceptual detail Malaysian corporate and consumer narratives of employing handphone technology. Philosophically grounded theory shows how culturally concrete experiences of cellphone use during work and leisure instantiate abstract patterns of understanding in reception and response. ","",""

"2007","Editorial: mobile communication and Asian modernities","The global emergence of mobile phone and wireless services has renewed the call for new media researchers to understand better the relationship between information and communication technologies (ICTs) and society. This is an intellectual challenge comparable to the one posed by the rise of the internet a decade ago. In this themed section of New Media & Society, we propose to take on the challenge and explore the opportunities therein by examining the social, cultural and institutional dynamics of wireless ICTs and the formation of multiple modernities in the context of contemporary Asia. We choose to focus on this part of the world because Asia has long been portrayed as an exotic Other outside western modernity. However, since the post-war industrialization of Japan and the ‘tiger’ economies and the recent economic and technological boom in China, India and several Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia and Singapore, the region has become a major global ICT powerhouse, especially with regard to aspects of mobile communication. In the wake of the Asian Financial crisis of the late 1990s, we have observed a surprising leap in the diffusion of mobile phones throughout Asia, now home to more users than Europe or North America (International Telecommunications Union, 2005). Parallel to rapid technological diffusion is the impressive production capacity of Asia as the world’s leading manufacturer of mobile handsets and accessories.While European and American brands remain prominent in Asian markets, indigenous capacity has been connected to transnational capital and global networks of production and distribution,","",""

It provides an international anatomy of this industry model and the ways in which it has been used to capitalize upon the surprising success of short message service (SMS) to provide a basis for the development of consumer markets for mobile data services. It situates this analysis within a wider consideration of the role of premium rate culture in the social shaping of interactivity in convergent media. Specifically, it looks at how premium rate services are being constructed in relation to telecommunications, television and the internet. The article concludes that although premium rate culture has rejuvenated innovation in broadcast television, potentially it may constrain the interactive potential of the mobile internet. ","",""
"2008","The Adoption of Mobile Phones in Emerging Markets: Global Diffusion and the Rural Challenge","This paper offers an assessment of the drivers of mobile phone diffusion in emerging markets. It addresses both demand- and supply-side factors and provides an outlook on the diffusion process going forward, as two or three billion more mobile users are accommodated by mobile networks in addition to today’s 3.5 billion subscribers and users .     The paper focuses on several specific issues, namely the relationship of mobile phone adoption to income levels and legacy phone service as well as the role of prepaid phones and asymmetrical interconnection fees in hastening mobile diffusion in emerging markets. It also analyzes the impact of different levels of competition on mobile phone adoption, indicating that the diffusion benefits may recede as the number of operators increases. Finally, it attempts to explain why mobile penetration has been higher in Eastern Europe than in Latin America and in China than in India.     Looking forward, the paper addresses the major challenges the mobile industry faces in extending mobile networks to rural regions in Africa, Asia, Latin America and elsewhere. The paper questions whether the market will be able to serve the last one or two billion potential subscribers or whether subsidies will be required, and notes the emerging use of infrastructure sharing and output-based subsidy schemes to foster rural network deployment. In also calls for research on mobile phone awareness and ability-to-pay levels among the world’s non-users and non-subscribers to help determine whether the recent 25% annual growth in worldwide mobile phone diffusion is sustainable.     Inputs to the paper include a literature review, comparative databases, the author’s studies of mobile adoption in individual countries, and the comments of reviewers of earlier drafts.","",""
"2008","Mobile Generations: The Role of Mobile Technology in the Shaping of Swedish Media Generations","It is often argued that young people are among the first to adopt new media technologies, and that they are especially keen on taking on all new features connected with mobile technology and the Internet. In spite of this oft-repeated claim, one could suspect that since computers and mobile phones have become so widespread among large portions of the populations in the industrialised world, it might not be technology, per se, that distinguishes the young from the old, but rather the actual ways in which it is used. One approach to discuss this is in terms of media generations. It could be expected that generations that have grown up with different mediated experiences during their formative years will relate to the mobile technology in a variety of ways (cf. Mannheim, 1952 & Volkmer, 2006). In this article, three such generations are analysed: the radio/print generation (born in the 1930s), the TV generation (born in the 1950s), and the mobile technology generation (born in the 1980s). Access and usage patterns are researched, and the degree to which the three generations differ when it comes to their relations to mobile technology is discussed, but also the unifying character of the mobile telephony usage. Our methodological approach is quantitative, analysing results from annually conducted postal surveys that are representative for the Swedish population.","",""

The article brings together studies of travel, communications and social networks through a particular focus upon the multiple processes of coordination. We specifically examine how communications are used to coordinate meetings between friends and family members, and how these ‘coordination technologies’ have in part changed the nature of arrangements to meet and conduct face-to-face meetings. We show striking changes in technologies and cultures of coordination – a shift from punctuality effected through clock time to a flexible and perpetual coordination effected through email and mobiles. This empirical research addresses specifically located embodied practices of coordinating meetings and it illustrates how coordination is a practical, relational accomplishment and how coordination cultures are variable amongst young adults.","",""

"2008","EFFECTIVE USE OF MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS IN E-GOVERNMENT: How do we reach the tipping point?","This paper investigates what is needed to make the mobile phone a more effective tool for the interaction between government and governed. Recent studies have shown that a significant proportion of the UK population have no intention of accessing the Internet; however, it is reported that there are more web-enabled mobile phones than there are PCs in the UK. Mobile phones may thus offer the most viable electronic channel through which to encourage large-scale take-up of online public services. Although people have integrated mobile phones into their everyday lives, we argue that unless there is a substantial change in social practices the much heralded ‘m-government’ will take a significant amount of time to become a reality. Despite these ongoing challenges, mobile technologies offer huge potential to represent mainstream government/citizen interaction. The paper will draw upon case studies of best practice from around the world to investigate the emerging ways in which large-scale usage of this type of government/citizen interaction can be achieved.","",""
"2008","Mobilising Poverty?: Mobile Phone Use and Everyday Spatial Mobility Among Low-Income Families in Santiago, Chile","In the last few decades physical mobility has become one of the key elements of contemporary societies. This centrality of mobility also means the development of a new kind of social exclusion caused by the problems of living in a social context in which one has to be increasingly “on the move” to access goods and services. In this article, based on fieldwork conducted with 20 low-income family inhabitants of the city of Santiago, Chile, we study the role that mobile phone usage has in relation to physical mobility in the everyday lives of these individuals. Through an analysis of the pattern of usage and mobility of these devices, we arrive at the conclusion that rather than giving rise to an experience of constant mobility and “anytime–anywhere” availability, the individuals studied face limitations and exclusions that profoundly constrict the potential “mobility” afforded by these devices.","",""

"2008","Sex, Cannibals, and the Language of Cool: Indonesian Tales of the Phone and Modernity","In Indonesia mobile technology has come at the end of 35 years of the Suharto regime, and in its aftermath an era of new openness. Not surprisingly mobile phones are by many Indonesians associated with the new freedoms of this post-1998 period, facilitating newly emergent youth cultures, a hip mobile lifestyle as well as experiments with novel sexual identities. In a country characterized by stark contrasts—between center and periphery, city and countryside, and the rich and the poor—this has at the same time resulted in an uneven spread of technology, and thus in the coexistence of very diverse cellular markets. Through deliberating the pros and cons of mobile technology, new possibilities the phone seems to offer, and the often creative solutions people find in gaining access to mobility, it is shown how Indonesians try coming to terms with the otherwise abstract notion of (post)modernity.","",""

It categorizes studies along two dimensions. One dimension distinguishes studies of the determinants of mobile adoption from those that assess the impacts of mobile use, and from those focused on the interrelationships between mobile technologies and users. A secondary dimension identifies a subset of studies with a strong economic development perspective. The discussion considers the implications of the resulting review and typology for future research.","",""

I do so by way of a preliminary inquiry that seeks to explore the intersection between the emergence of mobiles in Australia with transformations in that country's sense of its relationship with Asia. First I discuss the history of the mobile phone in Australia, noting some important uses and representations that formed part of its social shaping. Second, I explore mobiles and the paradoxes of multiculturalism, and also how digital technologies became central to political culture and identity debates in Australia in the early to-mid 1990s. Third, I look at some important moments in the social shaping of text messaging, in which questions of cultural difference were decisive. Finally, I offer concluding remarks about future research on mobiles in Australia and how they are tied into Asian identities.","",""

Epitomising contemporary convergence by way of its smorgasbord of applications and multimedia possibilities, it seems almost impossible to get such a device just for voice calling without all the `extras'. But is mobile media a new emerging art form? Is it new media? Or is it a domestic technology? And in an age of convergent media can we distinguish the different media histories? As a symbol of convergent global media, mobile phone practices are also marked by divergence. This divergence is particularly the case in terms of the increasingly tenacious role of the local in informing and adapting the global. The history of the mobile phone as a communication device inflects the localized practices of mobile multimedia, fusing communication with new media discourses. This article will discuss the rise of mobile communication studies and the role of locality, then turn to one of the centres for mobile innovation, Seoul, to discuss the role of mobile media as a domestic new media.","",""

The first is the use of cell phones in a protest movement in the Philippines that resulted in the resignation of President Joseph Estrada in 2001. I then look at the marketing and consumption of cell phones in the (over)developed world, focusing on the USA. I argue that the Philippine protest movement, known as People Power II, indicates the medium's progressive potential, while the marketing of cell phones in the USA indicates the medium's reactionary potential, or, borrowing a term from Paul Virilio, the cell phone's potential as `technological nanny'. The comparison tries to steer between two orientations in cultural studies — which I characterize as the optimism of technoutopianism and the pessimism of techno-phobia — in order to appreciate the political potential of cell phones, in particular, and technology in general.

Despite of the robust tradition of network and community studies, mobile social networks are often addressed improperly. This paper presents a theoretical framework to study mobile social networking and examines the design implications of results of an exploratory study conducted with a group of 18 young adults in Finland. The findings of this study indicate that the quality of mobile applications offering social networking could be greatly increased by integrating the knowledge of two traditions that so far developed in parallel, namely the mathematical as well as social approaches to social networks.","",""
"2008","Always on: Libraries in a world of permanent connectivity","Mobile communication has been more widely adopted more quickly than any other technology ever (Castells, et al., 2007). It represents a diffusion of communications and computational capacity into a growing part of our research, learning and social activities. It has resonated with emerging youth behaviors, providing support for distinctive patterns of social interaction and group formation, information use and personal expression.&#x0D; &#x0D; Diffuse networking changes how we coordinate our resources to achieve goals. For example, our use of time and space changes. Timeshifting is routine as students may listen to or watch lectures in the gym or on the train. The use of space to support ad hoc rendezvous and social learning is becoming more important. &#x0D; &#x0D; As networking spreads, we have multiple connection points which offer different grades of experience (the desktop, the cell phone, the xBox or Wii, the GPS system, the smartphone, the ultra-portable notebook, and so on). While these converge in various ways, they are also optimized for different purposes. A natural accompaniment of this mesh of connection points is a move of many services to the cloud, available on the network across these multiple devices and environments. This means that an exclusive focus on the institutional website as the primary delivery mechanism and the browser as the primary consumption environment is increasingly partial. &#x0D; &#x0D; Students are results-oriented and value convenience. This emphasis coupled with the design constraints on some devices promotes a need to get to relevance quickly. Socialization, personalization and location awareness become very important.&#x0D; &#x0D; Libraries have been working to develop network-ready services. Mobile communication intensifies this activity and adds new challenges as they look at what it means to be mobile-ready. This has organizational implications as a shift of emphasis towards workflow integration around the learner or researcher creates new relationships with other service organizations on campus. It also has implications for how space is used, for library skills, and for how collections are developed. We can see the impact of mobile communication on services in two ways. First, services may be made mobile-ready, as with special mobile interfaces for library services, alerting services, and so on. Second, mobilization continues the restructuring of services, organizations and attention that networking has brought about. Think here of how to socialize and personalize services; how to adapt to collection and service use which spans personal, institutional, and cloud environments; how to position and promote the library ‘brand’ as services become atomized and less ‘visible’ on the network; and more complex questions about what best to do locally and what to source with collaborative arrangements or third parties.","",""

This article examines the factors associated with mobile phone usage in the south Indian state of Kerala and the social structural consequences of such usage, particularly the composition and location of the social ties maintained through mobile technologies. Bivariate analysis of mobile phone usage and network composition shows that frequent users have fewer local ties and more external ties than non-frequent users. However, these effects are due largely to the association of email and mobile phone use. The article shows that internet use increases, while mobile phone use decreases the geographical diversity of social ties. The implication is that mobile telephony and internet technologies may have different consequences for the globalization process. ","",""

As a valued commodity, the quality of comforting a person provides may be used to maintain or balance rewards and costs in close relationships. We examined whether perceptions of equity in dating relationships and the effort expended on comforting predict the quality of comforting communication. One hundred and fifteen college students reported their perceptions of equity in their relationships. In addition, they estimated the effort they would expend on comforting their partner in different situations and reported the verbal messages they would use to comfort their partners in a particular scenario. Although molecular measures of equity were significant predictors of comforting behavior, global measures were not. Support was found for the use of comforting communication as a maintenance and a balancing mechanism. In addition, the effort participants would exert in a major crisis was a significant predictor of comforting quality.","",""
"2009","SMS: EXPLOITING THE INTERACTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF NEAR-SYNCHRONY","This paper argues that near-synchrony creates interactional advantages for SMS and that these help to explain the popularity of the medium. The research included 32 interviews with adult mobile phone users, 24-hour communication diaries, and an analysis of respondents' text messages. Many of the text messages collected were short, phatic messages. These distinctive messages exploit the near-synchrony and brevity of SMS. Text messages combine low-contact threshold with immediate direct personal contact; consequently users can send ‘thinking of you’ messages, creating social connection with negligible effort and disruption. The near-synchrony of SMS also enables a distinctive form of conversation. In SMS conversation, the brevity of messages often creates ambiguity, but asynchrony limits scope for collaborative interpretation, making it harder to clarify meaning. However, instead of treating this as a problem for repair, users sometimes deliberately exploit this, using SMS as an equivocal, open-ended form of communication. The paper ends with a discussion of near-synchrony, contrasting SMS, email and instant messaging, and arguing that the temporal affordances of media are socially shaped and not technologically determined.","",""

Exploring aural cultures of surveillance and the eroticization of abstract data, the essay aims to disrupt the privileged status granted to optics within the field of Surveillance Studies-- particularly when it comes to questions of sex and sexualization. Written in the style of the scripts commonly used when conducting phone-based research, the essay positions you (the reader) as a staff interviewer collecting data for a fictional present-day study regarding modern sex practices. Today, the focus of your study is the curious case of 'databaters': a term used for the male masturbators who, as a means to elicit intimate information from unsuspecting call recipients, pretend to be social and behavioral scientists conducting exactly this sort of phone-based research. By the mid-1970s, databaters became one of the most common types of problem calls reported by American women. While the background information provided within your script might also reveal a persistent tradition of intimate transgressions within 'real' phone-based social and behavioral science, any such effect is entirely inadvertent.

"2009","Review Article: Mobile phones: appropriation, uses and consequences","These two edited volumes capture some major facets of mobile communication, which is one of the fastest penetrating modes of communication shaping human social networks in the digital world. The market for mobile phones is large and growing rapidly. Also growing is the literature, attempting to make sense of the divergent social, economic and cultural ramifications of mobile phone technology. These volumes provide a closer look at the tiny device that is much more than a tool for keeping people in ready contact. Organized under sub-themes that range from imaging to shaping mobiles, Gerard Goggin’s Mobile Phone Cultures focuses exclusively on the associated cultures of mobile use. True to this theme, the book draws on studies from diverse socio-cultural milieus carrying meaningful theoretical and empirical analyses. James E. Katz’s Handbook of Mobile Communication Studies, as one would expect from a handbook, collates a large number of studies covering a broad compass of themes that examine the ways mobile communication is fitting into and altering social processes. Selecting contributions to these two valuable collections for consideration in this review article was difficult, because of both the broad spectrum of elements of the mobile phone that the compendia address, and the substantial analyses and discussions that the studies undertake. new media & society","",""

Using a domestication perspective, the study examines the use of voice calls compared with texting by youths (aged 18—24) to probe the role of Estonia’s transition from a state-controlled to a market economy in shaping mobile usage. Results show that while the dissemination of mobiles among young Swedes and Estonians is similar, the patterns of texting and calling are not. In Sweden (as in Japan and even the USA), young people text more than they call, while the reverse is true in Estonia. These findings reflect the fact that unlike Swedes, many Estonians obtained mobile phones before getting landlines, and again unlike Swedes, Estonians are likely to give up landlines in favour of mobiles.

For individuals with primarily local usage patterns, both voice calling and text messaging were positively associated with social leisure activity. For those who primarily used the mobile phone to contact others from a distance, text messaging was positively related to social leisure activity, and for those whose mobile contacts were balanced between local and distant, voice calling was positively associated with active membership in organizations. Interpretation of these findings and directions for future research are offered in the discussion. ","",""

Data are derived from a Swedish national survey. We find that in their everyday lives, young adults (compared with older people) seem to be in perpetual contact with family, friends and colleagues, via traditional voice communication but preferably via text messages.

"2010","Mobile phones and the inexorable advance of multimodal connectedness"," The aim of this article is to put mobile phones and uses of other new media into the broader context of cross-cultural comparison. The article focuses on two countries (Sweden and the USA) and on leisure and sociability. A problem with studies narrowly focusing on mobile phones is that the mobile’s uses cannot easily be separated from uses of other information and communication technologies (ICTs), as when ICTs compete for time spent or when key functions such as maintaining relationships are distributed across devices. Therefore the concept of multimodal connectedness is introduced to examine the whole range of ICTs. Once we can see how various technologies for maintaining relationships complement each other, we often find that convergences outweigh divergences between cultures. The implications for cross-cultural comparison are that we can distinguish between culture in an anthropological sense (that is, as a unique way of life) as against mediated culture, where there are increasingly common patterns of multimodally communicative relationships across cultures, even if differences also persist.

I begin with Walter Benjamin’s notion that the rise of the private individual can be indexed to the set of practices that transform the dwelling place into an interiorization of the external world through the collection of images and objects while at the same time acting as a place of refuge from the external world. Linking those observations to Raymond Williams’ notion of mobile privatization, I argue that the contradictory impulses of moving through the world while retreating from it are the product of economic and social structures which act to isolate individuals from each other while connecting them to the products of corporate media, and do not arise from any inherent traits within cellular phone technology.

It is claimed that locative media seeks to re-enchant urban space though the application of locative technologies to develop novel and experimental methods for navigating, exploring and experiencing the city. To this end, SI concepts such as psychogeography and the techniques of detournement and the dérive (drift) have exerted considerable influence on locative media practices, but questions arise as to whether this constitutes a valid contemporary appropriation or a recuperative co-option, serving to neutralise their inherent oppositional qualities. The paper will argue that there is an identifiable strand of locative art works which through their contingent re-appropriation of situationist techniques can be thought of as being involved in the ‘construction of locative situations’, and that these (re)applications of situationist practices point to future directions for locative media's artistic engagement with the accelerating ubiquity of locative technologies.","",""

While developments in media technology are generating progressively smaller, more personalised distribution platforms, onto which the transfer of large screen content is currently performed. Mobile gaming, mobile film, and mobile television content viewing are increasingly marketed as extensions to traditional distribution means. Given the drastically different viewing and distribution mediums of the large and small screens, it is useful to investigate the effectiveness of this practice on the reception of content and audience viewing experience. Results showed that while basic understanding was not lost on a small-screen viewing platform, a significant reduction of overall experience was noted. ","",""

Maps are often thought of as products that allow us to find our way between places. However, they have various other uses and meanings, existing as both scientific and cultural artefacts. Mobile phone technologies have evolved, allowing for the integration of global positioning systems (GPS). The inclusion of GPS in ‘smart phones’ such as the iPhone now allows users to view the spaces they are moving through in new ways. This article examines how we are now remapping places through mobile technologies, which poses the question of how our relationship with local spaces may be changing. It focuses on Foursquare, the Layar AR browser and the iPhone game Argh as examples of how our sense of place and mapping are evolving through user-generated input. ","",""
"2011","Invisible Whispers: Accounts of SMS Communication in Shared Physical Space"," The use of short message services (SMS) on mobile phones has gained huge popularity in most western and many developing countries — so much so that it has become established as the preferred medium for mobile communication especially among young people. This article explores SMS as used for discreet communication between people in the same physical space (‘shared physical space SMS’ — or ‘SPS-SMS’). Drawing from semi-structured interviews with young people in Norway, 10 different scenarios of SPS-SMS use are explored and analysed within an interactionist framework. These sites of SPS-SMS are presented here as ‘communicative affordances’. It is concluded that the mobile phone, by the application of SPS-SMS, affords communicative layers of transparency, by which various SMS users maintain semi-synchronous communication, both for care and coordination. Although a qualitative study of this nature does not lend itself to generalizations about SPS-SMS communication, it does demonstrate how detailed studies of extraordinary uses of mediated communication may be used to widen analyses of social interaction.

"2011","Concerns about mobile phones: A cross-national study","Mobile phones allow people to communicate when, where, and with whom they wish. However, users are often troubled to find themselves always available to others. To measure attitudes towards mobile phones, we asked students from universities in five countries what they liked most and what they liked least about having a mobile phone. Responses across all countries indicated that communication was both what subjects liked most and least — enjoying the ability to contact others but feeling trapped by other people’s ability to always contact them. Concerns about dependency on mobile phones corresponded to intensity of usage. Some distinctions between countries reflect variation in available technology, while others may result from cultural factors.","",""

The results suggest that most respondents value their phone for the connectivity it affords with a variety of personal and professional contacts. In this sense, the mobile phone is not an overt means of poverty reduction for respondents but an integral part of their lives, in which it serves multiple functions. The study contributes empirical data to the emerging body of research on mobile phone communication in African countries. ","",""

Although some stories are more dramatic than others, the kinds of misunderstandings they represent are described as the mobile’s biggest drawback. Based on research on mobile phone use among young adults in the city of Inhambane, the article focuses on instances when connections backfire and when mobile phone communication generates conflict. It examines the ways in which mobile communication participates in the circulation of and access to information: not necessarily the kind of ‘useful information’ referred to by endorsers of the ‘ICT for Development’ perspective, but rather information that is meant to remain secret. The aim is to provide an alternative perspective on the transformative potential of mobile communication in the hopes of enhancing our understanding of the impacts of the spread of the technology.

Findings highlight the difficulty these populations encounter in acquiring and using cell phones due to social and economic factors, and the consequent subversive or illegal tactics used to gain access to such technology. Moreover, these tactics are embedded in and exemplars of the cyclic power relationships between high-and low-income populations that constitute the unique use of mobile technologies in these Brazilian slums. The article concludes by suggesting that future research on technology in low-income communities focus instead on the relationship of people to technology rather than a dichotomization of their access or lack thereof.

"2011","Midwives with mobiles: A dialectical perspective on gender arising from technology introduction in rural Indonesia"," Mobile phones were introduced to rural midwives in tsunami-affected Indonesia, allowing them to contact medical experts and communicate with patients. Ninety-two interviews were conducted with midwives, coordinators, doctors, and village representatives. This study applies a dialectical perspective to supplement the analytical frame of the ICT for healthcare development model (Chib et al., 2008), by addressing the multi-dimensionality of benefits and barriers. The theory of dialectical tension (Baxter and Montgomery, 1996) situates the conceptual discussion around the struggles between autonomy and subordination within gender roles, personal growth versus technological competency, and issues of economic and resource control in traditional hierarchies. We find that midwives engage in legitimization strategies, develop peer support, and focus on strategic issues to develop the capacity for agency and autonomy, despite socio-organizational barriers. Specific recommendations are offered, focusing on the resourcefulness and desire of women. ","",""

Written from a social construction of technology perspective, this article examines the mobile phone as a contemporary technology in the context of its use in illegal drug-dealing and the law enforcement of those practices in Canada. The relationship between illegal drug-dealing and law enforcement responses is critically analyzed, highlighting the way groups representing both sides utilize mobile phone technologies to achieve their divergent goals. Existing constitutional guidelines employed by law enforcement to support the use of mobile and wireless technologies for surveillance are considered, particularly considering the notion of privacy. The article concludes by challenging assumptions that mobile phones are primarily personal artifacts, and instead describes the inherently social nature of mobile communications, thereby calling for a re-conceptualization of current ideology on privacy.

"2011","Texting and African language literacy"," Mobile communication has become an important part of everyday life in Senegal, and text messages have turned out to be highly multilingual. So far Senegalese language policy has supported the use of the official language, French, in education and in writing in general, while the majority language, Wolof, has dominated the oral sphere. As SMS texts tend to include use of Wolof and other African languages as well as French, the question is whether texting will pave the way for African language literacy practices. The aim of this article is to study texting’s potential impact on the status of African languages as written languages through the investigation of SMS messages written and received by fifteen students from Dakar. Ethnographic tools have been used to collect text messages in Wolof, Fulfulde and French, as well as English, Spanish and Arabic, and also data on the context of communication and on the writers’ and receivers’ interpretations of the use of different languages. The analysis shows that African languages are given different roles and values in texting, being used in monolingual messages, in functional codeswitching and in mixed code messages. ","",""
"2011","Are mobile phones changing social networks? A longitudinal study of core networks in Kerala"," Mobile telephony has diffused more rapidly than any Indian technology in recent memory, yet systematic studies of its impact are rare, focusing on technological rather than social change. We employ network surveys of separate groups of Kerala residents in 2002 and again in 2007 to examine recent shifts in mobile usage patterns and social relationships. Results show (1) near saturation of mobiles among both the professionals and nonprofessionals sampled, (2) a decrease in the number of social linkages across tie types and physical locations, and (3) a shift towards friends and family but away from work relationships in the core networks of Malayalis. We interpret these findings as support for the bounded solidarity thesis of remote communication that emphasizes social insulation and network closure as mobiles shield individuals from their wider surroundings.

Implications of risk and mobile phones are reflected in current media discourse and contemporary public discussions. While the concept of risk remains at the centre of current sociological debate, children have only recently been seen as active social actors within social science. Based on the accounts of 30 young people aged between 11 and 17, the article adopts a social constructivist perspective to explore the relationship between young people’s talk of sexuality and sexual acts in their discussions of mobile phone use, within the wider theoretical debates about risk and self-identity.

Media ecological perspectives argue that the introduction of such new technologies can shift the existing biases in prevailing social systems. According to one ecological perspective, the theory of the niche, when new media technologies are successfully introduced into a domain, displacement may occur unless some alteration is made to the resource base. Interstices are conceptualized as the gaps in the routines of media users between scheduled activities. Through the use of a diary method, participants logged access to news using a variety of communication technologies, including mobile channels.

"2011","Mobile phones without guarantees: The promises of technology and the contingencies of culture"," The mobile phone’s global diffusion has generated hope in its ability to enable individuals in developing countries to increase their income and life opportunities. However, numerous socio-cultural factors contribute to the outcomes of technology in diverse contexts. This article uses Alcoff’s (2006) theory of positionality and the notion of socio-techno practices to examine mobile phones and the labor relations of young rural-to-urban migrant women working in the low-level service sector in Beijing. This study argues that the women’s gender, age, class, and rural origin produce particular constraints on their ability to generate higher income and find better jobs. It also reveals that some employers use mobile phones for surveillance of employees, which was not likely before since most migrant women do not have landlines. This article shows that as much as the mobile phone is a liberatory and equalizing technology, it can also reinforce rather than upset patriarchal power relationships. ","",""
"2011","Location-aware mobile media and urban sociability"," Location-aware mobile media allow users to see their locations on a map on their mobile phone screens. These applications either disclose the physical positions of known friends, or represent the locations of groups of unknown people. We call these interfaces eponymous and anonymous, respectively. This article presents our classification of eponymous and anonymous location-aware interfaces by investigating how these applications may require us to rethink our understanding of urban sociability, particularly how we coordinate and communicate in public spaces. We argue that common assumptions made about location-aware mobile media, namely their ability to increase one’s spatial awareness and to encourage one to meet more people in public spaces, might be fallacious due to pre-existing practices of sociability in the city. We explore these issues in the light of three bodies of theory: Goffman’s presentation of self in everyday life, Simmel’s ideas on sociability, and Lehtonen and Mäenpää’s concept of street sociability.

"2011","Mobile communication in the global south"," Mobile communication has become a common phenomenon in most parts of the world. There are indeed more mobile subscriptions than there are people who use the internet. For many people outside of the metropolitan areas of Europe and North America, this is literally their first use of electronically mediated interaction. This preface to the special issue of New Media &amp; Society examines mobile communication in a global context. Through an overview of eight articles situated in the global south, we describe how mobile communication sheds light upon notions of information, appropriation and development and how it is challenging, and in many cases changing, notions of gender. While the mobile phone reshapes development and micro dynamics of gendered interactions, it is not necessarily a revolutionary tool. Existing power structures may be rearranged, but they are nonetheless quite stable. The analysis of mobile communication in the global south helps us to understand the rise of innovative practices around information and communication technologies and, in turn, enables us to develop theory to understand these emergent empirical realities.

"2011","Designing multimodal tracks for mobile users in unfamiliar urban environments","While there have been many studies of navigation design guidelines for integrating maps in mobile devices, we argue that the research focus should turn more towards the design of multimodal navigation aids, which would reflect the impact of typical human wayfinding behaviour. Therefore, we suggest an interdisciplinary design approach, i.e. building on urban design practice that focuses on supporting the navigation of pedestrians in urban areas. The design implications are explored in this study with the subjects being pedestrians accomplishing wayfinding tasks in an unfamiliar, urban area. The main areas that this paper contributes to are: investigating the design implications of multimodal navigation aids; evaluating these in the context of mobile wayfinding tasks; and reflecting the results according to the user's wayfinding strategies and spatial anxiety. It is concluded that through designing multimodal tracks into mobile navigation applications we can help users to find their way in unfamiliar, urban environments.","",""
"2012","List Media: The Telephone Directory and the Arranging of Names"," … there is nothing remotely creative about arranging names alphabetically in a white pages directory. It is an age-old practice, firmly rooted in tradition and so commonplace that it has come to be expected as a matter of course. — Justice O’Connor, judgment in Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service Company, 1991Does a telephone directory have an author? — Justice Finkelstein, judgment in Telstra v Desktop Marketing 2001I own the copyright to my information. I collect the listings and I put them in a database for print or digital (online) use, and that database is my book, my brand, my copyright. — Greg Ellis, Sensis general manager, 2004 (quoted in Barker)The Telephone Directory as a Species of List MediaOnce a common fixture in households and businesses with a telephone service, the telephone directory illustrates the beguiling nature of lists. At first glance, the telephone directory looks like a simple list of the names of subscribers, their phone numbers, and addresses. As the telephone spreads across societies, reaching something like “universal” coverage in many countries in the 1990s, then telephone directories become much more elaborate. They are stuffed full with many more names, though it is not only their heft that distinguishes them. The telephone directory is a lucrative vehicle for advertising, for many years a significant competitor to, if not outstripping, other forms of “main media” advertising (CEASA). The telephone directory also functioned to enable direct marketing of potential products and services to customers. As we shall see, the complexity of telephone directories deepens with computerisation of lists and advances in software and programming, as the database becomes their paradigmatic form.Thus, the practice of making a list of telephone subscribers is far richer and more consequential than it ordinarily seems. Over its nearly one hundred and fifty year history, there is a persistent, perplexed plaint that this kind of list-making is entirely ordinary. Not perceived as the slightest bit creative, the directory is just a matter of arranging names. Yet, from its inception, the nature of telephone directories was more complex than this. Furthermore, as directories grew in size, reach, and financial worth, the compilation of telephone directories has become much more complicated still. To make a telephone directory in the twenty-first century entails the computational, network, and human resources, of some of the largest corporations in history—who remain on permanent guard against incursions from competitors wishing to enter the phone list market. Accordingly, contemporary telephone directories are not the kind of literary lists of which Robert Belknap writes: “personal constructions that invite different interpretations from different readers” (Belknap xv). For Belknap, there is a “principle of expandibility” that characterises the shopping list, or telephone directory,which retains numbers of individual entries and orders them according to a straightforward principle for ease of use. In this instance, elements are added alphabetically, rather than tacked on at the end, but fundamentally both the grocery list and the telephone directory readily assimilate additional members. (Belknap 31)While expandability might apply to literary lists, Belknap feels that:literary compilations have a limit to the number of items they can hold, beyond which the addition of further units becomes detrimental. One of things that can go awry with a list is that it can go on for too long: though without bounds in principle, the list has a load limit of what it can skilfully hold. (Belknap 31)Thus, the disciplines of metre in poetry mean that with “such impositions, it is impossible to attain telephone-directory exhaustiveness” (Belknap 31). Exhaustive they might be, but the problem here is really that the telephone directory does not scan so well as literature. Or at least on Belknap’s model of literature created from the confines of narrow lists—rather than works created from technologies of the word-becoming-data. To do justice to lists, and their prevalence and central role in contemporary culture, I propose that it is much more productive to approach the telephone directory as a form of media. As I shall argue in what follows, the notion of list media is a much more fruitful way to assess the cultural practices, meanings, economies, and social correlates of telephone directories, and their implications for lists in our worlds.From a List of Subscribers to the Telephone BookOne of the antecedent forms of the telephone directory was the city or town directory used by people to find someone: “In 1655 a directory for the city of New York provided 255 names of households, arranged by location rather than by name” (Shea 51). City directories coexisted with telephone directories, until the latter superseded them (Shea 51). From their own inception, telephone directories were also a relatively prosaic and useful, yet also socially complex, form of list. In 1893 the telephone directory for the state of New South Wales was entitled New South Wales Government Telephone Exchanges, Sydney ... List of Subscribers (NSW Government). Later, it simply became Telephone Directory (with the name of the district covered).  The first Australian telephone exchange and telephone directory was established in 1880 (Sensis). It was published in succession by the Postmaster-General’s Department, the Postal and Telecommunications Department, Telecom Australia, then finally Telstra (still Australia’s dominant carrier). The telephone directory helped subscribers to know and locate the details of an interlocutor with a telephone, in order to request the operator place a call:Since the telephone numbers can be used regardless of the point of origin of calls, the same directory information may be given to all subscribers. Directories for any region may be prepared in bulk and distributed throughout the Commonwealth as required. Also, subscribers may include their national numbers on letter-heads and in advertisements, providing a useful supplement to Departmental directories and a valuable advertising feature for the public. (Turnbull, Hams, and Pollock 37.1)As the telephone diffused more widely across Australia, the directory became an effective, if still incomplete, list of citizens living in a place. As a public record, the telephone directory was harvested by many historians including, notably, Claude S. Fischer in his social history of the telephone in USA (Fischer). Telephone directories also took on ambiguous social functions in households, especially during the decades when telephones were still not widely used––recalling that in 1975, for instance, in Australia, there were still only 39 telephone instruments in service per 100 head of population (ABS 412), a figure that at least was significantly up from just over 13.6 telephones per 100 in 1950 (Commonwealth Bureau 204). Yet, even early on, furniture was designed around the telephone, with hall-tables designed to accommodate the directory volume: instructions for a telephone table with a “directory compartment […] no larger than necessary to hold the telephone books” is given, for example, in an article in a 1923 issue of Popular Science (Collister).As well as constituting a network of calling parties, the list of telephone subscribers also held considerable commercial value. The commercial and non-commercial interests of subscribers were probably blurred early on in the life of the telephone. With the importance of the telephone instrument for business––advertising and marketing enterprises, and their services and products, as well as contacting them––separate directories were provided for subscribers. The first business listings were published in a trade listings section in the Adelaide White Pages in 1906 (Sensis). Stand-alone commercial directories saw the creation of the Pink Pages as in, for instance, the 1958 the Melbourne classified telephone directory: complete listing of business, professional, commercial and trade subscribers (PMG, Pink Pages). This is distinct from the Telephone Directory, which remains a “list of subscribers to the Melbourne telephone exchange system,” though it does contain a “classified advertising section” courtesy of O’Brien Publicity Company (“by arrangement with the Postmaster-General”) (PMG, Telephone Directory). In 1975, the Pink Pages was succeeded by the Yellow Pages––a commercial directory as well as a “buying guide” (Telecom). In the same year Telecom also established the National Directory Service to manage publication and distribution of its directories (Sensis).With the deregulation of telecommunications around the world from the 1980s onwards, the value of telephone directories and directories-associated services––such as directory assistance to subscribers––rose higher still. A New York Times article estimated that, in 1997 alone, US Yellow Pages generated US$11.5 billion in sales (Elliot, cited in Rysman)––very likely close to the highwater mark for telephone directory revenues. Typically, directories were provided free annually to subscribers, and their cost was covered by advertising revenue (Busse and Rysman; Rysman). Directories were also dominated by telephone companies, with some competition from independent publishers who had not achieved much success (Rysman). Because of their relative lack of competition, and their significance in advertising for small business in particular––who often lacked the wherewithal or clout of large corporations to negotiate better deals––telephone directories became a target for deregulation. Across the world, carriers that had previously enjoyed a monopoly on directories were obliged to unbundle their directory services, and to ensure that their information was made available, with appropriate safeguards, to other telecommunications competitors (Chung). Directories could no longer be used as a privileged branding vehicle for the dominant carrier, and policy discussions ensued about how to deliver essential public and emergency information, while ensuring competition was possible. Argument ensued as to whether the databases that now underlay directories were private goods, and thus fully open to competition, or whether they were actually public goods. Heated discussion ensued about the trade-offs among the different considerations of economic efficiency, stimulating competition, reasonable return to the carrier, and safeguard of appropriate intellectual property rights (Richards). Before its final decommissioning in July 2012, the French Minitel service was in the vanguard of public innovation allowing users to search data from directories (Barr). By the end of the 1990s, ideas and prototypes for directories were fast emerging to deal with a range of associated issues posed for the future of directories by burgeoning email and Internet services, in the face of which listing people, organizations, and addresses was not as straightforward as it had become with telephone directories (Patel and Ryan).At the turn of the century, then, the telephone directory was at a crossroads. The list of subscribers had become something that, as the title of a recent history has it, “everyone uses but no one reads” (Shea). The telephone directory had itself become part of the bundle of essential telecommunications services that governments were prepared to intervene to ensure continued—as a right of citizens. In 1997, the Australian government posed a licence condition on Telstra to produce an “alphabetical public number directory” annually, by geographical area to all customers supplied with a “standard telephone service” (the key policy concept operationalising universal service), with the exclusion of details of customers with unlisted numbers (clause 9, Australian Government). Also protected as an obligation was the new concept of the “industry-wide integrated public number database,” necessary in a competitive market in which carriers and service providers had their own customer databases (clause 10, Australian Government).Arguably, the directory helped the telephone itself to become a “social fact”––Émile Durkheim’s concept of something essential to society that Rich Ling has recently used in relationship to the mobile phone (Ling). The directory was commonly referred to as the “telephone book,” a conceit taken up by theorist Avital Ronnell as the pretext for her discussion of philosophy, technology, and communication (Ronnell). This term for the telephone directory raises the interesting question of in what way a list may become a book. However, a much more significant question, as I suggested at the outset, is when does this genre of the list become a form of media.Following Lev Manovich’s account of media evolution at the turn of the twentieth-century, we could argue that by the time it is a database the telephone directory is well-qualified to be described as a medium. Manovich draws our attention to the dynamics driven bythe need for new technologies to store, organize, and efficiently access [the unprecedented amount of media materials accumulated since the beginning of the nineteenth century] … The emergence of new media coincides with this second stage of a media society, now concerned as much with accessing and reusing existing media objects as with creating new ones. (Manovich 35)For this reason, Manovich proposes that the database is central to contemporary media:The database becomes the center of the creative process in the computer age […] It is not surprising, then, that databases occupy a significant, if not the largest, territory of the new media landscape. (Manovich 229)Regardless of how new media objects present themselves, Manovich suggests, “underneath, on the level of material organization, they are all databases” (Manovich 229). On Manovich’s definition, it is clear that the directory-cum-database is certainly as much about re-using existing telephone directories, and renovating and extending them for a time of digital cultures and networks. It is also about creating new kinds of media characteristics, functions, and possibilities for the telephone directory—parlaying the older form into the kind of agile, ductile, and extensible list media adequate to contemporary conditions. For telephone directories, as we shall see the possibilities and politics of the database as the foundation of a new, second stage of media society prove especially challenging.“A Garden Variety White Pages Directory,” or Stealing Names and Numbers?As telephone directories transmuted into databases, furious battles broke out over the rights to these lists and the information they contained. Customarily, the list of telephone subscribers containing names, numbers, and often addresses were collected in a directory, published as a book, and widely distributed. Can this information be used by others for their own commercial purposes? Or is the telephone directory tantamount to proprietary information, owned and controlled by the telephone company that has collected it? A landmark legal case in the US relating to telephone directories involved a publishing company, Feist Publications. Feist specialised in area-wide telephone directories, covering a number of contiguous calling areas––a much larger geographical range than directories offered by the phone companies. In order to compile its 1983 directory, Feist approached each of 11 telephone companies in the North-West Kansas area, requesting the right to licence their directory information. One company, Rural Telephone Service declined to grant this right, so Feist copied and edited information from their directory, hiring staff to verify relevant listings and seek additional information (Feist v Rural Telephone). When it sued for copyright infringement, “Rural asserted that Feist’s employees were obliged to travel door-to-door or conduct a telephone survey to discover the same information for themselves” (Feist). In return, Feist argued that this requirement was “economically impractical” and that copyright protection did not apply to the copying of this information (Feist). The District Court found for Rural, on the precedent that “courts have consistently held that telephone directories are copyrightable” (Rural Publications v. Feist) and the relevant Court of Appeals upheld the judgment. However, the Supreme Court reversed this decision, on the basis that originality, the sine qua non of copyright, was not demonstrated:The selection, coordination, and arrangement of Rural’s white pages do not satisfy the minimum constitutional standards for copyright protection […] Rural’s white pages are entirely typical. Persons desiring telephone service in Rural’s service area fill out an application and Rural issues them a telephone number. In preparing its white pages, Rural simply takes the data provided by its subscribers and lists it alphabetically by surname. The end product is a garden-variety white pages directory, devoid of even the slightest trace of creativity. (Feist)The Court noted that there may certainly be creativity and originality in a compilation, that sustains a claim of ownership for copyright. Moreover, that Feist appeared to concede the directory as a whole was subject to a valid copyright––because of some “forward text and some original material in the yellow pages” (Feist). However, to establish infringement, the Court felt that it needed to be shown that Feist copied “constituent elements of the work that are original” (Feist). What they copied, the Court determined, was the White Pages material, which fell short of originality:Rural's selection of listings could not be more obvious: It publishes the most basic information—name, town, and telephone number—about each person who applies to it for telephone service. This is “selection” of a sort, but it lacks the modicum of creativity necessary to transform mere selection into copyrightable expression. (Feist)The judgment in Feist vs Rural Publications occurred at a time when competition in telephone directories was intensifying, especially because of the technologies that allowed copying and compilation of data to be achieved much more easily.As well as publishers wishing to compete in the telephone directories market, new products and services emerged that made innovative use of listings. One such service was the reverse telephone directory service, developed during the 1990s. Rather than looking up someone’s name or business to find their phone number and address, the reverse directory allowed a user in possession of a given telephone number to search for the associated subscriber and address details (if not unlisted). Typically the provider used cheap typing services available in low-wage countries offshore to copy information from available telephone directories and compile a list. The list would be combined with a program, and made available on a CD-ROM. The reverse directory raised privacy concerns, and so was subject to regulation in many jurisdictions. Another new technology that allowed gathering of telephone numbers and identification of related subscriber names and address as was caller identification (caller ID; also known as calling number display) (Seecof). In the ensuing debates it was evident that citizens strongly felt attached to their telephone number, as a crucial piece of personal and private information––hence the visceral response many consumers had to the veritable blizzard of telemarketing in this period (Albert). This affect associated with the telephone number only intensified as mobile phones grew in popularity during the 1990s. Before long, these issues raised by the change in telephone directories with competition and new technology were eclipsed by the full-blown development of the commercial Internet. More than anything it was the advent of the Web and associated search engines that fundamentally changed how telephone lists were made, and in turn, how profits were made from them.“That Database Is My Book”Like their American counterparts, Australia’s lists of subscribers were a telecommunications industry commonplace by the time the Web arrived. Not so the corporate arrangements that had evolved to compile, use, and profit from the directories. Australia’s Telstra shifted its directories business into a wholly-owned subsidiary called Pacific Access that, in 2002, became the current Sensis company (Sensis). Today, Sensis styles itself as an innovator in new online and mobile technologies. It takes pride in its century plus of information provision via directories, believing still that this incumbency offers a firm basis to compete with search providers (such as Google) or locative media companies. To this end, Sensis and Telstra have vigorously sought to fight any competitors making use of the White and Yellow pages. This stance on the part of the historic owners of Australia’s directories can be seen in the cases in the early 2000s that went to the heart of the database technology. As noted, databases became the format taken by many lists, including lists of telephone subscribers–­­–resulting in international moves to devise a unique legal framework for the protection of intellectual property in databases  (Fitzgerald and Bartlett 309). The first significant occasion where these matters were considered in Australian courts was the 2001 case Telstra v Desktop Marketing. In the Federal Court, Justice Finkelstein held that Telstra did have copyright in its Yellow and White pages, and that the respondent’s copying had infringed this:the substance of the information that has been taken from Telstra’s works (the directory portion of the directories and the headings that appear in the yellow pages directories and headings books) has been reproduced in the CD-roms. It must be remembered that copyright is not claimed for each particular entry, because copyright does not subsist in each individual recorded fact. It is claimed in the whole of the collected data, ordered in a particular way. As regards the directories, the significant recorded facts (name, address, telephone number, and the relevant type of business) are the same, or substantially the same, as they appear in Telstra’s works. (Telstra v Desktop 84-85)On appeal, the Full Bench of the Federal Court unanimously, though in separate judgments, upheld the decision (Desktop v Telstra), and the High Court later refused special leave to appeal. This outcome raised queries about the application of the law (see discussion in Ice TV). It also highlighted serious policy concerns, leading commentators to question whether copyright was the best way to protect databases:The major difficulty with the decision is that it will be unlawful to innovate on top of or, by using the Telstra database, to create a new improved yet similar database. Extracting facts from all the books in the world is allowable if my book is differently expressed, but extracting facts from all of the Telstra databases to innovate on top of them in a similar (yet standard) alphabetised way is not allowable for life of the author plus 50 years […] It seems once again that we are threatening to stymie the innovations of digital technology by adopting the approaches of a bygone era. (Fitzgerald and Barlett 324-325)By the end of the decade, however, the Australian courts were taking a different direction on telephone directory databases––in Telstra v Phone Directories (2010).The initial judgment usefully described how the list of subscribers is now created:Telstra collects and maintains information in relation to the names and addresses of its subscribers. Sensis […] conducts the business of publishing the WPD [White Pages Directory] and YPD [Yellow Pages Directory] throughout Australia.Each WPD and YPD lists the names, addresses, telephone numbers and other information in relation to residential or business customers for a particular geographic area. In the case of the WPD, the entries are free, but revenue is earned by persuading customers to add enhancements to their free entries for a fee. In the case of the YPD, revenue is earned in the same way and by taking advertisements for customers under multiple headings. (Telstra v Phone Directories)The trial judge records very detailed information on how the design and publishing process is automated, noting with respect to 91 affadavits tendered by Sensis that “there are substantial parts of the directories that do not have human authors [...] are automated to the extent that human involvement is minor [...] or have authors who cannot be ascertained […]” (Telstra v Phone Directories). Despite these complex processes, the appellate judges citing Feist, felt strongly that: The name and address of a particular subscriber does not relevantly “originate” with an employee who takes a note of these details from the subscriber. This information is factual in its nature: it is not “created” by the person who merely records it […]. (section 59, Telstra v Phone Directories, Full Court)In late 2011, Telstra was refused leave to appeal the Telstra v Phone Directories decision in the High Court. In response, the corporation signalled that it would advocate an extension of copyright law to afford protection to databases. Sensis Chief Executive Bruce Akhurst told the American Australian Chamber of Commerce luncheon that:There have been companies that have been copying our books for a long time. It has taken a long time to get through the legal process […]. It is really, I think, a matter of principle and public policy as to whether that form of copyright is appropriate and whether copyright law needs to be modernised to take account of modern technology and the way things are created these days. (Akhurst quoted in Kitney)Akhurst’s remarks underscore that the “way things are created” in lists is precisely what still is at issue, despite the protracted judicial consideration of the status and nature of the modern telephone directory.ConclusionIn the present day, the telephone directory does not play the same role in society as it used to do. In the face of the growing trend to obtain all sorts of information including telephone numbers, email, social media, and other addresses from Internet and mobile search, the future of directories has been seriously questioned (Gettler 2011). Nonetheless, the telephone book remains widely distributed and valued. In Australia, Telstra via its Sensis subsidiary still has an obligation under its licence condition to print and distribute a copy of the White Pages telephone directory to each household. (The Yellow Pages is deemed a commercial product, so not subject to the same distribution.) In capital cities, the White Pages comprises two volumes. The business and government information volume is delivered by default, as more than 80 percent of searches in White Pages are for this information. Since 2010, distribution was altered in Melbourne and Sydney—with household customers needing to “opt in,” to order their copy of the second volume with residential subscriber information. Judged successful, this trial will be extended to Brisbane and Perth next. In regional markets, there remain more than 50 different telephone directories for specific areas, which are “co-bound,” combining one half yellow pages content and one half white pages content. With environmental sustainability a high priority, Sensis receives strong encouragement from its customers to minimize or end its printed directories. However, many other customers, especially in rural and regional areas, still very much value the telephone book (information supplied by Damian Glass, Corporate Affairs, Sensis).While Telstra is still under an obligation to maintain the Integrated Public Number Database (IPND), the future of this database and its policy framework is the subject of a Federal government review, initiated in 2011 and yet to report at the time of writing. The review notes the “basic functionality of the IPND and the provision of the IPND itself has changed very little since 1998, despite there being great advances in database and telecommunications technology” (DBCDE 18). The review also notes that the importance of the telephone service number as an “identifier” is diminishing, and so canvasses the inclusion of the now significant addresses and other identifying information of email accounts, instant messaging, and social media, Internet protocol (IP) addresses, and locational information (DBCDE). The impetus for reform of the IPND and telephone directories generally has grown, with the shift from the public-switched telecommunications network to the new National Broadband Network, where voice telephony will be reconstructed in wholly data network architecture. This policy reconsideration of the role of directories and the databases that now underlie them takes place in the midst of a deep transformation of how lists are created, what kind of media objects they create or entail, and how users interact with them. Telecommunications carriers are keeping a precarious grip on the heritage of the telephone directory, continuing to harvest the inheritance it bestows, and seeking to cover the return on investment necessary to renovate it for today. So, if telephone directories can be considered as list media, their fate is subject to creative destruction, like much else of media in everyday life and culture now.AcknowledgementsMy thanks to two anonymous reviewers of this paper for helpful comments.

"2012","South African Perspectives on Mobile Phones: Challenging the Optimistic Narrative of Mobiles for Development","South Africa, with its high mobile phone penetration rate and persistent social inequalities, is the target of many “mobiles for development” (M4D) initiatives. By comparing South Africans’ stories about mobile phones with the optimistic narrative presented by mobile enthusiasts, this study offers a counterbalance to M4D’s claims that mobile phones incontrovertibly enhance economic situations, improve health outcomes, and guarantee safety. Drawing upon a diverse collection of 79 interviews with NGO employees and beneficiaries in Cape Town, this study problematizes the mobile phone success story espoused by M4D enthusiasts and advocates for a reimagining and retelling of the mobiles for development story that fully considers the negative and neutral aspects of technology for development projects.","",""
"2012","Mobile Interface Theory: Location-Aware Mobile Devices in Urban Environments","James Carey famously noted how the telegraph’s separation of communication from transportation resulted in a “social nervous system in which signaling was divorced from musculature” (Carey, 2009, p. 215). Mobile devices make this statement increasingly true while pushing back on his assertion that geography has been made irrelevant. The authors of these books posit that mobile interfaces do not simply divide us from our surroundings or distance ourselves from others, but connect us to social networks and physical environments. These devices, particularly more powerful “smart phones,” help individuals to sense, communicate, and play with others. These three books explore how mobile interfaces in the urban environment offer new ways to consider public space, though they also outline the pitfalls of constantly transmitting and receiving one’s location. As multifunctional devices are adopted on a mass scale, mobile interfaces become an increasingly relevant entry point for a host of important issues having to do with mediated communication, including identity, privacy, and cooperation. This is particularly true in non-Western contexts where adoption of cellular phones has outpaced that of desktop computers.","",""
"2012","""""Mobile Communications: An Introduction to New Media"""" by Nicola Green and Leslie Haddon","With the mobile phone being a pervasive part of contemporary everyday lives and with over 5 billion users worldwide (ITU 2010), the lack of a textbook on mobile communication is surprising. Green and Haddon fill an important gap in the literature by providing a comprehensive handbook specifically addressed to students of new media. In their own words, the main goal of the volume is to challenge the taken-for-granted assumptions implicit in our daily practices of use and ‘make the familiar strange’ (p. 2). Combining different perspectives on ICTs which are generally assumed under the label of the social shaping of technology and drawing on their vast experience as researchers in the field, the authors provide an extensive review of the literature and research on mobile communication, gathering both leading scholars and the first exploratory studies made in the second half of the 1990s. One of the major strengths of this work is indeed its wide offer of case studies that complement each chapter with attention-grabbing factual material and help the reader contextualize theoretical issues in social uses of mobile phones. The handbook is also supplied with further useful resources for students: summaries at the end of each chapter; reflections, questions and exercises aimed at encouraging ‘our readers to question common assumptions about ways of doing things with mobiles’ (p. 15) and a thematic ‘annotated guide to further reading’. After outlining a brief history of the development of mobile communication technologies, the authors discuss the main social consequences of mobile communication that research has examined over time and introduce some emerging issues related to the convergence of the mobile phone with the internet and television. With a strong interest in cross-cultural diversity, Green and Haddon point to how mobile communication has led to socially negotiated re-articulations of private and public spaces, affecting our experience of space and the meanings of proximate and distant. They, then, address issues of time, showing how the domestication of mobiles entails both an incorporation of the technology within existing temporal structures and the production of new temporalities.","",""

This phenomenological study explores the characteristics and perceived effects of frequent BlackBerry usage as perceived by approximately 20 middle managers from Toronto and Vancouver, Canada. Using Moustakas' modified van Kaam Methodology, seven themes emerged. These are (1) BlackBerry's perceived effect on employee effectiveness; (2) BlackBerry's perceived impact on personal life; (3) the perceived impact of BlackBerry technology on communication quality; (4) feelings that occur when BlackBerry technology malfunctions; (5) perceived effect of convergence on employees and organizations; (6) perception and experiences of addictiveness of frequent BlackBerry use; and (7) recommendations for using the technology to maximize the organizational effectiveness. The emerging themes of the study were discussed to provide future direction for organizational managers.","",""
"2012","Internet Inquiry: Conversations about Method","time and a different, more flexible, organization of meetings that may be perceived and criticized in some countries as encouraging a ‘lack of punctuality’ (p. 85). In reviewing research on the incorporation of mobiles in the maintenance of social contact, the normative – at least in Europe – use of the mobile phone as a tool for creating a ‘full time intimate sphere’ is compared with different cultural practices that valorize the connectivity with both strong and weak ties. How this constant availability is managed in different cultural contexts is also addressed. Perpetual contact, which represents a pervasive experience and a benefit in people’s lives, is also the starting point to examine issues of power, such as those embedded in parental monitoring of their children; or the exercise of power through the mobile or struggles of status within peer networks; and the use of mobile communication as an expression of ‘hierarchical command’ (p. 125) in organizational contexts. Finally, they deal with the domestication of the camera phone which has given rise to a rich research field in its own. Though the scope was ambiguous, the authors have been successful in providing a thorough exploration of this research field.","",""
"2012","Locative journalism: Designing a location-dependent news medium for smartphones"," This article provides an account of the tensions between locative context-awareness and the act of writing journalistic copy for a mobile application. Based on the field trials of the interdisciplinary LocaNews project, the article discusses locative media’s potential for spatially sensitive news journalism.  In 2009 researchers in Norway made a medium design called LocaNews, and tested it out with pre-planned procedures for the two fundamental activities: production and reception. Of those who participated, 12 people worked as journalists, editors, technicians, and they generated 93 journalistic stories that were read and watched by 32 test-users who were interviewed. The present article deals with findings regarding the production of news content, and presents the strategies used to reinterpret the traditional news criteria of journalism to be fit for a GPS-equipped smartphone. First, the article discusses the connection between journalism and cartography, and then introduces the experimental method used for this research. The bulk of the article consists of an evaluation of the experimental attempt at practising location-dependent journalism. It deals with four issues: putting stories on the map, the characteristics of ‘zoom in stories’, the construction of an implied position for the readers, and finally the formulation of news criteria that focus on spatial proximity instead of temporal actuality.

"2012","The comfort of mobile media"," This debate article notes that there is currently a tendency to focus, understandably, upon what it is that mobile media do, that is to say their functionality. This piece argues that we need to open up our analysis to understand these devices as objects with which individuals may develop an attachment. The piece draws upon literature that uncovers the attachments that people create with everyday objects and suggests that mobile media devices, as prominent everyday devices that are intimately incorporated into routine bodily practices, need also to be thought of in these terms. Here it is argued that it is important that we don’t just think of these devices as portals onto virtual culture, but that we acknowledge that these objects also have a material connection with the owner. These personal attachments with everyday devices are yet to receive sustained attention, yet these connections are actually an important part of how mobile media have become such a prominent and embedded part of contemporary life. The aim of this article is to open up this additional dimension to the study of mobile media and to place it upon the collective analytical agenda for those researching new media forms. ","",""
"2012","From mannerist situationism to situated media"," A decade ago, the convergence of GPS with mobile telephony first allowed media artists to map the city’s psychogeography. With such technology having now become widespread, the artistic novelty of this approach has somewhat diminished. While the field of ‘locative media’ has been and continues to be productive of both work and of critique, this essay questions some of its conceptual commitments and critical interpretations. As the technological assemblages upon which locative media are based are themselves constantly shifting, the essay considers adapting conceptual approaches accordingly. To this end, an argument is put forth for expanding the concept of locative media, built upon Bruno Latour’s recent engagement with new media and design practices which he characterizes in terms of the act of assembling rather than debunking. Drawing further on actor-network theory, an alternative interpretation of the metaphor of cognitive mapping is developed in which a core concept of locativity, that of proximity, is redefined in terms of tracing the connections of networked objects, this as opposed to the often repeated association of locative media with Situationist psychogeography. An assembly of practices are examined which trace logistics and give voice to multiple nonhuman ontologies. ","",""
"2012","Locative media: From specialized preoccupation to mainstream fascination","In 2010, Google generated global controversy when their Google Street View cars recorded data sourced from unsecured WiFi networks. While, in February of the same year, mobile social networking service Foursquare became embroiled in its own controversy when it was revealed that much of the traffic on their site was appearing on Please Rob Me.com, a website which streams updates from various location-based networks that shows when users check-in to a geographical location that is not their home. These controversies are of note not just for the salutary lessons they offer about the risks associated with digital data retention, privacy and security. At a more general level, they are noteworthy in that they testify to the dramatically increased public awareness of, and mainstream (especially press) exposure granted to, location-based media services. Such services are now well established and booming commercially, with consumers accustomed to using sat nav devices in their cars, Google maps on desktop and laptop computers and mobile devices, geoweb and geotagging and other mapping applications, and various apps on iPhones and smartphones that use location technologies. Not only do location-based services ‘comprise the fastest growing sector in web technology businesses’ (Gordon and de Souza e Silva, 2011: 9), questions of location and locationawareness are increasingly central to our contemporary engagements with the internet and mobile media. Indeed, as Gordon and de Souza e Silva (2011: 19) suggest, ‘unlocated information will cease to be the norm’ and location will become a ‘near universal search string for the world’s data’ (2011: 20); or, as McCullough (2006: 26) puts it, information ‘is now coming to you . . . wherever you are’ and ‘is increasingly about where you are’. In this special issue, ‘locative media’ is the term that is used to capture this diverse array of location aware technologies and practices. The term ‘locative media’ (that is, media of communication that are functionally bound to a location) is preferred for the precise reason that it is economical and expansive but also precise. That is to say, it captures a lot in two words while also retaining a sense of the term’s very particular history, which is anchored within the field of new media arts. For instance, various sources trace the origin of the term ‘locative media’ back to Karlis Kalnins, who is said to have first proposed it during the Art þ Communication Festival in Riga,","",""
"2012","The sound of locative media"," This article develops an alternative perspective to the visual bias in locative media discourses by focusing on the role of sound in locative media and related discussions. This sonic perspective allows us to understand the temporal, situated and embodied aspects of locative media. Informed by debates from sound studies and mobile media studies, a locative smart phone application where users experience specific sounds depending on their locations, is discussed. The concept of ‘Placed Sounds’ is introduced for a more detailed analysis of locative sound experiences. A framework for analysis is developed to discuss how locative sound engages with the auditory aspects of our spatial perception, how immersion operates for locative media and sound, and also to consider the role of situated experience, the role of walking as remixing, and how agency and exclusion operate in locative sound. This framework explains how walking operates in terms of interacting with locative media, and how we experience being immersed in physical and media contexts at once via sound. ","",""
"2012","Directions for future cellular mobile network architecture","Despite the extraordinary success of the cellular mobile telecommunications industry, many of the underlying design strategies and service assumptions that have served us arguably well over the past four decades may benefit from a fresh new look. Even today’s LTE (Long–Term Evolution), which is designed to meet the demands of modern broadband Internet packet connectivity, nonetheless draws heavily on the legacy of cellular’s circuit–oriented origins. Its heavy reliance on fine–grained tunnels and hard–state signaling protocols, for example, imposes performance penalties and cost burdens that may not be inevitable if hard–earned lessons are incorporated in the coming years. In this paper we describe a fresh approach to cellular network architecture. Inspired by past and present ideas and experiences by others and ours, we propose fundamental principles to guide the development of efficient and flexible network architecture, able to serve the still unknown needs and preferences of future users. We offer an example of a network built on those principles and suggest how we can manage the evolution from today’s networks to an architecture better suited to the decades ahead.","",""

Nokia’s early investment and marketing of multimedia messaging service (MMS) is juxtaposed to actual trends in user adoption and cultural appropriation, which in turn encouraged the company to deploy narrative practices based on perceived user needs and later focus on popular internet-based services, such as online image sharing. The goal of this study is to highlight the complex contested ground onto which new media technologies ‘emerge,’ while offering a partial, yet multilayered, snapshot of the first few years of a still relatively new, but already pervasive, personal media tool.

We find that texting is hugely popular among teens compared to other age groups. Further, the number of persons with whom people text is quite small. About half of all text messages go to only five other persons. Finally, we find that there is pronounced homophily in terms of age and gender in texting relationships. These findings support previous claims that texting is an important element of teen culture and is an element in the construction of a bounded solidarity. ","",""

Revisiting the theories of performativity, the author shows how, by defining the concept more broadly, we are able to understand the performative effects of such occurrences, which imply artefactual mediations. This ‘techno-pragmatic’ approach is applied to the case of telephone rings. The article highlights a ‘crisis of the summons’ with regard to telephone rings, stemming from the tension between the demand for accessibility and connectivity, on the one hand, and individuals’ concern to protect themselves, on the other.

"2012","Texting, techspeak, and tweens: The relationship between text messaging and English grammar skills"," The perpetual use of mobile devices by adolescents has fueled a culture of text messaging, with abbreviations and grammatical shortcuts, thus raising the following question in the minds of parents and teachers: Does increased use of text messaging engender greater reliance on such ‘textual adaptations’ to the point of altering one’s sense of written grammar? A survey ( N = 228) was conducted to test the association between text message usage of sixth, seventh and eighth grade students and their scores on an offline, age-appropriate grammar assessment test. Results show broad support for a general negative relationship between the use of techspeak in text messages and scores on a grammar assessment, with implications for Social Cognitive Theory and Low-Road/High-Road Theory of Transfer of Learning. These results indicate that adolescents may learn through observation in communication technologies, and that these learned adaptations may be transferred to standard English through Low-Road transfer of learning. Further mediation analyses suggest that not all forms of textual adaptation are related to grammar assessment score in the same way. ‘Word adaptations’ were found to be negatively related to grammar scores, while ‘structural adaptations’ were found to be non-significant.

"2012","Calling and texting (too much): Mobile maintenance expectations, (over)dependence, entrapment, and friendship satisfaction"," This article uses dialectical theory to examine how mobile phone use in close friendships affects relational expectations, the experiences of dependence, overdependence, and entrapment, and how those experiences affect relational satisfaction. Results suggest that increased mobile phone use for the purpose of relational maintenance has contradictory consequences for close friendships. Using mobile phones in close relationships increased expectations of relationship maintenance through mobile phones. Increased mobile maintenance expectations positively predicted dependence, which increased satisfaction, and positively predicted overdependence, which decreased satisfaction. Additionally, entrapment, the guilt and pressure to respond to mobile phone contact, uniquely predicted dissatisfaction. The results are interpreted in relation to the interdependent dialectical tensions of friendship, media entrapment, and the logic of perpetual contact. ","",""

With the transformation of mobile media from a communication tool into a multimodal device accompanied by global positioning systems (GPS), the significance of location-based services (LBS) has taken centre stage. Google maps, Facebook places and Foursquare are but a few of the locative media, a phenomenon creating new forms of co-presence that disrupt old binaries between online and off-line. In this transformation, a paradoxical relationship between identity, personalization and place occurs. On one hand, we see new ways for engaging with people, place and co-presence. On the other hand, we see the potential for corporations to create new levels of surveillance – a type of ‘überveillence’ – that put into question individual’s sense of privacy and identity. If ‘social networking sites don’t publicize community, they privatize it’ as Andrejevic notes, then second-generation locative media further challenge these distinctions. In this paradoxical struggle, we see that locative media highlight the pivotal role place has played in the evolution of mobile media practices. In each location, various factors such as sociocultural and technonational inform the types of media practices. One location experiencing a covert paradoxical struggle with locative media is South Korea. As one of the centres for technological innovation and tech-savvy youth, Seoul provides a fascinating case study for the tensions around localized notions of identity, privacy and sociality as it plays out through locative media.

"2013","Foursquare and the parochialization of public space","The mobile social network Foursquare has gained popularity in the last few years among both users and businesses. This article explores how the use of Foursquare changes and impacts people’s sense of place. Drawing on the work of Lofland (1998) on the social production of space, we argue that as new socio–spatial information (i.e., who checks in where) is introduced via the mobile social network, it can change the way people experience a place. Based on qualitative in–depth interviews with active Foursquare users, we explore person–to–person and person–to–place connections and argue that Foursquare promotes parochialization of public space.","",""
"2013","‘You’re virtually there’: Mobile communication practices, locational information sharing and place attachment","Mobility is a fact of contemporary everyday life. Especially, in big metropolises everyday life revolves around a continuous movement, which serve the need of catching up with the fast pace of metropolitan life. Such mobilities can alter our perception of space and time, leading us to think of distances as shrinking and places becoming closer. This leads to material, social and cultural reconfigurations (Bærenholdt and Granås, 2008) and reinforces the question of distance and proximity in maintaining social and familial relationships. Today, face–to–face social interactions are supplemented with what Urry (2007) calls imagined presence. This imagined presence, or “the transport to a virtual place” is ‘affected through the images of places and peoples appearing on, and moving across, multiple print and visual media’.. This paper discusses what happens to imagined presence when those images are mobile, geo–tagged and shared within a network. Do mobile and locative media practices enhance our sense of place by triggering a “nostalgic ode to home” and displacing us from the co–present situation? Or, do they foster bonding with places by creating a sense of belonging and by enabling us to carry our existing social relationships wherever we go? In order to answer these questions in this article, the relationships among social production of space, mobility, imagined presence and sense of place (place attachment) are analysed drawing on the findings of two studies conducted in 2011 and 2012, in London.","",""
"2013","Mobile voice communication and loneliness: Cell phone use and the social skills deficit hypothesis"," This study developed a research model of mobile voice communication on the basis of the social skills deficit hypothesis. In the model, poor social skills were related to less face-to-face and mobile voice communication, which was linked to greater loneliness. Structural equation modeling analyses of survey responses from 374 adults supported the social skills deficit hypothesis in that poor social skills were related to less involvement in face-to-face communication and greater loneliness. Also, as expected, more face-to-face interactions were associated with lower levels of loneliness; however, more cell phone calling was associated with greater loneliness. Additional regression analyses revealed that the positive relationship between mobile voice communication and loneliness was more pronounced for those who have more friends than those who have fewer friends.

This case study collected a corpus of 370 text messages exchanged via cell phone between a high-school pair at a US residential school. Also included were survey responses from 35 high-school students and interviews with the texting pair and several teachers, all of which enhanced the understanding of how deaf adolescents at this school used texting for communication. The corpus was analyzed, along with the surveyed general characteristics of texting. The pair’s messages indicated that the deaf adolescents adopted various characteristics of textism used by the English-speaking hearing adolescents studied by other researchers. However, the corpus also showed incidents of characteristics unique to the deaf teens’ texting, such as structural transfer from sign language. ","",""

"2013","Smartphones, mobile social space, and new sociality in Korea"," As mobile phones evolve into smartphones equipped with mobile operating systems, the modes of mobile communication are changing. When smartphones incorporate the Internet into their multimedia functions, they enable people to access various mobile social communication spaces in which existing forms of mobile communication, such as calls and text messages, coexist with forms of Internet communication such as instant messengers, emails, and social networking sites (SNSs) on the move. This study attempts to focus on the newly emerging mobile communication practices that have resulted from smartphones allowing people to access their SNSs anytime and anywhere. To understand how the mobility and immediate accessibility of smartphones have affected the communication practices of SNS, the study will pay particular attention to the use of Twitter via smartphones. This study will explore this through 49 Korean Twitter users’ everyday practices of communication and social interaction via their smartphones. Based on qualitative interview data, this study discusses how mobile social media forms a pseudo-aural space for volatile but self-expediential social networks and how it shapes a new sociality. It suggests that this sociality strays from existing social practices and has a new cultural significance. ","",""

Thus one will be able to have new views of the local environment (mobile visual services). In terms of the former, the sense of sight is increasingly being brought to bear on the nexus of physical environment and digital information, yielding literally novel and unprecedented views. This article assesses examples of these services and the way they inter-mix previously separate domains, but also create new layers of monitoring of self and others. In particular, it notes conflicts at the levels of public policy and individual privacy and autonomy. ","",""
"2013","What’s mobile in mobile communication?"," Interrogating the terminology of “mobile” communication, this article notes that media and communicative practices have been mobile for millennia. What’s mobile about cell phones and other current mobile media is a new range of contexts in which personally meaningful and socially consequential interactions become possible. Mobile media should be studied, above all, as resources of social action across physical space. Mobile media, further, provide the wider field of research with an opportunity to revisit the great divide between technologically mediated and embodied communication. Technologically mediated communication remains grounded in human bodies residing in local places. Humans can be understood as a first degree of media whose communicative and performative reach has been extended in time and space by historically shifting technologies. ","",""
"2013","Where are you? Location talk in mobile phone conversations"," Conversational studies have shown that location cannot be considered as an external framework that shapes interaction; rather it is to be analyzed as a resource and an achievement in interaction (Schegloff, 1972). Building on a corpus of 93 recorded mobile phone conversations from the United States and Denmark, this article adds to current interaction research by investigating how location is produced, understood and socially accomplished via mobile phones. More specifically, we investigate how location talk operates in the opening sequences of the call. We find that location is an opening-relevant topic: speakers introduce it as the reason for the call and topicalize it following initial engagement. When referring to location, speakers predominately use two variations: inquiries (where are you), and reports of their whereabouts (I just got home). Further, speakers formulate their locations in two ways: location specific (I’m sitting on a train) or status of transit (we are on our way). In addition to open format where-are-you elicitations, location talk can take the form of a candidate (are you at Union street); candidate formulations show how speakers orient to the collaborative work of meeting up with one another and display knowledge about each other’s activities. Finally, we treat the case of reciprocal location inquiries and reports, where both caller and callee state their whereabouts, showing how location talk is sequence organized. ","",""
"2013","Merging mobile communication studies and urban research: Mobile locative media, “onscreen encounters” and the reshaping of the interaction order in public places"," This communication discusses how the use of locative media in urban public settings allows users to recognize one another’s proximity on screen. Such “on screen encounters” make simultaneously relevant the categories of passer-by and mobile user, thus creating a tension between an orientation towards civil inattention or engaging in focused, face-to-face interactions. Such a tension is characteristic of the interaction order of urban settings experienced as location- or proximity-aware “hybrid ecologies”. ","",""

Given the growing convergence between mobile, social and locative media, this requires a reassessment of mobile media and its relationship with place and intimacy. How are these convergent media platforms, contexts and practices shaping, and being shaped by, intimate cartographies of place? Drawing on a case study of location-based services, games and camera phone practices in South Korea, this paper explores the role of gendered visual cultures in the relationship between place and intimacy.

First, I problematize what constitutes the boundaries of mobile social media. Distinctions between location-based mobile social networks and non-location-based mobile social networks are established to suggest that the mobility of social media is in fact much broader than location alone. Second, several key theoretical questions are identified for future exploration, including micro, meso, and macro-level theories. Lastly, methodological challenges and opportunities are reflected upon and culminate in the call for multi-disciplinary programs of research to fully understand the role of mobile social media in the world today.

"2013","On mobile communication and youth “deviance”: Beyond moral, media and mobile panics"," Cautionary voices have pointed to the apparent dangers that mobile media and communication pose for young people in the form of “deviant” activities such as sexting and mobile phone-facilitated bullying and criminal activity. Such incidents have ignited moral panics about the proliferation of mobile media because they are seen to facilitate emergent social/spatial interactions that are either unprecedented, or occurring on a scale not hitherto witnessed. While labelling concerns about youth deviance that is, in some measure, enabled or facilitated by mobile communications as “moral panics” is unproductive, it would be equally myopic to disregard the risks that mobile media can pose for youths in certain circumstances. This article critically examines the panic discourse surrounding youths and mobile media before reviewing research that suggests how mobile media can present risks for youths in particular contexts and milieus.

The data, provided by Cellcom Israel, the country’s largest mobile operator, enabled an analysis of real behavior patterns rather than relying on memories of people who may have been under stress or traumatized during the hostilities, hence unable to accurately recollect this information later on. During both wars, significant changes were noted in the way people used their mobile phones: There was a substantial decrease of calls originating from within a 10-kilometer region along the Israel-Lebanon border and mobile users also made significantly longer calls. However, the decrease in calls during the Lebanon War was more than double that of the decrease in the comparable region along the Gaza border. There was no significant change in the calling patterns of Israelis living outside the directly affected regions. These supposed differences in reaction to a crisis situation (which are congruent with previous mobile phone usage studies following suicide bombings) are analyzed, and questions regarding the validity of the myth of solidarity and bonding among Israelis are raised.

"2013","Welcome to <i>Mobile Media &amp; Communication</i>","There is a long and healthy debate about the “new” in “new media,” and ever more scholars in the social sciences and humanities are entering the debate. Whichever side one takes in that debate, there is evidence of new forms of interaction and connection by way of modern media. Teenagers renegotiate relations to their parents by real time sharing and withholding of information on their location, their activities and their emotional states. Cultural goods such as literature and music acquire new and different meanings and affective investments when no longer collected and used in a material form but streamed to devices at hand. New potentials for health provision, social welfare and trade arise in regions where people have their first contact with hospitals, government agencies and banks through the screens of their mobile phones instead of computers or human agents. We cannot yet systematically define precisely what these observations have in common. But they all touch the phenomenon of mobility in communication. We believe that the time has come for a joint effort to explain this still unfolding phenomenon. This is what Mobile Media & Communication is about.","",""

This field has been establishing itself through a number of other initiatives as well, including conferences, symposiums, edited books, listservs, and centers for research. Despite this momentum, little attention has been given to defining – and justifying – the field itself. This essay begins by questioning whether there really is, or should be, a distinct field of study for research and theory on mobile media and communication. I then proceed to address this question by highlighting themes in the literature that illustrate how mobile communication is distinct from other forms of mediated communication and information exchange, with correspondingly distinctive social consequences. The essay argues that there are indeed justifiable reasons for treating mobile communication studies as a field. However, like the technology itself, this field is – or at least should be – highly integrated with research and theory of media and communication more broadly. ","",""

Results show that the diversity of mobile phone use and the frequency of relational mobile communication are positively associated with mobile donation. As importantly, mobile donation helps to overcome age, race and SES gaps, giving members of disadvantaged social groups a more accessible tool for civic engagement. Internet donation and mobile donation complement rather than compete with each other. ","",""
"2013","Mobile communication and intermediality"," The article argues the importance of intermediality as a concept for research in mobile communication and media. The constant availability of several, partially overlapping channels for communication (texting, calls, email, Facebook, etc.) requires that we adopt an integrated view of the various communicative affordances of mobile devices in order to understand how people choose between them for different purposes. It is argued that mobile communication makes intermediality especially central, as the choice of medium is detached from the location of stationary media and begins to follow the user across all contexts of daily life.

The world’s first cellular network was created in 1977, but the mobile phone has made history as one of the fastest diffusing communication technologies, reaching nearly six billion subscribers by 2011. The time is right to define mobile media in an effort to better understand mobile communication technologies and their broad implications for the fundamental meanings of media, communication, community, social institutions, and especially society. In this article, I argue that the advent of mobile telephony as a wireless telecommunication system and portable platform for human communication has seemingly transformed the classical definition of mass communication. In fact, mobile media-supported communication, such as mobile news and mobile tweets, has accelerated what communication scholars have described as “the end of mass communication.” The article ends with a call for a holistic view of mobile communication research.

Based on 31 individual semistructured interviews with Danish high school students and a grounded theory approach, it finds that instrumental use of information on smartphones has become an integrated and relied on part of everyday lives of these young Danes. Near-ubiquitous access to information is found to have consequences at both individual and social levels. Individually, users are able to look up information irrespective of the time and place and respond and adapt to this information in a rapid and flexible manner: a process the article refers to as “flexible alignment.” Further, near-ubiquitous access to information may lead to a more flexible orientation among users, who come to depend on just-in-time (rather than ahead-of-time) access to information in dealing with the contingencies of everyday life. Socially, the article finds that users may become increasingly autonomous vis-à-vis the network of social contacts, as mobile access to information is no longer exclusively available through mediated person-to-person communication but can be accessed individually as well.

Since the removal of GPS signal degradation in 2000, artists and researchers have been exploring how location-awareness influences mobility, spatiality, and sociability. Besides exploring the historical antecedents of today’s location-based services, this article focuses on the main social issues that emerge when location-aware technologies leave the strict domain of art and research and become part of everyday life: locational privacy, sociability, and spatiality.

"2013","Your smart phones are hot pockets to us: Context collapse in a mobilized age"," A key guarantor of social trust and a necessary feature of democratic societies is a stable sense of social distance. Social distance is the cultural imaginary within which an individual’s coordinates of social status and contingent social location allow or inhibit contact with similarly and dissimilarly located others. The rearrangement of customary social distances by new communication technologies is a source of considerable social anxiety. In mobile communication, this context collapse is instigated by a distinctive combination of affordances: deep connectivity, the accelerated speed and volume of communicative exchange, enhanced social legibility and asymmetric communicative transparency. Robust and effective levels of social trust depend on a political will to build strong democratic accountability and civil rights guarantees into emerging mobile architectures. Identifying specific recalibrations of familiar social distances by regimes of mobile communication and assessing the effects of these recalibrations in democratic terms is a central task of mobile research.

Through a survey of 400 mobile users in Korea, our study verified the validity of the proposed model. In addition, this model enables us to examine mobile divide in two different approaches – at the level of each component and in the relations among the components. Mobile divides by gender, age, SES, and social capital existed at the level of various components. Age and SES even showed significant mobile divides in the relations between mobile uses and consequence-related components.

Previous research has shown that our temporal and spatial movement is highly predictable and that the majority of calls and text messages are sent to only four to six different persons. This article extends this research by examining both tie strength and the distance between the interlocutors in urban and rural settings. The findings show that even as information and communication technologies (ICTs) potentially put the world at our fingertips, the mobile phone is an instrument of a more limited geographical and social sphere. Approximately two-thirds of our calls/texts go to strong ties that are within a 25-km radius.","",""

The relationship between these various times and scales of mobility shape mobile communities as a daily reality for many Africans. African family histories and personal lives are full of connecting with those who have left. In recent years, these daily practices have been radically altered by improvements in communication technology – with travel, radio messages and letter writing being replaced by mobile telephony as the main connecting technology. This article explores how the development of connecting technology has changed the social dynamics of African mobile communities and focuses on the changes in (old and new) social hierarchies that are related to possibilities of accessing mobility and connecting technologies.

"2014","The social meanings of mobile phones among South Africa’s ‘digital natives’: a case study"," The past decade has seen the mobile phone evolve and acquire additional meanings in Africa and elsewhere. From being the relatively expensive yuppie toy of the 1990s to becoming the basic necessity available on the market both as new and used today; from the voice-and-text only functions of yesteryear to the compact multimedia ‘package’ that usurps the roles of earlier technologies like the TV, radio and PC, the mobile phone has been key to the (re)shaping of society, just as its appropriation has been dialectically shaped by society. And yet most of the writing about new media in Africa focuses on the economic and technological aspects of use and access, the digital divide, and the potential of new media to help the development process and expand e-commerce, among others. All these aspects are important, but there is also scope for new research to explore the social character of the mobile device among different African communities. This article focuses on the social place of the mobile phone among a section of South African youth, namely University of Cape Town students. It employs a combination of online survey and qualitative interviews with selected undergraduate students. The article notes that the mobile phone has arguably become a key pivot around which youth culture is organised, while at the same time being appropriated and shaped creatively by the youth to address their varying interests. The study notes that although the mobile phone has not replaced traditional norms of socialisation as such, its presence has structured, and continues to structure youth’s social and academic lives.

Yet SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) registration schemes are threatening to throttle the technology’s developmental potential. These mandates, which require the registration of identity information to activate a mobile SIM card, are fast becoming universal in Africa, with little to no public debate about the wider social or political effects. Whereas some authors have explored the motivations behind these drives, as well as their potential economic impacts, this paper focuses its critique on the broader diversity of implications of this regulatory transformation. Viewing SIM registration through a lens that combines surveillance studies and information &amp; communication technologies for development, it examines elements of resistance across a range of actors, as well as other emerging effects like access barriers, linkages to financialization, and Africa’s budding mobile surveillance society.","",""
"2014","Governing risks and benefits: Mobile communication technologies in British universities","Mobile communication technologies (MCTs) pose new opportunities and challenges to university governance. Not only are the devices widespread, they have particular capabilities and constantly changing uses which makes any governing of them difficult. Furthermore most devices are individually owned. Thus universities are unable to directly control how they are used but do have a duty of care towards those learning and teaching within their spaces. This article outlines preliminary findings on how some British universities are responding to these challenges by seeking to capitalise on potential pedagogic benefits while limiting privacy risks posed by new patterns of usage. It found that these universities converge in their recognition that students are using or want to use MCTs to capture content in teaching spaces. However they diverge in how they respond, in particular, on what uses are restricted and how competing rights, for instance, disability versus privacy, are negotiated.","",""

The study has shown that as a developing country, Botswana has done well to develop and structurally position the mobile telephony sector for the benefit of its citizens. This is evidenced by the high rate of subscription of mobile telephony countrywide and continuous attempts by the government to network under-served communities. However, the sector has been left in the hands of a quasi-governmental corporation and private individual businessmen. In addition, there is serious competition for subscribers amongst network operators, uneven diffusion of network technologies and inadequate communication signal in some remote areas.

Facebook’s approach has been cautious but deliberate. However, following the strategic acquisitions of location-sharing start-ups Gowalla and Glancee, Facebook has ramped up its location-based services: they launched their Nearby feature in December 2012, and adjusted their application programming interface (API) in early 2013 to enable ‘seamless’ location-sharing across third-party applications. These, and more recent acquisitions, are part of ambitious, longer-term moves that reposition Facebook as a local recommendation service (taking on Foursquare and Yelp), and, significantly, establish Facebook as a key local, and increasingly mobile-centred, advertising portal (taking on Google).

"2014","Inside the mobile world and outside the Internet","Forty years ago, when Martin Cooper made the first ever mobile phone call, nobody could have envisaged that it would become a handy tool that would one day change not only the ways of communication but also several facets of our lives. (It was not quite handy then as it looked like a brick with a protruding antenna.) The mobile world now surrounds us in numerous ways, transforming the mobile device with its ever-evolving capabilities and with a power that ultimately reconstructs human lives in unimaginable ways. From its beginnings as a simple connecting instrument devoid of the tentacles of wires fixed to sockets, the mobile phone has acquired features converging computing and Internet technologies. In short, the mobile phone has lost its raison d’etre as a phone. It has turned out to be an instrument that has immense potential. It is being used not only as a web browser, games machine or an HD camera, but also as a blood pressure monitor and a compass. With over half a million apps available for this device, the mobile phone has ceased to be simply a phone. This is but one of its thousands of uses. The current debate centers on why the mobile phone has changed from being primarily a mobile technology to a sedentary technology (Fortunati, 2002). Now called a “smartphone,” with the prefix commonly used to denote some advanced capabilities, it is a programmable device that first appeared on the market in 1999 and has become well-nigh ubiquitous since 2003. If the current trend is any indication, it will be expanded further and faster, offering new possibilities for human interaction, leisure, entertainment and knowledge. The device continues to mutate in remarkable ways through the imagination of people like Steve Jobs. 509063 NMS16110.1177/1461444813509063new media & societyReview essay research-article2014","",""
"2014","Making sense of innovations: A comparison of personal computers and mobile phones"," Despite revolutionary expectations about information and communication technologies (ICT), the academic understanding of what exactly these technologies bring to individual lives remains incomplete. We know very little about how individuals perceive the value of ICT products, and even less about the process by which these value perspectives are built. This paper contributes to addressing these gaps. It presents an empirical study comparing the perceived use-value of personal computers and mobile phones. The findings show that the day-to-day value of innovations is deeply embedded in the existing and newly emerging social contexts. Thus, societal transformations, such as becoming an information society, cannot be reduced to matters of technological possibilities. The paper also builds a construct for the sense-making process that clarifies that compared to mobile phones, computers are more difficult to position in mind, purchase and use, require more support from social contacts and are only meaningful in selective contexts.

"2014","A socio-economic exploration of mobile phone service have-nots in Sweden"," Most studies in the mobile communication field focus on the acceptance of the technology rather than the resistance of it, a trend that makes researchers try to understand only the powerful actors in society. Instead, this paper explores the socio-economic characteristics of mobile phone service have-nots. Based on an analysis of samples from three consecutive nationwide annual surveys in Sweden, this study finds that two socio-economic factors – age and the household income – remain significant to explain non-usage of mobile phone services. Other variables dynamically change over time without a significant effect. This finding supports the argument that most socio-economic factors are transient at different stages of the adoption of innovation. Since the benefits of mobile phones are related to social networks (the more people you know, the more beneficial), it is not surprising that, in the long run, elderly people with low income, who typically have a decreasing social network, find this technology no longer purposeful and finally refuse it. This indicates that the status of the have-nots may not reflect socio-economic inequalities in general, but rather individuals’ preference when managing their social situation. This is relevant with the argument that a universal service policy should be based on connectivity, that is, people’s need for communication rather than solely promoting subsidizing a particular technology or service. The policy, therefore, should consider the technological frame sharing – the interpretation of the technology shared by members of a relevant social group, that is, users, service providers and regulators, to bring a more socially constructed technology that can protect individuals with less socio-economic power from being socially excluded.

"2014","Locating the Visual"," Smartphones are increasingly becoming an all-pervasive and embedded part of everyday life. In this phenomenon, the rise of high-quality camera phones and growth in distribution services via social media has heralded new forms of visuality. With geotagging almost a default setting, these new visualities are marked by a different relationship between information, co-presence, and place. In particular, these new visualities are shaping, and shaped by, gender. One key location that has become famous for its high deployment of camera phone practices, especially self-portraiture ( sel-ca) by women, is Seoul, South Korea. However, as camera phone practices increasingly intertwine with locative media, we see a shift in the motivations, genres, and affects. In this article, I explore some preliminary studies conducted into women’s use of camera phones and how, with the overlay of locative media like geotagging, this is shifting the role of camera phone images in depicting place and intimacy.

This article discusses findings from a recent promenade initiative, commissioned for a UK arts festival, along with a review of literature, to critically engage with growing evidence of the diverse ways in which technology is integrated at direct user level. Concepts of ‘hybrid spaces’ and ‘user agency’ are discussed, along with the ‘performativity’ of spaces. Central to the discussion is the function of narrative in engaging the participant to construct new perspectives, which are facilitated by the mediating role of personal media devices between subject, narrative, space and community.","",""

"2014","New visualities and the digital wayfarer: Reconceptualizing camera phone photography and locative media"," In this article, we examine how second-generation locative media and emerging contemporary camera phone practices are becoming entangled to create new visualities and socialities of place and place making. With location-based services (LBS) smartphone apps like Instagram geotagging is increasingly the default, rather than choice. This has transformed both how we experience and conceptualize co-present relationships across micro and macro realms and how we chart these relationships and environments as we move through the everyday world. Through a preliminary study of 10 users of smartphones in urban Australia we explore their daily routines and how camera phone and LBS practices become part of those everyday repetitions. In 2013, Australia mobile Internet subscriptions have now reached 22.1 million: basically one subscription for every person in the country. To understand these new everyday visualities we develop the notion of the “digital wayfarer” as a way to think about the perpetually moving mobile media user. Expanding upon Tim Ingold’s notion of the wayfaring type of mobility that is both routine and repetitive (i.e., “transport”) in the realm of the digital interwoven within the everyday, we reflect upon the digital wayfarer as they move through taking and sharing pictures and their tagged geographic and temporal contexts as part of broader emplaced and interwoven visualities and socialities.

Interviews with low-income, urban U.S. residents reveal that cell phones are an asset for psychological reassurance, crime prevention, and critical access to emergency help. At the same time findings reveal that these residents often have broken and disconnected cell phones that require constant upkeep, or technology maintenance. Reliance on second-hand, government, and no-contract phones ease cell phone ownership but also normalize intermittent disconnection leading to dependably instability. These findings demonstrate the extreme value of cell phone access for residents of poor neighborhoods, and at the same time indicate that disparities in cell phone access still persist and may be worsening.

Further, the findings of this study show that TBC journalists use mobile phones to interact and involve the audiences in the processes of producing programmes. Consequently, TBC communication has become less hierarchical, more two-way, horizontal, and interactive. Moreover, the study reveals that the audiences use phone-in programmes on TBC as a platform to air the voices and concerns of the grass-roots population.

While such observations are compelling, they lack a conceptual context. This paper theorizes the smartphone in the general terms of mediatization. Emphasis is on existing and emerging technologies of the mediatization process and the consequent “intercorporeal” relationships users construct with the smartphone. Empirical findings about the often intensely personal usage of the smartphone document this phenomenology. The paper concludes by introducing three provocative implications of new media like the smartphone, which are both indicators and motors of mediatization, as focuses for future study: technogenesis, or the coevolution of people and their information machines; embodied and extended cognition, the intensifying interweaving of mind and thinking machines; and the subjectifying process of individualization, ever more dependent on digital self-creation and self-maintenance.

"2014","A tethered generation: Exploring the role of mobile phones in the daily life of young people"," The increasing global ubiquity of mobile phones has called into question their efficacy as dynamic tools for engagement and participation in daily life. While there is little argument in their growth as primary communication tools, scholars have actively debated their role as conduits for dynamic and diverse, information flow. This study explores how an international cohort of university students uses mobile phones for daily communication and information needs. In spring 2012, 793 students from 8 universities on 3 continents participated in a 24-hour mobile tracking exercise and reflection to answer the questions: How are college students using mobile phones for daily communication and information needs? and, how do college students perceive of the role of mobile phones for communication and information needs in their daily lives? The findings point to a population tethered to their mobile devices primarily through social networking apps, to the extent that they find it increasingly difficult to distinguish relationships that exist in their pockets from those that exist in their physical surroundings. While the participants acknowledged the diverse and participatory capacity of mobile devices, their dependence on the phone for connecting to peers left them skeptical of the phone’s efficacy for productive connectivity, vibrant communication, and diverse information consumption in daily life. The study concludes with suggestions for more inclusive and active engagement in the dynamic potential of phones that are not necessitated by a response to large-scale political or civil injustices.

"2015","Curating Everyday Life: Approaches to Documenting Everyday Soundscapes","In the last decade, the cell phone’s transformation from a tool for mobile telephony into a multi-modal, computational “smart” media device has engendered a new kind of emplacement, and the ubiquity of technological mediation into the everyday settings of urban life. With it, a new kind of media literacy has become necessary for participation in the networked social publics (Ito; Jenkins et al.). Increasingly, the way we experience our physical environments, make sense of immediate events, and form impressions is through the lens of the camera and through the ear of the microphone, framed by the mediating possibilities of smartphones. Adopting these practices as a kind of new media “grammar” (Burn 29)—a multi-modal language for public and interpersonal communication—offers new perspectives for thinking about the way in which mobile computing technologies allow us to explore our environments and produce new types of cultural knowledge.    Living in the Social Multiverse  Many of us are concerned about new cultural practices that communication technologies bring about. In her now classic TED talk “Connected but alone?” Sherry Turkle talks about the world of instant communication as having the illusion of control through which we micromanage our immersion in mobile media and split virtual-physical presence. According to Turkle, what we fear is, on the one hand, being caught unprepared in a spontaneous event and, on the other hand, missing out or not documenting or recording events—a phenomenon that Abha Dawesar calls living in the “digital now.” There is, at the same time, a growing number of ways in which mobile computing devices connect us to new dimensions of everyday life and everyday experience: geo-locative services and augmented reality, convergent media and instantaneous participation in the social web. These technological capabilities arguably shift the nature of presence and set the stage for mobile users to communicate the flow of their everyday life through digital storytelling and media production.     According to a Digital Insights survey on social media trends (Bennett), more than 500 million tweets are sent per day and 5 Vines tweeted every second; 100 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute; more than 20 billion photos have been shared on Instagram to date; and close to 7 million people actively produce and publish content using social blogging platforms. There are more than 1 billion smartphones in the US alone, and most social media platforms are primarily accessed using mobile devices.  The question is: how do we understand the enormity of these statistics as a coherent new media phenomenon and as a predominant form of media production and cultural participation? More importantly, how do mobile technologies re-mediate the way we see, hear, and perceive our surrounding evironment as part of the cultural circuit of capturing, sharing, and communicating with and through media artefacts? Such questions have furnished communication theory even before McLuhan’s famous tagline “the medium is the message”. Much of the discourse around communication technology and the senses has been marked by distinctions between “orality” and “literacy” understood as forms of collective consciousness engendered by technological shifts. Leveraging Jonathan Sterne’s critique of this “audio-visual litany”, an exploration of convergent multi-modal technologies allows us to focus instead on practices and techniques of use, considered as both perceptual and cultural constructs that reflect and inform social life. Here in particular, a focus on sound—or aurality—can help provide a fresh new entry point into studying technology and culture.  The phenomenon of everyday photography is already well conceptualised as a cultural expression and a practice connected with identity construction and interpersonal communication (Pink, Visual). Much more rarely do we study the act of capturing information using mobile media devices as a multi-sensory practice that entails perceptual techniques as well as aesthetic considerations, and as something that in turn informs our unmediated sensory experience.    Daisuke and Ito argue that—in contrast to hobbyist high-quality photographers—users of camera phones redefine the materiality of urban surroundings as “picture-worthy” (or not) and elevate the “mundane into a photographic object.” Indeed, whereas traditionally recordings and photographs hold institutional legitimacy as reliable archival references, the proliferation of portable smart technologies has transformed user-generated content into the gold standard for authentically representing the everyday. Given that visual approaches to studying these phenomena are well underway, this project takes a sound studies perspective, focusing on mediated aural practices in order to explore the way people make sense of their everyday acoustic environments using mobile media. Curation, in this sense, is a metaphor for everyday media production, illuminated by the practice of listening with mobile technology.  Everyday Listening with Technology: A Case Study  The present conceptualisation of curation emerged out of a participant-driven qualitative case study focused on using mobile media to make sense of urban everyday life. The study comprised 10 participants using iPod Touches (a device equivalent to an iPhone, without the phone part) to produce daily “aural postcards” of their everyday soundscapes and sonic experiences, over the course of two to four weeks. This work was further informed by, and updates, sonic ethnography approaches nascent in the World Soundscape Project, and the field of soundscape studies more broadly.  Participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire about their media and technology use, in order to establish their participation in new media culture and correlate that to the documentary styles used in their aural postcards. With regard to capturing sonic material, participants were given open-ended instructions as to content and location, and encouraged to use the full capabilities of the device—that is, to record audio, video, and images, and to use any applications on the device. Specifically, I drew their attention to a recording app (Recorder) and a decibel measurement app (dB), which combines a photo with a static readout of ambient sound levels.  One way most participants described the experience of capturing sound in a collection of recordings for a period of time was as making a “digital scrapbook” or a “media diary.” Even though they had recorded individual (often unrelated) soundscapes, almost everyone felt that the final product came together as a stand-alone collection—a kind of gallery of personalised everyday experiences that participants, if anything, wished to further organise, annotate, and flesh out.   Examples of aural postcard formats used by participants: decibel photographs of everyday environments and a comparison audio recording of rain on a car roof with and without wipers (in the middle).  Working with 139 aural postcards comprising more than 250 audio files and 150 photos and videos, the first step in the analysis was to articulate approaches to media documentation in terms of format, modality, and duration as deliberate choices in conversation with dominant media forms that participants regularly consume and are familiar with. Ambient sonic recordings (audio-only) comprised a large chunk of the data, and within this category there were two approaches: the sonic highlight, a short vignette of a given soundscape with minimal or no introduction or voice-over; and the process recording, featuring the entire duration of an unfolding soundscape or event. Live commentaries, similar to the conventions set forth by radio documentaries, represented voice-over entries at the location of the sound event, sometimes stationary and often in motion as the event unfolded. Voice memos described verbal reflections, pre- or post- sound event, with no discernable ambience—that is, participants intended them to serve as reflective devices rather than as part of the event. Finally, a number of participants also used the sound level meter app, which allowed them to generate visual records of the sonic levels of a given environment or location in the form of sound level photographs.  Recording as a Way of Listening  In their community soundwalking practice, Förnstrom and Taylor refer to recording sound in everyday settings as taking world experience, mediating it through one’s body and one’s memories and translating it into approximate experience. The media artefacts generated by participants as part of this study constitute precisely such ‘approximations’ of everyday life accessed through aural experience and mediated by the technological capabilities of the iPod. Thinking of aural postcards along this technological axis, the act of documenting everyday soundscapes involves participants acting as media producers, ‘framing’ urban everyday life through a mobile documentary rubric. In the process of curating these documentaries, they have to make decisions about the significance and stylistic framing of each entry and the message they wish to communicate.   In order to bring the scope of these curatorial decisions into dialogue with established media forms, in this work’s analysis I combine Bill Nichols’s classification of documentary modes in cinema with Karin Bijsterveld’s concept of soundscape ‘staging’ to characterise the various approaches participants took to the multi-modal curation of their everyday (sonic) experience.  In her recent book on the staging of urban soundscapes in both creative and documentary/archival media, Bijsterveld describes the representation of sound as particular ‘dramatisations’ that construct different kinds of meanings about urban space and engender different kinds of listening positions. Nichols’s articulation of cinematic documentary modes helps detail ways in which the author’s intentionality is reflected in the styling, design, and presentation of filmic narratives. Michel Chion’s discussion of cinematic listening modes further contextualises the cultural construction of listening that is a central part of both design and experience of media artefacts. The conceptual lens is especially relevant to understanding mobile curation of mediated sonic experience as a kind of mobile digital storytelling. Working across all postcards, settings, and formats, the following four themes capture some of the dominant stylistic dimensions of mobile media documentation.  The exploratory approach describes a methodology for representing everyday life as a flow, predominantly through ambient recordings of unfolding processes that participants referred to in the final discussion as a ‘turn it on and forget it’ approach to recording. As a stylistic method, the exploratory approach aligns most closely with Nichols’s poetic and observational documentary modes, combining a ‘window to the world’ aesthetic with minimal narration, striving to convey the ‘inner truth’ of phenomenal experience.  In terms of listening modes reflected in this approach, exploratory aural postcards most strongly engage causal listening, to use Chion’s framework of cinematic listening modes. By and large, the exploratory approach describes incidental documentaries of routine events: soundscapes that are featured as a result of greater attentiveness and investment in the sonic aspects of everyday life. The entries created using this approach reflect a process of discovering (seeing and hearing) the ordinary as extra-ordinary; re-experiencing sometimes mundane and routine places and activities with a fresh perspective; and actively exploring hidden characteristics, nuances of meaning, and significance. For instance, in the following example, one participant explores a new neighborhood while on a work errand:The narrative approach to creating aural postcards stages sound as a springboard for recollecting memories and storytelling through reflecting on associations with other soundscapes, environments, and interactions. Rather than highlighting place, routine, or sound itself, this methodology constructs sound as a window into the identity and inner life of the recordist, mobilising most strongly a semantic listening mode through association and narrative around sound’s meaning in context (Chion 28). This approach combines a subjective narrative development with a participatory aesthetic that draws the listener into the unfolding story. This approach is also performative, in that it stages sound as a deeply subjective experience and approaches the narrative from a personally significant perspective. Most often this type of sound staging was curated using voice memo narratives about a particular sonic experience in conjunction with an ambient sonic highlight, or as a live commentary. Recollections typically emerged from incidental encounters, or in the midst of other observations about sound. In the following example a participant reminisces about the sound of wind, which, interestingly, she did not record:  Today I have been listening to the wind. It’s really rainy and windy outside today and it was reminding me how much I like the sound of wind. And you know when I was growing up on the wide prairies, we sure had a lot of wind and sometimes I kind of miss the sound of it… (Participant 1)   The aesthetic approach describes instances where the creation of aural postcards was motivated by a reduced listening position (Chion 29)—driven primarily by the qualities and features of the soundscape itself. This curatorial practice for staging mediated aural experience combines a largely subjective approach to documenting with an absence of traditional narrative development and an affective and evocative aesthetic. Where the exploratory documentary approach seeks to represent place, routine, environment, and context through sonic characteristics, the aesthetic approach features sound first and foremost, aiming to represent and comment on sound qualities and characteristics in a more ‘authentic’ manner. The media formats most often used in conjunction with this approach were the incidental ambient sonic highlight and the live commentary. In the following example we have the sound of coffee being made as an important domestic ritual where important auditory qualities are foregrounded:     That’s the sound of a stovetop percolator which I’ve been using for many years and I pretty much know exactly how long it takes to make a pot of coffee by the sound that it makes. As soon as it starts gurgling I know I have about a minute before it burns. It’s like the coffee calls and I come. (Participant 6)  The analytical approach characterises entries that stage mediated aural experience as a way of systematically and inductively investigating everyday phenomena. It is a conceptual and analytical experimental methodology employed to move towards confirming or disproving a ‘hypothesis’ or forming a theory about sonic relations developed in the course of the study. As such, this approach most strongly aligns with Chion’s semantic listening mode, with the addition of the interactive element of analytical inquiry. In this context, sound is treated as a variable to be measured, compared, researched, and theorised about in an explicit attempt to form conclusions about social relationships, personal significance, place, or function. This analytical methodology combines an explicit and critical focus to the process of documenting itself (whether it be measuring decibels or systematically attending to sonic qualities) with a distinctive analytical synthesis that presents as ‘formal discovery’ or even ‘truth.’  In using this approach, participants most often mobilised the format of short sonic highlights and follow-up voice memos. While these aural postcards typically contained sound level photographs (decibel measurement values), in some cases the inquiry and subsequent conclusions were made inductively through sustained observation of a series of soundscapes. The following example is by a participant who exclusively recorded and compared various domestic spaces in terms of sound levels, comparing and contrasting them using voice memos. This is a sound level photograph of his home computer system:    So I decided to record sitting next to my computer today just because my computer is loud, so I wanted to see exactly how loud it really was. But I kept the door closed just to be sort of fair, see how quiet it could possibly get. I think it peaked at 75 decibels, and that’s like, I looked up a decibel scale, and apparently a lawn mower is like 90 decibels. (Participant 2)   Mediated Curation as a New Media Cultural Practice?  One aspect of adopting the metaphor of ‘curation’ towards everyday media production is that it shifts the critical discourse on aesthetic expression from the realm of specialised expertise to general practice (“Everyone’s a photographer”). The act of curation is filtered through the aesthetic and technological capabilities of the smartphone, a device that has become co-constitutive of our routine sensorial encounters with the world. Revisiting McLuhan-inspired discourses on communication technologies stages the iPhone not as a device that itself shifts consciousness but as an agent in a media ecology co-constructed by the forces of use and design—a “crystallization of cultural practices” (Sterne). As such, mobile technology is continuously re-crystalised as design ‘constraints’ meet both normative and transgressive user approaches to interacting with everyday life.  The concept of ‘social curation’ already exists in commercial discourse for social web marketing (O’Connell; Allton). High-traffic, wide-integration web services such as Digg and Pinterest, as well as older portals such as Reddit, all work on the principles of arranging user-generated, web-aggregated, and re-purposed content around custom themes. From a business perspective, the notion of ‘social curation’ captures, unsurprisingly, only the surface level of consumer behaviour rather than the kinds of values and meaning that this process holds for people. In the more traditional sense, art curation involves aesthetic, pragmatic, epistemological, and communication choices about the subject of (re)presentation, including considerations such as manner of display, intended audience, and affective and phenomenal impact. In his 2012 book tracing the discourse and culture of curating, Paul O’Neill proposes that over the last few decades the role of the curator has shifted from one of arts administrator to important agent in the production of cultural experiences, an influential cultural figure in her own right, independent of artistic content (88).  Such discursive shifts in the formulation of ‘curatorship’ can easily be transposed from a specialised to a generalised context of cultural production, in which everyone with the technological means to capture, share, and frame the material and sensory content of everyday life is a curator of sorts. Each of us is an agent with a unique aesthetic and epistemological perspective, regardless of the content we curate. The entire communicative exchange is necessarily located within a nexus of new media practices as an activity that simultaneously frames a cultural construction of sensory experience and serves as a cultural production of the self.     To return to the question of listening and a sound studies perspective into mediated cultural practices, technology has not single-handedly changed the way we listen and attend to everyday experience, but it has certainly influenced the range and manner in which we make sense of the sensory ‘everyday’. Unlike acoustic listening, mobile digital technologies prompt us to frame sonic experience in a multi-modal and multi-medial fashion—through the microphone, through the camera, and through the interactive, analytical capabilities of the device itself. Each decision for sensory capture as a curatorial act is both epistemological and aesthetic; it implies value of personal significance and an intention to communicate meaning. The occurrences that are captured constitute impressions, highlights, significant moments, emotions, reflections, experiments, and creative efforts—very different knowledge artefacts from those produced through textual means. Framing phenomenal experience—in this case, listening—in this way is, I argue, a core characteristic of a more general type of new media literacy and sensibility: that of multi-modal documenting of sensory materialities, or the curation of everyday life.

"2015","Communicative Affordances of Mobile Media: Portability, Availability, Locatability, and Multimediality","Mobile technologies such as smartphones and tablets have been rapidly adopted worldwide. Mobile media are now the primary online connection for most individuals. Despite this rapid rise, theories of how mobile media relate to communication patterns and outcomes remain scarce. An affordances approach promises a high-level framework for researching how technologies such as mobile media are integrated into routines, affecting subsequent patterns of communication. In this article, I first consider the theoretical lineage of affordances and how this perspective demonstrates advantages from related theories. Second, I draw on affordances to define “communicative affordances,” a perspective that takes communication as a central concern. Finally, I synthesize literature from mobile communication to formulate a typology of communicative affordances of mobile media: portability, availability, locatability, and multimediality. Suggestions are then made for research employing a communicative affordances framework.","",""
"2015","The Use of Mobile Phones Among Trishaw Operators in Myanmar","This article examines use of mobile phones by trishaw (rickshaw) operators in the newly emerging techno-landscape of Myanmar. Trishaw operators transport people and goods in a physically demanding job that often earns them as little as US$2 per day. Spanning the period before and after the widespread commercialization of mobile phones in the country, this research draws from interviews with trishaw operators in several locations. With commercialization, the price of a mobile subscription fell from over US$1,500 to US$1.50, making it affordable to groups that heretofore have not had access. We find that the trishaw sector is changing because of this. The mobile phone strengthens ties with important clients, meaning a more stable income, but also an enhanced importance/power for these customers. Operators who have not adopted mobile phones, usually because of poverty, age, or a lack of interest, will likely have fewer business opportunities.","",""

We use a range of qualitative methods, including interviews, sound walks, sound maps, and photography, to explore how teenagers use mobile media to respond to the visual and sonic landscape of a public space in Dublin, Ireland. This space was a “nonplace” for our contemporary participants from which they felt economically, socially, visually, and aurally excluded. They responded by using mobile media to create safe, centripetal, and meaningful spaces. Our findings underline the role that local soundscapes play in understanding the audio and mobile media practices of teenagers in public spaces.","",""
"2015","Is mobile phone use associated with spatial dimensions? A comparative study on mobile phone use in five European countries","The aim of this paper is to investigate if, and how, mobile phone use is associated with space. In particular, we considered three spatial dimensions, such as the size of the place of residence, the macro-region and the country. We drew the data from a telephone survey designed by us and sponsored by Telecom Italia. The survey was administered in 2009 and conducted on representative samples of the populations of five European countries (Italy, France, Spain, UK and Germany) (N = 7255). Several interesting results emerged. One of these is that there seems to be no longer an association between the volume of use of the mobile phone and the urban environment, but only with the sophistication of its use. On the contrary, the fixed telephone is more intensively used by urbanites. The macro-region assumes a new strength regarding the use of the mobile phone: some macro-regions reoriented themselves towards the mobile phone or the landline phone (like the south of Spain), while others are developing both, such as the south of Italy. The variable ‘culture’ confirms its strong role: Italy is the strongest user of the mobile phone, while the UK and Spain make the most advanced use of it. As to the fixed telephone, Italy shows the least intense use of it, while France the most intense.","",""

"2015","Sometimes I think it is hell to be a girl: a longitudinal study of the rise of confessional radio"," Despite wide recognition in media studies, the significance of technology is often understated or overlooked in radio and sound studies. This article addresses this absence in a longitudinal study of uses by radio listeners and radio hosts of an ‘automatic telephone tape recorder’ (ATTR) in a Danish youth radio segment. The study shows that the two groups developed a range of uses for the ATTR from 1973 to 1996 and that especially confessional use, despite its paradoxical synthesis of public and private, emerged as the significant feature of the segment. An analysis of changes in users’ perception of technology over time is performed within a phenomenological media studies framework and the emerging field of postphenomenology, particularly through the concepts of ‘multistability’ and ‘dailiness’. I formulate a sociomaterial perspective on radio as the ‘intimate medium’ whose formation is negotiated through time in a multistable process between technology, listeners and radio hosts. ","",""

This article analyses the everyday communicative practices of adults living in Sydney surrounding their use of text messaging in shared social spaces. Asking the research participants when, how and why they rely on text messaging exposes increasingly routine transgressions of boundaries between different social spheres. While participants were acutely aware of largely unspoken social norms and expectations attached to mobile phone use in the presence of others, they themselves strategically used text messages to create layers of intimacy within shared social spaces. We explore the implications of this tension by highlighting how rituals of social interaction are cared about by social actors but play into a wider sense of the abandonment of care for the presence of others.

Through our analysis, we show the potential for new mobile sound practices that allow for the more participatory production of public soundscapes. ","",""
"2015","Smartphone resistance as media ambivalence","In this paper, we develop the notion of media ambivalence to account for such seemingly unrelated practices as content filtering, screen-time limitation and social media rejection. We propose that as compared to resistances to dedicated communication technologies with an on/off button, resistances in a neoliberal age of ubiquitous, convergent media are temporary and local. Analyzing interviews with smartphone resisters, we discuss their critique of smartphone culture; their investment in their feature phones and their pride and unease over using them; and their sense that their resistance cannot last. Interpreting smartphone resistance as a form of media ambivalence, we suggest that in terms of scope, contemporary resistance is aimed at a single medium, platform or practice that is singled out of the convergence; that its meaning develops over time along with technological and cultural changes; and that it acquires personal, social and political significance from related uses and resistances.","",""

Utilising Heidegger’s notions of mood and attunement to the world, the paper argues that the towards-which of the user, that is the mood of the user in a phenomenological sense, is critical to their experience of using location-based social media and the revealing of place that emerges from that usage. A contrast between a technological and a poetic or computational revealing of place can then be established based on the phenomenological orientation of user to device, application and world. The emphasis on orientation and attunement has implications for application design and research on user experience. ","",""

We offer a novel perspective, through an examination of the user–device relationship, on how the latent use of smartphones enhances the actual use of value-added mobile services. We grounded our framework in both the domestication and Apparatgeist theories as well as the findings from three focus groups. We tested the framework using self-reported data from 414 smartphone users. The findings demonstrate that the symbolic use of smartphones results in increased attachment to smartphones that in turn has a positive effect on deriving experiential value of using value-added mobile services. Symbolic use also has a positive relationship with value-expressiveness resulting from the use of such services. Both value-expressiveness and experiential value have a strong, positive relationship with overall user satisfaction that leads to an increase in the actual use of such services. ","",""

While some theorists celebrate possibilities for autonomy, others are concerned that the increased reliance on mobile-based communication leads to disparities in digital skill and status replication. We examined how mobile-mediated behavior among teens interacted with the characteristics of socio-demographics and mobile access to predict (1) levels of diverse use and skill and (2) consequences of skill/use differences ( n = 552). Findings revealed that skill/use disparities were manifested based on race, and such variations were associated with status of parents in interaction with mobile phone ownership. Instrumental use and content/creation-based skill had significant impacts on public involvement among teens. Our data have implications for understanding how social backgrounds incubate mobile-based disparities in light of enabling teens’ life chances. ","",""

Eighty-six Australian and 150 Canadian undergraduates were asked to rate the appropriateness of textism use in various situations. Students distinguished between the appropriateness of using textisms in different writing modalities and to different recipients, rating textism use as inappropriate in formal exams and assignments, but appropriate in text messages, online chat and emails with friends and siblings. In a second study, we checked the examination papers of a separate sample of 153 Australian undergraduates for the presence of textisms. Only a negligible number were found. We conclude that, overall, university students recognise the different requirements of different recipients and modalities when considering textism use and that students are able to avoid textism use in exams despite media reports to the contrary.

Adopting an affordance-based approach, this study examines how different uses of the mobile phone are related to individuals’ subjective well-being and social capital. Findings from a national survey showed that both voice and online communication with the mobile phone is positively related to various indicators of subjective well-being and bonding and bridging capital. Moreover, both bonding and bridging capital mediated the relationship between mobile phone use and subjective well-being. On the other hand, non-communicative uses, such as information seeking activities, were negatively related to positive affect and passing time activities were positively related to negative affect. Implications of the findings are discussed. ","",""

As such, the study of social media in the mobile era must look beyond the interface. Studies in this field must go beyond what takes place on the screens of devices to contextualize those interactions with what is happening around those devices. Moving beyond the interface, the study of social mobile media must then take into account the various infrastructures that make these practices possible (including fiber optic cables that run along the paths laid by railroad tracks, the mobile switching centers run by mobile providers that route data, the Internet data centers and peering points, and the servers that connect people and data). As social media scholarship turns toward the various levels of invisibility and visibility of the infrastructures required for mobile social media to work, it becomes clear that practices of social media are one node among a massive network of materiality.

The study was designed as a spatial-technological experiment and focused on eliciting and representing experiences embedded in everyday life practices, generated by people's daily movement through the city. The paper highlights the importance of first ‘provoking’ an enhanced awareness of one's everyday environments before such experiences can come to the surface and be expressed. Moreover, inspired by the open source movement, it illustrates possibilities for expanding the role of ordinary city inhabitants from data-generators to co-producers of knowledge for, and about, the city, through the use of locative technology. In doing so, the paper advances knowledge regarding the use of Global Position Systems technology in citizen-sensing initiatives.","",""
"2015","On the liveness of mobile phone mediation: Youth expectations of remittances and narratives of discontent in the Cameroonian transnational family"," Drawn from multisited fieldwork conducted among Cameroonians in Germany and Cameroon, the article reveals that the liveness of mobile phone communication influences expectations and narratives of remittances in Cameroonian transnational social relationships. These expectations are meaningful within a cultural context where economic resources are expected to flow from migrants to nonmigrants. As this case demonstrates, the general belief in nonmigrants’ entitlement to the achievements of those who migrate regardless of their status abroad, also means migrant students are involved in remittances practices. The students are expected to remit and at the same time, they are conscious of their obligation to support people who stay back in the home country. As such, the mobile phone ideally provides an infrastructure through which monetary resources could be coordinated and channeled to Cameroon. While exploring this possibility of remittances transfer, I argue that instant communication contradictorily generates and fuels conflicts mainly as a result of unmet expectations of deploying the phone to directly request money from abroad.

Similar to Wallis’s (2011) conclusions, I found that access to and use of a mobile phone does not automatically imbue taxi drivers with power and autonomy from forces that seem to be working against them. However, access to mobile phones does help to shake up the hierarchy of control in the taxi industry. This study has also identified another type of community where the theory of polymedia (Madianou &amp; Miller, 2012) applies, that is, labor communities, and has shown that while choice of technology may offer some sense of power, access to mobile communication technology does not necessarily result in significant changes in power structures within and surrounding a community.

"2015","Tasking the everyday: Where mobile and online communication take time"," In the contemporary urban environment, the conditions for communication are in abundance, having shifted and extended to include multiple overlapping possibilities for interaction through mobile devices, personal computers, and online platforms such that traditional domains of activity have been subsumed within a relational domain of communication activity. This involves not only an extension of interaction across spaces of activity but also the remapping of how interpersonal communication practices are woven into the temporality and embodied practices of everyday life. The conditions for networked communication partially emerge through a consistent set of embodied background communication practices. These include practices of the individual maintaining contact with technological objects in their environment and also the habitual rhythms of interface-level practices, which together contribute to the forms of networked connection.  Stemming from qualitative fieldwork with 35 participants during 2010 and 2011, this paper explores the organization and experience of networked interpersonal communication practices within the temporalities of everyday life. The individual’s perceived need for networked connection is proposed as the prerequisite for, but also a condition of, participation in contemporary everyday life. This paper explores the emerging role of networked time: where the constant and multiple embodied rhythms of individual engagement with overlapping media technologies, as objects and interfaces within the material environment, are interwoven with the capacity of those media to partially constitute one’s relationship to, and management of, time in everyday life. The tension between the finite minutes of the individual’s day and the limitless potential of networked connection is explored through the individual’s interface-level practices to avoid being temporally overwhelmed by potential interactions. In this manner, communication is perceived and managed as distinct, quantifiable, but variable units of time in and of themselves: interaction as “tasks” to be addressed and completed through engagement.

"2015","News consumption in an age of mobile media: Patterns, people, place, and participation","Having a mobile device continuously within an arm’s reach has changed everyday life. A retrospective glance shows that the mobile phone has enjoyed a broad diffusion around the globe during the 1990s and 2000s. This development has made possible mobile communication at any time and any place. Functioning as a tool for interpersonal communication—via voice calls and texting—it has become a taken-for-granted part of everyday life (Ling, 2012). Until recently the diffusion of mobile phones was twice as high as the diffusion of Internet access, but with mobile phones having become equipped with Internet functionality this gap is losing its relevance. Feature phones have increasingly been displaced by more and more smart mobile devices equipped with advanced hardware and software that facilitate not only communication but also the production and consumption of media. These personal and portable mobile devices provide ubiquitous connectedness through computer-like functionalities. Facilitated by developments of computing and hardware, they offer a touchscreen interface to a mobile ecosystem loaded with customized applications and responsive sites. Alongside these we also find that tablets have gained significance, offering largely similar affordances (although typically not traditional voice calls), but with slightly larger screen sizes. Situated betwixt smartphones and tablets one finds phablets offering affordances from each category that thus blurs the boundaries further. All of these mobile devices offer instant and personalized access to search engines, social networking sites, games, news, etcetera. Ultimately there has been a tremendous shift from mobile handsets designed primarily for communication toward more versatile media and communication functionalities.

Though public safety campaigns intended to curb dangerous texting behaviors have been implemented, relatively little is known about the psychological processes involved in these behaviors. Our study integrates emerging research on automatic behavior, self-control, and mindfulness in an attempt to explain why many individuals believe that such behavior is dangerous but engage in it anyway. Our survey study ( N = 925) of college students ( n = 313) and adults ( n = 612) revealed that texting automaticity, trait self-control, and the “acting with awareness” facet of trait mindfulness were all uniquely predictive of texting while driving as well as texting while walking. Further, we observe that texting automaticity is more strongly related to the frequency of texting while walking than driving. Together, the findings synthesize disparate strands of research on cognition and media use and demonstrate the importance of distinguishing among types of consciousness to understanding mobile communication behavior.

An online questionnaire assessed especially cell phone usage patterns (e.g., frequency of cell phone usage), personality traits (e.g., Big Five, need for popularity), and contextual factors (e.g., awaiting a call, being in a noisy environment). Analyses ( N = 249; 137 female) revealed that the majority of participants (83.5%) have experienced phantom phone sensations. Multivariate analysis methods indicated that, in particular, contextual factors regarding the social situation (awaiting a call) along with cell phone usage patterns are predictive for the experience of phantom phone sensations.

We sometimes consciously create our everyday life narratives intending to hang onto a moment, or simply because the technology automatically saves our experiences, we unconsciously preserve our pasts. Mobile media can contribute to the existing ways of narrating places and the self because locational information can communicate multiple and different aspects of places. Situating our analysis within the broader literature on memory and media, we draw on three different studies conducted in the UK and the US in order to analyze different uses of mobile media in remembering associations with places, past experiences, and creating a nostalgic sense of place. More specifically we draw on notions of memory work and mediated memories to explore the mutual shaping of media, place, and memory. ","",""

From the viewpoint of media organizations, UDC is a process by which the mass media converge with online social networks through the intentional use of social media and other platforms and services in an effort to expand the distribution of media content. In order to focus specifically on mobile news consumption, this paper sheds light on the novel phenomenon of mobile user-distributed content (mobile UDC). Mobile UDC is manifested in mobile users’ ability to share online media content on a perpetual and ubiquitous basis. The study utilizes the results from a survey carried out with Finnish Internet users. The main finding is that mobile Internet users are more active in UDC than those who do not use the Internet with mobile devices. It is thus argued that mobile UDC, as a developing concept, can be used to explain the practices that are characteristic of mobile online news consumption. ","",""
"2016","Navigating Movie (M)apps: Film Locations, Tourism and Digital Mapping Tools","The digital revolution has been characterized by the overlapping of different media technologies and platforms which reshaped both traditional forms of audiovisual consumption and older conceptions of place and space. John Agnew claims that, traditionally, the notion of place has been associated with two different meanings: ‘the first is a geometric conception of place as a mere part of space and the second is a phenomenological understanding of a place as a distinctive coming together in space’ (317). Both of the dominant meanings have been challenged by the idea that the world itself is increasingly “placeless” as space-spanning connections and flows of information, things, and people undermine the rootedness of a wide range of processes anywhere in particular (Friedman). On the one hand, by obliterating physical distance, new technologies such as the Internet and the cell phone are making places obsolete, on the other hand, the proliferation of media representations favoured by these technologies are making places more relevant than ever. These increasing mediatisation processes, in fact, generate what Urry and Larsen call ‘imaginative geographies’, namely the conflation of representational spaces and physical spaces that substitute and enhance each other in contingent ways (116).  The smartphone as a new hybrid media platform that combines different technological features such as digital screens, complex software applications, cameras, tools for online communication and GPS devices, has played a crucial role in the construction of new notions of place.  This article examines a specific type of phone applications: mobile, digital mapping tools that allow users to identify film-locations. In doing so it will assess how new media platforms can potentially reconfigure notions of both media consumption, and (physical and imagined) mobility. Furthermore, the analysis of digital movie maps and their mediation of film locations will shed light on the way in which contemporary leisure activities reshape the cultural, social and geographic meaning of place. Digital, Mobile Movie MapsDigital movie maps can be defined as software applications, conceived for smart phones or other mobile devices, which enable users to identify the geographical position of film locations. These applications rely on geotagging which is the process of adding geospatial metadata (usually latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates) to texts or images. From this point of view these phone apps belong to a broader category of media that Tristan Thielmann calls geomedia: converging applications of interactive, digital, mapping tools and mobile and networked media technologies. According to Hjorth, recent studies on mobile media practices show a trend toward “re-enacting the importance of place and home as both a geo-imaginary and socio-cultural precept” (Hjorth 371). In 2008 Google announced that Google Maps and Google Earth will become the basic platform for any information search. Similarly, in 2010 Flickr started georeferencing their complete image stock (Thielmann 8). Based on these current developments media scholars such as Thielmann claim that geomedia will emerge in the future as one of the most pervasive forms of digital technology (8).In my research I identified 44 phone geomedia apps that offered content variously related to film locations. In every case the main functionality of the apps consisted in matching geographic data concerning the locations with visual and written information about the corresponding film production. ‘Scene Seekers’, the first app able to match the title of a film with the GPS map of its locations, was released in 2009. Gradually, subsequent film-location apps incorporated a number of other functions including:Trivia and background information about films and locationsSubmission forms which allow users to share information about their favourite film locatiosLocation photosLinks to film downloadFilm-themed itinerariesAudio guidesOnline discussion groupsCamera/video function which allow users to take photos of the locations and share them on social mediaFilm stills and film clipsAfter identifying the movie map apps, I focused on the examination of the secondary functions they offered and categorized the applications based on both their main purpose and their main target users (as explicitly described in the app store). Four different categories of smart phone applications emerged. Apps conceived for:Business (for location scouts and producers)Entertainment (for trivia and quiz buffs)Education (for students and film history lovers)Travel (for tourists)‘Screen New South Wales Film Location Scout’, an app designed for location scouts requiring location contact information across the state of New South Wales, is an example of the first category. The app provides lists, maps and images of locations used in films shot in the region as well as contact details for local government offices. Most of these types of apps are available for free download and are commissioned by local authorities in the hope of attracting major film productions, which in turn might bring social and economic benefits to the region.A small number of the apps examined target movie fans and quiz buffs. ‘James Bond and Friends’, for example, focuses on real life locations where spy/thriller movies have been shot in London. Interactive maps and photos of the locations show their geographical position.  The app also offers a wealth of trivia on spy/thriller movies and tests users’ knowledge of James Bond films with quizzes about the locations. While some of these apps provide information on how to reach particular film locations, the emphasis is on trivia and quizzes rather than travel itself.Some of the apps are explicitly conceived for educational purposes and target film students, film scholars and users interested in the history of film more broadly. The Italian Ministry for Cultural Affairs, for example, developed a number of smartphone apps designed to promote knowledge about Italian Cinema. Each application focuses on one Italian city, and was designed for users wishing to acquire more information about the movie industry in that urban area. The ‘Cinema Roma’ app, for example, contains a selection of geo-referenced film sets from a number of famous films shot in Rome. The film spots are presented via a rich collection of historical images and texts from the Italian National Photographic Archive.Finally, the majority of the apps analysed (around 60%) explicitly targets tourists. One of the most popular film-tourist applications is the ‘British Film Locations’ app with over 100,000 downloads since its launch in 2011. ‘British Film Locations’ was commissioned by VisitBritain, the British tourism agency. Visit Britain has attempted to capitalize on tourists’ enthusiasm around film blockbusters since the early 2000s as their research indicated that 40% of potential visitors would be very likely to visit the place they had seen in films or on TV (VisitBritain). British Film Locations enables users to discover and photograph the most iconic British film locations in cinematic history. Film tourists can search by film title, each film is accompanied by a detailed synopsis and list of locations so users can plan an entire British film tour. The app also allows users to take photos of the location and automatically share them on social networks such as Facebook or Twitter.Movie Maps and Film-TourismAs already mentioned, the majority of the film-location phone apps are designed for travel purposes and include functionalities that cater for the needs of the so called ‘post-tourists’. Maxine Feifer employed this term to describe the new type of tourist arising out of the shift from mass to post-Fordist consumption. The post-tourist crosses physical and virtual boundaries and shifts between experiences of everyday life, either through the actual or the simulated mobility allowed by the omnipresence of signs and electronic images in the contemporary age (Leotta). According to Campbell the post-tourist constructs his or her own tourist experience and destination, combining these into a package of overlapping and disjunctive elements: the imagined (dreams and screen cultures), the real (actual travels and guides) and the virtual (myths and internet) (203). More recently a number of scholars (Guttentag, Huang et al., Neuhofer et al.) have engaged with the application and implications of virtual reality on the planning, management and marketing of post-tourist experiences. Film-induced tourism is an expression of post-tourism. Since the mid-1990s a growing number of scholars (Riley and Van Doren, Tooke and Baker, Hudson and Ritchie, Leotta) have engaged with the study of this phenomenon, which Sue Beeton defined as “visitation to sites where movies and TV programmes have been filmed as well as to tours to production studios, including film-related theme parks” (11). Tourists’ fascination with film sets and locations is a perfect example of Baudrillard’s theory of hyperreality. Such places are simulacra which embody the blurred boundaries between reality and representation in a world in which unmediated access to reality is impossible (Baudrillard).Some scholars have focused on the role of mediated discourse in preparing both the site and the traveller for the process of tourist consumption (Friedberg, Crouch et al.). In particular, John Urry highlights the interdependence between tourism and the media with the concept of the ‘tourist gaze’. Urry argues that the gaze dominates tourism, which is primarily concerned with the commodification of images and visual consumption. According to Urry, movies and television play a crucial role in shaping the tourist gaze as the tourist compares what is gazed at with the familiar image of the object of the gaze. The tourist tries to reproduce his or her own expectations, which have been “constructed and sustained through a variety of non-tourist practices, such as film, TV, literature, records, and videos” (Urry 3). The inclusion of the camera functionality in digital movie maps such as ‘British Film Locations’ fulfils the need to actually reproduce the film images that the tourist has seen at home.Film and MapsThe convergence between film and (virtual) travel is also apparent in the prominent role that cartography plays in movies. Films often allude to maps in their opening sequences to situate their stories in time and space. In turn, the presence of detailed geographical descriptions of space at the narrative level often contributes to establish a stronger connection between film and viewers (Conley). Tom Conley notes that a number of British novels and their cinematic adaptations including Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings (LOTR) and Stevenson’s Treasure Island belong to the so called ‘cartographic fiction’ genre. In these stories, maps are deployed to undo the narrative thread and inspire alternative itineraries to the extent of legitimising an interactive relation between text and reader or viewer (Conley 225).The popularity of LOTR locations as film-tourist destinations within New Zealand may be, in part, explained by the prominence of maps as both aesthetic and narrative devices (Leotta). The authenticity of the LOTR geography (both the novel and the film trilogy) is reinforced, in fact, by the reoccurring presence of the map. Tolkien designed very detailed maps of Middle Earth that were usually published in the first pages of the books. These maps play a crucial role in the immersion into the imaginary geography of Middle Earth, which represents one of the most important pleasures of reading LOTR (Simmons). The map also features extensively in the cinematic versions of both LOTR and The Hobbit. The Fellowship of the Ring opens with several shots of a map of Middle Earth, anticipating the narrative of displacement that characterizes LOTR. Throughout the trilogy the physical dimensions of the protagonists’ journey are emphasized by the foregrounding of the landscape as a map.The prominence of maps and geographical exploration as a narrative trope in ‘cartographic fiction’ such as LOTR may be responsible for activating the ‘tourist imagination’ of film viewers (Crouch et al.). The ‘tourist imagination’ is a construct that explains the sense of global mobility engendered by the daily consumption of the media, as well as actual travel. As Crouch, Jackson and Thompson put it, “the activity of tourism itself makes sense only as an imaginative process which involves a certain comprehension of the world and enthuses a distinctive emotional engagement with it” (Crouch et al. 1).The use of movie maps, the quest for film locations in real life may reproduce some of the cognitive and emotional pleasures that were activated while watching the movie, particularly if maps, travel and geographic exploration are prominent narrative elements. Several scholars (Couldry, Hills, Beeton) consider film-induced tourism as a contemporary form of pilgrimage and movie maps are becoming an inextricable part of this media ritual. Hudson and Ritchie note that maps produced by local stakeholders to promote the locations of films such as Sideways and LOTR proved to be extremely popular among tourists (391-392). In their study about the impact of paper movie maps on tourist behaviour in the UK, O’Connor and Pratt found that movie maps are an essential component in the marketing mix of a film location. For example, the map of Pride and Prejudice Country developed by the Derbyshire and Lincolnshire tourist boards significantly helped converting potential visitors into tourists as almost two in five visitors stated it ‘definitely’ turned a possible visit into a certainty (O’Connor and Pratt).Media Consumption and PlaceDigital movie maps have the potential to further reconfigure traditional understandings of media consumption and place. According to Nana Verhoeff digital mapping tools encourage a performative cartographic practice in the sense that the dynamic map emerges and changes during the users’ journey. The various functionalities of digital movie maps favour the hybridization between film reception and space navigation as by clicking on the movie map the user could potentially watch a clip of the film, read about both the film and the location, produce his/her own images and comments of the location and share it with other fans online.Furthermore, digital movie maps facilitate and enhance what Nick Couldry, drawing upon Claude Levi Strauss, calls “parcelling out”: the marking out as significant of differences in ritual space (83). According to Couldry, media pilgrimages, the visitation of TV or film locations are rituals that are based from the outset on an act of comparison between the cinematic depiction of place and its physical counterpart. Digital movie maps have the potential to facilitate this comparison by immediately retrieving images of the location as portrayed in the film. Media locations are rife with the marking of differences between the media world and the real locations as according to Couldry some film tourists seek precisely these differences (83).The development of smart phone movie maps, may also contribute to redefine the notion of audiovisual consumption. According to Nanna Verhoeff, mobile screens of navigation fundamentally revise the spatial coordinates of previously dominant, fixed and distancing cinematic screens. One of the main differences between mobile digital screens and larger, cinematic screens is that rather than being surfaces of projection or transmission, they are interfaces of software applications that combine different technological properties of the hybrid screen device: a camera, an interface for online communication, a GPS device (Verhoeff). Because of these characteristics of hybridity and intimate closeness, mobile screens involve practices of mobile and haptic engagement that turn the classical screen as distanced window on the world, into an interactive, hybrid navigation device that repositions the viewer as central within the media world (Verhoeff).In their discussion of the relocation of cinema into the iPhone, Francesco Casetti and Sara Sampietro reached similar conclusions as they define the iPhone as both a visual device and an interactive interface that mobilizes the eye as well as the hand (Casetti and Sampietro 23). The iPhone constructs an ‘existential bubble’ in which the spectator can find refuge while remaining exposed to the surrounding environment. When the surrounding environment is the real life film location, the consumption or re-consumption of the film text allowed by the digital movie map is informed by multi-sensorial and cognitive stimuli that are drastically different from traditional viewing experiences.The increasing popularity of digital movie maps is a phenomenon that could be read in conjunction with the emergence of innovative locative media such as the Google glasses and other applications of Augmented Reality (A.R.). Current smart phones available in the market are already capable to support A.R. applications and it appears likely that this will become a standard feature of movie apps within the next few years (Sakr). Augmented reality refers to the use of data overlays on real-time camera view of a location which make possible to show virtual objects within their spatial context. The camera eye on the device registers physical objects on location, and transmits these images in real time on the screen. On-screen this image is combined with different layers of data: still image, text and moving image.In a film-tourism application of augmented reality tourists would be able to point their phone camera at the location. As the camera identifies the location images from the film will overlay the image of the ‘real location’. The user, therefore, will be able to simultaneously see and walk in both the real location and the virtual film set. The notion of A.R. is related to the haptic aspect of engagement which in turn brings together the doing, the seeing and the feeling (Verhoeff). In film theory the idea of the haptic has come to stand for an engaged look that involves, and is aware of, the body – primarily that of the viewer (Marx, Sobchack). The future convergence between cinematic and mobile technologies is likely to redefine both perspectives on haptic perception of cinema and theories of film spectatorship.The application of A.R. to digital, mobile maps of film-locations will, in part, fulfill the prophecies of René Barjavel. In 1944, before Bazin’s seminal essay on the myth of total cinema, French critic Barjavel, asserted in his book Le Cinema Total that the technological evolution of the cinematic apparatus will eventually result in the total enveloppement (envelopment or immersion) of the film-viewer. This enveloppement will be characterised by the multi-sensorial experience and the full interactivity of the spectator within the movie itself. More recently, Thielmann has claimed that geomedia such as movie maps constitute a first step toward the vision that one day it might be possible to establish 3-D spaces as a medial interface (Thielmann).Film-Tourism, Augmented Reality and digital movie maps will produce a complex immersive and inter-textual media system which is at odds with Walter Benjamin’s famous thesis on the loss of ‘aura’ in the age of mechanical reproduction (Benjamin), as one of the pleasures of film-tourism is precisely the interaction with the auratic place, the actual film location or movie set. According to Nick Couldry, film tourists are interested in the aura of the place and filming itself. The notion of aura is associated here with both the material history of the location and the authentic experience of it (104).Film locations, as mediated by digital movie maps, are places in which people have a complex sensorial, emotional, cognitive and imaginative involvement. The intricate process of remediation of the film-locations can be understood as a symptom of what Lash and Urry have called the ‘re-subjectification of space’ in which ‘locality’ is re-weighted with a more subjective and affective charge of place (56). According to Lash and Urry the aesthetic-expressive dimensions of the experience of place have become as important as the cognitive ones. By providing new layers of cultural meaning and alternative modes of affective engagement, digital movie maps will contribute to redefine both the notion of tourist destination and the construction of place identity. These processes can potentially be highly problematic as within this context the identity and meanings of place are shaped and controlled by the capital forces that finance and distribute the digital movie maps. Future critical investigations of digital cartography will need to address the way in which issues of power and control are deeply enmeshed within new tourist practices.  ReferencesAgnew, John, “Space and Place.” Handbook of Geographical Knowledge. Eds.

By conducting semistructured interviews with 32 young employees in China, this study showed that Chinese young workers mainly depend on their smartphones for understanding (e.g., being updated of the events in their work), orientation (e.g., performing work-related actions), and communication (e.g., contacting and interacting with colleagues) at work. Three task attributes (i.e., task interdependence, task mobility, and time criticality) and organizational norms influence the work-related smartphone dependency of Chinese young workers. Implications for theories and practices are discussed.","",""

"2016","The power reinforcement framework revisited: mobile technology and management control in home care","Whereas digital technologies are often depicted as being capable of disrupting long-standing power structures and facilitating new governance mechanisms, the power reinforcement framework suggests that information and communications technologies tend to strengthen existing power arrangements within public organizations. This article revisits the 30-year-old power reinforcement framework by means of an empirical analysis on the use of mobile technology in a large-scale programme in Danish public sector home care. It explores whether and to what extent administrative management has controlled decision-making and gained most benefits from mobile technology use, relative to the effects of the technology on the street-level workers who deliver services. Current mobile technology-in-use might be less likely to be power reinforcing because it is far more decentralized and individualized than the mainly expert-dominated and centrally controlled technologies that were the main focus of the 1970s and 1980s studies. Yet this study concludes that there is general support for the reinforcement framework in the contemporary application of mobile technology in public sector home care.","",""

The purpose of this study is to investigate the association between spatial distance and the closure and diversity of businesses mobile social networks. We used a database that aggregates actual mobile communication patterns of business users of a large Israeli cell phone company (n =  16,199). Our findings, among a large sample of businesses, provide support for the place and mobile communication perspective. The results reveal a negative association between spatial distance and mobile business communication networks. As spatial distance between business network members increases, business social ties through mobile communication decreases. Furthermore, the results also revealed a negative association between spatial distance and mobile network density. As the spatial distance between business users increases, the density of the mobile communication network diminishes. Physical proximity promotes the development of dense business networks. The implications of the findings are discussed.","",""
"2016","Mobile phone for empowerment? Global nannies in Paris"," Feminization of migration has emerged as a common livelihood strategy to alleviate poverty and escape difficult socio-economic, cultural, and familial situations. Mobile phones have become the most crucial and pervasive communication device that enables migrants to be simultaneously mobile and connected, anytime and anywhere. Is the mobile phone empowering or disempowering as a new form of social control? Based on a long-term ethnographic research on global nannies in Paris, this study presents a case for the importance of the detailed investigation of everyday contexts and power relations to better understand the complexities of mobile phone use in work life. This study will argue that, far from an instrument of empowerment, the mobile phone can work to reinforce already existing power relations and mundane social structures, leading to more unequal and enslaving relationships in work life.

"2016","Locative media and data-driven computing experiments"," Over the past two decades urban social life has undergone a rapid and pervasive geocoding, becoming mediated, augmented and anticipated by location-sensitive technologies and services that generate and utilise big, personal, locative data. The production of these data has prompted the development of exploratory data-driven computing experiments that seek to find ways to extract value and insight from them. These projects often start from the data, rather than from a question or theory, and try to imagine and identify their potential utility. In this paper, we explore the desires and mechanics of data-driven computing experiments. We demonstrate how both locative media data and computing experiments are ‘staged’ to create new values and computing techniques, which in turn are used to try and derive possible futures that are ridden with unintended consequences. We argue that using computing experiments to imagine potential urban futures produces effects that often have little to do with creating new urban practices. Instead, these experiments promote Big Data science and the prospect that data produced for one purpose can be recast for another and act as alternative mechanisms of envisioning urban futures.

"2016","‘Why would you want to know?’"," With the widespread adoption of smartphones, mobile users today have an increasing number of ways to communicate about their location; the practice of ‘checking in’, thereby broadcasting one’s location to one’s network of friends on Facebook, is one such way. Previous research has indicated that the social sharing of location information in mobile social media may be associated with significant consequences, for instance, in the areas of coordination, self-presentation, network presence and social capital. An interview study conducted with 31 ‘ordinary’ young Danish smartphone and Facebook users, however, indicates that this specific use of location sharing, despite being well-known and despite the potential of the technology indicated by previous research, has come to play a relatively minor role in their everyday lives. Drawing on the domestication approach, this article examines the meaning making associated with the use and particularly the reluctance towards use of the technology and discusses the discrepancy between the existing literature and limited use found in the present study.

The ‘site’ chosen for the study was T-Mobile, a global mobile operator that was developing Europe’s first open mobile web service. Through interviews with its employees, the analysis shows how a change took place in the self-reflections of the telecoms industry with regard to the ways it was using various historical narratives. That rhetorical adjustment tied the mobile industry to the World Wide Web and its industry but did so in complex and contested ways. The analysis of this period of development is shown to have constituted the formation phase of the contemporary complexities of the ubiquitous web and its industries. ","",""

The KakaoTalk-scape shows that smartphones and their apps are articulated with community-based local modes of communication and the rhythm of urban space. It also demonstrates that media convergence occurs not only between different media platforms but also between global and local media practices. ","",""
"2016","Soft coercion: Reciprocal expectations of availability in the use of mobile communication","This paper examines how the mobile phone has grown to be an essential item in daily life. It simultaneously represents a gadget that affords us freedom while also tying us to our closest social contacts. The mobile phone provides personal utility via a bewildering number of apps and functions. Through the socially enforced mutual expectation of availability, it ties us to our social sphere while also helping us to create and maintain social cohesion. We are pushed (or coerced) into being in contact via a mobile communication device. This paper draws on qualitative interviews and focus groups from the past two decades to trace the dimensions of this social expectation. The focus in this paper is not on the channel of mediation, i.e., voice vs. chat vs. texting vs. social networking, etc. The focus is on examining the development of the reciprocal social expectation for telephonic availability. The analysis shows how the generalized expectation of availability operates on a daily basis and becomes acutely operative in the case of emergencies such as in the immediate wake of the 22 July Oslo bombings.","",""

"2016","Cell phone disconnection disrupts access to healthcare and health resources: A technology maintenance perspective"," Over 50% of people in poverty in the United States no longer have a landline telephone, and this same population is more likely to have a no-contract cell phone plan requiring the continuous purchase of minutes. As a result, the poor may increasingly experience short-term phonelessness, which may disrupt access to healthcare and other services. To explore this we conducted 37 client interviews and 7 staff interviews at two free health clinics. Cell phone disconnection was a regular occurrence that delayed access to care and threatened client privacy. Temporary disconnection also contributed to lost employment, lost welfare benefits, and strains on social support networks—all of which are critical for optimizing health. Results are interpreted through a lens of technology maintenance, which argues that the poor will struggle to maintain digital access after ownership and public availability are realized. The potential worsening of health inequalities and related policy implications are discussed. ","",""

In an online survey, 272 smart phone users reported on their recalled responses to loss/separation from their mobile phone (not by choice), as well as their use of the mobile phone for self-expansion. Results show that self-expansion via mobile phone was associated with greater inclusion of the mobile phone in the self-concept and greater subjective well-being. Most respondents reported negative feelings, such as loneliness/disconnection, anxiety, and boredom, when without their mobile phone, but others felt relieved to be out of touch with others. The use of the mobile phone for self-expansion was associated with more negative emotion and less positive emotion (relief) in response to loss/separation from the phone.

These forms of engagement, however, have primarily been interpreted through the lenses of the ‘liberation technology’ agenda, which privileges the relationship between citizens and the state, neglecting the variety of actors and networks that intervene in shaping governance processes, alongside or in competition with the state. Through an ethnography of two local radio stations in Kenya, this article offers a more realistic picture of mobile–radio interactions and their repercussions on governance. The findings illustrate that (1) while these interactive spaces are open to all listeners with access to a phone, they are in practice inhabited by small cohorts of recurrent characters often connected to existing power structures; (2) even in places where basic services are offered by actors other than the state, including non-governmental organizations and criminal networks, the state continues to represent the imagined figure to which listeners address most of their demands; (3) in contrast to the expectations that authorities will act on claims and grievances made public through the media, other factors, including ethnicity, intervene in facilitating or preventing action.

Recent years have seen dramatic changes in the mediascape with a multitude of new possibilities for text-based communication; Facebook, in particular, has become popular among young Danes. Some have suggested that the role of SMS texting, a technology that was previously an entrenched part of young people’s communication repertoires, has changed in this diversified media environment. Based on interviews with 31 Danish high school students and drawing on the domestication approach, this article examines the use practices and meanings associated with SMS texting in today’s complex and evolving mediascape. This article argues that SMS texting is becoming re-domesticated, its meanings changing, and the technology finding a new position in the communication repertoires of users. ","",""
"2016","Situated empowerment: Mobile phones practices among market women in Kampala"," In this article we depart from studies on empowerment and its intersections with the informal economy and market women in the Global South and promises of the mobile phone in so-called developing regions. Conducting an explorative study among market women in Kampala, the aim is to examine what roles (if any) the mobile phone plays for them in terms of empowerment. Our findings resonate with studies from other parts of the world, suggesting that while pivotal for their business endeavors, mobile phone practices are also embedded in patriarchal structures. By discussing how these market women navigate the tensions between using the phone for their business and in relations to their partners, the article contributes a more nuanced and context-specific understanding of mobile phone practices and the empowerment of market women. We conclude the article by suggesting a situated approach to the study of empowerment. ","",""
"2016","From garamut to mobile phone: Communication change in rural Papua New Guinea"," This article presents the attitudinal response of rural villagers in Papua New Guinea to mobile telephony, based on a threshold study made during the early stages of its adoption. The research indicates that the introduction of mobile telecommunications has generally been viewed positively, with mobile phones affording social interaction with loved ones. Nonetheless, negative concerns have been strongly felt, notably financial costs and anxiety about mobile phones aiding in the coordination of extramarital liaisons and criminal activities. The communities investigated previously had scant access to modern communication technologies, some still using traditional means such as wooden slit drums, known locally as garamuts. The expansion of mobile network coverage has introduced into communal village life the capability to communicate dyadically and privately at a distance. Investigation into the adoption of mobile phones thus promotes understanding about traditional means of communication and notions of public and private interactions. ","",""
"2016","Mobile art: Rethinking intersections between art, user created content (UCC), and the quotidian"," In many countries across the world, mobile media has become an embedded part of everyday life. And yet, despite the influence of mobile media in and around art, the notion of “mobile art” or “mobile media art” remains relatively undertheorized and discussed. So what constitutes mobile art? Is it defined by a mobile interface in the process or delivery of the artwork? Or is it defined by a relationship to mobile content or context? Located in and around the field of mobile communication, mobile art has often been sublimated with locative, hybrid, mixed reality, or media arts. This paper argues for an understanding of mobile art as a broader field of creative practice than just locative media practice or media arts. Rather than survey all the examples of mobile art on offer today, this paper will structure mobile art into key three thematic rubrics: intimate copresence, emplaced visuality, ambient play. ","",""
"2016","The “life and death” of great Finnish fashion phones: A periodization of changing styles in Nokia phone design between 1992 and 2013"," Visual aesthetics is an essential part of our experience of mobile devices, but the ways in which it is accounted for in design have largely been overlooked. We investigate whether an aesthetization of mobile design is taking place and, if so, how it is being pursued through institutional practices in organizations. We conduct a visual analysis of all Nokia phone releases between 1992 and 2013 complemented by an interview series with key actors. The study reveals a continuous increase in aesthetic variation between 1998 and 2008, which is visible in the variation of colors, forms, and materials. The period between 2003 and 2008, which we term the “Grand” period, marks the peak of aesthetization of Nokia’s devices. It exhibits great variation, and is visibly similar to aesthetics in the fashion industry. With the introduction of the slate form, we see a decrease in visual variation between 2009 and 2013. The interviews reveal how the visual design was driven by organizational strategies, such as customer segmentation in general, and an orientation toward the fashion industry, for example, in the creation of a fashion segment. The study reveals how aesthetic variation is weaved into a complex innovation system with sometimes conflicting demands deriving from, for instance, technology and user interaction. ","",""
"2016","The influence of individual noise sensitivity on mobile phone attitudes and behavior"," Research in psychoacoustics and public health reveals that individuals respond differently to noise, with some being more sensitive to noise than others. Given the prevalence of mobile technology and that noise sensitivity appears to be a relatively stable individual difference, it is possible that noise sensitivity may distinguish individual mobile phone use. This study investigates the relationship between noise sensitivity and mobile phone attitudes and behaviors. Study results suggest that noise sensitive bystanders find mobile phone conversations more annoying, that they differ in their assessment of the distraction level of ambient noise when making and receiving calls, are more likely to report mobile phones as distracting, and are more likely to seek privacy from others when receiving a call.

"2016","Domestication of smartphones and mobile applications: A quantitative mixed-method study"," Smartphones are finding their way into our daily lives. This paper examines the domestication of smartphones by looking at how the way we use mobile applications affects our everyday routines. Data is collected through an innovative quantitative mixed-method approach, combining log data from smartphones and survey (perception) data. We find that there are dimensions of domestication that explain how the use of smartphones affects our daily routines. Contributions are stronger for downloaded applications than for native applications. Especially applications that require interaction with others, such as social media and instant messaging, have a serious impact on our day-to-day routines. As a result, appropriation is core in incorporating smartphones in daily life routines. However, frequency of use and the total number of minutes spent on a given type of application per day affect our everyday routines in different ways. This paper is the first quantitative domestication study that focuses on smartphones rather than feature phones. The theoretical contribution and practical implications are outlined. ","",""

Little attention, however, has been devoted to its theoretical foundations. Drawing from youth culture theory and new (mobile) media theories, this article conceptually develops mobile youth culture by (a) describing the commonalities in adolescent mobile phone use that constitute the culture, and by (b) discussing the origins of these commonalities through an analysis of the network, the social and personal logics inherent in mobile communication technology, and the way these are appropriated by youths to accommodate their transition to adulthood. The article concludes by pointing out the shortcomings of the concept: The limited attention for the heterogeneity in adolescent media use, the integration of mobile media technologies into young people’s media repertoires, the cross-generational implications of mobile media use, and the impact of local context and culture.

"2016","Unintended consequences of a strategically ambiguous organizational policy selectively restricting mobile device use at work"," Mobile devices have permeated organizations creating diverse communication opportunities and new organizational challenges. This case study examines one of those challenges: creating a strategically ambiguous mobile device use policy to combat misuse in an organization. We use focus group data collection and a subsequent constant comparative analysis to examine a U.S. company with an organizational policy selectively restricting mobile device access for nonmanagerial workers. The findings and resulting theoretical model reflect the tension employees face when interpreting a restrictive mobile device use policy within the context of mobile use as “taken for granted.” This tension is manifest through four unintended consequences of the strategically ambiguous policy: (a) declining productivity, (b) supervisors burdened by overwhelming tasks, (c) decreased professional mobility, and (d) fleeting organizational identification. This research offers an organizational contribution to the current work on mobiles and it provides insight into how nonmanagerial workers interpret and act when a mobile use policy is strategically ambiguous.

"2016","The convergence of mobile and social media: Affordances and constraints of mobile networked communication for health workers in low- and middle-income countries"," The increasing convergence of mobile and social media is highly transformational because it is shifting the dominant form of digital communication from bilateral towards mobile and networked communication among distributed interactants. This paper explores the affordances and constraints of this dynamics for global health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In these settings, research and practice have focused on one- or two-way communication designs and on approaches that position health workers as passive actors. To extend current views, three domains of mobile social media usage are theorized: (a) sociocognitive learning; (b) Sociocultural professional participation; and (c) Concertive peer and multistakeholder control. The theoretical discussion is illustrated with empirical examples from a nonsystematic literature review to account for the wide and interdisciplinary problem space. In the second part of this analysis, suggestions are discussed regarding how to anchor and facilitate mobile social media spaces within existing institutional structures. Finally, this paper argues that leveraging the affordances of mobile social-media-based communication requires the consideration of several constraints and challenges, including the economics of participation, privacy and surveillance, regulation and information quality, equal sociocultural participation, and technical competencies and professionalism.

As the first mobile electronic device, the portable radio reveals important information about how the mobile media experience has developed over time. Portable radio afforded several new experiences that are relevant to today’s media landscape: it allowed users to create customizable, mobile media environments that they could take with them wherever they went; it redefined the radio listening context by allowing users to bring their preferred forms of entertainment with them when travelling to unfamiliar places; and it facilitated more continuous media consumption habits. This interdisciplinary essay combines close textual analysis of historical newspaper articles and advertisements, which are viewed through the lens of a range of media theories. The goal is to uncover some of the complex effects of early mobile media and to lay the groundwork for future in-depth studies of mobile media history. ","",""
"2016","The hierarchy of mobile phone incorporation among older users"," Older people use mobile telephones extensively, yet little is known about the relevant domestication processes. Employing usage variety as an indicator, this study explores levels of mobile phone incorporation among older users, based on an online cross-European survey of 1,039 individuals aged 60 and up. Results displayed a four-level pyramid structure of mobile phone incorporation with voice calling at its base, proceeding through basic functions and Internet-based functions to media player at its apex. The two upper levels were negatively associated with reported “old” media use (e.g., television, radio) and positively correlated with use of more advanced technology-based media. Younger age, higher education and income, work force participation, and residence in Italy or Israel predicted higher levels of mobile phone incorporation. The findings suggested that the incorporation phase of mobile phone domestication by older Internet users comprises various subphases and that level of incorporation depends on one’s personal and cultural background. Furthermore, results demonstrated that mobile phones replace old media to some extent and complement the use of other new media. ","",""

However, mobile technology appropriation in the Global South is not limited to these cases, as evidenced by Brazil’s well-established media arts community, which has embraced mobiles as interfaces for art making since the early 2000s. Based on fourteen in-depth interviews with mobile communication researchers and media artists in Brazil between 2011 and 2013, this article investigates the creative appropriation of mobile technologies in the production of hybrid spaces. Our results reveal that these creative appropriations, namely mobile art and locative art, can be described through four main nodes of articulation: motivations, creative processes, sponsorship, and promotion. The experimental nature of these projects invites us to look at the Brazilian media art scene as a materialization of a circuit of innovative mobile culture and as an indication that investigations about technological appropriation in the Global South must be expanded to include motifs other than the already-known utilitarian purposes.","",""

However, addiction as a “dark side” of this technology use has been described, and multiple psychological scales for the determination of this addiction’s severity have been created. Smartphone addiction is not specific to a certain cultural, social, economic or educational background. Risk factors for smart phones addiction development have been detected in epidemiological trials: female gender, high anxiety level, insomnia, Internet use, alcohol use, low self-esteem, low self-control, and sensation-seeking. Depression has been associated with both high risk for developing cell phone addiction, and with protective value for this pathology. Applications for monitorisation of the smartphone use have been created, in order to help a clinician to verify the status of the addiction. No clinical trials focused on specific treatment approaches has been yet initiated. Due to the increasing rate of cell phones use, and to the wide range of population possible affected by excessive use of the cell phones- from children to elderly individuals, more research is needed for delineating harm-reduction approach (to decrease the use, or to make the behaviour controllable) and therapy (in more severe cases).","",""

"2017","Women, youth and everything else: age-based and gendered stereotypes in relation to digital technology among elderly Italian mobile phone users"," In the context of an international research project on older people’s relations with and through mobile telephony, Italian participants spontaneously provided narrations on mobile phones that appeared to be structured around strong stereotypes. Respondents show a twofold representation of mobile phones either as a simple communication tool or as a ‘hi-tech’ device, which generates multifaceted stereotypes. More specifically, when the mobile phone is considered as a simple communication tool, age-based stereotypes address younger people’s bad manners, while gendered stereotypes depict women as ‘chatterboxes’ or ‘social groomers’. On the other hand, when the mobile phone is considered a ‘hi-tech’ device, age-based stereotypes underline younger people’s advanced user skills, while gendered stereotypes focus on women’s lack of competencies. Based on that, we provide a conceptual framework for analysing such stereotyped – and apparently conflicting – representations. Interestingly, while some issues also emerged in other countries, the masculine assumption that women are less-skilled mobile phone users appears as a peculiarity of Italian respondents. ","",""

It focuses on my experience of moving frequently within and between cities under specific work/ life conditions. An autoethnography provides insights not observable in quantitative research designs; and allows for access to embodied experience, along with reflections on emerging topics going beyond the purely personal, namely, mobility, advantage, and (work)place-making. This strategy allowed me to delineate the boundaries of the fieldsite across online and offline settings, including the digital technologies I share with other research participants. Personal maps of geolocalised trajectories overlapped with experiential accounts (photos, audionotes, interviews, and hand-drawn maps) are included. An interpretational thickness emerges from this association of materials. The research process has inspired the development of a smartphone mobile application for documenting such experiences of mobile freelancing, yet to be created with developers, who are, in turn, participants in this research.","",""

Based on the doctoral study on  subaltern users and their mobile media digital practices in India, it  discusses some of the theoretical issues and outlines methodological  possibilities while entering the field. It makes distinction between the  theoretical orientations of techno-sociality and sociality of technology,  and highlights the significance of adopting the latter to study new socialities  that are emerging due to human interaction with technology. It  discusses some challenges of doing qualitative research in new media  contexts and suggests measures for overcoming them. In this regard, it  reviews the suitability of virtual ethnography and participant observation  as methodological approaches to mobile phones. While the  popular trend has been to resort to technologised tools of data collection  and processing (even within qualitative research in new media  and digital technologies) this article suggests and discusses the usefulness  of a more basic, yet powerful method of long interview to study  users and document their practices. It concludes how such a choice  can also be regardful of some ethical issues involved in studying user  practices on mobile phones.","",""

We draw on a long-term ethnographic study of NEET individuals to argue that one of the underpinning principles of mobile phones – that they pertain to mobility and that mobility is positive and agential – is called into question. Our aim is not only to unpack a number of concepts and assumptions underpinning the mobile phone but also to suggest that these concepts unhelpfully (and even detrimentally) locate mobile phones in relation to the technological possibilities on offer without taking into account what is simultaneously made impossible and immobile, and for whom. Finally, when we set the digital experiences of NEETs alongside the discourses around mobile phones, we find that mobility is restricted – not enabling, and that it is forged in, and articulated as part of an everyday life that is dominated by the social and economic horizons set by the groups status as NEET.

For farm workers, the initial experience of landlines and public pay phones was filled with anxiety and missed connections. Despite the benefits of mobile phones, their adoption was delayed among Mixtec in Oxnard, California, because of a combination of legal status, high cost, and seasonal work. This article finds that a surge in mobile phone adoption and use took place during a time where production of labor-intensive crops like strawberries increased throughout California, farm worker settlement patterns matured, and mobile phone plans changed becoming more affordable and easier to understand. The widespread adoption of mobile phones brought more predictability to the informal agricultural job market for farm workers, but this did not necessarily mean higher wages in the strawberry fields.

Ubiquitous smartphone use proffers a managerial relationship between subject and device, such that smartphone culture becomes necessary for navigating between different spheres of life. Furthermore, as smartphones occupy a greater role in public life, they have also begun to shape the creation of story in media narratives. I argue that smartphones have become a tool of narrative management for network drama not unlike the ways in which they govern everyday life. TGW’s narrative form and genre—a unique negotiation between episodic procedural and serial melodrama—successfully mirror the management of routine informational and emotional flows, structuring narrative and spectatorial habits while also accommodating for technology’s glitches.

These findings have led researchers to suggest that mobile phone use may pose a legitimately addictive behavior for some people. Other research has suggested negative effects of mobile phones on academic outcomes. To study the effects of phone separation on both anxiety and attainment of academic study goals, we randomly assigned participants ( N = 93) to a restricted mobile phone access condition or a control condition. After setting a list of goals for a study session, participants worked on their own, self-chosen class materials for 60 minutes. Anxiety was measured before and immediately following the study session. Attainment of study goals was assessed through a self-report estimate of the percent of study goals accomplished at the end of the session. We predicted that those who classified as high on a problematic mobile phone use scale and who had their phones taken away would show the greatest increases in anxiety over the session as well as the greatest deficits in attainment of study goals as compared to all other participants. While there was a general tendency for participants who scored higher on the problematic use scale to be more anxious, anxiety did not differ between participants with phone access and those without it. Participants without phone access self-reported attainment of 12% more of their study goals than those who had phones. This study qualified the conditions for which restricting mobile phone access increases anxiety and provided further empirical support for detriments to attainment of study goals when mobile phones are present.

Some research has found detrimental effects of permanent availability and connectivity, other studies hint at beneficial effects resulting from users taking minibreaks from work. As there is some evidence for a recovery potential of mass media in general, the current study extends this line of research by examining whether smartphones also have such potential. To that end, we investigated the effects of smartphone use in fatiguing situations on recovery experiences and cognitive performance. After a fatigue-induction task, participants were observed in a waiting situation in order to check whether they used their mobile devices. Afterwards, data on their recovery experiences and cognitive performance were collected. The results demonstrate that smartphone use can be beneficial for some recovery dimensions but also detrimental for others. Smartphone use was positively related to cognitive performance, mediated through experiences of control.

Exploring the realities of mobile phone use in conflict areas","ABSTRACT Across disciplines, scholars extol the revolutionary potential of mobile technologies in developing nations. Mobile phones in particular may facilitate economic and social development. However, our understanding of mobile phone’s interaction with a developing country’s society is limited by two factors: first, development is often accompanied by social and political conflict; and second, scholars often provide a broad overview on the use of these technologies. We address these limitations through the use of data collected from ethnographic interviews conducted in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo. We highlight the everyday use of mobile technologies in developing nations that experience political conflict. We conclude that while mobile technologies have some potential of mitigating social inequality, political conflict, and safety concerns, these opportunities for meaningful use are hampered by limitations associated with daily life in developing countries such as irregular access to electricity and network coverage boundaries.","",""
"2018","Everyday imagery"," User-based research into the lived experiences associated with smartphone camera practices – in particular, the taking, storing, curating and sharing of personal imagery in the digital media sphere – remains scarce, especially in contrast to its increasing ubiquity. Accordingly, this article’s detailed analysis of open-ended questionnaires from ‘millennial’ smartphone users elucidates the varied experiential, compositional and technological aspects associated with smartphone imagery in everyday life. It argues that the associated changes do more than just update previous technologies but rather open space up for emergent forms of visual communication. Specifically, our close interpretive reading indicates four key factors underlying the moments privileged when using smartphone cameras, namely: they deviate from the mundane, are related to ‘positive’ emotions, evince strong social bonds and encompass a future-oriented perspective. Relatedly, in terms of photographic composition, visual content tends to circulate around: the social presence of others, boundedness of event, perceived aesthetic value and intended shareability. Our findings question certain formulations about the gradual disappearance of media from personal consciousness in a digital age. If ceaselessness is a defining characteristic of the current era, our analysis reveals that the use of smartphone cameras is indicative of people affectively and self-consciously deploying the technology to try to arrest the ephemerality of daily life, however fleetingly. This article thus pinpoints the theoretical and methodological value of research approaches moving beyond a narrow focus on the usage patterns to uncover the spatio-temporal specificities shaping (and being shaped by) smartphone imagery and its communicative resonances.

Via in-depth interviews (N=20) with officers and combat soldiers, the study shows how soldiers’ cellular devices served a range of objectives: military, personal documentary, communication with home and family, and updating the home front and other battle sectors. On the military level, cellular enables the generation of the “cellular buddy” phenomenon, or the ability to consult with extra-organizational parties — such as friends who are former senior officers — which led to impeding the army’s internal chain of command. On the personal-experiential level, this section presents the “availability conflict” that the soldiers described, between their desire to be in touch with home during the war and the high price thereof. Full-time availability and the lack of ability to disconnect “brings” the home front, the home, and the family directly to the battlefield, thus affecting the soldiers’ already-complex experiential and mental state.","",""

Such a phenomenon drew on the publics’ fears of an unknown and anonymous ‘pervert,’ which now had access to their private sphere through the technology of telephone calls. Previous research which had focused on obscenity laws and censorship with regards to cultural products, however neglects the gendered, sexual, and racialized implications of this historical episode of obscene calls. The discourse around obscene calls during the 1960s demonstrates that the telephone shifted from a technology of progress to a technology of ‘terror’ that delivered social anxieties around race, gender, and sexuality into the domestic sphere.","",""
"2018","Negotiating digital spaces in everyday life: A case study of Indian women and their digital use","New developments in digital technology and better and affordable access allow women unprecedented access to information and communication networks — if they are able to use digital technologies to access networks and digital information. This study presents a case study of motivations of women to use information and communication technologies (ICT) in a ubiquitous information environment. This study follows an interpretive paradigm to explore an understanding of culture and gender in a middle-class Indian context. Women in this report varied in terms of heavy/light and mandatory/voluntary use. We discuss the implications of such variations in terms of technology adoption for digital inclusion. Social factors, such as the role of parents and social communities, were found to influence women to develop and maintain interests in ICT that were reflected in their professional and personal lives. Some women were slow to adapt to ICT use as they tended to adhere to normative expectations which hindered ICT use. Women tend to have greater ICT use if it is for fulfilling familial roles and for communication.","",""

It examines the possibility that cinematic media (in this case audio from films) can be repurposed within an immersive, mobile heritage guide. The paper will describe the project in broad terms but will focus on certain unexpected and unusual perceptual effects generated during the test phase of the project. BATTERCTRAX began as an adjunct to a larger academic initiative called Cinematic Geographies of Battersea: Urban Interface and Site-Specific Spatial Knowledge, a collaboration between Liverpool, Cambridge and Edinburgh Universities and English Heritage. Amongst many outcomes, Cinematic Geographies built a comprehensive database of films shot in the London district of Battersea, which created ways to mobilise historic moving images for the analysis of social and material change in cities. As a tangential outcome of this project, BATTERCTRAX was a mobile phone app that played audio content from feature films, documentaries and TV shows at the places where they were originally recorded. The user would walk through clusters of GPS-enabled geofences in the test zone of Battersea Park, triggering a succession of historic cinematic sounds from across the 20th century. However, by anchoring fictional audio content to the places of their origin, BATTERCTRAX appeared to create a sense of dissonance between sensory stimulants, destabilising a sense of perceptual cohesion in the user. These novel effects lead the researchers to speculate that such technology could not only be used to construct highly immersive, location-based urban experiences, but that it could also trigger psychoactive effects in ways that media developers and users had not anticipated. This paper will propose that geolocative media has the ability to tap into unexplored realms of """"collective"""" cultural memory, but can also elicit unexpected psychological and perceptual responses.","",""

A survey was conducted in the quantitative phase to confirm the relationship patterns suggested by qualitative findings. Financial, cognitive, and environmental resources constituted access barriers. Despite gaining material access through alternative social and environmental resources, the barriers they faced still influenced the nature and frequency of their parent–child mobile interactions.

To help address this issue the present study explicates a method for measuring media use and competition, the time–space diary, and reports a methodological study testing the robustness of this method across 3 diary instruments. Following a summary of concepts central to mobile media use and measurement, this study reports findings from data collected using 3 types of time–space diaries. Results indicate no significant difference between diary methods (paper and pencil, audio recorder, mobile device) on the likelihood of reported media use, and minimal differences in patterns of competitive superiority, supporting the reliability of the method. Paper-and-pencil diaries are argued to offer the greatest use flexibility relative to audio recorders and mobile devices, and received higher ease of use scores relative to mobile devices. The article concludes with a discussion of the utility of the time–space diary method for emerging mobile media research which must account for media use in novel times and places, as well as multichannel media consumption.

As these smartphone interfaces are the result of continuous personalization processes, they can be seen as snapshots of the phone’s current use. Thus, this form of data should have strong explanatory powers for understanding the related mobile media practices.

"2019","Walkie-Talkies, Wandering, and Sonic Intimacy","IntroductionThis short article examines contemporary artistic use of walkie-talkies across two projects: Saturday (2002) by Sabrina Raaf and Walk That Sound (2014) by Lukatoyboy. Drawing on Dominic Pettman’s notion of sonic intimacy, I argue that both artists incorporate walkie-talkies as part of their explorations of mediated wandering, and in ways that seek to capture sonic ambiances and intimacies. One thing that is striking about both these works is that they rethink what’s possible with walkie-talkies; both artists use them not just as low-tech, portable devices for one-to-one communication over distance, but also—and more strikingly—as (covert) recording equipment for capturing, while wandering, snippets of intimate conversation between passers-by and the “voice” of the surrounding environment. Both artworks strive to make the familiar strange. They prompt us to question our preconceived perceptions of, and affective engagements with, the people and places around us, to listen more attentively to the voices of others (and the “Other”), and to aurally inhabit in new ways the spaces and places we find ourselves in and routinely pass through.The walkie-talkie is an established, simple communication device, consisting of a two-way radio transceiver with a speaker and microphone (in some cases, the speaker is also used as the microphone) and an antenna (Wikipedia). Walkie-talkies are half-duplex communication devices, meaning that they use a single radio channel: only one radio on the channel can transmit at a time, but many can listen; when a user wishes to talk, they must turn off the receiver and turn on the transmitter by pressing a push-to-talk button (Wikipedia). In some models, static—known as squelch—is produced each time the push-to-talk button is depressed. The push-to-talk button is a feature of both projects: in Saturday, it transforms the walkie-talkie into a cheap, portable recorder-transmitter. In Walk That Sound, rapid fire exchanges of conversation using the push-to-talk button feature strongly.Interestingly, walkie-talkies were developed during World War Two. While they continue to be used within certain industrial settings, they are perhaps best known as a “quaint” household toy and “fun tool” (Smith). Early print ads for walkie-talkie toys marketed them as a form of both spyware for kids (with the Gabriel Toy Co. releasing a 007-themed walkie-talkie set) and as a teletechnology for communication over distance—“how thrilling to ‘speak through space!’”, states one ad (Statuv “New!”). What is noteworthy about these early ads is that they actively promote experimental use of walkie-talkies. For instance, a 1953 ad for Vibro-Matic “Space Commander” walkie-talkies casts them as media transmission devices, suggesting that, with them, one can send and receive “voice – songs – music” (Statuv “New!”). In addition, a 1962 ad for the Knight-Kit walkie-talkie imagines “you’ll find new uses for this exciting walkie-talkie every day” (Statuv “Details”). Resurgent interest in walkie-talkies has seen them also promoted more recently as intimate tools “for communication without asking permission to communicate” (“Nextel”); this is to say that they have been marketed as devices for synchronous or immediate communication that overcome the limits of asynchronous communication, such as texting, where there might be substantial delays between the sending of a message and receipt of a response. Within this context, it is not surprising that Snapchat and Instagram have also since added “walkie-talkie” features to their messaging services. The Nextel byline, emphasising “without asking permission”, also speaks to the possibilities of using walkie-talkies as rudimentary forms of spyware.Within art practice that explores mediated forms of wandering—that is, walking while using media and various “remote transmission technologies” (Duclos 233)—walkie-talkies hold appeal for a number of reasons, including their particular aesthetic qualities, such as the crackling or static sound (squelch) that one encounters when using them; their portability; their affordability; and, the fact that, while they can be operated on multiple channels, they tend to be regarded primarily as devices that permit two-way, one-to-one (and therefore intimate, if not secure) remote communication. As we will see below, however, contemporary artists, such as the aforementioned earlier advertisers, have also been very attentive to the device’s experimental possibilities. Perhaps the best known (if possibly apocryphal) example of artistic use of walkie-talkies is by the Situationist International as part of their explorations in urban wandering (a revolutionary strategy called dérive). In the Situationist text from 1960, Die Welt als Labyrinth (Anon.), there is a detailed account of how walkie-talkies were to form part of a planned dérive, which was organised by the Dutch section of the Situationist International, through the city of Amsterdam, but which never went ahead:Two groups, each containing three situationists, would dérive for three days, on foot or eventually by boat (sleeping in hotels along the way) without leaving the center of Amsterdam. By means of the walkie-talkies with which they would be equipped, these groups would remain in contact, with each other, if possible, and in any case with the radio-truck of the cartographic team, from where the director of the dérive—in this case Constant [Nieuwenhuys]—moving around so as to maintain contact, would define their routes and sometimes give instructions (it was also the director of the dérive’s responsibility to prepare experiments at certain locations and secretly arranged events.) (Anon.) This proposed dérive formed part of Situationist experiments in unitary urbanism, a process that consisted of “making different parts of the city communicate with one another.”  Their ambition was to create new situations informed by, among other things, encounters and atmospheres that were registered through dérive in order to reconnect parts of the city that were separated spatially (Lefebvre quoted in Lefebvre and Ross 73). In an interview with Kristin Ross, Henri Lefebvre insists that the Situationists “did have their experiments; I didn’t participate. They used all kinds of means of communication—I don’t know when exactly they were using walkie-talkies. But I know they were used in Amsterdam and in Strasbourg” (Lefebvre quoted in Lefebvre and Ross 73). However, as Rebecca Duclos points out, such use “is, in fact, not well documented”, and “none of the more well-known reports on situationist activity […] specifically mentions the use of walkie-talkies within their descriptive narratives” (Duclos 233). In the early 2000s, walkie-talkies also figured prominently, alongside other media devices, in at least two location-based gaming projects by renowned British art collective Blast Theory, Can You See Me Now? (2001) and You Get Me (2008). In the first of these projects, participants in the game (“online players”) competed against members of Blast Theory (“runners”), tracking them through city streets via a GPS-enabled handheld computer that runners carried with them. The goal for online players was to move an avatar they created through a virtual map of the city as multiple runners “pursued their avatar’s geographical coordinates in real-time” (Leorke). As Dale Leorke explains, “Players could see the locations of the runners and other players and exchange text messages with other players” (Leorke 27), and runners could “read players’ messages and communicate directly with each other through a walkie-talkie” (28). An audio stream from these walkie-talkie conversations allowed players to eavesdrop on their pursuers (Blast Theory, Can You See Me Now?).You Get Me was similarly structured, with online players and “runners” (eight teenagers who worked with Blast Theory on the game). Remotely situated online players began the game by listening to the “personal geography” of the runners over a walkie-talkie stream (Blast Theory, You Get Me). They then selected one runner, and tracked them down by navigating their own avatar, without being caught, through a virtual version of Mile End Park in London, in pursuit of their chosen runner who was moving about the actual Mile End Park. Once their chosen runner was contacted, the player had to respond to a question that the runner posed to them. If the runner was satisfied with the player’s answer, conversation switched to “the privacy of a mobile phone” in order to converse further; if not, the player was thrown back into the game (Blast Theory, You Get Me). A key aim of Blast Theory’s work, as I have argued elsewhere (Wilken), is the fostering of interactions and fleeting intimacies between relative and complete strangers. The walkie-talkie is a key tool in both the aforementioned Blast Theory projects for facilitating these interactions and intimacies.Beyond these well-known examples, walkie-talkies have been employed in productive and exploratory ways by other artists. The focus in this article is on two specific projects: the first by US-based sound artist Sabrina Raaf, called Saturday (2002) and the second by Serbian sound designer Lukatoyboy (Luka Ivanović), titled Walk That Sound (2014). Sonic IntimaciesThe concept that gives shape and direction to the analysis of the art projects by Raaf and Lukatoyboy and their use of walkie-talkies is that of sonic intimacy. This is a concept of emerging critical interest across media and sound studies and geography (see, for example, James; Pettman; Gallagher and Prior). Sonic intimacy, as Dominic Pettman explains, is composed of two simultaneous yet opposing orientations. On the one hand, sonic intimacy involves a “turning inward, away from the wider world, to more private and personal experiences and relationships” (79). While, on the other hand, it also involves a turning outward, to seek and heed “the voice of the world” (79)—or what Pettman refers to as the “vox mundi” (66). Pettman conceives of the “vox mundi” as an “ecological voice”, whereby “all manner of creatures, agents, entities, objects, and phenomena” (79) have the opportunity to speak to us, if only we were prepared to listen to our surroundings in new and different ways. In a later passage, he also refers to the “vox mundi” as a “carrier or potentially enlightening alterity” (83). Voices, Pettman writes, “transgress the neat divisions we make between ‘us’ and ‘them’, at all scales and junctures” (6). Thus, Pettman’s suggestion is that “by listening to the ‘voices’ that lie dormant in the surrounding world […] we may in turn foster a more sustainable relationship with [the] local matrix of specific existences” (85), be they human or otherwise.This formulation of sonic intimacy provides a productive conceptual frame for thinking through Raaf’s and Lukatoyboy’s use of walkie-talkies. The contention in this article is that these two projects are striking for the way that they both use walkie-talkies to explore, simultaneously, this double articulation or dual orientation of sonic intimacy—a turning inwards to capture more private and personal experiences and conversations, and a turning outwards to capture the vox mundi. Employing Pettman’s notion of sonic intimacy as a conceptual frame, I trace below the different ways that these two projects incorporate walkie-talkies in order to develop mediated forms of wandering that seek to capture place-based sonic ambiances and sonic intimacies.Sabrina Raaf, Saturday (2002)US sound artist Sabrina Raaf’s Saturday (2002) is a sound-based art installation based on recordings of “stolen conversations” that Raaf gathered over many Saturdays in Humboldt Park, Chicago. Raaf’s work harks back to the early marketing of walkie-talkie toys as spyware. In Raaf’s hands, this device is used not for engaging in intimate one-to-one conversation, but for listening in on, and capturing, the intimate conversations of others. In other words, she uses this device, as the Nextel slogan goes, for “communication without permission to communicate” (“Nextel”). Raaf’s inspiration for the piece was twofold. First, she has noted that “with the overuse of radio frequency bands for wireless communications, there comes the increased occurrence of crossed lines where a private conversation becomes accidentally shared” (Raaf). Reminiscent of Francis Ford Coppola’s film The Conversation (1974), in which surveillance expert Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) records the conversation of a couple as they walk through crowded Union Square in San Francisco, Raaf used a combination of walkie-talkies, CB radios, and “various other forms of consumer spy […] technology in order to actively harvest such communication leaks” (Raaf). The second source of inspiration was noticing the “sheer quantity of non-phone, low tech, radio transmissions that were constantly being sent around [the] neighbourhood”, transmissions that were easily intercepted. These conversations were eclectic in composition and character:The transmissions included communications between gang members on street corners nearby and group conversations between friends talking about changes in the neighbourhood and their families. There were raw, intimate conversations and often even late night sex talk between potential lovers. (Raaf)What struck Raaf about these conversations, these transmissions, was that there was “a furtive quality” to most of them, and “a particular daringness to their tone”.During her Saturday wanderings, Raaf complemented her recordings of stolen snippets of conversation with recordings of the “voice” of the surrounding neighbourhood—“the women singing out their windows to their radios, the young men in their low rider cars circling the block, the children, the ice cream carts, etc. These are the sounds that are mixed into the piece” (Raaf).Audience engagement with Saturday involves a kind of austere intimacy of its own that seems befitting of a surveillance-inspired sonic portrait of urban and private life. The piece is accessed via an interactive glove. This glove is white in colour and about the size of a large gardening glove, with a Velcro strap that fastens across the hand, like a cycling glove. The glove, which only has coverings for thumb and first two fingers (it is missing the ring and little fingers) is wired into and rests on top of a roughly A4-sized white rectangular box. This box, which is mounted onto the wall of an all-white gallery space at the short end, serves as a small shelf. The displayed glove is illuminated by a discrete, bent-arm desk lamp, that protrudes from the shelf near the gallery wall. Above the shelf are a series of wall-mounted colour images that relate to the project. In order to hear the soundtrack of Saturday, gallery visitors approach the shelf, put on the glove, and “magically just press their fingertips to their forehead [to] hear the sound without the use of their ears” (Raaf). The glove, Raaf explains, “is outfitted with leading edge audio electronic devices called ‘bone transducers’ […]. These transducers transmit sound in a very unusual fashion. They translate sound into vibration patterns which resonate through bone” (Raaf).Employing this technique, Raaf explains, “permits a new way of listening”:The user places their fingers to their forehead—in a gesture akin to Rodin’s The Thinker or of a clairvoyant—in order to tap into the lives of strangers. Pressing different combinations of fingers to the temple yield plural viewpoints and group conversations. These sounds are literally mixed in the bones of the listener. (Raaf) The result is a (literally and figuratively) touching sonic portrait of Humboldt Park, its residents, and the “voice” of its surrounding neighbourhoods. Through the unique technosomatic (Richardson) apparatus—combinations of gestures that convey the soundscape directly through the bones and body—those engaging with Saturday get to hear voices in/of/around Humboldt Park. It is a portrait that combines sonic intimacy in the two forms described earlier in this article. In its inward-focused form, the gallery visitor-listener is positioned as a voyeur of sorts, listening into stolen snippets of private and personal relationships, experiences, and interactions. And, in its outward-focused form, the gallery visitor-listener encounters a soundscape in which an array of agents, entities, and objects are also given a voice. Additional work performed by this piece, it seems to me, is to be found in the intermingling of these two form of sonic intimacy—the personal and the environmental—and the way that they prompt reflection on mediation, place, urban life, others, and intimacy. That is to say that, beyond its particular sonic portrait of Humboldt Park, Saturday works in “clearing some conceptual space” in the mind of the departing gallery visitor such that they might “listen for, if not precisely to, the collective, polyphonic ‘voice of the world’” (Pettman 6) as they go about their day-to-day lives.Lukatoyboy, Walk That Sound (2014)The second project, Walk That Sound, by Serbian sound artist Lukatoyboy was completed for the 2014 CTM festival. CTM is an annual festival event that is staged in Berlin and dedicated to “adventurous music and art” (CTM Festival, “About”). A key project within the festival is CTM Radio Lab. The Lab supports works, commissioned by CTM Festival and Deutschlandradio Kultur – Hörspiel/Klangkunst (among other partnering organisations), that seek to pair and explore the “specific artistic possibilities of radio with the potentials of live performance or installation” (CTM Festival, “Projects”). Lukatoyboy’s Walk That Sound was one of two commissioned pieces for the 2014 CTM Radio Lab. The project used the “commonplace yet often forgotten walkie-talkie” (CTM Festival, “Projects”) to create a moving urban sound portrait in the area around the Kottbusser Tor U-Bahn station in Berlin-Kreuzberg. Walk That Sound recruited participants—“mobile scouts”—to rove around the Kottbusser Tor area (CTM Festival, “Projects”). Armed with walkie-talkies, and playing with “the array of available and free frequencies, and the almost unlimited amount of users that can interact over these different channels”, the project captured the dispatches via walkie-talkie of each participant (CTM Festival, “Projects”). The resultant recording of Walk That Sound—which was aired on Deutschlandradio (see Lukatoyboy), part of a long tradition of transmitting experimental music and sound art on German radio (Cory)—forms an eclectic soundscape.The work juxtaposes snippets of dialogue shared between the mobile scouts, overheard mobile phone conversations, and moments of relative quietude, where the subdued soundtrack is formed by the ambient sounds—the “voice”—of the Kottbusser Tor area. This voice includes distant traffic, the distinctive auditory ticking of pedestrian lights, and moments of tumult and agitation, such as the sounds of construction work, car horns, emergency services vehicle sirens, a bottle bouncing on the pavement, and various other repetitive yet difficult to identify industrial sounds. This voice trails off towards the end of the recording into extended walkie-talkie produced static or squelch. The topics covered within the “crackling dialogues” (CTM Festival, “Projects”) of the mobile scouts ranged widely. There were banal observations (“I just stepped on a used tissue”; “people are crossing the street”; “there are 150 trains”)—wonderings that bear strong similarities with French writer Georges Perec’s well-known experimental descriptions of everyday Parisian life in the 1970s (Perec “An Attempt”). There were also intimate, confiding, flirtatious remarks (“Do you want to come to Turkey with me?”), as well as a number of playfully paranoid observations and quips (“I like to lie”; “I can see you”; “do you feel like you are being recorded?”; “I’m being followed”) that seem to speak to the fraught history of Berlin in particular as well as the complicated character of urban life in general—as Pettman asks, “what does ‘together’ signify in a socioeconomic system so efficient in producing alienation and isolation?” (92).In sum, Walk That Sound is a strangely moving exploration of sonic intimacy, one that shifts between many different registers and points of focus—much like urban wandering itself. As a work, it is variously funny, smart, paranoid, intimate, expansive, difficult to decipher, and, at times, even difficult to listen to. Pettman argues that, “thanks in large part to the industrialization of the human ear […], we have lost the capacity to hear the vox mundi, which is […] the sum total of cacophonous, heterogeneous, incommensurate, and unsynthesizable sounds of the postnatural world” (8). Walk That Sound functions almost like a response to this dilemma. One comes away from listening to it with a heightened awareness of, appreciation for, and aural connection to the rich messiness of the polyphonic contemporary urban vox mundi. ConclusionThe argument of this article is that Sabrina Raaf’s Saturday and Lukatoyboy’s Walk That Sound are two projects that both incorporate walkie-talkies in order to develop mediated forms of wandering that seek to capture place-based sonic ambiances and sonic intimacies. Drawing on Pettman’s notion of “sonic intimacy”, examination of these projects has opened consideration around voice, analogue technology, and what Nick Couldry refers to as “an obligation to listen” (Couldry 580). In order to be heard, Pettman remarks, and “in order to be considered a voice at all”, and therefore as “something worth heeding”, the vox mundi “must arrive intimately, or else it is experienced as noise or static” (Pettman 83). In both the projects discussed here—Saturday and Walk That Sound—the walkie-talkie provides this means of “intimate arrival”. As half-duplex communication devices, walkie-talkies have always fulfilled a double function: communicating and listening. This dual functionality is exploited in new ways by Raaf and Lukatoyboy. In their projects, both artists turn the microphone outwards, such that the walkie-talkie becomes not just a device for communicating while in the field, but also—and more strikingly—it becomes a field recording device. The result of which is that this simple, “playful” communication device is utilised in these two projects in two ways: on the one hand, as a “carrier of potentially enlightening alterity” (Pettman 83), a means of encouraging “potential encounters” (89) with strangers who have been thrown together and who cross paths, and, on the other hand, as a means of fostering “an environmental awareness” (89) of the world around us. In developing these prompts, Raaf and Lukatoyboy build potential bridges between Pettman’s work on sonic intimacy, their own work, and the work of other experimental artists. For instance, in relation to potential encounters, there are clear points of connection with Blast Theory, a group who, as noted earlier, have utilised walkie-talkies and sound-based and other media technologies to explore issues around urban encounters with strangers that promote reflection on ideas and experiences of otherness and difference (see Wilken)—issues that are also implicit in the two works examined. In relation to environmental awareness, their work—as well as Pettman’s calls for greater sonic intimacy—brings renewed urgency to Georges Perec’s encouragement to “question the habitual” and to account for, and listen carefully to, “the common, the ordinary, the infraordinary, the background noise” (Perec “Approaches” 210).Walkie-talkies, for Raaf and Lukatoyboy, when reimagined as field recording devices as much as remote transmission technologies, thus “allow new forms of listening, which in turn afford new forms of being together” (Pettman 92), new forms of being in the world, and new forms of sonic intimacy. Both these artworks engage with, and explore, what’s at stake in a politics and ethics of listening. Pettman prompts us, as urban dweller-wanderers, to think about how we might “attend to the act of listening itself, rather than to a specific sound” (Pettman 1). His questioning, as this article has explored, is answered by the works from Raaf and Lukatoyboy in effective style and technique, setting up opportunities for aural attentiveness and experiential learning. However, it is up to us whether we are prepared to listen carefully and to open ourselves to such intimate sonic contact with others and with the environments in which we live.ReferencesAnon. “Die Welt als Labyrinth.” Internationale Situationiste 4 (Jan. 1960).

Mobile canvassing is the use of GPS-enabled smartphones to mediate a two-sided real-time interaction between itinerant actors in a meso-area—that is, the area beyond our ability to actually see another actor but not beyond a distance that can be traversed in a few minutes. The article develops the idea of the smartphone as a “meso-scope” (e.g., a device that gives us an overview of the activities, services, and possibilities that are in our proximate, but also somewhat distant, vicinity). The article examines the need for symmetrical criticality (the development of a critical mass on both sides of the interaction) in this development. Further, the article considers the use of mobile canvassing apps to facilitate the development of autonomous vehicles.","",""
"2019","Metrics, locations, and lift: mobile location analytics and the production of second-order geodemographics","ABSTRACT This article examines the relationship between location data and geodemographic knowledge by focusing on the role of the third-party mobile location analytics companies that passively capture location data from mobile advertising exchanges to develop new approaches to audience measurement. It argues that in addition to segmentation, a key objective is to calculate the performativity of algorithmically targeted advertising by measuring its capacity to drive foot traffic to particular locations. This is known as measuring audience ‘lift’ and reveals how the value of location data depends on how metrics can be created to prove their ability to influence behaviour. ‘Second-order geodemographics’ is proposed as a concept for theorizing the relationship between location-based classification and measurement and is grounded in a case study of one company to illustrate the ecosystem of mobile location analytics.","",""

The objective of the paper was to examine whether mobile phone ownership facilitates the work of some micro-entrepreneurs and constrains the work of others. In addition, the paper examines the situation of those who were exploiting the ‘spillover efficiencies’ of mobile telephony by borrowing (sometimes for pay) the phones of others. The findings of this study suggest that the early adopters reap efficiency benefits while those who lag behind have a weaker position. The paper also examines examples of some small-scale ‘sideline’ activities enabled by the mobile phone, e.g., phone owners selling air-time to non-owners. At the same time, the affordances of the device threatened the core of other small-scale entrepreneurs.","",""
"2019","Gender inequality in mobile technology access: the role of economic and social development","ABSTRACT Digital inequality is a burgeoning field of study across disciplines, yet few papers address categorical digital inequality in cross-national samples. Using the only available cross-national data on access to Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) disaggregated by gender from the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), I add to existing literature by examining factors associated with women’s unequal access to mobile phones across 51 countries. The largest of such samples, the ITU data demonstrates that the type and levels of gender inequality in mobile phone use are not consistent throughout countries. In fact, the distribution is quite variable, from incorporating a small-sample of nations where women have marginally higher access, to sub-samples close to parity, to a larger sub-sample where women are at a substantial disadvantage. Using Quantile Regression Methods to assess these variations, I test how major gender and international development theories inform inequality patterns. My findings suggest that women’s wellbeing, as measured by their access to modern contraception (i.e., reproductive autonomy), overwhelmingly promotes women’s relative access to mobile phones, regardless of preexisting levels of access. Other perspectives like the growth imperative and world polity theory show some staggered associations along the distribution that remain substantively inconclusive.","",""

Based on 47 semi-structured interviews and focus groups with youth aged 12-22 from 2016-2017, this study finds that decaying levels of trust in the medium of telephony has resulted in distinctions in hierarchies of intimacy and functionality. Youth expressed both high levels trust and distrust in traditional telephone calling in relation to impromptu calling. Unknown impromptu calls were associated with telemarketers, creating high levels of distrust in the medium of telephony. Impromptu calls from known contacts indicated a level of urgency and seriousness. Informants revealed complex system of norms in relation to impromptu and planned telephony calling from known callers, expressing specific temporal and spatial expectations for both short and long calls.","",""
"2019","GEOLOCATION: LOCATING TRUST IN DIGITAL PLATFORMS AND ECONOMIES","Digital location—or geolocation—is a fixture of digital platforms and economies, figuring as an organizational logic for content and user experience (e.g., map-based interfaces), native technical affordance (e.g., locational functionalities of GPS-enabled smartphones), and core enabling agent behind the rise of ‘disruptive’ platform enterprises (e.g., Uber, Deliveroo, and Waze all rely on geolocation for service delivery). Despite its inextricability from contemporary media, data productions, and digital practices, geolocation’s role in fostering mis/trust in digital systems has to date been unaddressed. The papers in this panel identify and theorize the ways in which geolocation functions as simultaneously a key ‘technology of trust’ (sociotechnical agent through which mis/trust is bred and/or secured in digital ecosystems), and a social relation of trustworthiness in digital platforms and economies, exploring the role geolocation plays form the perspectives of both securing trust and breeding mistrust in digital systems.","",""
"2019","PERCEPTIONS OF DARKNESS: MOBILE MEDIA AND THE EMBODIMENT OF RISK AND SAFETY IN THE URBAN NIGHT","This paper explores the embodied experience of smartphone users in urban darkness, and considers how the geo-locative and network functionality of mobile media impacts upon the perception of safety and risk at night. City spaces at nighttime are often perceived as less safe, and the habitual trust we place in familiar strangers during the day can become imbued with caution, suspicion and fear. Much of the research in this area neglects the impact of both the networked infrastructure of the city – what de Souza e Silva and Sutko (2009) term “net-local space” – and the place of mobile media in people’s nighttime practices and their experience and perception of the urban dark. This paper draws on original ethnographic data collected in Perth and Melbourne from 2015-2017 to examine how mobile devices as both communicative and location-aware interfaces are used to provide women with a perceived or ‘felt’ sense of bodily safety and security, and the potential implications this has on users’ pedestrian traversal of the urban dark. Throughout the paper, our conceptual and ethnographic approach is informed by Merleau-Ponty’s (1945) work on habituation and proprioception, Ihde’s (1993) postphenomenological take on the cultural specificity of the body-technology relation, and Weiss’s (1999) feminist adaptation of the term intercorporeality. The theme of “trust” runs as a thread through this paper, as we unpack the mistrust city dwellers have of the urban dark and how mobile media perceptually ameliorates this embodied sense of risk by extending users communicative reach via location-aware interfaces.","",""

In the wake of events such as the London bombings of 2005, user-generated content bureaux and hubs were established by major media organizations from the British Broadcasting Corporation and CNN to Al Jazeera while new software and hardware was developed. The potential for covering virtually any news development from at least one of the world’s seven billion mobile phones suggested a whole new phase of broadcast journalism was imminent. This study of news bulletins by three United Kingdom-based broadcasters – Channel 4, the BBC and ITV – establishes a new methodology for the identification of mobile phone content in broadcasting. It also finds that a decade later, mobile phone footage has not lived up to its early potential. ","",""

A cross-national sample of participants ( n = 1156) completed an online study, which included self-report measures as well as a newly developed instrument (Positioning Others and Devices [POD]) assessing the closeness to technical devices and social actors. Results showed the smartphone to be the closest device. Furthermore, structural equation modeling lent support for the theoretical model indicating that trust and preoccupation mediate the relationship between closeness to the smartphone and stress and coping. Findings support the concept of companionship as a fruitful approach to explain smartphone-related behaviors. ","",""
"2019","From hybrid space to dislocated space: Mobile virtual reality and a third stage of mobile media theory"," Research in the field of mobile communication studies (MCS) has generally moved away from focusing on how mobile phones distract users from their physical environment to considering how the experience of space and place can be enhanced by locative smartphone applications. This article argues that trajectory may be complicated by the emergence of a new type of mobile technology: mobile virtual reality (MVR). While an increasing number of handsets are specifically developed with MVR in mind, there is little to no research that situates this phenomenon within the continuum of MCS. The intention of this paper is accordingly twofold. First, the article conceptualizes MVR as a connective tissue between the two sequential tropes of MCS: physical distraction and spatial enhancement. Second, the article introduces the concept of ‘dislocated space’ as a way of understanding the embodied space MVR might configure. ","",""
"2019","The network is not the territory: On capturing mobile media"," Cellular mobile networks, in which devices constantly relay their location and their movements, are formed by the motion of end devices in relation to the position of radio towers. As a matter of principle, it is this motion that allows the location of devices to be identified within the network. The article argues that the emergence of mobile media based on cellular triangulation has introduced an ontology in which, by technical necessity, the position of every object is constantly registered and objects that do not have an address do not exist. The location and movement of all participants are, at all times, a known technical variable. With Xeros PARC’s “ubiquitous computing” as a reference case, the article scrutinizes how movement triggers the process that registers the locations of mobile phones or smartphones, a development it situates against the cybernetic imagination of determining the location and the movement of an object at the same time.

This paper explores parent perceptions and attitudes toward two mobile interventions (Text4baby and Univision Contigo) designed to support parents’ engagement with their young children as a way of reducing the language gap and improving child outcomes. We conducted eight focus groups with parents who were users of either service. Using general inductive analysis of the transcript data, we found that parents enrolled in the Text4baby service were relatively unaware of the video text messages and almost never clicked the links. Univision Contigo users, on the other hand, more frequently recalled seeing videos encouraging parent–child interaction and particularly liked that these videos came as multimedia messages (MMS). We interpret findings through a social cognitive theory lens and provide recommendations for incorporating video into parent-targeted mobile interventions. ","",""

Extending well beyond use as an air-conditioning tool, the hand-fan has evolved across centuries and cultures to become a portable screen, a game console, an artistic medium, and an elaborate communication device. Drawing on the scholarly, literary, and art history of hand-fans in North Asian and European contexts, this paper excavates a deep history of hand-fans and connects them to contemporary mobile communication devices. This research develops two key aspects of the hand-fan as a communicative apparatus: first, the fan as an optical image surface to store and transmit information, constituting the earliest portable screen, and second, the fan as a haptic and gestural object from which distinct vernaculars arise. This paper maps a radical new trajectory in how we conceptualise the hand-fan in history and the mobile phone in the present. ","",""
"2019","Two-way street: How smartphones and the social web impact the traveller’s liminal gaze"," Travellers have long inhabited a liminal position between home and away. Now they also have a bridging foot in cyberspace, as Internet-enabled smartphones mediate their travel experience. Social-web-assisted mobility means that gazing down at a smartphone screen can either enhance or hamper a traveller’s movement through a destination and their interaction with place and its inhabitants, either distancing them from local people or offering new means to connect with hosts and enhance the travel experience. An Internet-linked smartphone is like a portal through which the traveller can gaze into different directions. Further, it is not just a question of which direction they choose; the choice will impact on the gazer and the performance of the gaze, potentially compromising attempts to view a place through independent eyes as the traveller’s imaginings of the foreign sphere are influenced by the social web. This paper reviews the literature on how travellers use the Internet before, during, and after a trip, and suggests the concept of the liminal gaze—in which an individual chooses between different directions to look at and different spheres to focus on—as a tool to examine smartphone-mediated interaction between people, and between people and place.

"2019","Portables, luggables, and transportables: Historicizing the imagined affordances of mobile computing"," This article contributes to the history of “mobile media beyond mobile phones” by accounting for genres of portable computing (or “portables”) that emerged in the late 1980s. Though largely overlooked by historians of technology, these mobile, less-than-mobile, and relatively immobile devices helped shape the social and cultural uses of contemporary mobile communication. I argue that the technological capabilities of portables altered users’ expectations for how and where computers could be incorporated into daily life, be it near bodies, on hand, or at one’s fingertips. While the market for bulky portables dwindled by the late 1990s, as laptops and cell phones became more ubiquitous, these consumer electronics are nonetheless useful today for understanding the perpetual role of materiality and embodiment in how we conceive of the imagined affordances of mobile communication technologies.

The focus of this article is on the fluctuating fortunes of one U.S. company: Skyhook Wireless. The company was founded in 2003 with the explicit aim of exploring and developing systems that responded to a very specific communication infrastructure related challenge: how to calculate location positioning from Wi-Fi signals rather than from cellular towers or by using GPS? In this article, I detail the technical means by which they achieved this, and examine how the strength of Skyhook’s position in the field of location positioning and analysis became a key factor driving Google’s highly contentious Street View program for extracting and recording Wi-Fi access point and payload data. Through this analysis of Skyhook Wireless and its technical achievements, this article aims to contribute valuable new knowledge to our understanding of the location-related operations of mobile devices; the infrastructures associated with these operations; and the businesses that have emerged around, draw on, contribute to, and have come to dominate, these infrastructural systems.

"2019","Accumulating phones: Aid and adaptation in phone access for the urban poor"," This study draws on participant observation and interviews with low-income adults in Chicago to show how the poor stay connected to phone service and mobile Internet through the possession of multiple phones, including those subsidized by government aid. The “accumulation” of phones by individuals is widely observed, though underexplored in scholarship. Popular media coverage in the US frames the possession of multiple phones by people in poverty as criminal or excessive. In contrast, this study identifies three functions for phone accumulation as a strategy for maintaining phone access: to back up other phones, to build up capacities across phones, and to share phones with others in need. Each function responds to struggles unique for the urban poor as mobile technology advances and public phone access declines. Extra phones insure against regular disconnections due to loss and theft of devices and limits on subsidized service. Active service on one device combines with Internet functionality on another to approximate a single, high-end device and service plan. Subsidized phones help overcome the hesitation that poor people feel in lending out their devices to others in need. Accumulation thus contributes to the goal of securing reliable phone access for low-income Americans. There are limits to accumulation as a strategy for maintaining access, which result from the prevalence of inferior hardware, limited service plans, and lack of trust among strangers. Telecommunications policies should adapt to the needs of low-income phone users with accumulation in mind. The article concludes with recommendations for adapting policy to the needs of low-income phone users. ","",""

"2019","Understanding women’s mobile phone use in rural Kenya: An affordance-based approach"," Increases in mobile phone ownership and Internet access throughout Africa continue to motivate initiatives to use information and communication technologies (ICTs)—in particular, mobile phones—to address long-standing socioeconomic problems in the “developing world.” While it is generally recognized that mobile phones may help to address these problems by providing pertinent information, less widely known is exactly how (and if) a handset’s human–computer interface—that is, its software and hardware design—supports this form of communication. The concept of “affordances” has long been used to answer such questions. In this paper, we use Hartson’s definition of affordances to qualitatively investigate rural Kenyan women’s interactions with their mobile phones. Our detailed analysis provides empirically grounded answers to questions about the cognitive, physical, and sensory affordances of handsets used in our field sites and how they support and/or constrain mobile communication. We then discuss the implications of our findings: in particular, how this affordance-based approach draws attention to mobile phones’ design features and to the context in which they and their users are embedded—a focus which suggests new design and research opportunities in mobile communication.

"2019","The “flashpacker” and the “unplugger”: Cell phone (dis)connection and the backpacking experience"," The cellular phone’s unique characteristics—its mobility, its portability, and the constant availability that it enables—challenge the feasibility of solitary spaces in individuals’ lives. These spaces—for example, cultural “timeouts,” leisure, and backpacking travel—necessitate a certain degree of cutting oneself off from one’s daily routine, which is threatened by the constant presence of one’s cell phone. This study examines the role of cell phones in young adults’ backpacking experience. Using questionnaires ( n = 105) and in-depth interviews ( n = 14) with “cellular backpackers” and “cell-free backpackers,” the study shows how an attempt is made to reduce availability and attain maximum control over the scope and timing of communication, using a variety of avoidance practices. Those practices derived from the personal narrative structure of the backpacking experience as an escapist, “dropping-off-the-radar” one, and as an attempt to preserve the trek as a space that is cut off and isolated from a technology-saturated environment. In addition, it was found that backpackers care a great deal about their parents’ position when making their decisions whether to take their phones with them and when to use them. In this regard, the article continues the discussion on the metaphor of the cell phone as a transitional object, applying this concept from childhood and adolescence to the twenties and thirties, the ages of most backpackers. On another level, the article addresses the mobile phone’s unique function as an antistatus symbol, in a way that contradicts its function in an ordinary context. ","",""

We begin by pointing out that mobile phone/smartphone research has dominated MMCS as a field. That focus makes sense, but it runs the risk of MMCS essentially turning into “smartphone studies,” which we argue would limit our impact. To make that case, we identify a few examples of the types of oft-ignored technologies that could add to the depth and breadth of MMCS research (e.g., RFID [radio frequency identification] tags, the Walkman, barcodes). We then summarize the articles in this special issue to categorize the breadth of this research, which ranges from analyses of mobile fans to autonomous cars to mobile infrastructure. ","",""

Formerly accessible only to military and cultural elites, the smartphone was now available to virtually all. In 2020, just six years later, smartphones are commonplace, used by every class and walk of life. The introduction and mainstreaming of the smartphone in Myanmar coincided with the transition from military dictatorship to quasi democracy; from heavy censorship to relative liberalisation of culture and the media. This ongoing transition continues to be a painful one for many in Myanmar. The 3G network and smartphone ownership enable ordinary people to connect with one another and the Internet—or, more specifically, Facebook, which is ‘the Internet in Myanmar’ (Nyi Nyi Kyaw, “Facebooking in Myanmar” 1). However, the smartphone and what it enables has also been identified as a new instrument of control, with mass-texting campaigns and a toxic social media culture implicated in recent concerted violence against ethnic and minority religious groups such as the Muslim Rohingya. In this article, I consider the political and cultural conversations enabled by the smartphone in the period following its introduction. The smartphone can be read as an anomalous, hybrid, and foreign object, with connotations of fluidity and connection, all dangerous qualities in Myanmar, a conservative, former pariah state. Drawing from Sarah Ahmed’s article, “The Skin of Community: Affect and Boundary Formation” (2005), as well as recent scholarship on mixed race identification, I examine deeply held fears around ethnic belonging, cultural adeptness, and hybridity, arguing that these anxieties can be traced back to the early days of colonisation. During military rule, Myanmar’s people were underserved by their telecommunications network. Domestic landlines were rare. Phone calls were generally made from market stalls. SIM cards cost up to US$3000, out of reach of most. The lack of robust services was reflected by remarkably low connection rates; 2012 mobile connections numbered at a mere 5.4 million while fixed lines were just 0.6 million for a population of over 50 million people (Kyaw Myint, “Myanmar Country Report” 232). In 2013, the Norwegian telecommunications company Telenor and the Qatari company Ooredoo won licenses to establish network infrastructure for Myanmar. In August 2014, with network construction still underway, the two companies released SIM cards costing a mere 1500 kyats or US$1.50 each. At the time, 1500 kyats bought two plates of fried rice at a Yangon street food stall, making these SIM cards easily affordable. Chinese-manufactured handsets quickly became available (Fink 44). Suddenly, Myanmar was connected. By early 2019, there were 105 smart connections per 100 people in the country (Kyaw Myint, “Facebooking in Myanmar” 1). While this number doesn’t count multiple connections within a single household or the realities of unreliable network coverage in rural areas, the story of the smartphone in Myanmar would seem to be about democratisation and a new form of national unity. But after half a century of military rule, what did national unity mean? Myanmar’s full name is The Republic of the Union of Myanmar. Since independence in 1948 the country has been torn by internal civil wars as political factions and ethnic groups fought for sovereignty. What actually bound the Union of Myanmar together? And where might discussions of such painful and politically sensitive questions take place? Advertising as a Space for Crafting Conversations of National Identity In a report on Asian Advertising, Mila Chaplin of Mango Marketing, the agency charged with launching the Telenor brand in Myanmar, observes thatin many markets, brands talk about self-expression and invite consumers to get involved in co-creation … . In Myanmar what the consumers really need is some guidance on how to start crafting [national] …] identities. (4) Advertising has often been used as a means of retelling national stories and myths as well as a site for the collective imaginary to be visualised (Sawchuk 43). However, Myanmar was unlike other territories. Decades of heavy censorship and isolationist diplomatic policies, euphemistically named the “closed” period, left the country without a functional, independent national media. Television programming, including advertising, was regulated and national identity was an edict, not a shared conversation. With the advent of democratic reforms in 2011, ushering in a new “open” period, paid advertising campaigns in 2015 offered an in-between space on nationally broadcast television where it was possible to discuss questions of national identity from a perspective other than that of the government (Chaplin). Such conversations had to be conducted sensitively, given that the military were still the true national power. However, an advertising campaign that launched a new way to physically connect the country almost inevitably had to address questions of shared identity as well as clearly set out how the alien technology might shape the nation. To do so required addressing the country’s painful colonial past. The Hybrid in National Narratives of Myanmar  In contemporary Myanmar, the smartphone is synonymous with military and government power (mobile Internet traffic in northern Rakhine state, for example, has been shut down since February 2020, ostensibly for security). Yet, when the phone was first introduced in 2014, it too was seen as a “foreign” object, one that had the potential to connect but also “instantiated ... a worldly sensibility that national borders and boundaries are potentially breached, and thus in need of protection from ‘others’” (Sawchuk 45). This fear of foreign influence coupled with the yearning for connection with the outside world is summed up by Ei Phyu Aung, editor of Myanmar’s weekly entertainment journal Sunday:it’s like dust coming in when you open the window. We can’t keep the window closed forever so we have to find a way to minimize the dust and maximize the sunlight. (Thin)Ei Phyu Aung wishes to enjoy the benefits of connecting with the world outside (sunlight) yet also fears cultural pollution (dust) linked with exploitation, an anxiety that reflects Myanmar’s approach to belonging and citizenship, shaped by its colonial history. Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, was colonised in stages. Upper Burma was annexed by British forces in 1886, completing a process of colonisation begun with the first Anglo-Burmese wars of 1823. The royal family was exiled from the pre-colonial capital at Mandalay and the new colony ruled as a province of India. Indian migration, particularly to Rangoon, was encouraged and these highly visible, economic migrants became the symbol of colonialism, of foreign exploitation. A deep mistrust of foreign influence, based on the experiences of colonialism, continued to shape the nation decades after independence. The 1962 military coup was followed by the expulsion of “foreigners” in 1964 as the country pursued a policy of isolation. In 1982, the government introduced a new citizenship law “driven as much by a political campaign to exclude the ‘alien’ from the country as to define the ‘citizen’” (Transnational Institute 10). This law only recognises ethnicities who can prove their presence prior to 1824, the year British forces first annexed lower Burma. As a consequence of the 1982 laws, groups such as the Rohingya are considered “Bengali migrants” and those descended from Chinese and Indian diasporas are excluded from full citizenship. In 1989, the ruling State Law and Order Council (SLORC) changed the country’s name to Myanmar and the anglicised Rangoon to Yangon. Thus the story of Burma/Myanmar since independence is of a nation that continues to be traumatised by colonisation. Given the mistrust of the foreign, how then might an anomalous hybrid object like the smartphone be received?  Smartphone Advertising and National Narratives  Television advertising is well suited to creating a sense of national identity; commercials are usually broadcast repeatedly. As Sarah Ahmed argues, it is through “the repetition of norms” that “boundary, fixity and surface of ‘social forms’ such as the ‘nation’ are produced” (Cultural Politics of Emotion 12). In her article, “The Skin of Community”, Ahmed describes these boundaries as a kind of “skin”, where difference is recognised through affective responses, such as disgust or delight. These responses and their associated meanings delineate a kind of belonging through shared experience, akin to shared identity—a shared skin. Telenor’s first advertisement in this space, Breakfast, draws from the metaphor of skin as boundary, connecting a family meal with cultural myths and social history.   Breakfast was developed by Mango Marketing Services in 2014 and Telenor launched its initial television campaign in 2015, consisting of several advertisements brought to market in the period between 2014 and 2016 (Hicks, Mumbrella). The commercial runs for 60 seconds, a relatively expensive long format typical of a broadly-disseminated launch where the advertiser aims to introduce something new to the public and subsequently, build market share.  Opening with images of Yangon, the country’s commercial centre, Breakfast tells the story of May, a newlywed, and the first time she cooks for her in-laws. May’s mother-in-law requests a famous breakfast dish, nanjithoke, typical of Mandalay, where May is from. But May does not know how to cook the dish and blunders around the kitchen as her in-laws wait. Sensing her distress, her husband suggests that she use his smartphone to call her mother in Mandalay and get the recipe. May’s dish is approved by her in-laws as tasty and authentic.  In Breakfast, the phone is used as if it were a landline, its mobility not wholly relevant. The locations of both parties, May and her mother, are fixed and predictable and the phone in both instances is closely associated with connecting homes and more significantly, two important cities, Yangon and Mandalay. The advertisement presents the smartphone as solving the systemic problem of unreliable telecommunication in Myanmar as well as its lack of access; there is a final message reassuring the user that calls are affordable. That the smartphone is shown as part of everyday life presents it as a force for stability, a service that locates and connects fixed places. This in itself represented a profound shift for most people, in light of the fact that such communication was not possible during the “closed” period. Thus, this foreign, hybrid object enables what was not previously possible.While the benefits of the smartphone and network may be clear, the subtext of the advertisement nonetheless points to fears of foreign influence and the dangers of introducing an alien object into everyday life. To mitigate these concerns, May is presented in the traditional htamein or longyi and aingi, a long wrap skirt and fitted blouse with sleeves that end on the forearm, rather than western jeans and a t-shirt—both types of clothing are commonly worn in Yangon. Her hair is pulled back and pinned up, her makeup is subtle. She inhabits domestic space and does not have her own smartphone. In fact, it does not even occur to her to call her mother for the nanjithoke recipe, which is slightly surprising given her mother has a smartphone and knows how to use it, indicating that she has probably had it for some time. This subtext reflects conservative power structures in which elder generations pass knowledge down to new generations.  The choice to connect Yangon and Mandalay through the local noodle dish is also significant.  Breakfast makes manifest historic meanings associated with “place” a mapping of the “hidden” and “already given cultural order” (Mazzarella 24-25).  As discussed earlier, Yangon was the colonial capital, known as an Indian city, but Mandalay as the pre-colonial capital remains a seat of cultural sophistication, where the highest form of the Myanmar language is spoken. The choice to connect Myanmar with the phone, as foreign object and bearer of anomaly, should be read as a repudiation of its bordered past, when foreigners (or kalaa, a derogatory term), including European ambassadors, were kept separate from the royal family by walls and a moat. The commercial, too, strongly evokes a shared skin of community through the evocation of the senses, from Yangon’s heat to the anticipation of a tasty and authentic meal, as well as through the visualisation of kinship and inheritance. In one extremely slow dissolve, May and her mother share the screen simultaneously, compressed in space as well as time. It is as if their skin of kinship is stretched before us. As the viewer’s eye passes from left to right across the screen, May’s present, past, and future is visible. She too will become the mother, at the other end the phone, offering advice to her daughter. There is suggestion of a continuum, of an “immemorial past” (Anderson 12), part of a national narrative that connects to pre-colonial Mandalay and the cultural systems that precede it, to the modern city of Yangon, still the commercial of contemporary Myanmar.At first glance, Breakfast seems to position the phone as an object that will enable Myanmar to stay Myanmarese through the strengthening of family connections. The commercial also strives to allay fears of the phone as a source of cultural pollution or exploitation by demonstrating its adoption among the older generation and inserting it into a fantasy of an uninterrupted culture, harking back to pre-colonial Burma. Yet, while the phone is represented in anodyne terms, it is only because it is an anomalous and hybrid object that such connections are possible. Furthermore, the smartphone in this representation also enables a connection between pre-colonial Mandalay to contemporary Yangon, breaching painful associations with both annexation and colonisation. In contrast to the advertisement Breakfast, Telenor’s information video, Why we should use SIM slot 1, does not attempt to disassociate the smartphone with foreignness. Instead, it capitalises on the smartphone as a hybrid object whose benefit is that it can be adapted to specific needs, including faster Internet speeds to enable connection to external video channel, such as YouTube.The video features young women dressed in foreign jeans and short-sleeved tops, wearing Western-style make-up, including sparkly nail polish. Both women appear to own their smartphones, and one is technically adept, delivering the complex information about which slot to use to facilitate the fastest Internet connection. Neither has difficulty with negotiating the complicated ports beneath the back cover of their smartphone to make the necessary change. They are happy to alter their phones to suit their own needs.  These women are perhaps more closely in line with other markets, where the younger generation “do not expect to follow their parents’ practice” (Horst and Miller 9). This is in direct contrast to Breakfast, where May’s middle-aged mother has adopted the phone and, in keeping with conservative power structures, is already well-versed in its uses and capabilities. While this video was never intended to be seen by the audience for Breakfast, there remain parallels in the way the smartphone enables a connection within the control of its user: like May’s mother, both women in Breakfast are able to control or mitigate the foreign material through the manipulation of their device, moving from 2G to H+. They can opt in or out of the H+ network.This article has explored discussions of national identity prompted by the introduction of the smartphone to Myanmar during a moment of unprecedented political change. Breakfast, the advertisement that launched the smartphone into the country, offered a space in which the people of Myanmar were able to address questions of national identity and gently probe the discomfort of the colonial past. The communication video Why we should use SIM slot 1 reflects Myanmar’s burgeoning sense of connection with the region and presents the smartphone as customisable. The smartphone in advertising is thus positioned as a means for connecting the generations and continuing the immemorial past of the Burmese nation into the future, as well as a hybrid object capable of linking the country to the outside world. Further directions for this enquiry might consider how the discussion of Myanmar’s national identity continues to be addressed and exploited through advertising in Myanmar, and how the smartphone’s hybridity is used to counteract established national narratives in other spaces.References Adas, Michael.

"2020","Smartphone addiction: psychological and social factors predict the use and abuse of a social mobile application","ABSTRACT As smartphones have been revealed as hosts for addictive behaviors, many studies have focused on the relationship between psychological factors and the generalized use of smartphones without considering the wide range of activities involved. By collecting data from a large sample, this study investigated the relative contribution of both psychological and social factors in predicting different usage levels of the social mobile application (app) LINE, which is very popular in Asia. The results indicated that subjective norms and social identity predicted positively for individuals in the addictive use cluster, while self-esteem and social skills predicted negatively. The predictive power of self-esteem and life satisfaction was positive for the heavy use of LINE with no serious problems while that of subjective norms was negative. No single factor was associative with the ordinary use. These results highlight that people deficient in self-esteem and social skills, but eager to obtain others’ approval and a sense of belonging, are more inclined to develop an addiction to this app. Those who use LINE heavily with no serious problems are highly satisfied with life; they do not mind acting in accordance with others’ expectations, because they have high self-esteem. Ordinary users are not influenced psychologically or socially. This research not only underscores the importance of considering a specific form of application to understand the smartphone addiction, but also advances the knowledge of social contributors in this issue.","",""

Findings from the interviews (n = 31) indicate that healthcare staff used their personal mobile phones for patient referral because they could quickly reach specific personal contacts in the hospitals and provide nuanced contextual information that was not possible to communicate via the formal paper-based communication system. The practices capture the nascent quasi-institutionalization of mobile-assisted referrals, and provide insights into how existing organizational rules, cultural, norms, resources, and social relationships shape, and are likely to be shaped by mobile communication.","",""
"2020","The socio-spatial installed base: Ride-hailing applications, parking associations, and precarity in tuk tuk driving in Phnom Penh, Cambodia","Abstract In this paper I present an infrastructural analysis of the changing tuk tuk driving sector in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. I argue that drivers’ informal, long-standing parking associations, located at well-defined parking spots and based on kinship relations, act as the socio-spatial installed base of Phnom Penh’s tuk tuk infrastructure. I show that two recent infrastructural changes – the increased popularity of ride-hailing applications and “Indian-style” tuk tuks – have made traditional tuk tuk driving more precarious. I show how the parking associations help traditional drivers manage the negative consequences of infrastructural changes. My analysis indicates that parking associations with their kinship bonds, experience, and geographical positioning put established drivers in a privileged position in relation to new independent drivers using digital tools. In effect, while long-standing associations can be effective tools of subversion to platform economies, they also produce barriers to inclusive solidarity.","",""

"2020","PATCHWORKED MEDIA: MOBILE DEVICES AND CREATIVE PRACTICE IN CAPE TOWN,   SOUTH AFRICA","There has been a recurring narrative in research that revolves around mobile technologies and society, particularly in relation to Africa: that these technologies have the potential to reconfigure and revolutionise the development trajectories of entire countries (Donner &amp; Locke, 2019). But if these narratives are to be the case, then, indeed, the role that mobile devices can play in production (in this case of art, media, and design) is going to have to be something that allows people in the global South to earn a living. This paper presents an exploration of the creative practices, with a focus on mobile creative practices, of a cohort of Extended Curriculum Program (ECP) Visual Design students from a university in Cape Town, South Africa (2014). All of these students came from low-income, resource constrained contexts in the townships that surround Cape Town. In questioning whether mobile technologies can help young South African creatives forge careers or attain resources that could help them do so, the role of mobile technologies is complicated. While these devices offer new emerging creative affordances, and in some cases, can offer means to generate income, the material reality is a different story. I conclude by arguing that instead of these devices offering access to a global network, they, at best, provide the means for young creatives, such as those featured in this study, to a forge a media patchwork.","",""
"2020","m-Reading: Fiction reading from mobile phones","Mobile phones are reportedly the most rapidly expanding e-reading device worldwide. However, the embodied, cognitive and affective implications of smartphone-supported fiction reading for leisure (m-reading) have yet to be investigated empirically. Revisiting the theoretical work of digitization scholar Anne Mangen, we argue that the digital reading experience is not only contingent on patterns of embodied reader–device interaction (Mangen, 2008 and later) but also embedded in the immediate environment and broader situational context. We call this the situation constraint. Its application to Mangen’s general framework enables us to identify four novel research areas, wherein m-reading should be investigated with regard to its unique affordances. The areas are reader–device affectivity, situated embodiment, attention training and long-term immersion.","",""

Although there is evidence for the short-term effect of academic-media multitasking on academic achievement, support for its long-term effect is lacking. Therefore, we investigated the long-term relationship between academic-media multitasking and academic achievement, and the possible underlying mechanism of academic attention problems using a three-wave longitudinal study, with time intervals of 3–4 months, among 1215 adolescents (11–15 years, 52% boys). Although academic-media multitasking and academic achievement were cross-sectionally related, the findings showed neither support for a direct nor indirect long-term relationship between academic-media multitasking and subsequent academic achievement scores. However, academic-media multitasking was associated with an increase in subsequent academic attention problems. This study indicates that concerns regarding the long-term impact of academic-media multitasking on academic achievement need to be qualified. ","",""
"2020","Mobile communication, social presence, and perceived security on public transport"," Mobile phones have become a ubiquitous phenomenon on public transport. However, little attention has been given to the effect of mobile communication on perceived security on public transport. This paper develops a model of social presence and perceived security in order to understand the widespread use of mobile phones on public transport as well as its effects. The first part of the model suggests a mediating role of social presence to understand how perceived security motivates mobile communication. The respective hypotheses are tested with a representative survey ( N = 2,267), and the results support the mediating role of social presence. The second part of the model assumes that social presence is not only a motive to use mobile communication but also helps to improve perceived security. Based on a 2-week mobile experience sampling with 86 participants and 1,264 measurement points, the effect of mobile communication and social presence obtained, as well as individual and situational factors on perceived security were tested. The respective hypotheses were partially supported but also suggest that other coping strategies might be of relevance to fully understand the relationship between mobile communication and situational perceived security. Besides the academic insights, these results suggest that public transport operators should consider expanding mobile phone coverage in their vehicles and stations to improve perceived security and make their services more attractive.

For this study, we employed a general ethnographic methodology and, in particular, a workshop based on different artistic techniques that encouraged the young people involved to become active participants, committed from the start in the generation of the material to be used for the analysis of their daily practices. This approach emerged from the recognition of the importance for these young people to feel included and connected. Migrant adolescents take refuge in their mobile devices to participate in the youth microculture, both locally and globally. In addition, they are able to access different social networks that allow them to play out the personas they wish to adopt. Finally, we recognise the importance of digital media in allowing them to maintain close and affective relationships with their relatives, fellow citizens, and communities in their country of origin.

"2020","Tethered women, mobile men: Gendered mobilities of typewriting"," In recent years, scholars have turned their attention to the nexus of mobility, space, and communication practices. At the same time, historians of information and communication technologies (ICTs) have amassed a large body of literature on the history of typewriters and their contribution to gendered office work. To date, however, these two strains have yet to converge. This article thus examines intersections between typewriting, gender, and mobility, focusing on the case of portable typewriters to investigate users’ “differential” mobilities before World War II in the United States. In this regard, it reconceives of typewriters as fluid historical objects defined significantly by their social contexts. It calls upon scholars to expand their characterizations of typing beyond thinking only of it as an immobile, desk-based practice and as “women’s work.” Instead, it draws attention to itinerant male typists as an early class of portable typewriter users who could (and were encouraged to) travel with a typewriter in tow. More broadly, the article also contributes to understandings of mobile media histories beyond mobile phones by demonstrating similar concerns related to portability, usability, and ergonomics in the early 20th century.

"2020","Decolonizing mobile media: Mobile Internet appropriation in a Guaraní community"," The Internet has been a valuable resource for many indigenous groups as a vehicle for self-representation. In this paper, we describe how the installation of a Wi-Fi signal in a Guaraní community in Greater Buenos Aires—as part of the community leader’s decolonizing media projects—generated issues within the community. While much indigenous media research concerns the politics of cultural representation, we consider the politics of everyday, intracommunity mobile communication practices. Firstly, our findings show how the choice of communication medium can become a political issue. An upsurge in mobile-mediated communication within the community contributed to the decline of face-to-face deliberations, which were the mainstay of communal sharing arrangements and which held a central position in understandings of Guaraní culture. Secondly, our findings show how discrepancies between users’ communication preferences and the readily available mobile media services can generate a use barrier by deterring users from obtaining the skills needed to effectively appropriate or transform mobile media services. Familiarity with a few mainstream social media apps not only reinforced imaginaries of the Internet as a nonindigenous space but also generated set ideas of what the Internet supports in terms of communicative form—social networking—and content type—mainstream media. In the end, the community leader’s decolonizing projects, aimed at using social media for community media dissemination, were not only rejected by community members but also undermined by the dynamics of mobile media practices in the community. We argue that limited mobile technology skills combined with commercially oriented mobile media services can hinder creative and adaptable mobile media practices, and in turn, undermine decolonizing mobile appropriations.

"2021","Embodied Perceptions of Darkness","Introduction The past decade has seen a burgeoning new field titled “night studies” or “darkness studies” (Gwiazdzinski, Maggioli, and Straw). Key theorists Straw, Shaw, Dunn, and Edensor have spearheaded this new field, publishing a recent flurry of books and other scholarly work dedicated to various aspects of the night. Topics range, for instance, from the history of artificial lighting (Shaw), atmospheres of urban light and darkness (Sumartojo, Edensor, and Pink), street music and public space at night (Reia), the experience of eating in the dark (Edensor and Falconer), walking at night (Morris; Dunn), gendered experiences of the city at night (Hardley; Hardley and Richardson “Mobile Media”, “Mistrust”), and women’s solo experiences of the wilderness at night. Contributing to this new field, this article considers some of the embodied ways mobile media have been deployed in the urban night. To date, this topic has not received much attention within the fields of mobile media or night studies. The research presented in this article draws on a qualitative research project conducted in Australia from 2016-2020. The project focussed on participants’ use of mobile media in urban spaces at night and conducted a specific analysis of pertinent gendered differences. Throughout my iterative and longitudinal research process, I engaged various phases of data collection to explore participants’ night-time mobile media practices, as well as to consider how darkness and the night impact networked practices in ways that speak to the postphenomenological concept of multistability (Ihde Postphenomenology and Technoscience). I highlight the empirical findings through a series of participant stories, exploring salient insights into embodied perceptions of darkness and various ways of co-opting mobile media practices in the urban night. Methods: Data Collection, Interpretation, and Representation My research took place in Perth and Melbourne from 2016-2020. A total of 98 individuals, aged 19 to 67 years, participated. Participants came from diverse backgrounds, including urban and rural Australia, Sweden, America, Ethiopia, Italy, Argentina, USA, and England. They were students, teachers, chefs, unemployed, stay-at-home-parents, miners, small business owners, retired, doctors, and government scientists. They identified across the sexuality and gender identity spectrums. My techniques for data collection were grouped into four main phases: (i) an initial survey; (ii) home visits, which included interviews, haptic experiments, observations, and my own situatedness in participants’ homes; (iii) geo-locative tracking and text messaging; and (iv) online follow-up interviews. The study was open to anyone who lived in Perth or Melbourne, was over 18 years old, and used a smartphone. All phases of the data collection were conducted during the day or at night, depending on participant availability. My focus on darkness and the night, in relation to mobile media, evolved over time. The first question regarding mobile media and the night was posed in 2016 during initial data collection, using an online survey to cast a wide net to gather insights on networked functionality afforded by mobile phones and perceptions of safety and risk in urban and domestic space. Participants frequently referred to the differences between day and night. During home visits and face-to-face interviews in 2017, as well as online interviews in 2020, I sought to gain deeper insights into participants’ sensory experiences of darkness and the night. My interpretation and representation of the data adopts a similar approach as vignettes, which are described by Berry in her book on creative practice and mobile media. For Berry, vignettes are a way of “braiding” (xv) accounts of participant experience together. My particular use of this approach has been published in detail elsewhere (Hardley and Richardson “Digital Placemaking”).  Postphenomenology, Multistability, and Mobile Media Throughout this article I frame engagement with mobile media as a particular kind of body-technology relation. As the founder of postphenomenology, Ihde, writes, “technologies transform our experience of the world and our perceptions and interpretations of our world, and we in turn become transformed in this process” (Postphenomenology and Technoscience 44). Ihde adapted phenomenology (from Merleau-Ponty, Husserl, and Heidegger) by shifting away from an essentialist body-subject to non-essentialist contextualisation. As Ihde explains (he uses archery longbows and arrows to make his point), all tools are the “same” in an abstract sense; however, “radically different practices fit differently into various contexts” (Postphenomenology and Technoscience 16). In other words, tools (including mobile media) are never neutral and are always multiple and variable depending on context and practice. All tools are therefore situated and embodied in culturally specific ways. Postphenomenological scholarship can, thus, be said to capture the cultural specificity of all human-technology relations. The following examples help illustrate this defining characteristic of postphenomenology, as distinct from phenomenology. It could be argued that Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenological description of the blind man with his cane is an essentialist notion of what it’s like to experience blindness. On the other hand, Wellner’s postphenomenological description of using a mobile phone describes how the same technology can be used by different people in multiple ways, as people assign different meanings to the technology. This notion is best captured by the term multistability, which suggests each technology has numerous uses, applications and purposes. As Irwin explains, the term multistability—one of Ihde’s central concepts within postphenomenology—conveys the inherent adaptability and mutability of both bodies and media engagement, depending on the context or situatedness of a tool’s use. In the following sections, I first explore embodied perceptions of darkness and the night, and then explore how mobile media have modified participants’ embodied perception of darkness and how it informs their situated awareness of their urban surroundings. In terms of my research, this concerns how mobile media users embody their devices in an array of different ways, especially at night. “Feeling” the Night: Embodied Perceptions of Darkness Darkness, and the night, are not simply about the lack of vision. Indeed, while sensory perception in the dark, such as obscured vision and the heightening of other senses, comes into play, we also encounter the night through an enmeshed cultural relationship of darkness and danger. Shaw describes this relationship in the following way:  darkness has been equated with danger: the night was a time when demons, criminals and others who presented a threat were imagined to be present in the landscape. Darkness was thus imagined as a space in which both real and mythical dangers were present. (“Controlling Darkness” 5)  Chris, a young gay man living in a medium-sized town close to Melbourne, leaned back in his chair, closed his eyes, and laughed when I asked him if he has ever been scared of the dark. He responded:  [Silence] Yeah! I have! Wow, what a funny question. [Laughter] I remember always checking my closet as a child before getting into bed. And the door had to be closed. I could not sleep if the closet door was open.  When asked what he thought might be in the closet at night, he laughed again and shared:  I have no idea. I don’t think I ever thought it was a person, just the unknown. How funny to think about that now—as a gay man I was scared of what might come out of the closet! [Laughter]  Chris’s observation of his habitual childhood behaviour illustrates an embodied cultural imagery of darkness and the role of fear, anxieties and the unknown in the dark. He also spoke of “growing out of” his fantastical fear of the dark as he entered adulthood. This contrasts with what many women in my study described, noting their transition from childhood “fears of the dark” to very real and “felt” experiences of darkness and danger. This opened up a major finding in my research, and uncovered navigational and connectivity strategies often deployed by women in urban spaces at night (Hardley and Richardson “Mistrust”). For instance, Leah (a woman in her late 40s living in Perth), revealed her peripatetic engagement with the (sub)urban night when she described her cycling routes with her 8-year-old daughter. While talking with me via Zoom in 2020, she explained:  I have an electric bike—it’s great. I can zip around the city and I have a kid’s seat on the back for my daughter. Sometimes I feel like a hybrid pedestrian—I can switch quickly between being on the road or the footpath. Recently, my daughter asked why we always take the long way home at night. I had to think quickly to come up with a response because I think she’s too young to know the truth. I told her that parks are often empty at night, so if something happens to us then there will be no one to help. In a way that’s true, but really, it’s because as a woman and a child it’s safer for us to remain on well-lit streets.  Leah’s experience of the city and her mobility at night are distinctly gendered; she reflects on her experience as a “hybrid pedestrian” in relation to what could happen to her and her daughter if they were to ride through the park at night instead of remaining on the well-lit bike path. Overwhelmingly, the men who participated in my study did not share similar experiences or reflections. Introducing the embodiment of darkness and the night, along with associated fears and anxieties, in a general sense sets the atmospheric scene for a postphenomenological analysis of embodied experiences of the urban night and how users co-opt mobile media functionalities to manage their embodied experiences of the dark. Chris and Leah’s stories both suggest how we “feel” at night has important implications for the practical way(s) in which we engage, navigate and curate our experiences of the dark. In the following section, I consider how mobile devices are literally “handled”, particularly by women in the urban context, to mitigate fears and anxieties of the night. I contend that our embodied experience of the urban night is mediated by, and through, our collective and individual fears, anxieties and perceptions of danger in the dark. Co-opting Mobile Media: Multistable Experiences of the Urban Night  Reflecting on his own practices of walking at night, Dunn writes,  walking at night, however, offers something different, having the capacity to alter our ingrained, seemingly natural predispositions towards the urban surroundings, and our perceptions along with it. (9)  Indeed, the night can offer a “capacity to alter”; however, I suggest that it can also reinforce anxieties and fears of the dark (both real and imagined). As such, walking at night can also reinforce “ingrained, seemingly natural predispositions”. Postphenomenology is useful here, as it offers a way to think through practices of what Ihde calls “amplification” and “reduction” of the corporeal schema. Through both actions, mobile media users habituate themselves or take up residence in the urban night by and through their use of smartphone functionalities, as well as their sense of networked connectivity. In the context of this article, the corporeal schema undergoes an amplification and reduction via the co-opting of mobile media, such as an embodied sense of networked connectivity or a tactile prop, to generate a “tele-cocoon” (Habuchi), “shield” (Verhoeff), or “bubble” (Bull Sounding). The corporeal schema can be understood as our lived experience of the world (Merleau-Ponty), whereby our “perceptual reach and bodily boundaries, is always-already extendible through artifacts and technologies” (Hardley and Richardson “Mistrust”). The digital cocoon afforded by mobile media is often gendered and overtly concerned with issues of personal safety and privacy, especially at night. For many women, generating an imagined boundary between the self and others in shared urban spaces is an important function of mobile media. As one Perth participant reflected,  my phone’s a good distraction when I’m alone in a public place, especially at night if I’m waiting for someone. Sometimes guys will come up and try to start a conversation—it’s so annoying. If I focus on my phone, it’s like telling them to leave me alone.  This tactical use of mobile media to carve out one’s own space in crowded social places was especially common among the women I interviewed. Yet, such practices are also deployed by men, albeit for different reasons. In Melbourne, Dane described the strategic use of his mobile phone as both a creative tool of connection and a means of communicating—especially to women at night—that he was non-threatening. As a proud late-adopter of smartphones, he explained to me that his main reason for buying one had been the camera function; he refers to his smartphone as “a camera that rings”. He particularly enjoys taking photos at night, during which time his familiar streets become “moody and strange”. He spends many hours walking in his neighbourhood, capturing shadows and uploading the images to his public Instagram account. Referring to his dark skin and shaved head, he joked, “I’d look great in a line-up” and added:  sometimes I feel a bit self-conscious on the bus or train, particularly late at night, I think maybe I could seem like a threat or something. So, I’ll play a game or chat to friends about my photos via Instagram. I figure it works both ways—I don’t notice anyone and people don’t notice me.  As these participant stories reveal, the personal privacy bubble offered by our mobile devices is co-opted differently. Turning to Ihde’s notion of multistability, these examples can be analysed and understood as mobile technologies’ potential variabilities with multiple outcomes (Ihde Postphenomenology and Technoscience). To explore and explain this further, I consider the following participant story in which Britta, an American living in Melbourne, reflected on her night-time pedestrian practices across two cities, sharing:  at night, in Australia, my phone would be in my bra. In Philadelphia, it would be in my hand. It's totally different because of safety. When at University in the U.S., I would always talk to a friend while walking from one place to the next. It doesn't even cross my mind to do that in Australia. In Philadelphia, I would call one of the girls I lived with and if someone approached me, I could say, """"Oh shit, I'm about to get mugged, this is where I am” and they could call the cops. It's a sense of being on guard. I would never walk using headphones in Philadelphia. In Australia, if I go running at night I listen to music with one earphone in.  In this vignette, Britta has habituated an acute awareness of her corporeal schema. As Wellner suggests, “the world is always a negotiation between humans and their tools, their artifacts, their technology, and their devices” (5). In this context, Britta has an amplified awareness of her situatedness, and uses her mobile phone to listen to music in different ways depending on her geographical location. There is a direct connection to her use of headphones to listen to music and her embodied perception of personal safety at night. Turning to Ihde, this participant story can be explained through the term “non-neutrality”, which describes how “no technology is ‘one thing,’ nor is it incapable of belonging to multiple contexts” (Ihde Technology and Prognostic 47).  Such an example points to the non-neutrality of mobile media, and how “our perception and environment are mediated by the technology” (Wellner 15). This analysis can be extended further to consider the use of headphones (as an extension of the mobile phone) and geographical location in relation to the concept of multistability—that is, the specificity of use. As Irwin writes, “how is it to be an earbudded body in the world? ... Earbuds are non-neutral and they are becoming deeply imbedded in daily life” (81). Indeed, Bull’s influential work on how personal stereos and iPods change users’ experiences of public spaces (Sound Moves) is useful here in understanding the background of what Irwin refers to as “keeping sound in and sound out” (81). It is, according to Irwin, “about privacy and isolation” (81); however, as Britta’s vignette shows, mobile media practices of privacy and isolation in urban spaces can be impacted by geographical location and urban darkness, and are also distinctly gendered. Applying the concept of multistability allows me to consider how, in some instances, mobile phones are often deployed as a proxy Do Not Disturb sign when alone in public (Hardley and Richardson “Mistrust”). While, in other instances, one’s embodied experience of being an earbudded body in the world can increase their perceptual sense of risk based on various factors, such as geographical location. Beyond this, it also speaks to the relational ontology between body and technology and the mutability of perception. In Britta’s example, her corporeal schema in the urban night is amplified by and through her personal and situated embodiment of mobile media use, particularly her decision to use headphones in specific ways depending on her geographical location. In 2017, I conducted a home visit with Dominique, a woman in her 30s living in Perth. During this visit, she reflected on her use of a Bluetooth earpiece, especially at night, sharing:  I use a Bluetooth earpiece to talk over the phone. I also sometimes wear it at night even if I'm not on the phone or expecting a call as I can quickly request that Siri call someone for me without having to actually dig out my phone, unlock it and make the call. I prefer having my hands free. It can make me feel safer at night.  Dominique’s description of having her mobile phone on standby can be understood as a habituated practice to overcome her anxieties of being alone at night in urban space, as well as to apprehend her sensory experience of the urban night by remaining “hands free”. Similar to Britta, Dominique’s embodiment in the urban night had become habituated and sedimented over time—or, in other words, “[a] force of habit” (Rosenberger and Verbeek 25). In this way, Dominique’s embodiment is configured depending on her contextual specificity, such as being alone in public spaces at night. Conclusion This article contributes to the emerging interdisciplinary field of “night studies” and “darkness studies” by focusing on the relationship between mobile media practices and the urban night. I based my methods, including data collection, interpretation and representation, in a postphenomenological framework, and detailed how this framework is useful in reflecting deeply and critically on mobile media use at night. Drawing from the framework’s key concept of multistability, I suggest a particular analysis of how users co-opt mobile media functionalities in situationally unique and personal ways in the urban night. The ways in which users co-opt these functionalities are often gendered. I unpacked how some of my research participants deploy mobile media functions as a means of managing their fears and anxieties of darkness and the urban night, and suggest that such uses are always dependent on the users specific situatedness, both within urban spaces and toward other city dwellers. In sum, this article has stressed the importance of situated and embodied experiences of darkness, and deploys postphenomenological insights to glean ways in which mobile media is implicated in the configuration of embodiment of the night.

"2021","Parents’ Social Uses of Mobile Phones in Public Places: The Case of Eateries in Two National Contexts","Given the growing salience of mobile phones that impact various aspects of family life, this study examines how parents use mobile phones in public places and whether the typology of  structural  and  relational  media uses applies to these circumstances. This topic is explored through the case of eateries, selected for their popularity among families with young children. Adopting an ethnographic approach, we conducted unobtrusive observations of 125 families with young children 2 to 6 years of age in two national contexts: the United States and Israel. Our findings demonstrate that mobile phones were used by parents above and beyond their basic communicative functions. We identified six such uses: Structural uses include the digital “playpen,” “bottle,” and “pacifier”; whereas relational uses include the digital “bubble,” “bond,” and “stage.” In contrast to the earlier typology, however, we found that, given the unique affordances of the mobile phone, the distinction between structural and relational uses is more blurred.","",""
"2021","Towards reimagining the ‘digital divide’: impediments and circumnavigation practices in the appropriation of the mobile phone by African journalists","ABSTRACT The rapid proliferation of the mobile phone in Africa has often been celebrated in deterministic ways that blindly eschew the stark and intricate realities associated with the challenges of the ‘digital divide’. Equally, very little attention has been paid to the sophisticated ways in which citizens (in association with mobile phone operators and manufacturers) negotiate their way around these challenges. Against this backdrop, this essay draws on interviews conducted between 2008 and 2016 to explore the experiences of African journalists in their deployment of the mobile phone as a journalistic and everyday communication platform. It specifically examines the localised challenges faced and the strategies employed to circumnavigate them. The findings show that, to remain connected, journalists as both professionals and citizens, generally deploy tactics hinged on their individual and collective agency as well as the creative innovations of mobile phone operators and manufacturers. Collectively, these strategies, as the paper argues, present an opportunity to reimagine the notion of the ‘digital divide’ as a multifaceted, inherently contextual experience embedded in the interplay between social actors, their immediate context of ‘practice’ and the wider social milieu.","",""
"2021","‘Data must fall’: mobile data pricing, regulatory paralysis and citizen action in South Africa","ABSTRACT South Africa’s mobile telecommunications industry boasts four major players, namely Vodacom, MTN, CELL C and Telkom. On the face of it, this suggests a diverse market with healthy competition. However, the costs of mobile services, including data and voice calls remains among the highest in the world, suggesting a distorted and uncompetitive market. Despite increasing awareness of this reality, and growing public outcry, change has been slow and piecemeal, with both policymakers and regulatory authorities not taking decisive action. Using institutional policy analysis, document analysis and interviews with sampled actors from the telecommunication industry, civic society and the regulatory authority, this paper argues that a combination of regulatory paralysis, collusive behaviour by oligopolistic operators, indecisive government policy, and to some degree citizen inaction have led to sustained overpricing of mobile data in South Africa. It highlights the corporate dominance in the policing of this sector, which has implications for citizens’ capacity to participate in various spheres of life, and hence for democracy. The paper is premised on the public interest theory and theories of universal (internet) access which are germane to understanding access to information as a human rights issue.","",""
"2021","Smartphone-size screens constrain cognitive access to video news stories","ABSTRACT Smartphones are expanding physical access to news and political information by making access to the internet available to more people, at more times throughout the day, and in more locations than ever before. But how does the portability of smartphones – afforded by their small size – affect cognitive access to news? Specifically, how do smartphone-size screens constrain attentiveness and arousal? We investigate how mobile technology constrains cognitive engagement through a lab-experimental study of individuals’ psychophysiological responses to network news on screens the size of a typical laptop computer, versus a typical smartphone. We explore heart rate variability, skin conductance levels, and the connection between skin conductance and the tone of news content. Results suggest lower levels of cognitive access to video news content on a mobile-sized screen, which has potentially important consequences for public attention to current affairs in an increasingly mobile media environment.","",""
"2021","Translating a Chinese approach? Rural distribution and marketing in Ghana’s phone industry"," Ghana’s mobile phone markets are currently dominated by a Chinese company called Transsion. Based on 7-month ethnographic research, this article examines Transsion’s distribution and marketing practices in Ghana, which are largely labor-intensive, rural-centric, low value-added, and lower-class-oriented. Taking a historical approach, this article reveals that this business strategy originated in China and has been translated to Ghana by a wide variety of translators. By elaborating various translation scenarios, this article demonstrates that translation as a practice, be it cultural, technological, or managerial, is a complicated process with tensions, adaptations, and innovations. As a tech company from the Global South, Transsion provides a critical case to think beyond the urban-centric and high value-added business model of Silicon Valley-type companies. ","",""
"2021","GIRLS, GADGETS AND GATEKEEPERS: HOW GENDER AND CLASS ASPIRATIONS SHAPE        ADOLESCENT ACCESS TO MOBILE PHONES IN MUMBAI, INDIA","Within a patriarchal, caste-based and restrictive family setup, how do gender and class work together to shape adolescent girls’ access to mobile phones in Mumbai, India? How do adolescent girls mediate their own independent aspirations and desires to variously fit within or subvert these frameworks of class stability and social morality? This paper addresses these question by using a mixed-methods study of 59 group interviews and 278 surveys with adolescents aged 13-15 in Mumbai. Taking an intersectional analytical framework, the findings show how gender and class together, create varying standards of respectable femininity and class distinction that families aspire to and cultivate in adolescent girls. The mobile phone can be seen as both a threat and a necessity to the maintenance of these standards of respectability, resulting in families variously enabling or constraining access to mobile phones by girls. Rather than interpreting the findings through binaries of lower-class/upper-class or empowered/constrained, I instead consider how classed ideals of respectable femininity create different aspirational conditions for girls belonging to each class group, and form the cultural frames of everyday life. I explore what implications this might have for adolescents girls’ understandings and enactments of independence, and how they use the site of the mobile phone to make these enactments.","",""

In everyday life these mobile online and offline spaces are increasingly interdependent and interwoven in manifold ways. Practices, experiences, meanings and expectations are negotiated across these spaces, while at the same time they are bound by the respective logics and limitations, leading to new interrelations and contradictions. The mobile, interlocking but non-converging nature of these spaces involves issues of access and power in struggles over in(ter)dependencies and leads to significant method(odolog)ical, practical and ethical challenges for researchers, to which the current COVID-19 pandemic only adds complexity. Researchers are confronted with questions such as: What are appropriate designs to study mobile online and offline spaces and their intersections? Do interdependent spaces call for likewise interdependent methodological approaches? In what ways can elaborated mixed and multi-method designs capture complexity adequately without the researchers losing sight of the specifics? And what are the ethical and practical implications for the parties involved? Meanwhile, in the methodological literature, the specific challenges associated with researching the intersections of online and offline spaces, especially under mobile conditions, are rarely explicitly addressed. For this reason, the panel presents a thought-provoking range of five examples of research into phenomena at the intersections of mobile online and offline spaces and the associated experiences as well as methodological challenges of researchers in dealing with issues of in(ter)dependence at all levels.","",""
"2021","Telephones, music and history: From the invention era to the early smartphone days"," This article focusses on the musical history of the telephone, an aspect of telephonic history that is often overlooked and has not yet received systematic academic attention. The article is structured around two musical themes of telephonic history: (1) public performances of telephones as musical instruments and (2) the telephone network as musical instrument. Two historic periods are considered for both themes, (a) the late 1800s/early 1900s and (b) the late 2000s. The article’s approach draws loosely on media historic and media archaeologic perspectives to analyse existing material about telephone history (with a musical focus) alongside empirical field work on the musical use of mobile phones in the late 2000s. The results contribute to debates regarding the ‘newness’ of media, and to sound studies approaches to media histories. The article shows how the theme of the musical telephone has been re-occurring but often overlooked throughout its history, and also sketches out a future research agenda. The article contributes a new understanding of the musical uses of the telephone across history, relevant for both understanding contemporary uses of telephone technologies such as smartphones and the Internet of Things, and for a richer understanding of historic telephone uses.

"2021","Effects of smartphones on economic and subjective quality of life","Popular characterizations of smartphones presume the benefits of their use. To test this, we used a national survey data (n = 1,261) and examined smartphone effects on economic and subjective quality of life. Preliminary analyses revealed significant associations between smartphone use and earnings as well as quality of life. Two-stage least square models, however, suggested that those associations are potentially endogenous, or can be better recognized as ‘chicken-and-egg’ causality. Subsequently, we dissected the relationships into mediating steps and found an indirect effect of a certain feature of smartphone use — texting to diverse people — on earning, signaling that benefits of smartphone are rewarded indirectly through diverse social contacts. We also found the persistent power of socio-demographics in explaining a large variance for subjective quality of life. Taken together, this study aims to take a historical snapshot of smartphone effects at its ‘critical mass’ turn and make a fuller description of how smartphones will be utilized, shedding a light on societal nature of technological benefits.","",""
"2021","Location in location-less environments: The role of geospatial concordance in online information evaluation"," In spite of the capacity for the Internet to connect people and information irrespective of geography, physical location may paradoxically provide influential indicators of the perceived expertise of strangers and the credibility of the information they provide that may in turn guide people’s behaviors. To address this, this study examined the novel concept of geospatial concordance or the degree to which entities implicated in the sharing of aggregated opinions in online information pools are physically close to each other in geographic space. Predictions were tested in the context of user-generated online reviews using stimuli reflecting various types of geospatial concordance: between information consumers and online reviewers, between reviewed venues and their reviewers, and between consumers and reviewed venues. Findings support geographic perspectives emphasizing space as a mental construction imbued with particular meaning and confirm psychological views that people mentally construe places at different levels of abstraction, depending on their psychological, and physical, distance from them.

"2021","Beyond the gender (dis)empowerment dichotomy: The mobile phone as social catalyst for gender transformation in the Global South"," Over the past two decades, increasing attention has been drawn to gender impacts arising from adoption and usage of information and communication technologies (ICTs), the mobile phone especially, by marginalized women in the Global South. Grounded in the theory of structuration, our study challenges techno-determinism and structural functionalism embodied in a prevailing gender (dis)empowerment dichotomy, and instead reveals the contextually situated and dynamically negotiated techno-socio relationships. It allows for examination of the mobile phone in the interactions between agency of women to get empowered and their situated gendered social power structures. While the phone reinforces structural constraints via facilitating access, surveillance, and intervention from those of higher patriarchal statuses, it simultaneously enables women’s strategic responses involving avoidance, accommodation, and collaboration. The constraining yet empowering processes conceptually make the functioning of the mobile phone as socially catalyzing the development of self-consciousness by women, and furthermore, the clustering of awakening individuals toward emergent female collective power.

"2021","Noisy polymedia in urban Ghana: Strategies for choosing and switching between media under unstable infrastructures"," This ethnographic article examines how Ghanaian urbanites choose between new media platforms under inadequate infrastructures. By combining participant observation with digital ethnography, the case studies described here show how informants change their media choosing and switching habits due to unstable electricity and dysfunctional inter-city roads. Thus, moral and social choices face an infrastructural ‘noise’ that diverts people’s digital practices. These findings contribute to Madianou and Miller’s theory of polymedia by suggesting that constraints of economy, access, literacy, or infrastructure cannot be exempt from the analysis of media choice, especially in Africa. It suggests the term ‘noisy polymedia’ as an expansive version that acknowledges how people use digital tools under unstable infrastructural conditions. Furthermore, this article demonstrates how smartphones became essential tools for ‘leapfrogging’ inadequate infrastructure in Africa as informants choose strategically between devices, payment plans, applications, and usage patterns.

Digital technology is now required for job seekers to research employers, store resumes, complete applications, and schedule interviews. What is the employment process for people who are living on the poverty line, without reliable access to the Internet or mobile phones? We focus on technology maintenance, the continuous work required to stay digitally connected, to understand how low-income job seekers in northern California manage the circulation and storage of information. We incorporate the concept of delegation from Latour to explore how people consciously consider who or what entities are responsible for technology maintenance, as this varies by government policies related to digital subsidies. This article draws novel connections between the influence of government policy on technology maintenance and how both the policies and digital inequalities shape impoverished job seekers’ choices around sharing and storage practices.

It read, in all caps, BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL. The message was mistakenly sent, but many residents lived in a threatened state of mind for the 38 minutes it took before a retraction was made. This study is based on a survey of 418 people who experienced the alert, recollecting their immediate responses, including how they attempted to verify the alert and how they used their mobile devices and social media for expressive interactions during the alert period. With the ongoing testing in the United States of nationwide Wireless Emergency Alerts, along with similar expansions of these systems in other countries, the event in Hawaii serves to illuminate how people understand and respond to mobile-based alerts. It shows the extreme speed that information—including misinformation—can flow in an emergency, and, for many, expressive communication affects people’s reactions. ","",""

Towards a theoretical framework for critically studying action possibilities at accident sites"," This article addresses the phenomenon of mobile bystanders who use their smartphones to film or take photographs at accident scenes, instead of offering their help to people in need or to assist medical units. This phenomenon has been extensively discussed in Swedish news media in recent years since it has been described as a growing problem for first responders, such as paramedics, police, and firefighters. This article aims to identify theoretical perspectives that are relevant for analyzing mobile media practices and discuss the ethical implications of these perspectives. Our purpose is twofold: we want to develop a theoretical framework for critically approaching mobile media practices, and we want to contribute to discussions concerning well-being in a time marked by mediatization and digitalization. In this pursuit, we combine theory from social psychology about how people behave at traumatic scenes with discussions about witnessing in and through media, as developed in media and communication studies. Both perspectives offer various implications for normative inquiry, and in our discussion, we argue that mobile bystanders must be considered simultaneously as transgressors of social norms and as emphatic witnesses behaving in accordance with the digital media age. The article ends with a discussion regarding the implications for further research. ","",""

Their work consists of moving around with their herd or flock, mainly sheep, so they can provide their animals with the best pastures. This research study, using ethnographic techniques, located and interviewed a group of livestock farmers to understand how the use of smartphones has changed their professional and social habits. Even now in modern times, this group still lives in isolation, working alone in the mountains. However, they have also been undergoing profound change due to the development of virtual social networks and information channels, mainly through groups in online applications. This enables them to keep fully up to date with all the topics they are interested in. This new connectivity has allowed them to make better-informed financial decisions based on more and better information. It has also meant they can produce proposals for joint action when faced with problems that affect them as a group. Lastly, the widespread use of mobile phones has increased their ability to communicate with friends and family, breaking previously held social taboos and barriers. ","",""

Although the overarching view of the social effects of cellphones in conversations appears to be negative, some research has also reported positive outcomes. The Cellphone Relevance Hypothesis predicts that effects of cellphone use on conversational satisfaction depend on the function of cellphones within a conversation. When a conversation partner integrates cellphone use into the conversation (integral use), conversational satisfaction is predicted to be higher than when the cellphone is used for a purpose unrelated to the conversation (incidental use). Two vignette studies provide support for the Cellphone Relevance Hypothesis and specify boundary conditions of the cellphone effect based on the involvement of respondents. ","",""

Accompanying the spike in Indian youths’ smartphone use is a proliferation of media coverage on the purported impact of smartphones on youths’ physical, psychological, and social well-being. We use a qualitative media analysis to show that the online and print media narratives around this issue reveal widespread fear and anxiety about youths’ smartphone use. We argue that this stems from a moral panic reaction to youths’, particularly young women’s, potential exercise of agency using their smartphones and accessing forbidden content over the internet. This narrative fails to include the potential affordances of internet access for youth and other marginalized people while also failing to address deeper concerns about digitization. ","",""

This experiment uses video vignettes to test how manager policy (no policy, pro-technology, anti-technology), device use (notepad, laptop, cell phone) and task-acknowledgment (no task-acknowledgment, task-acknowledgment) affect perceptions of meeting multicommunication behavior. US workers ( N = 243) who worked at least 30 hours per week and attended at least one weekly meeting rated relevant outcomes: expectancy violation, communicator evaluation, perceived competence, and meeting effectiveness. Results reveal manager policy and device use both affect multicommunication perceptions, with mobile phones generating the highest expectancy violation and lowest evaluation of the communicator and meeting effectiveness. Surprisingly, there was no effect for task-acknowledgment; however, a match between manager policy and task-acknowledgment affected evaluations. This paper unifies past evidence about multicommunication under the expectancy violations framework, extends theoretical understandings of mobile media use at work, and suggests practical implications for technology use in unfamiliar workplace situations.

It explores usage patterns and connectivity challenges, and how these affect access to social services as well as opportunities for information seeking, skills building, and social capital formation. To characterize the unreliable conditions under which this population uses mobile phones, we introduce the concept of access instability to capture not simply the obstacles to technology access imposed by poverty but more broadly those stemming from a combination of poverty, housing insecurity, and discrimination. The study is primarily based on a survey among adults experiencing homelessness (or at risk of) conducted over a span of 5 months, complemented by findings from a participatory research intervention carried out in collaboration with a local advocacy organization. Among the key findings is that reliable access to electrical power represents a fundamental yet understudied barrier to mobile use among marginalized populations, including (but not limited to) those experiencing homelessness. Lacking a safe and reliable place to charge their devices, the unstably housed must activate coping strategies that limit digital engagement and constrain use. Overall, access instability disrupts the expectation of constant reachability that underpins modern economic and social relations. Ultimately, this narrows pathways out of homelessness by limiting the ability to gain or sustain employment, to connect with healthcare providers and other vital resources, and to maintain networks of personal support.

Drawing on the notions of cellphone crosstalk and caller hegemony, we identify behavioral responses to mobile phones and the use of mobile phones by others, which help to manage both face-to-face and mediated social expectations of responsiveness. Based on observational fieldwork and interviews, we identify specific behavioral categories that demonstrate how social vulnerability and ostracism due to mobile phone use may be mitigated through parallel or collective mobile phone use. We also expand the original concepts of cellphone crosstalk and caller hegemony to mediated crosstalk and notification hegemony to account for contemporary changes in the sociotechnical mobile landscape.

"2021","Mobile communicating place and place-inscribed communicative mobilities: Shaping alternative consumer cultures in mobile media communication"," This study aims to update notions of how the practical elements of mobile communication (i.e., microcoordination and synchronization) alter the interconnectedness between places and mobilities. Based on ethnographic research on personal shoppers’ mobile purchasing practices between mainland China and Hong Kong (HK), this article argues that mobile communication, as a social practice, extends relational places in cross-border shopping, on the one hand, and transforms the performances of mobilities that are used to anchor the spatial identities of shoppers and localities for consumption, on the other. Shoppers’ mobile communication practices create variable interactions between mobilities and places, manifested as mobile communicating place and place-inscribed communicative mobilities. The consumer cultures of HK personal shopping are anchored by the multiplicity of places and shifting mobilities of people, data, and objects. Mobile communication in/of HK is a medium through which people from the mainland can consume the symbolic space and “localness” of HK, embodying the “spatial selves” of personal shoppers through digital expressions of mobilities. Shoppers produce place-inscribed communicative mobilities of themselves and of commodities in HK through differing synchronization and coordination patterns in two places (Tsim Sha Tsui and Sheung Shui), based on the fact that the former is an international and local-brand tourist center and the latter has risen as a new “parallel trading hub” for cross-border consumption.

Working with a sample of 433 American young adults in romantic relationships, the study found that smartphone use was associated with increased communication between romantic partners, and increased mediated communication between partners predicted more affectionate communication. Conversely, increased smartphone dependency was directly associated with less affectionate communication and lower relationship satisfaction. The study offers insights into how smartphones potentially affect how we connect with romantic partners. ","",""
"2021","Explicating self-phones: Dimensions and correlates of smartphone self-extension"," Given its role as a constant companion, the mobile phone has long been thought of as an extension of the self. However, the psychology of smartphone self-extension has received relatively little attention through empirical research. By explicating theorized facets of self-extension, we explore the dimensionality of smartphone self-extension and examine how established psychological orientations map onto these dimensions. Results provide support for a two-dimensional structure of self-extension. Specifically, we found that self-extension can be delineated on the extent to which the smartphone is viewed as (a) functional for personal goals and (b) integral to personal identity. Across two studies, habitual usage predicted the functionality dimension and problematic usage predicted the identity dimension. In addition, Study 2 revealed that the two dimensions of self-extension corresponded to different dimensions of smartphone vigilance. We discuss the importance of conceptualizing smartphone self-extension as a perceptual construct, as well as the challenges of measuring the psychological connection that exists – or is thought to exist – between self and phone.

At the time of this writing, 5G is not yet widely available, however the media is saturated with narratives about how it will revolutionize everyday life. Drawing from the social imaginaries and media infrastructures traditions, this textual analysis examines the social shaping of 5G through advertisements from leading telecoms in leading markets, including China and the United States. Findings reveal an overarching trend with ads from both societies imagining 5G in futuristic and utopian ways, suggesting new possibilities for people, objects, and places to be connected through smart homes, vehicles, factories, and cities—not just through smart phones. The findings also reveal distinctions in how 5G is envisioned at the societal level. For example, ads from China imagine 5G as a source of national pride that will elevate its global standing, while the US telecoms have a more inward focus on domestic competition. The discussion offers interpretations of these and other findings, along with directions for future research. ","",""
"2022","Daughters, devices and doorkeeping: how gender and class shape adolescent mobile phone access in Mumbai, India","ABSTRACT How do gender and class work together to shape adolescent girls’ unequal access to mobile phones within the family in Mumbai, India? What are the everyday practices and cultural logics upon which these inequalities are built? This paper addresses these questions by using a mixed-methods study of 59 group interviews and 268 surveys with adolescents aged 13–15 in Mumbai. Taking an intersectional analytical framework, the findings show how gender and class together create varying standards of ‘respectable femininity’ and class distinction that families aspire to and cultivate in adolescent girls. The mobile phone can be seen as both a threat and a necessity to the maintenance of these standards of respectability, resulting in families variously enabling or constraining access to mobile phones by girls. Rather than interpreting the findings through binaries of low-income/high-income or empowered/constrained, I instead consider how classed ideals of ‘respectable femininity’ create different aspirational conditions for girls belonging to each class group, and form the cultural frames of everyday life.","",""

Employing an ethnographic approach, this study examines the digitized resistance of Chinese rural–urban migrant women (n = 41) against sexual harassment faced in their workplaces. We adopt the lens of intersectionality to reveal the nuanced impacts of mobile communication practices negotiated in the context of gender, class, and the organizational structure across informal and formal economies. We find contrasting pictures of bottom-up disruption in the informal labor market and top-down transformation occurring in the modern factory. Migrant women working in the unregulated market restructured the existing patriarchal culture by deploying mobiles to establish collaborative groups for job information sharing. This mobile-mediated sharing enabled the rise of self-employed entrepreneurship, thus avoiding male intermediation in their livelihoods and thereby reducing the chances of encountering harassment. However, these benefits were uneven, with digitally-challenged women missing out. In contrast, migrant women employed in a registered factory with established rules actively negotiated top-down transformation of patriarchal culture. Female managers, in newly gained leadership roles, exercised their professional authority to encourage female workers to re-shape the discursive gender power of mobile spaces shared with male workers. Women actively confronted sexually provocative behavior of men on chat groups. We argue that subtle and covert mobile practices, in addition to visible and direct ones, allow for the construction of digitized female resistance culture as part of broader societal change influenced by mobile communication. We conclude with comments on the complexity and dynamism of mobile-mediated gender transformation in the context of rapid socio-economic development in the Global South.","",""

However, no one has demonstrated a causal effect of cell phone access on health and well-being. Using a 7-month longitudinal field experiment we investigated how stable cellphone access impacts health and quality of life of people experiencing poverty (N = 45, median annual income = $7,216). Participants received phone cards providing unlimited talk, text, and data (n = 23) or were given grocery store gift cards of the equivalent amount (n = 22). Over the course of the experiment, participants in the treatment group reported better health and quality of life compared to those in the control group. Emotional social support moderated this relationship in such a way that those with the least social support benefited the most from stable cellphone access (supporting a ‘poor-get-richer’ hypothesis).

Also, women face structural inequality. Among other things, polygyny (one husband and several wives) is legal. Based on the inductive analysis of 25 interviews with women, and using the lens of intersectionality, we examine their use of mobile banking. We examine how mobile technology plays into the management of the household economy, and how it is used in extramarital relationships. We discuss how women use mobile communication in their collective savings groups (chama). We see how the mobile phone can be the locus of tensions within the household and how mBanking both supports the lives of the women but also how this can eventually undercut social support.","",""

Using an online survey ( N = 408) and drawing on Congruence Theory and Generation Cohort Theory, we focus on three generations: X, Y, and Z. Findings show that all generations responded negatively when receiving an advertisement via smartphone. However, the generations differ in their patterns of association between mobile advertising attitudes and responses to mobile ads. Findings suggest that incongruence between each generation’s scheme and the five dimensions of advertising attitudes results in unfavorable responses to mobile advertising. These findings provide guidelines for future research and implications for marketers who intend to design behavioral targeting to consumers of various generational cohorts while using mobile platforms as an advertising channel.

This concern is addressed primarily by offering a non-location-based approach to study mobile spatiality and sociality. This approach involves studying spatial integration afforded by smartphone chat apps with their “ubiquitous connectivity, portability, and fluidity.” While content analysis showed that cross-directional hybrid space exists and that the elements from the physical space migrate to the virtual space, the use of space-event text matrix further helped in unraveling the nature of cross-directionality more closely.

However, smartphones can potentially distract visitors from the exhibit, crippling the hands-on experience. In this study, we present SurfaceLens which is a smartphone-based peripheral device enabling near-surface spatial interaction with exhibits. SurfaceLens detects proximity, location on the surface, and orientation of the device while a visitor moves it along the surface of exhibits like using a magnifying glass. It provides an information space and audio-haptic feedback reflecting its location and orientation so that the visitor can feel like seeing-through the exhibit. We compared this near-surface spatial interaction with on-screen touch interaction to investigate their effect on visitor experience and behaviour. The results indicate that SurfaceLens provided a more intuitive and transparent understanding of the content when used as an observation tool. Moreover, narrowing down the distance between visitors and exhibits promotes exploratory behaviours.","",""
"2022","Selectively localized: Temporal and visual structure of smartphone screen activity across media environments"," This study demonstrates how localization and homogenization can co-occur in different aspects of smartphone usage. Smartphones afford individualization of media behavior: users can begin, end, or switch between countless tasks anytime, but this individualization is shaped by shared environments such that smartphone usage may be similar among those who share such environments but contain differences, or localization, across environments or regions. Yet for all users, smartphone screen interactions are bounded and guided by nearly identical smartphone interfaces, suggesting that smartphone usage may be similar or homogenized across all individuals regardless of environment. We study homogenization and localization by comparing the temporal, visual, and experiential composition of screen activity among individuals in three dissimilar media environments—the United States, China, and Myanmar—using one week of screenshot data captured passively every 5 s by the novel Screenomics framework. We find that overall usage levels are consistently dissimilar across media environments, while metrics that depend more on moment-level decisions and user-interface design do not vary significantly across media environments. These results suggest that quantitative research on homogenization and localization should analyze behavior driven by user interfaces and by contextually determined parameters, respectively. ","",""

To understand the foundational decisions to incorporate technology (mobile devices) within our domestic time and space, this study explores how individuals use their mobile device for professional or work-oriented communication within the nonwork or domestic sphere. Using Domestication Theory as an important guide, the research explored how the border between the two domains (spheres) were managed. From 32 semi-structured interviews, this qualitative study uncovered 2 overarching themes: Control of Time and Influences. These themes provide understanding of the role mobile devices play in professional communication decisions, what control participants have, and how individuals manage work permeations into the domestic sphere. This research makes a theoretical contribution in the spirit of Clark’s Work/Family Border Theory. With the infusion of mobile devices, a model is proposed offering a fresh perspective of how borders are conceptualized in organizational and familial communication in this context. ","",""

"2022","The (other) two percent also matter: The construction of mobile phone refusers"," Technological resistance practices hold significant insights regarding the media’s role as much as its adoption and usage practices. However, studies examining media non-use have generally overlooked mobile phone resisters—individuals voluntarily deciding not to own mobile phones. Based on 25 in-depth interviews with mobile phone refusers, this study presents two refuser types differing in refusal dynamics. The first are ideologists, whose rejection stems from a formulated, critical worldview towards the mobile phone, in particular, and communication technologies, in general. The second are realizers, whose “post-factum resistance” resulted from a forced but positive experience of a temporary break in use (e.g., when their device was broken or stolen), motivating them to disconnect in an attempt to preserve the new, liberated space they experienced. Additional findings reveal the non-ownership practices adopted by the mobile phone refusers; the novel psychological and sociological motives underlying mobile phone refusal concerning the home space and digital well-being; refuser resistance discourse, which focuses solely on the medium’s nature and not its content; and how refusers negotiate the social status and stigma that accompanies their mobile phone refusal. Our study illustrates how mobile phone refusal stands apart from other media resistance, providing a deeper perspective on the price of connectivity, and thus underscoring the importance of studying these refusers. The uniqueness of mobile phone refusal is further expressed in its complexity, extremity, perceived authenticity, and visibility. ","",""

A growing body of research suggests that these technological devices, when used in a classroom, lead to various issues and problems for students from distraction/loss of focus to procrastination, and ultimately impact performance and grades. Media coverage has pointed to smartphones as a scourge responsible for the decline of an entire generation of university and college students. Much of the research, while important and timely, tends to study what technological devices ‘do to’ people. There has been less focus on how students temper their use of smartphones in a classroom and while doing schoolwork – in other words, what they ‘do with’ their technological devices, such as smartphones. This research was completed in Winter 2021 via online survey with 632 undergraduate students at a large Canadian University. It found that students employ a variety of strategies that help mitigate the risks of smartphone use. These include installing apps that manage time on various platforms, turning off notifications, or placing their phone in a coat or bag. Some students turn off their phone or leave it in another room when taking online classes. This study positioned the students themselves as ‘experts’ in the use of their smartphones. The findings suggest that many students feel they limit their smartphone use in class or while studying far better than professors and the media suggest.","",""

We utilized novel Screenomics data, comprehensive sequences of screenshots (N = 13,498,584) collected every 5 seconds from the smartphones of lower-income and higher-income adults (N = 65) in U.S. metropolitan areas for 2 months. While examining a person’s everyday smartphone use, we observed 103 natural exposures to advertisements of payday lenders who had in the past generated consumer complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We describe how individuals encountered payday loan ads through various digital channels despite the ad bans of major technology companies. We employed a quasi-experimental design to test for differences in participant actions immediately before and after ad exposure. Multilevel analysis results show that exposure to payday loan ads led to notable changes in the lower-income individuals’ smartphone use. Directly after seeing the ads, the lower-income individuals engaged with content that contained fewer future-oriented words, switched between applications more frequently, and avoided content that evoked negative emotions. Such effects were especially pronounced among the lower-income individuals who lacked the support of social safety nets, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly known as food stamps) and unemployment benefits. In contrast, there were no changes noted in smartphone use among the lower-income individuals receiving social safety net assistance and higher-income individuals. These findings highlight the nuanced yet impactful psychological consequences of digital experiences, an underexplored aspect of digital inequalities.","",""

Drawing upon 20 nights of field observations at live music events and 27 semi-structured interviews with promoters and attendees, I highlighted two scenarios in which promoters and attendees leveraged the spatial and temporal affordances of mobile and social media to calibrate their visibility. First, the last-minute and indirect sharing of event location afforded the community to bar outsiders from entering while allowing insiders to authenticate themselves by navigating to their gatherings. Second, the dialectical shaping between promoters’ venue policies and attendees’ folk theories of phone etiquette maintained a reduced level of mobile media use at such gatherings. These practices brought to light how mobile and social media afford new spatial-temporal conditions of visibility and bring forth new possibilities for people to not only manage – but play with visibility.","",""
"2023","MOBILE MEDIA DURING THE PANDEMIC: FOUR SCENARIOS TO HELP US IMAGINE A MOBILE MEDIA FUTURE TOWARDS LIBERATION","Together, our projects pose the question of what else can be possible as a way to rearrange the power relations that have contributed to the asymmetric flows of information and resources to some instead of others. We are inspired by indigenous scholars’ claim that “decolonization is not a metaphor” because liberation should not be a metaphor: it should be a possibility.  We, panelists, hope to engage conversations that address the future of the internet, especially the future of mobile communication with the lessons learned from studies. Panelists offer a close reading of four scenarios: in South Korea among residents whose locative data tell a story about their comings and goings, among International Exchange Students mobile media use during the on-set of travel bans, in China among rural-to-urban female migrant workers, and in Brazil among those who used the Unified Slum Dashboard to called attention for proper government intervention. Among our research methods are interviews, observations, content analysis, and case study to bring attention to and make institutional space for voices and accounts of community engagement that have been marginalized or overlooked. Our findings share a common theme that mobile media simultaneously can liberate and complicate our mobility choices, especially during a global pandemic, but that it can be a civic media in which liberation can be possible through more careful policies that take minoritized experiences into consideration for future policies.","",""

"2023","Mobile netware, social graphs, and the reconfiguration of space"," Scholars are well-aware that the smartphone is much more than just a mobile telephone. A plethora of applications have been developed to run on smartphones, covering just about every aspect of human life. What is distinctive about the fact that these apps run on smartphones (as opposed to other kinds of devices) is that the smartphone makes them mobile (the apps travel with the user) and locative (the apps know the location of the user). As a result, smartphone applications that take full advantage of these characteristics have the ability to bring users together in real space and real time. The key to the success of such “netware” apps is their generation and retention of social graphs that connect their users both socially and physically. Netware apps like ride hailing that are built around mobility and location have the potential to dramatically restructure economic and social life by reconfiguring their users’ experiences of the physical and temporal world. We use ride hailing as a case study to illustrate how the new social geographies generated by mobile netware apps interact with physical geography to generate a new sense of space that can only be mapped by the companies that “own” our social graphs.

His engagement with such data, that is, digital exhaust, extends back to the early 2000s, when he was a researcher with an international mobile network provider. Open-minded and with a strong curiosity drive, Ling joined forces with the company’s data scientists. This started an interdisciplinary dialogue that over the years has generated social insights that otherwise would have been hard to obtain. Yet, such collaborations are still rare. This article argues that the future of mobile communication scholarship lies in pursuing this strand in Ling’s legacy. Cross-fertilization of ideas between the social sciences and data analytics is likely to generate knowledge of high societal relevance. The article accounts for the history of such collaborations with special attention to Ling’s engagement, and points to opportunities for the coming decades. ","",""

We investigate this question by conducting two online field experiments. We randomly assigned participants to use their mobile phones or personal computers (PCs) to process different kinds of information. Study 1 ( N = 116) discovered that participants using mobile phones process emails more efficiently (i.e., spend less time) than those using PCs. Study 2 ( N = 241) extended this to online deceptive content and found that individuals using mobile phones, especially habitual users, are more efficient, but engage in less information processing, are less attentive and less vigilant about misinformation, compared to those using PCs. However, the latter are more likely to succumb to phishing emails by clicking on malicious links. We discuss theoretical implications for information processing across media devices and practical implications for combating misinformation and cybersecurity attacks. ","",""

These survey data were merged with the exam scores of these students. We analysed the resulting data by means of panel data random-effects estimation controlling for unobserved individual characteristics.

The main goal of this article is to show how the mobile experience sampling method (MESM), in combination with data donations, can be useful for addressing the challenges of mobile communication research. We explicate the design using an experience-sampling study that was conducted on mobile campaigning during the Dutch 2021 national election. Using this case, we discuss how MESM can be extended and combined with other data sources, such as tracking data, GPS, and sensory data, to address the challenges of mobile communication effects research and facilitate future studies.

"2023","Mobile social media: The challenges and opportunities continue","When the inaugural issue ofMobile Media and Communication (MMC) was published in 2013, I began my article with the story of the Lovegety, a stand-alone device in Japan in the late 1990s that would beep when within 5 meters of another Lovegety device on the same setting, either “chatting,” “karaoke,” or “get2” (Humphreys, 2013). This example demonstrated several important aspects of mobile social media. First, the use of a stand-alone device was out of place given the mobile phone, app-centric environment. Second, the Lovegety’s connectivity was based on proximity, not locality. There were no location-based data collected on such devices. Third, the Lovegety demonstrated that mobile social media were not always tied to mobile phones. In this article, I want to reflect on what these three aspects mean for mobile social media in 2023. WhenMMC first launched, it seemed unfathomable that a separate device, such as the Lovegety, would connect people rather than an app on a smartphone. Indeed from 2008– 2013, there was exponential growth in apps (Goggin, 2021; Morris & Murray, 2018). Today, however, given the rise of “smart” objects and appliances, devices such as the Lovegety do not seem unusual. Plenty of things “talk” to each other (Frith, 2019). It is, however, the case that such objects or things are now also connected to our mobile devices and ultimately the Internet (Bunz & Meikle, 2017), whereas the Lovegety was not accessible through a mobile phone or the Internet.

"2023","Psychological perspectives on mobile media: A flyover review","Psychology-infused research has always been a central section within the literature on mobile media and communication, highlighting the diverse emotional, cognitive, social, and personality processes that can interact with mobile behavior. While past work on the psychology of media and technology has been rooted more in the discipline of Communication than Psychology, more social scientists across disciplines are conducting mobile research with each year going forward. The result is a massive, and arguably scattered, body of knowledge on the psychological predictors, processes, effects, and implications of mobile media use. Despite the breadth of the burgeoning literature, there have been increasing attempts to synthesize this wide-ranging work (Bayer et al., 2016; Cumiskey & Ling, 2015; Ellis, 2020; Kushlev & Leitao, 2020; Melumad & Pham, 2020; Ross & Campbell, 2021; Wilmer et al., 2017).

When this journal was launched a decade ago, some were still trying to make sense of what this field entails, what to call it, and whether it even exists (Campbell, 2013). Although there was no question as to the growth in this new area of scholarship, the field’s coherence was highly questionable. When this journal was launched, the editors echoed concerns that: although mobile media scholarship has begun to grow, it is by no means a coherent field of scholarship, and there are still many areas in need of elaboration and differentiation [...] mobile media in an age of smart-phones requires that we not only attempt to articulate the field but also to more systematically understand its various dimensions.

"2023","Mobile media in China: Media practice as a research orientation","With the explosive spread of mobile media represented by mobile phones and the rapid iteration of mobile Internet technology, various social media applications have emerged, such as Facebook, Twitter, and China’s WeChat and Weibo. When mobile media as nonhuman actors were adapted into our daily life, the state of “permanent online, permanent connection” turned out to be the routine for mobile media users (Vorderer & Kohring, 2013), who started to use domesticated media as a resistance tactic to balance between the media system structures and action power (Haddon, 2003, p. 43). In this sense, the mobile media extend the time and space for social interaction. While the context of mobile communication has undergone drastic changes, the “media practice” carried out by users has also been increasingly treated as the core concept for the research on media action that is co-constructed among the public, technology, and environment. It should be noted that the scholarship on mobile communication effects achieved during the past decade mainly took a perspective from either the technological determinism or social construction of technology. However, neither the relationship between structure and action, nor that between technology and society, should be viewed as simply binary. Rather, the bilateral interaction perspective that was originally emphasized in communication research should be revisited, and the recent affordance perspective should be reintroduced and refocused. The concept of affordance was first proposed by eco-psychologist Gibson based on his interest in visual perception. Affordance refers to the action possibility of the perceiving subject in an object or environment, which is independent of the actor’s experience but","",""
"2023","Overestimating or underestimating communication findings? Comparing self-reported with log mobile data by data donation method"," Mobile phone usage is typically measured via self-reporting. However, scholars have questioned the validity of self-reported data, which may lead to Type I or Type II errors. Using an online survey ( n = 777), this study compared self-reported and log mobile phone usage data using a simplified version of the mobile data donation method. The results showed that people generally underreported their mobile phone usage in terms of time duration, the number of notifications, and apps used. Moreover, self-reported data may either have no additional effect on or overestimate the communication findings depending on the outcome variables. This challenges the Type II error explanation and suggests that the effect sizes of self-reported data might not be underestimated after all. Instead, past research examining mobile use and pertinent outcomes may have false-positive findings and Type I errors. Given the potential inaccuracies of self-reported data, future research on mobile media and communications should go beyond self-reported data to enhance the validity of findings. ","",""
"2023","Observations on mobile communication and well-being research","The year 2013 marked not only the inaugural issue of Mobile Media & Communication, but also the start of my academic career and the development of my first mobile phone and well-being study (Chan, 2015). Whether it is conceived as “mental health,” “subjective well-being,” “flourishing,” “positive thinking,” “life satisfaction,” or another term, well-being has been the subject of scientific research for more than a century (Rodman & Fry, 2009). The longevity of the literature is understandable because of the accumulative evidence across the decades that high citizen well-being produces a variety of normatively desirable individual and societal benefits. These include increased mortality, health, academic achievement, workforce productivity, and prosocial behaviors (Maccagnan et al., 2018). During my graduate studies, I was especially fascinated by the ongoing academic and societal discourses on the beneficial and deleterious consequences of mobile phones (i.e., Rainie & Wellman, 2012; Turkle, 2011) as well as my own gradual realization that the mobile phone has become so integral to my everyday life. The successive emergence of new communication technologies since the 1990s such as the Internet and social media have stimulated a vast literature on whether they engender or diminish psychological well-being. Research on mobile phones is no exception given that it is one of the fastest-diffusing technologies in the world (Wei, 2013). Indeed, a cursory search of mobile phone and well-being related keywords in Google Scholar exemplifies the growth, which shows few signs of abating (Figure 1).

"2023","The smartphone between the present and the future: Five changes","The first change that I point out here is the ongoing capability of the mobile phone (and now the smartphone) to colonize everyday life. This dominance of the smartphone over other technologies is due to its closeness to the human body, already described in the early 2000s (Oksman & Rautiainen, 2002). This fact explains not only its supremacy but also the radical nature of the social changes it has facilitated. The smartphone makes an ever-increasing number of societies’ domains available for consumption while people are on the move or wherever they happen to be at the moment (Vorderer et al., 2018). This also means that we are available for work and production wherever we might be (Mullan & Wajcman, 2017). Being a metamedium (Humphreys et al., 2018; Jensen, 2016), the smartphone also effortlessly incorporates into itself other technologies and platforms (e.g., the computer, camera, internet, radio, television, newspapers, etc.). We can speak, write, read, learn, do mathematical operations, take photographs and videos, control their schedules, coordinate with others, express emotions, pray, check calendars, search for places, get information (and archive it), and also communicate. We can also access social media, read the news, do banking and ecommerce, play games, and get health data. The smartphone offers an incredible number of opportunities to redesign the attitudes, habits, routines, and behaviors of everyday life. The implications of our use affect many dimensions of human existence: the ontological as well as the anthropological. For example, not only do we have new ways to keep our memories, but we develop another relationship with our memories (Humphreys, 2018; Özkul & Humphreys,","",""
"2023","Mobile work, mobility, and mobile devices: Responding to a societal shift","The global community of mobile communication scholars has accomplished much in the past 10 years. We have more precisely defined mobile communication scholarship and began to focus on spatial, temporal, and power dynamics surrounding mobility and mobile devices (e.g., Campbell, 2013; Frith & Özkul, 2019; Stephens, 2018). Our scholarship has led the way by publishing research on diverse types of work and workers around the globe (e.g., construction workers: Pink et al., 2014; janitorial staff: Stephens & Ford, 2016; livestock farmers: Vidal-González & Fernández-Piqueras, 2021). Now, in a world that has recently experienced multiple cascading disasters, including a global pandemic, mobile communication has become even more important, and in the next five years we have new occasions to contribute our theoretical and empirical research. Before the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in the US, 7% of the population were considered full-time mobile workers—worked outside a designated work location—so mobile work is not a new practice (Parker et al., 2020). Scholars in a host of fields have studied telework, virtual work, and the use of mobile technologies in organizations (e.g., Watson-Manheim et al., 2002). What is different is that during 2020, we experienced extreme growth as the percentage of people working outside a formal workplace full time jumped from 7% to 50% (Parker et al., 2020). With that shift came a host of new challenges: parents could not find childcare outside the home, care responsibilities more often fell on women, people were less mobile as travel came to a halt, and many people having to work from home did not have a dedicated place to do their job","",""

Based on social network analysis, Tai analyzed the structure of the citation networks of the key literature (56 journal publications) in agenda-setting research.

"2023","Field challenges","In the case of topics close to my research agenda, there has been over the past years a significant shift in the theoretical understanding of the way people use and integrate mobile communication into their daily lives. Compared to a decade ago and earlier, theories of media no longer construe a sharp divide between mobile and other forms of communication, or between online and offcommunication. The distinction between digital/ mobile and real life has been largely erased. This is partly due to a change in technologies of digital communication and what might be called the mobile pivot. An illustration of this conceptual step forward may be seen in the breakdown of formerly rigid boundaries between mobile communication and other forms of communication, especially between the field of computer-mediated communication (CMC) and that of mobile communication. Newer theoretical paradigms, such as that advocated by Scott W. Campbell (2019); Scott Campbell (2020), see the inter-mixing of mobile communication processes increasingly erasing boundaries between the two fields. This erasure has implications for the field of mobile communication both internally and externally. Internally, the scope of what can be legitimately considered as a topic of interest within the ambit of mobile communication has been expanded. Externally, the field boundaries of other disciplines have expanded into the mobile communication domain; this benefits the mobile communication field by having new cadres of researchers engaged with its issues.

Findings indicate that mobile communication research has grown into a distinctive subfield or sub-discipline, defined by four main characteristics. First, the scope of mobile communication research is broader than studies of mobile media alone. Second, mobile media as global technologies have attracted international authors, although global scholarship is uneven. Third, the boundary of mobile communication has expanded from social, economic, and cultural perspectives to those of health, education, and tourism. Fourth, although mobile communication research is increasingly theory-informed, building distinctive theories about mobile communication remains a challenge for future growth. ","",""
"2023","Evolving mobile media: Changing technology and transforming behavior","Historians have long warned us that any prediction about the future, including the future of communication technology, is a risky business. However, adoption of mobile telephony seems to be an exception. The predictions were wrong, just in a different way— worldwide adoption of mobile phones went much faster than expected rather than more slowly. It is now proverbial to characterize mobile phones and devices as the fastest-diffused technology in human history. In my essay for the inaugural issue of Mobile Media & Communication (Wei, 2013), I described mobile media spearheaded by the smartphone as coming of age with a big splash. By that I meant that widespread adoption and novel uses of mobile media were unlike any other media technology. Looking back, the splash became a tsunami. In 2021, mobile users worldwide topped seven billion, accounting for 91.54% of the world’s population. In fact, Earth has more mobile phones and devices than people.","",""
"2023","Predicting the next decade of mobile communication studies research: More mobile media, fewer mobile phones","The growth of Mobile Media & Communication (MMC) in the journal’s first decade has been both remarkable and somewhat understandable. On the one hand, the journal—and mobile communication studies (MCS) as a field more generally—have made amazing strides in just 10 years, going from a brand-new journal in 2013 to one of the International Communication Association’s top journals by 2022. On the other hand, the growth is somewhat explainable because mobile phones have now become the dominant form of contemporary communication media. Back whenMMC published its inaugural issue, smartphones were still relatively new (at least in academic research terms) and there was a relatively small number of communication researchers who focused on mobile phone practices. But that is obviously no longer the case. At this point, most media studies research focuses on smartphones because most media are accessed through smartphones. Consequently, while the rise of the smartphone helped MMC and MCS grow, simply studying smartphones has not been what has cemented MCS as an identifiable field of research (Campbell, 2019). Instead, MCS has continued to develop as a field because of the community of researchers and, maybe most importantly, MMC. Without the mobile research community and MMC as a venue to set the tone for the field, we could have easily been swallowed up by more established communication fields. In fact, I suspect that’s exactly what would have happened as smartphones became ubiquitous and smartphone research became far too prevalent to group it all under the MCS label. If all we had tying us together as a research community was “we study mobile phones,” then we would have little reason to exist in 2022 when most communication research is at least tangentially","",""

Compared to the cyberspace widely celebrated as a realm apart, from the 1990s and into the 2000s, DE is a particularly ambitious example of the so-called digital twins (Savage, 2022) that promise to reintegrate online and offline realities in a new category of infrastructure, namely, the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) (Bunz & Meikle, 2018)—which the field of media and communication research has barely begun to address. As I review the schedule of the 2022 Paris meeting of the International Communication Association to prepare for a hybrid online–offline reunion against the background of the COVID-19 pandemic, a search for the text string “internet of things” returns neither session headings nor paper titles—none.

Mobile messaging apps are among the most downloaded and used apps on earth (Statistica, 2022). For many people, mobile messaging is synonymous with Facebook and WhatsApp. Outside China, where WeChat dominates, over 2.5 billion people use these two Meta platforms for mobile messaging, and the company owns 90% of the mobile messaging market share in many places. This undercounts mobile messaging because Apple’s iMessage likely exceeds Facebook’s mobile messager app in size, and the Android messaging program is similar in size to Snapchat, Telegram, and QQ (the fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-ranked mobile messager apps respectively) (Statistica, 2022). Whatever you call it—texting, mobile instant messaging, direct messaging (DM), mobile chat—mobile messaging is, and long has been, an enormous part of the experience of mobile media. In this article, I will focus on messaging that occurs on mobile devices exclusively (i.e., smartphones), not desktopor laptop-accessed messenger programs. In the last five years, the boundaries between social media use (SMU) and mobile messaging have utterly blurred. Although Facebook introduced the DM in 2011, it wasn’t fully integrated with mobile devices until 2017 (Business of Apps, 2022).

The sample was representative of the Dutch population regarding age, gender, and education level ( N = 1674). Linear mixed models showed that perceived overuse was positively related to self-reported screen time and motivations to reduce screen time. People with higher perceived overuse were more likely to adopt disconnection strategies in the following 2 months. Yet, surprisingly, at the within-person level, we found that when someone experienced more overuse than they normally do, they were not more likely to adopt disconnection strategies. Moreover, using disconnection strategies in the previous 2 months was related to higher perceived overuse and self-reported screen time. Together, these findings suggest that people do not always take action when unsatisfied with their smartphone use, and when they do, technology-based disconnection strategies are not effective in reducing perceived smartphone overuse.

"2024","‘90 per cent of the time when I have had a drink in my hand I’m on my phone as well’: A cross-national analysis of communications technologies and drinking practices among young people"," Greater use of communication technologies among young people, including mobile phones, social media and communication apps, has coincided with declines in youth alcohol use in many high-income countries. However, little research has unpacked how drinking as a practice within interconnected routines and interactions may be changing alongside these technologies. Drawing on qualitative interviews about drinking with young people aged 16–23 across three similar studies in Australia, the United Kingdom and Sweden, we identify how communication technologies may afford reduced or increased drinking. They may reduce drinking by producing new online contexts, forms of intimacy and competing activities. They may increase drinking by re-organising drinking occasions, rituals and contexts. And they may increase or reduce drinking by enabling greater fluidity and interaction between diverse practices. These countervailing dynamics have likely contributed to shifting drinking patterns and practices for young people that may be obscured beneath the population-level decline in youth drinking. ","",""
"2024","Conversation-Related Advertising and Electronic Eavesdropping: Mapping Perceptions of Phones Listening for Advertising in the United States, the Netherlands, and Poland"," People report receiving ads on their mobile device that are seemingly related to previous offline conversations (i.e., conversation-related advertising). They may think that this is because their electronic devices are eavesdropping (i.e., e-eavesdropping). To gain insights into the scope and characteristics of conversation-related advertising and e-eavesdropping beliefs, we conducted a survey in the United States ( n = 300), the Netherlands ( n = 293), and Poland ( n = 293). These countries were chosen based on their differences in privacy regulations and history with state surveillance. We find that belief in conversation-related advertising is a widespread cross-country phenomenon, which is higher in the United States compared with European countries. In addition, between half and two-thirds of respondents believe e-eavesdropping is a likely explanation for it. We find that social media is a main contributing factor through which people hear about and most often see conversation-related advertising. Moreover, in response to such advertising, respondents experience more negative than positive affect. The results show that this is a prevalent and timely phenomenon that warrants more research. This carries implications for the (social) media industry and regulators, as it highlights the importance of transparency and (insufficient) individual understanding of data collection and processing.

"2024","A Study on Mobile Phone Technology Adoption &amp; Usage Among Urban Poor Women in Resettlement Sites"," Digital transformation and the use of interconnected digital technologies have opened up new opportunities across the world and hold promises for enhanced productivity and development for all. However, research from around the globe has proven that urban poor women are less likely to be digitally active, limiting the realization of its benefits. This study provides an insight into the mobile phone technology experiences of urban poor women at the resettlement site Perumbakkam in Chennai, India. A purposively selected group of women from the resettlement site participated in a workshop that focused on the usage of mobile technology. Post-workshop, the shared experiences of these marginalized women have provided insight into the interactions between gender and communication technology at resettlement sites. The researchers discovered that there was a growing awareness and recognition among the women about how technology could benefit their lives. They expressed eagerness to learn more about utilizing the new technology, particularly for economic improvement. However, structural barriers, particularly patriarchal gender norms, have thus far hindered women from fully harnessing the potential of mobile technology. ","",""
"2024","“I am not human without my phone”: How the socio-cultural realities of Liberia shape Liberian mobile youth culture"," Mobile youth culture (MYC) is a concept that refers to the distinctive ways in which young people adopt and use mobile phones. However, most studies on MYC are situated in the Global North, where the lived realities of teenagers are different from teenagers in the Global South. Through an investigation of how MYC manifests in Liberia, this article adds to the growing literature on mobile communication in the Global South. By doing so, the study responds to scholarly criticisms of the assumption that young people everywhere experience the use of mobile phones in similar ways. Based on qualitative semi-structured interviews with 38 Liberian teenagers, our findings challenge the western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD)-centric suggestion of a worldwide “monoculture,” because our results show that although mobile connectivity gives Liberian teenagers opportunities similar to those afforded to their peers in most WEIRD (and non-WEIRD) societies, it is simultaneously experienced markedly different by them. We therefore argue for a more “inclusive” conceptualization of the MYC concept. ","",""
"2024","The effects of fragmented and sticky smartphone use on distraction and task delay"," The smartphone has become an integral part of adolescents’ daily life. Despite the countless affordances of smartphones, concerns have been raised about their enormous potential to cause failures in self-regulation, such as distraction and task delay. The current study investigated whether two smartphone usage patterns, fragmented and sticky smartphone use, are associated with distraction and task delay. For three weeks, we logged the smartphone usage of 160 adolescents (733,359 observations) and assessed their distraction and task delay six times a day with experience sampling (12,723 observations). Using Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling, we found that, overall, adolescents felt more distracted when their smartphone use was more fragmented or sticky. Exploratory analyses indicated that 77% of adolescents experienced increased distraction (i.e., β &gt; .05) when their smartphone use was more fragmented, and 55% when it was sticky. Overall, adolescents did not report more task delay as their smartphone use was more fragmented or sticky. Nonetheless, 22% experienced increased task delay when their smartphone use was more fragmented, and 42% when it was sticky. Together, our findings underline the dynamic nature of smartphone use and its differential impact on self-regulation outcomes. ","",""
"2024","What happens next? The ever-dreaded “knock” and mobile access instability for vehicle residents"," This high-exposure study explores information-seeking via mobile phone usage among a specific unstably housed population. There exists a population referred to as “vehicle residents” who are people earning wages, who have chosen to move into their vehicles as a survival strategy during a time when housing expenses account for more than half of lower-income Americans’ monthly income, and whose situation varies from traditional homelessness in that they sustain some stability in maintaining ownership of the vehicle in which they are residing. Building on previous studies of homeless people and their mobile phone usage, while using mobilism as the frame, this study investigates the ways that access instability, an underexamined facet of digital inequality, impacts vehicle residents’ ability to search for information via their mobile phones to support their daily lives. This study is based on two rounds of semi-structured interviews with the same participants, complemented by a virtual guided tour of participant's vehicles. Among the key findings is that mobility creates and resolves access instability for vehicle residents, introducing the concept of mobile access instability. Overall, understanding the unique features and information needs of this particular group results in a more thorough comprehension of the contemporary housing crisis, which is necessary to improve policy by developing mitigation strategies and resolutions.

"2024","Domesticating technology: Learning from the use of mobile phone of small women rural entrepreneurs in India during COVID-19"," The COVID-19 pandemic and the worldwide lockdowns that followed the same have led to drastic changes in our lifestyles. While the lockdowns marked a global transition to a world of online services and products, the change was neither easy nor smooth for many. From lack of access to technology to the absence of skills to use it, the act of “going digital” was littered with challenges for people across the world. In the South-Asian country of India, this lack of access was further amplified by the presence of a gender digital divide. Among the women from various factions of the society, one such category affected by it was female entrepreneurs from small rural areas in India. These entrepreneurs were cut off from their clientele owing to a nationwide lockdown in the country imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19. Most of these women had no prior experience with technology (which is mobile phones in their case) but they not only negotiated access but used it to sustain and grow their entrepreneurial endeavors in a short duration of time. This study, through in-depth qualitative interviews with female entrepreneurs from small rural areas in India maps their usage patterns and their negotiations for domesticating mobile phones. The research found that the first two stages of domestication theory (appropriation and objectification) were easier to navigate for the women entrepreneurs, but gender expectations from them made the last two stages of incorporation and conversion challenging.

"2024","“Wayfearing” and the city: Exploring how experiential fear of crime frames the mobilities of women students at a city-based university using a bespoke chatbot app"," Personal safety apps provide new ways for crime data to be utilized by citizens within the context of urban mobilities. Yet, high-profile stories reveal the fear many women continue to experience in their daily lives. Operating as locative media, personal safety apps seem to imply that environments can simply be avoided. This is not always possible. Women students attending a city-based university, for example, might have to move through various urban spaces to get to their institution. Using a bespoke chatbot app for recording the experience of environments rather than avoiding them and semi-structured interviews, the purpose of this article is to examine the experiential fear of crime (EFC) that women students attending a city-based university experience in their daily lives. Between May and June 2022, 24 students who identify as women and attend a London-based university took part in this project. Our research first explored the question, how does EFC frame the experience of moving through a city-based university? Second, how does EFC frame the experience of ambulating the wider urban environment beyond campus? The article contributes to the wider field of locative media, by revealing how fear can shape extant understandings of digital wayfaring. ","",""

"2024","Technologies of inclusion and marginalization: Mobile phones and multiple exclusion homeless women"," Little is known about women experiencing multiple exclusion homelessness (MEH) in the UK, and even less about their use of mobile phones. MEH describes a subset of homeless people with multiple and complex needs who experience forms of deep social exclusion. Marginalized and socially excluded women often avoid social services and survive through remaining elusive and invisible. This evasion is reflected in their mobile phone practices in which both use and nonuse are expressions of their limited agency in the face of profound structural inequalities. This study explores MEH women's agency articulated through mobile phone ownership and usage in a UK coastal city. Through “deep hanging out” participant observation and interviews, it illuminates the complex ways in which MEH women access and manage mobile phones. It highlights paradoxical tensions between connection and invisibility; for example, homeless support services provide budget feature phones to MEH clients to ensure their improved safety and connectivity; however, MEH women sell these phones to meet their immediate needs. In so doing, these women reject the provision and discourse of stripped-back, financially compromised UK homeless support services. Through their mobiles, MEH women also engage with social media in uncertain ways, an activity which rather than providing connectivity and access, reaffirms social marginalization. Thus, MEH women's deep social exclusion is both mediated and reinforced by their mobile media practices. ","",""
"2024","Audience perceptions of a speaker who uses a smartphone as a public speaking aid: An experimental video vignette investigation"," Individuals use their smartphones for an assortment of communication and functional activities and in a variety of contexts. Researchers analyzing smartphone use during interpersonal interactions have posed hypotheses and developed theories regarding the positive and negative influences that smartphones have on individuals and relationships. However, there is little research that examines the role smartphone use plays in a public speaking context. The current study uses a video vignette methodology to explore audience perceptions of a speaker who uses a smartphone as a presentation aid at a small university in Singapore. Overall, results suggest that the speaker’s smartphone use did not have a negative impact on perceptions of credibility (likeability/trustworthiness, competence, speaker ability), speaker immediacy, or persuasion. However, there was a small interaction effect when accounting for participants’ degree of smartphone acceptance. University students who reported lower smartphone acceptance perceived the speaker who used a smartphone as less credible (likable/trustworthy) than a speaker who delivered a speech from memory. Additionally, despite reporting significantly less smartphone use than students, staff and instructors did not perceive a speaker who uses a smartphone compared to a memorized presentation differently. This exploratory study carries implications for better understanding normative and appropriate smartphone use in public speaking contexts and provides recommendations for public speaking educators.

"2024","Finding a home in or through mobile phones: Access and usage patterns among homeless women in shelter-homes of India"," With the number of mobile phone subscribers increasing across all sections of society, this paper aims to understand if homeless women in shelter-homes of India have access to mobile phones and, if so, what are their usage patterns. Facilitated by issues ranging from domestic violence to lack of employment to forced migration and even to human trafficking and rape, women residing in the shelter-homes of India have a myriad of stories to tell. Not all of them have been on streets forever and many have the basic literacy to understand how to use a mobile phone. For the purposes of the study, the researchers engaged with women above 18 years of age up to the age of 45 in a series of open-ended interviews to understand their access to mobile phones and contextualize their homelessness within an affordances-based framework for mobile phone access. This paper takes into account the dual barriers of gender and the lack of a home to study the digital divide experienced by homeless women in India, expanding on how both these factors shape their access and usage, eventually bridging the digital divide, and whether mobile phones are required/desired by the women themselves. The study found that the women staying in shelter-homes see a window of hope in their use of mobile phones in the form of an independent financial future or an independent marital life, but the biased perception of using a mobile phone among women hinders women’s access to and use of these devices, which ultimately results in the loss of any kind of opportunity before it has even been explored, perhaps leading to the loss of a chance at a bright future.

"2025","Mobile phones, mothers, and patriarchy: Understanding digital interactions of adolescent Indian rural girls under watchful eyes","As mobile media is expanding its roots in rural spheres of the Global South, and that too among girls and women, concerns related to their engagement with digital technologies are also emerging. These concerns are emerging owing to the belief that women are not capable enough to handle digital technologies and may fall prey to untoward and harmful activities. This study tries to understand if and how mothers in rural households become gatekeepers of everyday digital practices of young girls in the global south through in-depth interviews with girls and their mothers living in villages in India. Mothers are found to be reinforcing the patriarchal norms in the mobile phone usage of their daughters and hence, further the concept of patriarchy in the online sphere. This enforcement might emerge as an important factor in gender digital divide in the Global South.","",""
"2025","Listening in times of crisis: The value and limits of radio phone-in shows"," The article explores the democratic value of listening by examining what listening to radio phone-in programmes and listening more broadly mean to people in times of crisis. Drawing on focus groups with London residents severely affected by the cost-of-living, health and social care crises, the article discusses how participants engaged in listening and discussed its significance. Against what we call a ‘crisis of listening’, namely, a rapid shrinking of the spaces and possibilities for listening and a profound sense among people of not being listened to by the political system, the health system and other authorities, participants appreciated listening to phone-in shows and to fellow focus group participants. Listening unifies listeners around common experiences, facilitates building commonalities and enables the public expression of vulnerability in a period of increased isolation and intensifying individualism. At the same time, commercial and exploitative logics shaping phone-in shows foster polarised debate and delegitimise differing opinions, thus reinforcing a deepening crisis of listening. The article concludes by calling for a reorientation of public life around listening and a reorganisation of our commitment as researchers to contribute to listening as an ethical project. ","",""

We respond to a global north bias in the standing literature on smartphone media and suggest approaches to improve representation of global south perspectives. Concretely, we propose three programmatic maxims as a methodological guide to incorporate perspectives and concerns from the global south more fully. Drawing on long-term ethnographic research in Sarawak, we demonstrate the value of these suggestions by framing smartphones in the perspective of Bornean history as tools for maintaining instrumental social networks more than exchanging information across spatial disjunction. These tools are used differently by young urbanites and older rural populations. This leads us to show how Pokémon Go refracts generational conflicts by becoming the cultural touchstone of the changing political economic conditions of Malaysian urbanization. ","",""

"2025","Sharing is caring: The positive role of smartphone co-use in social dynamics"," Smartphones are increasingly present during the exchanges we have with others in real life. Such co-present smartphone use has mainly been examined from a negative perspective, and research has insufficiently recognized the positive role these behaviors may play in social relationships. The main goal of the current study was therefore to offer insight into the processes by which smartphone co-use may be related to positive social dynamics during in-person interactions. Data were collected through two cross-sectional studies among 1) in Austria ( N = 257, Mage = 32.84, SDage = 13.97, 55.9% female) and 2) in Belgium ( N = 180, Mage = 10.79, SDage = 0.66, 54% female) in 2022. Results from Study 1 indicated a significant indirect relationship between co-use and friendship satisfaction mediated through emotional support and companionship. Only for male participants, the relationship between smartphone co-use and perceived companionship was evident. Study 2 further indicated that this relationship was mediated through increased companionship and perceived emotional support for male participants, but not for female participants. As such, the current study offers an important first step in exploring the positive role co-present smartphone use can play in social relationships among different generations. ","",""
"2025","Mobile communication: From gender differences to value production theory","In this paper, I propose to explore the relationship between women and the mobile phone through the lens of political economy critique and the Marxian theory of value, as revisited by feminist scholars. In the first part, I offer metatheoretical reflections on strategies to revitalize the theoretical framework of mobile communication studies. I analyze the limitations of how mobile (and digital) studies have, so far, framed the issue of gender. I propose an initial paradigm shift in these studies by broadening the scope of gender and mobile communication research beyond the confines of traditional studies on gender differences, moving toward an exploration of the relationship between women and capital in mobile communication. I continue by proposing a second shift in mobile phone studies, illustrating how mobile communication is increasingly becoming human–machine communication and how the use of mobile phones is actually structured as reproductive labor. I then introduce the theory of value, a well-established sociological theory first proposed by Marx and later reelaborated by feminist scholars. I apply this theory to mobile communication, by expanding it further. Following this, I present a third paradigm shift, advocating a transition from studying the social consequences of mobile communication to investigating the deeper socioeconomic forces driving the adoption of mobile phones and digital technologies for women. The feminist reworking of the theory of value supports these paradigm shifts, enabling us to explore mobile communication within the domestic sphere in a novel way, particularly as it relates to housework and digital labor.","",""

While advanced semiconductors have long been recognized as driving innovation in mobile devices, their specific affordances, arrangements, and politics of composition have received limited critical attention. We begin by examining how hardware, such as integrated circuits and other microelectronics, have factored into mobile media and communication studies, and media studies more broadly, and explain how the dominant understanding of them in terms of facilitating compact device packaging, although powerfully true, is insufficient for understanding the range of critical aspects relevant to device hardware. Next, we introduce a framework for analyzing circuit integrations that can serve as a critical framework for understanding the technical design and operations of smartphones and other mobile media. With this background in hand, we then turn to a comparative analysis of the hardware of three generations of iPhones: the original iPhone, iPhone 5, and iPhone 12.","",""
