"2000","Stalking, Monitoring and Profiling"," The advent of caller identification (CID) services has brought additional complexity to the issue of telephone privacy. Federal hearings and other documents written between 1988 and 1996 are analyzed to create a typology of possible harms caused by CID, including the potential for CID to be used in the stalking of women by abusive men.  Four examples of CID usage that led to a murder of a spouse or lover were located through NEXIS searches of electronic newspaper archives. Analysis of these cases suggest that: stalking has not been a common feature of murder cases involving CID; men have been equally likely to be victims as women; half of the cases have taken place in one of the two states with no restrictions on CID; in half the cases it was the misinterpretation of CID information, rather than the data itself, that led to the murders; and in half the cases the victim's CID device was used against them.

"2001","Transaction costs and the social cost of online privacy","Economically, privacy can be understood as a problem of social cost, where the actions of one agent (e.g., a mailing list broker) impart a negative externality on another agent (e.g., an end consumer). Problems in social cost can be understood by modeling the liabilities, transaction costs and property rights assigned to various economic agents within the system, and can be resolved by reallocating property rights and liability to different agents as needed to achieve economic equilibrium. This article examines how advances in high speed networking and data storage have radically reduced the costs to businesses of collecting, storing, manipulating and exchanging large amounts of personally identifying information on consumers, and the policy implications that these cost reductions have on property rights over personal information. A complementary economic and legal system that recognizes individual property rights over personal information is suggested as a way in which to greatly accelerate the adoption of electronic commerce and to extract inefficiencies from the already existing marketplace for personal information.","",""
"2001","An empirical study of the causal antecedents of customer confidence in e-tailers","Why is it that consumers are very confident with an e-tailer such as Amazon.com and lack the same confidence when it comes to a smaller e-tailer such as supremevideo.com? In this paper, we attempt to answer this important question by examining the antecedents to customer confidence in e-tailers, using secondary data. Our findings indicate that the ease of use of a site, the level of online shopping resources, and the presence of a trusted third party seal all positively impact the level of customer confidence. Interestingly, online relationship services did not have an impact on consumer confidence. Larger firms may have a small edge. We also find that there are no large differences in the results across different product categories.","",""
"2002","Privacy, Surveillance, Trust and Regulation","This note inaugurates a new series of papers in Information, Communication and Society, which we hope will run as long as there are worthwhile contributions for us, as editors of the series, to put before an audience of readers who are interested in debating some of the most important and controversial information issues of our time. The topics of privacy, surveillance, trust and the regulation of potentially or actually invasive information practices have grown in importance over recent years in the realms of academic discourse, public policy and critical public debate. A wide range of perspectives embracing many, if not most, of the social sciences, of the more technical realms of informatics, and of philosophy, the law, and other humane disciplines illuminates them. They are enlivened by the contrast, and often the con ict, of viewpoints, analytical priorities and evidence. These topics are nothing if not political, yet too important only to be discussed in political arenas. Privacy and its invasion involve a mixture of subjective perception and structured aspects of relations and processes, and are implicated in many kinds of interaction involving trust and distrust in widely different situations and functions, both online and offline. These include the workplace, residential environments, commerce, government services, and many others. As applications of information and communications technologies (ICTs) are developed, they provide new situations in which the dynamics of these processes can be observed and analysed. These applications give rise to questions about the permissible limits of surveillance – broadly de ned – and of its regulation through formal or other means. These questions are engendering debate as surveillance becomes both a public and political issue as well as a matter of research enquiry in various disciplines. An important ‘bottom line’ is the consequence of privacy-invasive","",""
"2002","Everyday Surveillance: Personal data and social classifications","Surveillance is no longer merely a matter of deliberate, individual scrutiny and consequent fears for personal privacy. It is an everyday experience, run by myriad agencies for multiple purposes and exempting no one. Surveillance is also an ambiguous process, the two faces of which must yet be seen in relation to each other. Numerous data - now including biometric, genetic and video data - are abstracted from embodied persons and manipulated to create profiles and risk categories in a networked, rhizomic system. The resulting classifications are intended to influence and to manage populations and persons. The choices and the chances of data-subjects are thus both directly and indirectly affected, but socio-technical surveillance systems are also affected by people complying with, negotiating or resisting surveillance.","",""
"2002","Elements of surveillance: A new framework and future directions","Abstract This article argues for a wider conceptualization of the meaning and significance of surveillance in contemporary social studies. It has been written in the context of recently published work by Lyon (2001, 2002) who establishes a powerful argument illuminating the social and technical interconnectedness of surveillance systems, and the invisibility of their social ordering effects, in everyday life. The article is divided into two parts. The first examines recent empirical work concerning two domains of surveillance practice, which are significant, and typical of the research findings in these areas of study. The first surveillance practice is that of CCTV in public space, and the second is that which occurs in the workplace. The second part, mindful of Lyon's (2001, 2002) arguments, analyses the recently published work to examine broader ways in which we might want to conceptualize surveillance. It argues that it comprises four elements: representation, meaning, manipulation and intermediation which interact to form ‘surveillance domains’, and, at a local level, are contested, politicized places. Highlighting the role of intermediation, it uses this framework as the basis of an applied research strategy into everyday surveillance practices.","",""
"2002","Privacy, Surveillance, Trust and Regulation: Individual and Collective Dilemmas of Online Privacy Protection","As we noted in our overall introduction to this series of papers, September 11 has in many ways brought into sharper public focus a number of enduring dilemmas about the nature, value and priority of privacy when set against other desired social ‘goods’ – such as protection from terrorism or crime. In a range of contexts, individual rights, duties and freedoms have been more publicly and explicitly weighed against collective goals, such as security and public safety. Particularly in the USA and UK, there seems to have developed a greater public willingness to subordinate long-cherished individual freedoms to such collective goals. The rhetoric of ‘war’ has been explicitly invoked to justify ‘exceptional’ measures in the defence of global security. Yet, a moment’s re ection will show that the dilemmas, contradictions and trade-offs involved are not new. Not only have they been central to earlier wars, they have been regularly invoked in the ght against crime, child pornography and racism. Moreover, they are embedded in the very conception of privacy itself. For, whatever the contextual variety, in no society is privacy conceived as embodying a degree of autonomy from collective norms that would legitimize any and every private act. In addition, privacy is not conceived solely in terms of its value to the individual. Privacy, then, both conceptually and practically, has both individual and collective dimensions. In their different ways, each of the papers in the series appearing in this issue confronts the interface of individual and public dimensions of privacy. Both also seek to question and illuminate the extent to which the problems posed by online privacy differ from those of privacy in physical space. Priscilla Regan notes that,","",""
"2002","Surveillance: The need for research evidence","The two articles that continue the series on Privacy, Surveillance, Trust and Regulation in this issue point up, in different ways, the central importance of research investigations into surveillance practices in a variety of settings. The ubiquity of surveillance in everyday life — as is emphasized in David Lyon's writings elsewhere and in this series (2001, 2002) — requires that the understanding of surveillance and of its implications cannot remain only on a theoretical and generalized level that often fails to distinguish in any fine-grained way among the variety of surveillance settings and practices. Case studies are called for; however, understanding cannot be fully gained merely through the collection and comparison of cases without some well-articulated analytical categories which may serve not only to analyse case material, but which should, in the first place, help to steer research towards relevant cases. David Mason and his associates, and Kirstie Ball fulfil this aim in complementary ways. Both question certain areas of conventional wisdom. For Mason, the latter involves an unthinking 'apriorism' that assumes that surveillance has a single purpose and a set of effects upon the persons surveilled, such that there is little that can be gained through putting surveillance processes under the microscope and observing them in a variety of settings. Taking issue with that stance, Mason and his team investigate surveillance in several UK workplaces in which different surveillance-capable technologies were involved, including call centres, a power station, a print shop, a public health laboratory, a maternity hospital and a council tax office. Far from assuming uncritically what the social and political relations of work 'must be', they thus contribute to our understanding of the workplace as a site where the variable of competition or consonance of interests as between employers and employees becomes an important dimension along which to analyse surveillance practices. Without stipulating a priori the nature of these employment relations and therefore interpreting surveillance or its resistance as an instrument for carrying on conflict, these authors show that the processes and contexts of surveillance are far more","",""
"2002","On the poverty of apriorism: Technology, surveillance in the workplace and employee responses","Abstract Many debates about surveillance at work are framed by a set of a priori assumptions about the nature of the employment relationship that inhibits efforts to understand the complexity of employee responses to the spread of new technology at work. In particular, the debate about the prevalence of resistance is hamstrung from the outset by the assumption that all apparently non‐compliant acts, whether intentional or not, are to be counted as acts of resistance. Against this background this paper seeks to redress the balance by reviewing results from an ethnographic study of surveillance‐capable technologies in a number of British workplaces. It argues for greater attention to be paid to the empirical character of the social relations at work in and through which technologies are deployed and in the context of which employee responses are played out. In particular, it suggests that the resistance/compliance couple is too blunt an analytic instrument to capture the richness of those social relations. It argues, moreover, that there is an urgent need to reinstate the social in analyses of workplace relations just as respondents in the study frequently found themselves struggling to reinstate the social dimensions of work in the face of individualizing technologies. At the same time all parties to working social relations bring with them to the workplace understandings and definitions of legitimacy that have their origins at least partly outside the world of work. These definitions of legitimacy exercise a powerful influence on employee responses. Nowhere is this clearer than in the context of privacy where our respondents’ expectations and understandings diverged significantly from those to be found in much academic literature and social commentary—itself frequently framed in terms of a range of a priori assumptions about the priority attached to privacy at work.","",""
"2002","Privacy as a Common Good in the Digital World","This article seeks to broaden our understanding of online privacy in three ways: first, by drawing out the differences between the physical world and the digital world as those differences affect privacy; second, by exploring how the concept of the 'commons' might help us to understand social and economic relationships in cyberspace; and third, by analysing two contrasting views of privacy: privacy as a private or individual good and privacy as a common good. In order to analyse similarities and differences in privacy in the physical world and the online world, each is assessed in three ways: the obvious level of privacy available; the possibility of modifying that level of privacy to create or choose more or less privacy for oneself; and the degree to which the, prior or contemporaneous, privacy decisions of others affect the amount of privacy that is available to all. Applying an analysis based on the 'tragedy of the commons', the article concludes that at least part of cyberspace can be conceived as a 'commons' and that personal information flows could be considered a 'common pool resource' within that commons. Based on the likely calculations that individuals and organizations will make about collection and uses of personal information, the article next evaluates what would be the most effective policy approach to ensure that the common pool resource of personal information is not overused and degraded. The article concludes that a policy approach of providing individuals with a private means, either through property rights or some means of redressing their grievances, is unlikely to provide an effective means of protecting the common pool resource of personal information. A policy approach that acknowledges the common good basis of privacy and views personal information as a common pool resource provides an alternative view of the policy problems and offers suggestions in terms of rules and institutions that may be effective in addressing those problems.","",""
"2002","Data Retention and the Panoptic Society: The Social Benefits of Forgetfulness","Modern information systems not only capture a seemingly endless amount of transactional data, but also tend to retain it for indefinite periods of time. We argue that privacy policies must address not only collection and access to transactional information, but also its timely disposal. One unintended side effect of data retention is the disappearance of social forgetfulness, which allows individuals a second chance, the opportunity for a fresh start in life. We examine three domains in which social policy has explicitly recognized the importance of such a principle: bankruptcy law, juvenile crime records, and credit reports. In each case, we frame the issue in terms of the social benefits of forgetfulness, rather than in terms of individual privacy protection. We examine how different policy approaches to privacy might handle the retention of data and propose a comprehensive policy that includes a variety of strategies. The broad conclusion of the article is that data retention and disposal should be addressed as a part of a broader and comprehensive policy approach, rather than in a piecemeal fashion or as an afterthought.","",""
"2002","Toward a Typology of Internet Users and Online Privacy Concerns","Traditional typologies of consumer privacy concern suggest that consumers fall into three distinct groups: One-fourth of consumers are not concerned about privacy, one-fourth are highly concerned, and half are pragmatic, in that their concerns about privacy depend on the situation presented. This study examines online users to determine whether types of privacy concern online mirror the offline environment. An e-mail survey of online users examined perceived privacy concerns of 15 different situations involving collection and usage of personally identifiable information. Results indicate that the vast majority of online users are pragmatic when it comes to privacy. Further analysis of the data suggested that online users can be segmented into four distinct groups, representing differing levels of privacy concern. Distinct demographic differences were seen. Persons with higher levels of education are more concerned about their privacy online than persons with less education. Additionally, persons over the age of 45 years tended to be either not at all concerned about privacy or highly concerned about privacy. Younger persons tended to be more pragmatic. Content and policy implications are provided.","",""
"2002","Using the Content of Online Privacy Notices to Inform Public Policy: A Longitudinal Analysis of the 1998-2001 U.S. Web Surveys","In the United States, Congress has had a long-standing interest in consumer privacy and the extent to which company practices are based on fair information practices. Previously, public policy was largely informed by anecdotal evidence about the effectiveness of industry self-regulatory programs. However, the Internet has made it possible to unobtrusively sample web sites and their privacy disclosures in a way that is not feasible in the offline world. Beginning in 1998, the Federal Trade Commission relied upon a series of three surveys of web sites to assess whether organizations post online privacy disclosures and whether these disclosures represent the U.S. definition of fair information practices. While each year's survey has provided an important snapshot of U.S. web-site practices, there has been no longitudinal analysis of the multiyear trends. This study compares a subset of equivalent individual-level web-site data for the 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001 web surveys. Implications for using this type of research to inform public policy are discussed.","",""

This is pursued through detailed readings of Foucault’s analyses of urban medicine and the hospital. The article closes by making some general remarks about situating Foucault’s books in the context of his lecture courses, and about how the analysis of medicine may be a more profitable model for surveillance than the Panopticon.","",""

The paper seeks to explore the spatial, social and political relations revealed through studies of the surveillance and exclusionary mechanisms, including banning orders, deployed in shopping centres located on periphery estates in two Scottish cities. It identifies the tensions and synergies arising from the dualities of these centres as sites of consumption and civic engagement, examines the specific dynamics arising from the particular community contexts of the centres and explores how practices of surveillance impact on various dimensions of social exclusion.","",""

In particular, this paper asks whether CCTV makes the police more accountable or more cautious in the exercise of their discretion in public spaces.

These issues concern how the surveilled subject might come to be understood, and how connectivity between different surveillance locales may be examined.

"2002","Should Filtering Software be utilised in the Workplace? Australian Employees’ Attitudes towards Internet usage and Surveillance of the Internet in the Workplace.","The notion of Internet and email monitoring in the workplace is a debatable issue. Some would argue that surveillance is necessary to prevent ‘cyberslacking’ which can lead to loss of productivity and be a waste of a company’s resources. In contrast, others contend that cyberspace is a private space that employers do not have the right to intercept. There is currently a dearth of available Australian baseline research available on employees’ opinions on Internet and email activity in the workplace. This paper reports the findings from a survey, which asked Australians about their attitudes on appropriate usage of the Internet and email in the workplace, and their opinions on filtering software. This study considers whether gender, working for a company which has implemented a company policy, and number of hours of Internet usage in the workplace are useful predictors of attitudes towards Internet and email behaviour in the workplace. This study concludes that individuals do condemn some Internet and email activities in the workplace, such as downloading material that might offend or harasses others. However, participants did not all agree that filtering software is the only solution to preventing inappropriate Internet and email behaviours. Furthermore, this study found that, at least in the Australian workplace, there is a need to begin seriously questioning what is appropriate Netiquette.","",""

Specific programs such as retinal scanning and vehicle preclearance are analyzed according to the differential effects they generate in terms of risk, rights and speed of movement. These differentiations suggest that individuals and groups will be identified in unequal ways, and that they will in turn experience their mobility differently. In the end, the analysis provided here adds complexity to current theorizations about citizenship and identity: it shows that while individuals make claims to new and different kinds of citizenship, state power also makes claims on individuals that do not always depend on citizenship. In view of the manifest inequalities resulting from the mobility control practices currently in use, rethinking of those practices is warranted, and an emphasis on shared burdens would be more productive.","",""
"2002","Reactive Attention: Video Surveillance in Berlin Shopping Malls","The paper examines the practice of use of video-surveillance in Berlin Shopping Malls. The video systems observed here do not seem to be an efficient instrument of social control and exclusion. They are used more on demand for various purposes such as the monitoring of daily tasks and the co-ordination of persons working inside the mall. The objectives publicly claimed by management – crime prevention and the like – could not be achieved because the everyday practice presents other tasks to the operators. The workplace, the personnel, their multiple tasks, their qualifications support more a reactive use of video surveillance than a proactive targeted observation of individuals, even if the equipment would allow for that. It may turn out that the CCTV infrastructure of Berlin shopping malls can be characterised best as test-beds – open for various applications. There are, however, obstacles to this in the form of data protection concerns and the lack of political and economic support to go further (tied of course to financial constraints). Finally, as shown in our study, the social practice in everyday life continues to resist one-dimensional expectations of the technological possibilities of CCTV.","",""

"2002","Targeting the Unwanted: Video Surveillance and Categorical Exclusion in Oslo, Norway","The rise of video surveillance in the United Kingdom, in the form of the public installation of closed circuit television (CCTV), has been seen by several scholars as a contributing factor to the increasing exclusion of unwanted categories of people from city centers, a development often referred to as the 'commercialization' or 'purification' of the city. Drawing from field observations over three years in control rooms in Oslo, Norway, this article discusses whether CCTV systems in Oslo contribute to a similar process of exclusion. To do so, I compare the open street video surveillance system with two other CCTV systems - a shopping mall and a major transport center. The introduction of open street CCTV in Oslo in 1999 did not create social exclusion, but recent developments show the possibility remains. Although drug addicts and young people were the primary targets of surveillance in all three sites studied, ejections varied considerably from site to site. The shopping mall system had a higher ejection rate than the open street system, and was therefore the system with the clearest exclusionary effects. Reasons for the different ejection rates are discussed, in particular the social structure of the site under surveillance and the organizational relationships of CCTV operators to the policing agents connected to the surveillance system.","",""

"2002","New Labour and New Surveillance: Theoretical and Political Ramifications of CCTV Implementation in the UK","This paper examines the implications of New Labour's approaches to crime and disorder on CCTV implementation. It concentrates on the usage of CCTV as one of the government's many initiatives, which are intended to address crime and disorder, including the fear of crime. In particular, the impact of the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act (CDA) - the cornerstone of this government's approach to crime reduction - on the generation of such strategies is examined. The paper revisits neo-Marxist and Foucauldian analyses of the so-called surveillance society through an appraisal of the complex relationship between structure and agency in the formulation and implementation of anti-crime and disorder strategies. Drawing on fieldwork data the paper considers the activities of practitioners at a local level by focusing on the influence of central government, local communities and 'common sense' thinking based on certain criminological theories. It is argued that a myriad of micro-level operations, obligations, processes, managerial concerns (particularly conflict resolution and resource issues), structures and agency - as well as the indirect influence of central government - shape CCTV policy. Ultimately, the creation of new local policy contexts under the CDA emphasise the need to consider incremental and malleable processes concerning the formulation of CCTV policy. In turn, this allows a re-examination of theoretical accounts of surveillance, and their attendant assumptions of sovereign or disciplinary power.","",""

Firstly, this paper will argue that an understanding of street camera surveillance requires a consideration of the operation of neoliberalism at the local level [in this case Liverpool on the north west coast of England] through a myriad of 'partnership' arrangements that have shifted the terrain of local democracy and the meanings of both the public interest and social justice. Secondly, in using case material from a paradigmatic neoliberalising city, the paper argues that surveillance cameras are part of a social control strategy that seeks to hide the consequences of neoliberalisation in creating a particular ambience and exclusivity regarding 'public' spaces. Thirdly, the paper critically considers whether we can understand visual surveillance as a technique for the 'exclusion of difference' in urban space or as a tool that suppresses the reality of social divisions.","",""
"2002","Urban Surveillance and Panopticism: will we recognize the facial recognition society?","This paper explores the implementation of facial recognition surveillance mechanisms as a reaction to perceptions of insecurity in urban spaces. Facial recognition systems are part of an attempt to reduce insecurity through knowledge and vision, but, paradoxically, their use may add to insecurity by transforming society in unanticipated directions. Facial recognition promises to bring the disciplinary power of panoptic surveillance envisioned by Bentham - and then examined by Foucault - into the contemporary urban environment. The potential of facial recognition systems – the seamless integration of linked databases of human images and the automated digital recollection of the past – will necessarily alter societal conceptions of privacy as well as the dynamics of individual and group interactions in public space. More strikingly, psychological theory linked to facial recognition technology holds the potential to breach a final frontier of surveillance, enabling attempts to read the minds of those under its gaze by analyzing the flickers of involuntary microexpressions that cross their faces and betray their emotions.","",""

"2002","Exploring Relations between Watchers and Watched in Control(led) Systems: Strategies and Tactics","Using ethnographic observation within a number of Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) control rooms as evidence, this paper documents the apparently trivial but subjectively meaningful types of technologically mediated interaction taking place between CCTV operators and those watched. It examines the operators' interpretations of the various incidents, individuals and social realities observed. In so doing, the author suggests a number of interesting social-phenomenological processes are occurring. These include: the formation and existence of disembodied relationships between watchers and watched across distanciated CCTV surveillance networks; an operator gaze incorporating care, control and creativity; the existence of hermeneutical narrative constructions among the operators. The latter practice can be empirically demonstrated through the operators' creation of 'celebrity characters', their attribution of pseudo-identities for cameo 'guest stars' and their playful characterisation of the framed action taking place in the spaces under observation. It is argued that such informal tactics, employed to both entertain and relieve pressure, are the unintended outcome of systemic strategies of control designed to induce conformity. They allow the operators to make sense of, bring meaning to and cope with relentless, often disjointed, imagery and with the emotional strain of the CCTV workplace culture. The paper also suggests that tactics are not limited to the watchers. The watched or Stars of CCTV appear to employ methods in a similar bid to manoeuvre themselves around the cameras. By considering the practices of watchers and watched, it is argued more generally that CCTV technology is a social medium, the people, places and objects watched functioning not simply as passive 'objects of information', but also as active 'subjects of communication'.","",""

It goes on to explore the legal landscape relating to public and private use of CCTV to subject publicly accessible space to surveillance in Germany as well as giving an overview of the regulatory systems in France, the Netherlands and Sweden. Drawing from this analysis, minimum standards for effective regulation are explored in terms of fulfilling both the letter and the spirit of laws across Europe.","",""

"2002","CCTV Identity Management and Implications for Criminal Justice: some considerations","The UK Presidency of the European Union called for an expansive, mandatory policy of surveillance technologies aimed at the reduction of crime and the protection of citizens. Research indicates that the efficacy for this task of the technology, epitomised by CCTV, cannot be taken for granted. This paper asks whether the effects of the technological surveillance environment may be more problematic than currently posited in the literature to the extent that they render more vulnerable and undermine the identities of those they are pledged to safeguard. Much of the literature in surveillance studies debates whether surveillance technology, particularly CCTV, has the effects of crime reduction and prevention attributed to it by proponents. This paper goes one step further and through a process of critical analysis explores the import for individuals subjected to the process of surveillance technologies epitomized by CCTV. In particular the paper addresses the question as it is perceived through the postmodernist agenda. Accordingly in the process of critical analysis the paper considers the effects of transcarceration, the phenetic fix and the technological imperative.","",""

It first focuses on the politics of technology and algorithmic surveillance systems in particular: considering the broad politics of technology; the nature of algorithmic surveillance and biometrics, claiming that software algorithms are a particularly important domain of techno-politics; and finally considering both the growth of algorithmic biometric surveillance and the potential problems with such systems. Secondly, it gives an account of FRS's, the algorithms upon which they are based, and the biases embedded therein. In the third part, the ways in which these biases may manifest itself in real world implementation of FRS's are outlined. Finally, some policy suggestions for the future development of FRS's are made; it is noted that the most common critiques of such systems are based on notions of privacy which seem increasingly at odds with the world of automated systems.","",""

In doing so, we wish to interrogate the extent to which these surveillance practices are constitutive of new regimes of regulation and control. Surveillance technologies, we argue, are integral to strategies of risk profiling, social sorting and """"punitive pre-emption."""" The Australian nation-state thus mirrors broader global patterns in the government of mobility, whereby mobile bodies are increasingly sorted into kinetic elites and kinetic underclasses. Surveillance technologies and practices positioned within a frame of security and control diminish the spaces that human rights and social justice might occupy. It is therefore imperative that critical scholars examine the moral implications of risk and identify ways in which spaces for such significant concerns might be forged.","",""

We begin by noting how, with the increasing use of the 'broken windows' policing model to regulate deviant individuals and to secure derelict urban spaces, researchers may be implicated in the use of surveillance and counter-surveillance by community stakeholders. Drawing examples from direct and covert field observations, field notes, and photographs, we demonstrate that there is a significant potential for the researcher to become identified as an agent of surveillance, and as a potential target of counter-surveillance, within such settings. We conclude by considering some of the theoretical, methodological and ethical implications of the researcher's complicity in these dynamics for both the conduct of surveillance studies in general, and for urban fieldwork in particular.","",""

During 2006 a group of researchers from the European Observatory on Homelessness considered the ways in which the increasing surveillance, regulation and control over public space, evident in all European cities, has impacted on the lives of homeless people. In this paper we chart the background to this latest phase in the 'regulation of urban space' and assemble evidence from across Europe and especially from our case study countries – Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, and Sweden. We attempt an analysis of these trends using concepts of 'border control', 'discipline' and 'deterrence'. We also consider a limited number of examples of resistance by and on behalf of homeless people to the imposition of restrictions on public space access. In the concluding section, we reflect on related wider societal processes associated with urban regulation and surveillance and their impact on the use of public space.","",""
"2002","Photographing Fingerprints: Data Collection and State Surveillance","This paper examines fingerprint identification as a mode of state surveillance. Drawing on but critiquing the work of Simon Cole, it argues that the technique yielded a greater, more pervasive form of state surveillance by giving rise to new practices of data collection. This paper also highlights the photograph's role in fingerprint identification to argue for an essential transformation in law enforcement and surveillance practices announced by the intersection of fingerprinting and photography at the turn of the twentieth century. In contrast to traditional forms of visual surveillance, the collaboration of fingerprint identification and photography extended the surveillance gaze of the state in a manner often attributed to the rise of CCTV, enabling the state to bring all bodies – criminal and non-criminal alike – under surveillance. However, the unique capabilities afforded to the state through the intersection of fingerprint identification and photography remained largely theoretical until the advent of digital technologies in the 1960s and 1970s. At the start of the twenty-first century, advanced visual technologies and new media technologies reflect a restructuring of law enforcement and surveillance practices based on the aggregate collection of identification data. This paper argues that the continued photographing of fingerprints in contemporary law enforcement and state initiatives constitute heightened state surveillance and, as such, demands serious critical attention.","",""

"2002","Panoptic Power and the Pathologisation of Vision: Critical Reflections on the Foucauldian Thesis.","This article attempts to evaluate theoretically the applicability of Foucault’s Panopticon to the practices of public surveillance utilising CCTV technology. The first part maps out three “strands” in the reception of panopticism in surveillance studies, suggesting that it tends to fall into one of three broad kinds: its wholesale appropriation and application; its wholesale rejection as inadequate with respect to a supposedly “post-disciplinary” society; and its qualified acceptance subject to some empirically-dependent limitations. I then attempt in a preliminary way to supplement these three positions. In particular, I question the logical adequacy of equating visual surveillance with effective subjectification and self-discipline by drawing upon a range of philosophical and sociological perspectives. Philosophically, it is suggested that the Foucauldian thesis may well “pathologise” the relationship between subjectivity and visibility, and thereby overlook other dimensions of our experience of vision. Sociologically, it is suggested that the precise relation between surveillance and self-discipline requires us to attend, in ethnomethodological fashion, to the situated sense-making activities of subjects as the go about everyday practical activities in public settings.","",""

The electronic monitoring of offenders represents just one section of the expanding industry in 'techno-corrections' that incorporates elements of the private security, military and telecommunications industries. The surveillance capacity generated by these industries has diverted attention away from the role of human agency in the implementation of surveillance services. This paper is concerned with the reliance of 'technologies of control' upon 'street-level surveillance' which involves a shift in focus away from the capacity of surveillance technologies and towards the actions of agents of control, offenders and the local community, in ensuring the successful operation of electronic monitoring services.","",""

It then argues that there are important differences amongst the ways in which several such technologies construct and use identificatory artefacts, their orientations to human subjectivity, and their role in the governmentality of citizens and others. The paper then describes the novel and powerful form of bio-surveillance offered by DNA profiling and illustrates this by reference to an ongoing empirical study of the police uses of the UK National DNA Database for the investigation of crime. It is argued that DNA profiling and databasing enable the construction of a ‘closed circuit’ of surveillance of a defined population.","",""

In addition to providing empirical data, this paper argues that it is tempting for Australian scholars, and those elsewhere, to view the UK 'surveillance revolution' as the harbinger of inevitable global trends sweeping across jurisdictions. However analysis of the Australian data suggests that the deployment of CCTV in other national contexts may follow substantially divergent patterns. While the Australian CCTV experience follows many trends exhibited in other nations, it is nevertheless significant that the diffusion of CCTV in Australia has been more restrained than in the UK. We suggest that the divergence between the UK and Australian experiences resides in contrasting political structures and the consequent variation in the strength of debate and resistance at the local level.","",""

Surveillance may involve physical watching, but today it is more likely to be automated. Thus it makes personal data visible to organizations, even if persons are in transit, and it also allows for comparing and classifying data.

In this paper, we investigate three developments in somatic surveillance: nanotechnology systems for soldiers on the battlefield, commercial body-monitoring systems for health purposes, and radio-frequency identification (RFID) implants for identification of hospital patients. The argument is that in present and projected forms, somatic surveillance systems abstract bodies and physiological systems from social contexts, facilitating hyper-individualized control and the commodification of life functions.","",""

"2002","The impact of institutional surveillance technologies on student behaviour","Contemporary education institutions are increasingly investing fiscal and human resources to further develop their online infrastructure in order to enhance flexible learning options and the overall student learning experience. Coinciding with the implementation of these technologies has been the centralisation of data and the emergence of online activities that have afforded the capacity for more intimate modes of surveillance by both the institution and education practitioner. This study offers an initial investigation into the impact of such modes of surveillance on student behaviours. Both internal and external students surveyed indicated that their browsing behaviours, the range of topics discussed and the writing style of their contributions made to asynchronous discussion forums are influenced by the degree to which such activities are perceived to be surveyed by both the institution and teaching staff. The analyses deriving from this data are framed within Foucault's works on surveillance and self governance. This paper discusses the implications of this new mode of governance for learning and teaching and suggests areas of further investigations.","",""

The ERA was pivotal insofar as it precipitated what has been a relentless neo-liberal political campaign to legitimise 'choice' for parents and place 'power' within Schools. However, the use of school technologies that focus on 'assessment' and 'inspection', can, in this policy climate, become a means of surveillance and enforcement of morality and educational practice in the United Kingdom. Smart (1985) argues that the work of Michel Foucault (1977) can be characterised as 'neo-Marxist' and subsequently offers a set of theoretical strategies for understanding how policy discourses on education construct and control children's experiences and their identities, as constructed objects/subjects of knowledge.","",""

It starts from the observation that a growing number of Hollywood films are not only using (fake) CCTV images within their narrative, but are actually developing 'rhetorics of surveillance'. Following the argument of Thomas Y. Levin, contemporary Hollywood film is increasingly fascinated with (the images of) video surveillance. This fascination can be explained with the use of 'real time' and a shift from spatial to temporal indexicality in these movies. The paper then takes a closer look at three recent films: Tony Scott's Enemy of the State, Steven Spielberg's Minority Report and David Fincher's Panic Room. The role and uses of CCTV imagery in these films are analyzed; the role of the heroine under surveillance is examined; modes of (im-)possible resistance against CCTV are discussed.","",""
"2002","Digital Technology and the Market for Political Surveillance","Many new media technologies, such as the internet, serve both as a tool for organizing public commons and as a tool for surveilling private lives. This paper addresses the manner in which such technological innovations have enabled a dramatically expanded market for public policy opinion data, and explores the potential role of that market in facilitating panoptic regimes of both private and state surveillance. Whereas information about public policy opinion used to be highly reductive, expensive to collect, and restricted to a limited number of powerful political actors, today it is much less expensive, highly nuanced, and widely available. Pollsters now also have the ability to extrapolate political information from our commercial and noncommercial activities. We investigate the work of two organizations, a public policy polling firm named Grapevine Polling, and an advocacy consulting firm named United Campaigns. We find that both the increased sophistication of these firms' methods and the reduced cost of increasingly personalized data together have the potential to undermine the very public sphere that digital media were hoped to reinvigorate. Moreover, overlapping state and private demand for the products of such pollsters reflects the extent to which politics and the marketplace are increasingly intertwined and inseparable under the current articulation of democracy in the US.","",""

"2002","Behind the Screens: Examining Constructions of Deviance and Informal Practices among CCTV Control Room Operators in the UK","Hitherto, limited empirical research has focussed on the micro-level dynamics and social interactions forming a typical CCTV control room's everyday operational culture. As such, the 'human element' behind the monitoring of the cameras has been largely ignored in much CCTV analysis to date. Drawing upon ethnographic observation conducted within a privately funded CCTV control room, this paper questions the accuracy of a central assumption made in much of the general literature on CCTV, namely that surveillance cameras are not only controlled and monitored constantly, but also operated effectively and efficiently. A consideration of the types of person monitored, and why certain individuals attracted attention from the operatives, is also given. More specifically, and drawing on knowledge gleaned from studies of workplace culture, the article also identifies subtle forms of workplace resistance occurring in the observed control room's informal organisation. This involved strategies such as time wasting and game playing being adopted by the operators, largely in response to the effects of tiredness, boredom, derision and the difficulty of effectively monitoring up to fifteen television screens simultaneously. Indeed, the findings from the research suggested that the operatives felt alienated from their job, due to the imprisoning confines of the CCTV control room, the long hours worked, the high expectation levels placed upon them and the low pay and lack of acclamation received from their employers. Reflecting on these findings, it is concluded that, taken together, the above factors seriously undermine the effectiveness of CCTV surveillance per se.","",""

Central issues regarding institutional ethnography as a method of inquiry, including standpoint(s), texts and institutions, interviewing, and mapping, are discussed.

"2002","On the 'Pre-History of The Panoptic Sort': Mobility in Market Research.","This article reviews the history of market research to argue that that discipline has seen a paradigm shift during the second half of the 20th century. Originally market research developed as an integral element to the society-wide capitalist control revolution. Its aim was to contain the complexity of an increasingly mobile consumer demand in a number of pre-established categories. Since the 1950s however market researchers developed a series of techniques to observe and make use of consumer mobility. The emergence of these new techniques was coupled to a different conception of the role of marketing. Its role was no longer understood primarily as that of disciplining consumer demand, but rather as that of observing and utilizing ideas and innovations that consumer's themselves produced. This paradigm shift from 'containment' to 'control' drove the development the statistical techniques and theoretical conceptions of consumers that are now employed in the commercial surveillance of on and off-line mobility. Through ubiquitous surveillance contemporary capitalism aims at including virtually all of social life into its valorization process. The conclusion considers the possible contradictions that this might produce.","",""
"2002","The Diffusion, Regulation and Governance of Closed-Circuit Television in the UK","This article explores the introduction and diffusion of Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) surveillance systems in public places across the UK. In particular, it seeks to examine the diffusion of CCTV alongside the emergence of regulation and governance structures associated with its provision. By doing so, it is argued here, that the processes of diffusion, regulation and governance are inherently intertwined, that they have evolved together over time, and that we must place CCTV within its institutional and policy setting in order to have a good understanding of the reasons for its diffusion. Initially, it appears that the CCTV policy arena is relatively unregulated. This is surprising given the nature of the technology and its potential to be used as a tool for surveillance and control. However, a closer examination of its diffusion points to a variety of regulatory mechanisms emerging from within the CCTV policy environment and evolving alongside the development of policy networks. It is argued here, that whilst it may appear that regulation has emerged from within these networks, government, despite limited legislative intervention, remains the dominant actor in the policy process through its ability to shape and influence networks.","",""

The new public space called 'Dundas Square', designed as 'Times Square North', forms Toronto's new civic center, around an urban beach theme with waterplay fountains, that rise and fall continuously, to create a beautiful and restful atmosphere of pounding surf. The space is policed by Intelligarde-International, which describes itself as 'The Law Enforcement Company'. The use of private security guards in an allegedly public space creates some unique problems in accountability and reciprocity in visibility. Unlike the lifeguards of a traditional beach, who are themselves young, playful, and part of the swimming community, Intelligarde alienates itself from the community through an authoritarian desire to be free of accountability. Citizens who go to the urbeach to see and be seen, can be thought of as 'people watching people'. But unlike lifeguards at a traditional beach, who often help novice swimmers be comfortable in the water, Intelligardes are 'people watching people watchers' from a distance. The problem of private security in public space is twofold: (1) a private 'law enforcement company' is not subject to the same checks and balances as public lifeguards; (2) the double entendre of the words 'private security' is fulfilled. Not only is law enforcement of life in the public square privatized, but also the security guards enjoy a privacy (i.e. lack of accountability) that their 'citizens' (the surveilled) do not. This article describes my attempts at using """"Times Square North"""" for its intended purpose, and the resulting problems that point to a need for participatory equiveillance.","",""
"2002","Controlling CCTV in Public Spaces: Is Privacy the (Only) Issue? Reflections on Norwegian and Danish Observations","This paper examines data from an observation study of four CCTV control rooms in Norway and Denmark. The paper asks whether issues other than privacy might be at stake when public spaces are placed under video surveillance. Starting with a discussion of what values public spaces produce for society and for citizens and then examining CCTV practices in terms of those values, we find that video surveillance might have both positive and negative effects on key 'products' of public spaces. We are especially concerned with potential effects on social cohesion. If CCTV encourages broad participation and interaction in public spaces, for instance by increasing citizens' sense of safety, then CCTV may enhance social cohesion. But the discriminatory practices we observed may have the opposite effect by excluding whole categories of the populace from public spaces, thus ghettoizing those spaces and hampering social interactions. Though tentative due to limited data, our analysis indicates that structural properties of CCTV operations may affect the extent of discriminatory practices that occur. We suggest that these properties may therefore present 'handles' by which CCTV practices can be regulated to avoid negative effects on social cohesion.","",""

"2002","Crime, Maps and Meaning: Views from a Survey on Safety and CCTV in Germany","In researching CCTV, it must be examined how people assess CCTV measures against the background of their individual knowledge about the technology in question. Research on visual surveillance needs to ask how they sense and perceive cameras. As cameras impact on spatial images and social perceptions, such as security, people's confidence will not be explained solely by showing that cameras do or do not work in reducing crime. For that it is necessary to look at what expectations people have regarding CCTV and its possible shortcomings. These assumptions provided the research frame for a qualitative study that focused on the assessment of visual surveillance in an urban environment. The study examined what knowledge people actually had about the technology and what meaning was ascribed to the cameras themselves. It seems that knowledge does not inform the meaning, but that the ascribed meaning is generated independently of this knowledge or the lack thereof. The results permit the conclusion that forms of spatial perception that socially produce 'dangerous spaces' have gained prominence. Hazard is then directly ascribed to the spatial context itself. Thus, CCTV seems to be a suitable measure for safeguarding these 'crime hot spots' and is being used as a projection screen for fears and felt insecurities. Although an expansion of CCTV is mostly rejected in our study, CCTV measurement is seen as a suitable means to counter crime in particular spatial settings. The study indeed revealed many contradictions in the individual assessment of cameras in relation to actual knowledge and the meaning of these in relation to personal safety and spatial perception.","",""

The paper deals fundamentally with list-making and its social consequences. These social sorts could transform the most private interests into public matters, recategorizing individuals and redefining their material possessions and property. However the Ontario """"drunk list"""" was also known as the """"Indian list"""" and the story of the LCBO is also the story of how the politics of race become diabolical. This paper thus exposes the georacial profiling of First Nations populations of the northern region and the bureaucratic reinscription of identity by means of then new technologies that enabled specific forms of social sorting: the folding together of lists, supported by inter-institutional cooperation through data provision across sectors, toward the pre-elimination of populations from the ranks enjoying legal access to alcoholic products.","",""

In contrast, the use of the dogs in New South Wales, Australia and in the United States has been the subject of Supreme Court decisions, and in New South Wales, of parliamentary legislation and an independent review by the New South Wales Ombudsman. This paper will argue that the difficult legal issues raised by olfactory surveillance are similar to those raised by other forms of 'new surveillance' in the criminal justice system and that the failure of the legal system to deal with these issues in the case of olfactory surveillance could amount to a dangerous precedent for the regulation of other surveillance technologies.","",""

It concludes by arguing that through there has been some shift towards surveillance practices, there is insufficient evidence that a combination of electronic panopticon and peer pressure is effective and distinctive enough to constitute a credible new model of control of the labour process.

"2002","Data Quality, Database Fragmentation and Information Privacy","In this paper we use an Information Systems (informatics) perspective to critically examine legislation designed to regulate the way private sector organizations collect, store, use, and disclose personal information. We focus on The Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Act 2000 (Cth), which has recently been enacted in Australia. We argue that the ability of organizations to respond to the requirements of this legislation is affected by the data quality of the personal information they possess. In particular, this paper examines one problem associated with data quality that erodes an organization's ability to comply with legislation designed to protect the information privacy of individuals – the fragmentation of customer data across multiple databases owned and maintained by separate functional units within an organization. Given the ubiquity of these kinds of data quality problems we conclude that current legislative regimes to regulate private sector use of personal information in countries such as Australia and European Union member states can lead to contrary outcomes resulting in legislation that is either unenforceable or acts to encourage the development of high-quality, integrated customer databases that have the potential to erode information privacy. We believe that new models able to grapple with management of personal information in distributed, mobile and ubiquitous computing environments need to be developed.","",""

However, the initiative to start implementing and linking CCTV surveillance systems in CBDs in the major metropolitan cities of South Africa to local police services was taken in the mid-1990s by Business Against Crime of South Africa (BACSA). This article, using case study overviews from four South African CBD areas (Cape Town, Johannesburg, Pretoria (Tshwane) and Durban), traces CCTV use as crime control or prevention surveillance, how they were implemented, the rationale behind their implementation and the operationalising of them in terms of preventing street crime and its uses in other surveillance. In addition it also looks at this initiative from the perspective of the growth and commercialisation of the management of these services, and the co-operation and co-ordination structures in partnership with the South African Police Service (SAPS). Furthermore, it reviews the purported impact on the reduction of crime of these systems in CBDs and finally the application of public crime surveillance by the CCTV control room operators (private security) in co-operation with the police (response team) and the role it plays in the observation, recording, arrest and conviction of suspects.","",""

The legacy of authoritarian surveillance poses unique challenges to the practice of studying surveillance in Greece and in other post-authoritarian societies. This point is accentuated with reference to how the history of authoritarian surveillance continues to shape the types of methodologies that are possible for studying surveillance and the analytical orientation of such studies. It also informs us how we might interpret the prospect for resisting surveillance and can have implications for the personal biography of researchers, who have experienced such surveillance. ","",""

The ease with which such data - including sensitive time-dependent location information - can be collected and stored raises clear data protection and concerns. The value such data offers to both law enforcement agencies and the private sector has complicated regulatory responses to such data protection concerns. This has lead to the contradictory situation in which mobile data is used by the law enforcement agencies and the private sector to identify individual users, yet this same information is not considered to be 'personal data'.","",""
"2002","Privacy Outside the Castle: Surveillance Technologies and Reasonable Expectations of Privacy in Canadian Judicial Reasoning","In recent years U.S. police have been given greater surveillance powers in response to perceived threats from crime, drugs, and terrorism. Several legal and criminal events have facilitated a reevaluation of the balance between police surveillance authority and civil privacy protection. In the post-9/11 era, changes in federal law, court interpretation of privacy safeguards, and technological advances have expanded the circumstances and methods by which the police may engage in surveillance of civil activities. This paper examines the factors contributing to the escalation in police surveillance and its effects on privacy rights and civil life. The analysis suggests that increasing police surveillance has diminished individual privacy protections and impacted aspects of civil life.","",""

In light of existing regulatory arrangements this paper concludes that in Canada the emerging Wireless E9-1-1 system establishes a reasonable level of protection for the privacy rights of mobile phone users who choose to contact emergency services. However, an important and surprising issue was raised in the proceedings regarding the obligation of wireless service providers offering prepaid mobile phone service to obtain verifiable subscriber records from their customers. This paper provides details regarding the issue and contributes a number of points to an emerging debate concerning the right to anonymity for customers who elect to use prepaid or other services provided over commercial networks.","",""
"2002","Using CCTV to study visitors in The New Art Gallery, Walsall, UK","The routine use of CCTV surveillance in new art galleries in the UK presents an opportunity for researchers to harness its potential as a powerful observational tool in visitor studies, and recent developments in video technology have created new possibilities for observational research. Recent studies using video observation methods in the UK, France and the US have demonstrated how powerful film data can be, but have also shown the difficulties in operationalising studies that use these techniques. The analysis of video data is in its infancy in the field of art gallery visitor studies, and this paper contributes to the theoretical, ethical and practical debate by discussing a recent observational visitor study using in-house CCTV cameras in the New Art Gallery, Walsall. The study demonstrates significant advances on previous observational visitor studies that have gathered 'covert observational data'. It show how CCTV footage can be used to gather naturally occurring visitor activities in a highly structured way, without disrupting the gallery with extra cameras or microphones and yielding increasingly detailed, useful information. It opens up the prospect of a wider ideological debate about the use of CCTV in art galleries, and contributes to work in progress on a code of ethics for video observation in visitor studies.","",""
"2002","Protecting Personal Data in Camera Surveillance Practices","This paper explores in which ways privacy (in particular, data protection principles) comes to the fore in the day-to-day operation of a public video surveillance system. Starting from current European legal perspectives on data protection, and building on an empirical case study, the meanings and management of privacy in the practice of Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) will be discussed in order to identify the ways in which data protection is addressed in the operation of a video surveillance system. The case study suggests that views expressed by actors involved in the use of CCTV and the organisational and technical measures that have been employed, are related to a number of data protection issues, in particular principles regarding data quality. In addition, the case shows that while regulations (consisting in particular of organisational procedures) pertaining to the permissibility of data processing can be discerned in the practice of centralised CCTV, few indications exist that mechanisms taking into account data subjects' rights were established. Therefore, the system of video surveillance discussed in this paper suggests that different elements of data protection feature in different ways in the context of CCTV. This finding gives clues as to future research on privacy and camera surveillance.","",""
"2002","Little England? The rise of open-street Closed-Circuit Television surveillance in Canada","Social monitoring is often explained in terms of top-down or hierarchal forms of power, which is reflected in the reliance on neo-Marxist and disciplinary society analytical frameworks in contemporary studies of open-street closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance. Established surveillance theories cannot account for instances when citizens themselves seek out regulatory measures in their own communities. Community schemes can precede and inform police policy. Drawing from developments in the sociology of governance, I examine media coverage, government document and questionnaire data regarding the rise of open-street CCTV schemes in Canadian cities, demonstrating empirically how regulation through CCTV surveillance can be generated from above (e.g. police, state), the middle (e.g. business entrepreneurs), and below (e.g. moral entrepreneurs and civic governance). Offering four suppositions that act as a pragmatic framework for understanding the rise of open-street CCTV in Canada, this article is a partial corrective to the reigning theoretical explanations regarding how regulatory projects like open-street CCTV are generated.","",""

"2002","The Public Surveillance Functions of Private Security","This paper is concerned with arguably the most pervasive body of watchers in society, private security personnel. Set in the context of the rapid post-war expansion of both mass private property and private security, the contention of the paper is that the inter-dependency between these two industries is key to understanding the significance of surveillance as a form of governance in privatised urban spaces. Drawing on an empirical study of private security in three settings: a cultural centre, a shopping centre and a retail and leisure complex, it is argued that surveillance practices represented much more than an approach to policing and crime prevention in these venues, and were central to broader management strategies for the three centres. These surveillance practices also became the basis for collaborative working with the police. In the conclusion, a number of concerns are raised with respect to the policing aspects of surveillance, in relation to both commercial and public policing objectives and the human rights and civil liberties being eroded along the way.","",""
"2002","Secured and Sorted Mobilities: Examples from the Airport.","Surveillance is increasingly focused upon mobility. Be it in cities, shopping malls or outdoor 'public' spaces, surveillance is now able to track and monitor peoples movements. In recent years the most diverse forms of surveillance have been found at airports, yet paradoxically these spaces remain largely invisible within surveillance studies literature. This paper discusses a taxonomy of surveillance at the airport where several scales of mobility intersect – the global movements of international travel to local scale terminal activity. These are put under surveillance by techniques such as the passport and modern CCTV technologies. This paper illustrates the surveillant sorting that is perhaps most illustrative of airport surveillance, where airports can be seen to act as filters (Lyon, 2003) to the mobilities that pass through them. Using an Actor Network Theory (ANT) approach, trends to monitor the 'means of terrorism' are discussed in regard to the monitoring of objects and actors. The paper continues to critique the way by which we tend to focus chiefly upon the human subject of surveillance, often disregarding the surveillance of non-human actors.","",""

The rhizomatic expansion of late modern ‘surveillant assemblages’ is purported not only to enable important transformations in the purpose and intention of surveillance practices, but to facilitate a partial democratization of surveillance hierarchies. Seeking to account for the forces and desires which give rise to, and sustain, surveillant assemblages, this paper explicates the workings of a dialectic embedded in many surveillance practices to reveal a polarization effect involving the simultaneous leveling and solidification of hierarchies. Empirical data from the intensification of welfare monitoring are presented to illustrate the dialectics of surveillance practices as processes of social control.","",""

"2002","Types of Self-Surveillance: from abnormality to individuals ‘at risk’.","The major objective of this article is to inquire into the kind of subjectivity produced by surveillance practices. The analysis begins by questioning a certain understanding, widespread in the literature of new surveillance technologies, of Foucault’s conceptions of power and surveillance. In brief, this understanding privileges the surveillance of many by few, of ‘us’ by ‘them’. We contend, instead, that Foucault stressed in diverse books and articles the nexus between power relations and practices of the care of the self. Hence, techniques of surveillance are necessarily related to practices of self-surveillance. This theoretical framework constitutes the basis for differentiating two historically distinct types of self-surveillance: the first, proper to disciplinary society, is promoted by normalizing power; the second is associated to the increasing relevance of the epidemiological concept of risk in the problematizing of health-related behaviors. Epidemiology of risk factors, medical testing and genetics are opening up a temporal gap between the diagnostic of illnesses/diseases and their subjective symptoms. This gap is equivalent to a space for individual ‘pre-emptive’ action against possible illnesses/diseases.","",""

It seeks to merge the social policy analysis of Mutual Obligation with a surveillance perspective in order to delve deeper into the underlying nature of the policy and its implications for people who are unemployed. It does this by 1. outlining the neo-liberal political theory underlying these policies; 2. illustrating the nature and extent of surveillance of people in receipt of income support, and 3. employing Foucault's concepts of the technologies of domination and the self to highlight the controlling and coercive aspects of Mutual Obligation in achieving certain of the Government's political and policy objectives. In doing so, the analysis will make visible something of the power exerted over the disadvantaged while subject to such surveillance.","",""
"2002","What's New About the """"New Surveillance""""? Classifying for Change and Continuity.","A critique of the dictionary definition of surveillance as 'close observation, especially of a suspected person'; is offered. Much surveillance is applied categorically and beyond persons to places, spaces, networks and categories of person and the distinction between self and other surveillance can be blurred. Drawing from characteristics of the technology, the data collection process and the nature of the data, this article identifies 28 dimensions that are useful in characterizing means of surveillance. These dimensions highlight the differences between the new and traditional surveillance and offer a way to capture major sources of variation relevant to contemporary social, ethical and policy considerations. There can be little doubt that major changes have occurred. However the normative implications of this are mixed and dependent on the technology in question and evaluative framework. The concept of surveillance slack is introduced. This involves the extent to which a technology is applied, rather than the absolute amount of surveillance. A historical review of the jagged development of telecommunications for Western democratic conceptions of individualism is offered. This suggests the difficulty of reaching simple conclusions about whether the protection of personal information is decreasing or increasing.","",""

Based on our observations, we are going to present a typology of different uses of CCTV systems: (1) access control, (2) conduct control, (3) registering evidence, (4) flow control and the planning of deployment. As a conclusion, we will have a look at some future trends in the use of CCTV in railway stations, focussing on (a) individualization, (b) automation, and (c) commodification.

"2002","CCTV, Risk Management and Regulation Mechanisms in Publicly-Used Places: a Discussion Based on Swiss Examples","This paper focuses on the relations between different types of actors involved in both conceiving and using video-surveillance systems. More specifically, it deals with the reasons that support the growing use of video-surveillance systems, and the organisation structures and implementation schemes that are designed to cope with them. The analysis raises issues linked to the complexity of social and spatial relations that CCTV tends to produce. Based on four Swiss case studies chosen in function of different objectives (risks), different types of public spaces that are under surveillance (city centre, motorway, industrial zone, public transport), as well as different stages of completion of a CCTV project, the main results are to document new categories of actors: the definition of the relationship between CCTV-providers and end-users must be enlarged. Many more actors are playing important roles in terms of risk management and decision making while designing and implementing CCTV systems. Risks under surveillance: different types of risks are under surveillance. The study is underlining that different forms of surveillance must be distinguished, given the spatial characteristics of every risk (diffuse, located, specific and/or territorialized). The 'distancing effect': CCTV obviously creates distance between the object and the place where surveillance is actually made. To go a bit further, the paper claims that several kinds of distancing effects should be considered. These distancing effects modify both the quality of places under surveillance and the general context where mechanisms can be designed and implemented for a better public regulation of CCTV uses.","",""
"2002","A Comparison of the Impact of Protective and Preservative Video Surveillance on Urban Territoriality: the case of Switzerland","This paper focuses on a comparison between two forms of video-surveillance and their consequences for the territoriality of public space users: the preservative, which aims to preserve public order and to prevent 'anti-social' behaviour; and the protective, which protect specific risk-points like buildings or objects. The fundamental difference between preservative and protective surveillance is linked to the spatial logic of its functioning, that can be deduced both from the position of the cameras and the general orientation of its view. Following Lefebvre and Raffestin, it argues that these socio-spatial relationships of social players may be considered as an inherent part of public space. In consequence, their transformation directly affects the qualities of public space. These theoretical explored are illustrated with a cartographical study of the cameras within the city centre of Geneva and a study of public sensitivity and perception of video surveillance in the Swiss city of Olten.","",""

Technologies of suspicion are predicated upon a framework of trust; they are deployed within a “system of takings-for-granted” that presupposes trust and thus makes distrust possible. Drug-testing provides an excellent example of the institutionalization of distrust through the deployment of technologies of suspicion not only within institutions but beyond their real and virtual walls. The paper considers the also considers the decentralization and deinstitutionalization of distrust, the capillary dispersion of suspicion throughout the carceral society, and the role of distrust in underwriting the development of certain kinds of knowledge systems and technologies, forms of social and cognitive order, and the functional dispersion of police practices to individuals such as parents, teachers, and peers. Studying why bio-surveillance modalities should diffuse despite their unreliability and their contribution to a generalized climate of suspicion enables the characterization of certain features of the post-sovereign subject in a post-disciplinary regime.","",""

It begins with the use of fieldwork techniques in the early 1970's exploring the configuration of Britain's Post Office Towers – these were ostensibly the microwave links through which Britain's long distance telephone calls were made. This modelling process revealed a system within the system of microwave towers linked to the American Base of Menwith Hill in the North York Moors. All the key researchers were then promptly arrested, a raid by Special Branch on the author's university at Lancaster ensued and later a show trail for the other main researchers, most notably Duncan Campbell. Eventually in 1988, Duncan wrote up the ECHELON story, which for its time was an incredible piece of detective work using materials lifted from waste bins by the women activists campaigning around the Menwith Hill Base. Little notice was taken until 1997 when an obscure book by Nicky Hager, Secret Power explained the role and function of ECHELON in more depth. The author represented these findings in a policy report to the European Parliament on the technology of political control that led to a process of political debate and disagreement of the ethics of such a system which continues even today.","",""

CCTV systems prevail in both private and public space. Since 2000, a Code of Practice has required that signage is clearly deployed to advise of the existence of those systems wherever they are in use. Throughout 2002, examples of that signage were captured photographically, culminating in an exhibition of this material in October of that year. While arguing that the signage works closely in conjunction with the technological systems to which it refers, this paper focuses on this textual superstructure, using a Foucauldian approach as a means of shaping the discussion. It concludes that the signage itself has a number of possible effects. Most significantly, it argues that these texts, outwith the technological structures to which they refer, actively and substantially facilitate the 'automatic functioning of power'.","",""

However, the issue has not been specifically studied in the country. Research on surveillance cameras in Brazil has generally focused on cities and security. The debate on urban gentrification or private security has usually included the issue of CCTVs as a built-in element. The analysis presented here, based on data coming from research work carried out between 2002 and 2005, focuses on the installation of surveillance cameras in a public park in the central region of the city of São Paulo (Brazil). A multiplicity of discursive elements circulating in the country is analyzed, following an approach influenced by the work of Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze. Based on this case study, it is possible to notice that cameras actually take part in a process of gentrification and are also related to new knowledge about security and its privatization. Cameras are also analyzed here as a part of the mechanisms of the functioning of power, and their contemporary changes.","",""

Inevitably, either perspective is limited. Here I will attempt to break down this dichotomy by, firstly, drawing on the notion of discursive positioning to: analyse the cultural discourses which """"produce"""" paranoia; examine how subjects (i.e. individuals, communities, societies etc.) become positioned by others as paranoid; and explore the effects of such positioning. Secondly, I will investigate the discursive positions through which people may position themselves as paranoid and describe some of the effects of such positioning.

"2002","‘Cam Era’ — the contemporary urban Panopticon.","Deriving from Foucault’s work, space is understood to be crucial in explaining social power relations. However, not only is space crucial to the exercise of power but power also creates a particular kind of space. Through surveillance cameras the panoptic technology of power is electronically extended. The article examines parallelisms and differences with the Panopticon and contemporary cities: visibility, unverifiability, contextual control, absence of force and internalisation of control. Surveillance is examined as an emotional event, which is often ambivalent or mutable, without sound dynamic of security and insecurity nor power and resistance. Control seems to become dispersed and the ethos of mechanistic discipline replaced by flexible power structures. Surveillance becomes more subtle and intense, fusing material urban space and cyberspace. This makes it impossible to understand the present forms of control via analysing physical space. Rather, space is to be understood as fundamentally social, mutable, fluid and unmappable – ‘like a sparkling water’. The meaning of documentary accumulation changes with the ‘digital turn’ which enables social sorting. The popularity of ‘webcams’ demonstrate that there is also fascination in being seen. The amount of the visual representations expands as they are been circulated globally. Simultaneously the individuals increasingly ‘disappear’ in the ‘televisualisation’ of their lives. The individual urban experience melts to the collective imagination of the urban. It is argued that CCTV is a bias: surveillance systems are presented as ‘closed’ but, eventually, are quite the opposite. We are facing ‘the cam era’ – an era of endless representations.","",""
"2002","An interrupted transmission? Processes of CCTV implementation and the impact of human agency","This paper examines the processes that bring about the creation of new public-space CCTV schemes. Through an appraisal of the grounded activities of the practitioners who make decisions over CCTV, the role of agency is identified as a particularly strong, yet relatively neglected, influence on its implementation. Moreover, beyond dichotomised notions of central structures and local agency, an understanding is developed of the complex interaction between the individual actors involved in CCTV dissemination and the political context in which they operate. In doing so, public policy is identified as the vehicle through which camera surveillance systems become installed and disseminated throughout public space. Moreover, these various forces of structure and agency become filtered through identifiable networks of policy-makers, comprising 'responsibilised' actors who oversee the deployment of CCTV. This analysis is used to revisit a range of administrative and theoretical understandings of surveillance, including: citations of CCTV as an evaluated response to crime; the attribution of power- and interest-based agendas to its implementation; and accounts which locate CCTV expansion within various evolving societal processes. Drawing on qualitative fieldwork data gathered during doctoral research, the paper considers the activities of practitioners at a local level and identifies crucial contexts, drivers and negotiations on which expanding surveillance is contingent. Ultimately, it is argued that the process of CCTV installation – from conception to material implementation – is disrupted and mediated by a range of micro-level operations, obligations, processes, managerial concerns (particularly conflict resolution and resource issues), structures and agency, and the indirect influence of central government. These not only arbitrate over whether the CCTV becomes installed, but also generate a range of additional uses for the cameras, many of which are performed before they are even switched on. This emphasises the need to consider the processes that enable and constrain the actions of those making decisions over CCTV and demonstrates how no single interest becomes solely participant in the deployment of surveillance. Finally, because of the centrality and contingency of both human agency and the structural contexts in which it operates in determining the installation of CCTV, questions arise concerning the importance of integrative sociological theories in understanding the deployment of surveillance.","",""
"2002","Increasing the Potential for Gaze, Surveillance and Normalisation: the transformation of an Australian policy for people who are homeless.","Michel Foucault analysed the origins and social function served by institutions such as the prison and the clinic, explored the links between knowledge and power, and the body as a location or site of such social power. In this article, Foucault's analysis is applied to an Australian program for people who are homeless. After outlining a theoretical framework which emphases Foucault's theme of increasing surveillance being used for the purposes of greater regulation and control, this article analyses the changes that have occurred in the program. It is argued that initially the program was intended to assist non-government agencies to provide a range of services, including short-term crisis accommodation services, after which clients would move to independent housing. However, due to the lack of affordable and appropriate houses for clients to enter after their stay in agencies, clients have been forced to stay in funded agencies for longer than is otherwise necessary. Among other things, this program has adapted by providing more short-to-medium term accommodation and case management for clients which, in turn, has led to an extension of the time clients remain in agencies and greater intensity of service provision. It is argued that this has resulted in increased potential for surveillance, control and regulation.","",""

Drawing on the work of neo-Foucauldian authors in surveillance studies the paper shows how the figures of the supervisor and inmate within the Foucauldian diagram suggest different directions for pursuing surveillance theory. On the one hand, there is a concern with processes of subjection and normalization that arise through the internalization of the gaze, while on the other there is a concern with processes of administration, social sorting and simulation that occur independently of embodied subjects. Foucault's model both allows for these twin concerns within the context of the new surveillance while serving as a source of further insight into the empirical nuances of contemporary surveillance relations.","",""
"2002","Management Responsibility in Protecting Information Assets: An Australian Perspective","Information is a vital and valuable asset of all modern businesses. The law has treated information, in most common law jurisdictions, as not being property. Consequently, it is not possible at common law to steal information. In Australia, the Federal Government has recently brought into force a suite of legislation that has the purpose of deterring hackers who unlawfully try to gain access to a computers located in Australia. Further there have been a number of recent judicial determinations that now impose a positive duty upon management (Directors and Officers of a corporation) to implement reasonable steps to prevent a crime from being effected against the corporation. This positive duty includes the protection of information assets of the corporation from hacker attacks and loss of information and its value. Hence computer security is now a board issue in Australia and not just an IT issue.","",""

"2002","Wanted Dead or Digitized","A 16 September 2001 New York Times article describes a vision of the future “in the Brave New World of Fortress New York” (Barstow 2001). A diagram of an expensive but secure Times Square displays camera icons at each major intersection. These cameras would be connected to facial recognition technology that can digitally identify people on the street. According to the article, biometrics are a favorite of each of nine security and terrorism experts interviewed. On 17 September, the stock market reopened, and Visionics Corporation, the leading company in facial recognition technology, finished at number six in CNBC’s top ten stocks for the day. This was quite an achievement for a company whose premier product offering, aptly named FaceIt, is easily fooled by lighting changes, camera angle, beards, weight gain, and other minor changes in facial appearance. Much of the press coverage, however, has failed to adequately address the potential fallibility of the technology, instead structuring the debate over new surveillance systems as a trade-off between security and privacy. If the anti-terrorism legislation is any indication, it seems that “privacy” is losing both the discursive and the legislative battle, even if it is not clear how the new surveillance will provide us with increased “security.” Still, to say that privacy rights are suffering post-9/11 is an oversimplification. Consider a Visionics white paper issued on 24 September titled “Protecting Civilization from the Faces of Terror: A Primer on the Role Facial Recognition Technologies Can Plan in Enhancing Airport Security” (http://www.visionics.com/newsroom/downloads/whitepapers/ counterterrorism.pdf). The document offers an outline of how the company’s FaceIt system can be used to nab terrorist suspects without infringing on privacy rights.","",""

"2003","State-Sponsored Communications Interception Facilitating Illegality","This article suggests that, in the context of the UK and the USA, the uses of state- sponsored communications interception (i.e. wiretapping) practices directed against political, rather than criminal, policing have historically functioned outside prevailing legal frameworks and guidelines. Furthermore, it suggests that the abuse of communications interception by UK and US governmental agencies has been primarily facilitated by the intimate institutional interface between intelligence and law enforcement agencies on the one side, and communication service providers on the other. Thus, any debate around strengthening the legislative protections of privacy in the UK or the USA remains to a large extent uninformed, unless it considers the informal arrangements that have historically facilitated the abuse of citizens' privacy on both sides of the Atlantic.","",""
"2003","The Shifting """"Balance' Between Criminal Investigation and Privacy A case study of communications interception law in the Netherlands","In the past decade, numerous ICT-related investigation powers have been introduced or extended. Have these shifted the balance between criminal investigation and privacy? Do governments allow more privacy infringements for the sake of law enforcement than they used to do? As a first step towards answering these questions, this paper presents the results of a case study of communications interception law in the Netherlands. The study offers a historical analysis of the introduction and changes in Dutch law regarding powers to investigate post, telegraphy, telephony, telecommunications, oral communications and traffic data in the period 1838– 2002. The case study shows that the balance between criminal investigation and privacy in Dutch law has shifted somewhat towards law enforcement, particularly in 2000, but privacy is not altogether discarded. Still, privacy does not appear to operate on a par with law enforcement: it seems a secondary rather than a primary factor in legislative practice. Governments and parliaments should pay more attention to substantiating the need for extending investigation powers, if they want to retain a semblance of truth when they speak of the """"balance' between criminal investigation and privacy.","",""
"2003","Biometrics and Privacy A note on the politics of theorizing technology","Society's increased surveillance needs are accelerating the spread of biometric security solutions (new authentication and identification technologies based on individual physical characteristics). There are two opposing lines of argument regarding the question of whether biometrics are a threat to privacy or not. This paper analyses the two views on their tacit assumptions regarding the nature of biometric technology. It argues that the different assessments of biometric technology involve different conceptualizations and constructions of the technology in terms of its demarcation as a stabilized object. On a second level, the analysis deals with the philosophical issue of technological determinism. The opposition between deterministic and voluntarist views of technology is shaped by an underlying opposition between reification of technology on the one hand, and a conception of technology as a multifactor contingent human practice on the other . In this paper deterministic and voluntarist constructions of technology are considered as rhetorical devices , and as discursive strategies. This allows me to show how distinctions between inherent features and contingent aspects of biometric technologies, as well as demarcations between human and non-human agency are made, that imply particular distributions of responsibility and negotiating space for human choices and values. Examples are presented showing how each construction of biometric technology serves its own purpose in the political process of shaping biometrics.","",""

Given both the nature of online communication and research, those who study internet users and communities may find themselves particularly likely to come across distressing information in their research. Using personal homepages as a case in point, this article inquires: are researchers legally accountable for reacting in some way to the distressing online self-disclosure of those they study? Absent a legal responsibility, do researchers have any ethical or moral obligation to intervene? If an ethical responsibility does suggest itself, what are the barriers to intervention? Finally, how might online researchers prepare themselves for their encounters with distressing self-disclosure? ","",""

Yet it is well recognized within privacy-advocacy circles that ‘privacy’ is a loose concept encompassing a variety of meanings. In this article we view privacy as mediating between individuals and their online activities, not standing above them, and as being constantly redefined in actual practice. It is necessary to examine, therefore, what individuals are reacting to when asked about online privacy and how it affects their online experience. This article is based on data generated in the Everyday Internet study, a neighbourhood- based, ethnographic project being conducted in Toronto, Canada, that investigates how people integrate online services in their daily lives. We propose that there are three organizing ‘moments’ of online privacy: the moment of sitting in front of the computer, the moment of interaction with it, and the moment after the data has been released.","",""

"2004","Closed Circuits of Interaction?","Are CCTV images of such evidential strength that they speak for themselves? If not, then for whom do they speak? CCTV cameras form a growing presence in Britain's high streets. There are estimated to be 2.5 million cameras in operation in Britain, there is an increase in legislation relating to cameras and there is increasing concern amongst civil liberties groups about cameras' effects. Claims are frequently made such as 'if you are doing nothing wrong, you have nothing to worry about' and 'CCTV evidence is clear to see.' These claims depend upon acceptance of the proposal that CCTV images are simply left to speak for themselves and that CCTV staff do little interpretative work. However, to investigate these claims, we need to ask: How do CCTV systems actually operate in practice. How are identities for CCTV images made 'clear', accounted for and mobilized? What work is done to promote the notion that we have nothing to worry about with CCTV? How do issues such as 'surveillance', 'privacy' and 'public' become implicated within these identity production processes? This article seeks to tackle these questions through the interrogation of a single story involving a high-street CCTV system, local police, local residents, a national television company and civil liberties group. This analysis of interactivity (based on a broadly ethno-methodological remit) augments current sociological accounts of CCTV. Instead of accepting panoptic metaphors as a means of understanding CCTV, the article will open up the closed circuit of CCTV through an analysis of the pantopticon in practice.","",""
"2004","Emergency Response Systems and the Creeping Legibility of People and Places","Over the last 35 years, centralized universal-number (in the United States, 9-1-1) systems have come to be the preferred means of emergency-response dispatching. The creation of these systems has motivated the development of information systems that render the landscape, to those with the right access, increasingly legible. This has been to the benefit of those receiving emergency services, but also to the benefit of police and commercial interests, who have used the improved infrastructure as bases for the creation of geodemographic and other profiling systems. More recently, the creation of wireless telephony has motivated the creation of a further surveillance infrastructure built on and integrated into that landscape. One consequence has been the commercialization of the systems in ways that permit the incorporation of more intimate and detailed data into preexisting systems. Public concern with locational surveillance systems has focused on privacy. However, “privacy” may be an inadequate frame through which to understand these issues and to fashion appropriate responses.","",""

Using a sample of Internet users from 38 countries matched against the Internet population of the United States, we find support for (1) and (2), suggesting the need for localized privacy policies. Privacy concerns decline with Internet experience. Controlling for experience, cultural values were associated with differences in privacy concerns. These cultural differences are mediated by regulatory differences, although new cultural differences emerge when differences in regulation are harmonized. Differences in regulation reflect but also shape country differences. Consumers in countries with sectoral regulation have less desire for more privacy regulation.","",""

Responding to such privacy concerns is of key interest to legislators, policy–makers, and business leaders as these groups seek to balance consumer privacy needs with the realities of this new society. These groups, and others, use public opinion polls and surveys to measure the current climate of opinion among citizens. This study examines the language of 43 opinion polls and surveys dealing with privacy and the Internet to understand how these polls define and assess online privacy. Results suggest that polls treat the complex construction of privacy in an overly simplistic way. Additionally, pollsters present many poll questions in a way that may lead survey respondents to express stronger negative feelings about privacy than really exist.","",""

Each of these privacy ideals reflect different sets of social concerns. Laws operationalize privacy in terms of ‘personally identifiable information’. Technologies reify that definition. This has implications for the constitution of identity and social life. It may empower data holders to rationalize populations and create selfserving social categories, while permitting individuals to negotiate these categories outside of panoptic vision. It may facilitate public awareness of, and resistance to, these created social categories. A more expansive understanding of identification and privacy should inform policy discourse. ","",""
"2005","Resurveying Eden","&#x0D;         &#x0D; &#x0D;  The Garden of Eden is the original surveillance state. God creates the heavens and the earth, turns on the lights, inspects everything that he has made and, behold, finds it very good. But then the creation attempts to acquire the surveillant properties of the creator. In Genesis 3, a serpent explains to Eve the virtues of forbidden fruit: “Ye shall not die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil” (Genesis 3: 4–5). Adam’s and Eve’s eyes are certainly opened (sufficiently so to necessitate figleaves), but in the next verse, God’s superior surveillance system has found them out. The power relationship Genesis illustrates has prompted many – the Romantics in their seditious appropriations of Paradise Lost, for instance – to question whether Eden is all that “good” after all. Why was God so concerned for Eve and Adam not to see? For that matter, why was he not there to intercept the serpent, but so promptly on the scene of humanity’s crime? Various answers (that God planned the Fall because it would enable him to demonstrate supreme love through Jesus, that Eve and Adam were wilfully wrong to grasp for equality with the Creator of the Universe, that God could not intervene in the temptation because it would compromise humanity’s free will) do not alter the flaw in God’s perfect garden state.&#x0D; &#x0D;  Consciousness of this imperfection surfaces repeatedly in Western utopian narratives. The very existence of such narratives points to a humanist distrust in God as social engineer; the fact that these secular Edens are themselves often flawed suggests both a parody of the original Eden and an admission that humans are not up to the task of social engineering either. Thomas More’s Utopia and Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner – one the ostensible depiction of a new Eden, the other an outright dystopic inferno – address the association of Eden (or the Creator) with surveillance, and so undermine the ideality of the prelapsarian Garden. The archetypal power relationship, that of All-Seeing Creator with always-seen creation, is reconfigured sans God: in Utopia, with society itself performing the work of a transcendent surveillance system; in Blade Runner, with the multi-planetary Tyrell corporation doing so. In both cases, the Omnisurveillant is stripped of the mitigating quality of being God, and so exposed as oppressive, unjust, an affront to the idea of perfection.&#x0D; &#x0D;  Like Eden, the eponymous island of Thomas More’s Utopia is a surveillance state. Glass, we read, “is there much used” (More 55). Surveillance is decentralised and patriarchal: wives are expected to confess to their husbands, children to their mothers (More 65). Each year, every thirty families select a “syphogrant”, whose “chief and almost … only office … is to see and take heed that no man sit idle, but that every one apply his own craft with earnest diligence” (More 57). In the mess halls, “The Syphogrant and his wife sit in the midst of the high table … because from thence all the whole company is in their sight” (More 66). Elders are ranged amongst the young men so that “the sage gravity and reverence of the elders should keep the youngsters from wanton licence of words and behaviour. Forasmuch as nothing can be so secretly spoken or done at the table, but either they that sit on the one side or on the other must needs perceive it” (More 66). Not only are the Utopians subject to social surveillance, but also to a conviction of its inescapability. Believing that the dead move among them, the Utopians feel that they are being watched (even when they are not) and thus regulate their own behaviour. &#x0D; &#x0D;  In his preface to The Panopticon, Jeremy Bentham extols the virtues of his surveillance machine: “Morals reformed – health preserved – industry invigorated instruction diffused – public burthens lightened – Economy seated, as it were, upon a rock – the gordian knot of the Poor-Laws are not cut, but untied – all by a simple idea in Architecture!” (Bentham 29). As Foucault points out in “Panopticism”, the Panopticon works so well because the prisoner can never know when she or he is being watched, and this uncertainty compels the prisoner into constant discipline. Atheist Bentham had created a transcendent surveillance system that would replace God in (he trusted) an increasingly secular society. Bentham’s catalogue of the Panopticon’s benefits is something of a Utopian manifesto in its own right, and his utilitarianism, based on the “greatest-happiness principle”, was prepared to embrace the surveillance system so long as that system maximised overall happiness.&#x0D; &#x0D;  Perhaps Thomas More was a proto-utilitarian, prepared to take up the repressive aspects of panopticism in exchange for moral reform, health preservation, the invigoration of industry and the lightening of public burdens. On the other hand, Utopia is widely read as a deliberately ironic representation of the ideal state. Stephen Greenblatt has pointed out that More “remained ambivalent about many of his most intensely felt perceptions” in Utopia, and he offers the text’s various ironising elements (such as the name of More’s fictitious interlocutor, Hythlodaeus, “well learned in nonsense”) as evidence (Greenblatt 54). Even the text’s title undermines its Edenic vision: as Louis Marin argues, “Utopia” could derive equally from Greek ou-topos, no-place, or eu-topos, good-place (Marin 85). More’s ambivalence about Utopia – to the extent of attributing his account of No-place to a character called Nonsense – suggests his impatience with his own flawed social vision.&#x0D; &#x0D;  While Utopia is ambivalent in its depiction of the perfect state, more recent utopian narratives – Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World (1931), for instance, or George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) – are unequivocally ironic about the subordination of the individual to the perfect state. The Bible’s account of human society begins with Eden and ends with Apocalypse, in which divine surveillance reaches its inevitable conclusion in divine judgement. The utopian genre has undergone a very similar trajectory, beginning with what seem to be sincere attempts to sketch the perfect state, briefly flourishing as Europeans became first aware of Cytherean islands in the South Pacific, and, more recently, representing outright apocalypse (as in Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale [1986] and Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner [1992]), or at least responding pessimistically to human attempts at social engineering.&#x0D; &#x0D;  Blade Runner’s dystopic inversion of biblical creation illustrates an enduring distrust in both human and divine attempts to establish Eden. The year is 2019 (only one year off 2020, perfect vision); the place is Los Angeles, the City of Angels. Corporate biomechanic Eldon Tyrell manufactures a race of robots, “replicants”, who are physically indistinguishable from humans, capable of developing emotional responses, but burdened with a four-year self-destruct mechanism. When the replicants rebel, their leader, Roy Batty, demands of Tyrell, “I want more life, Father”. Tyrell is not only “Father”, but “the god of biomechanics”; and Batty is simultaneously a reworking of Adam (the disaffected creation), Lucifer (the rebel angel) and Christ (as shown in the accompanying iconography of crucifixion and doves). The Bible’s leading actors are all present, but the City of Angels, 2019, is unmistakeably not Eden. It is a polluted, dank, flame-spewing dragon of a city, more Inferno than human habitation. The film’s oppressive film noir atmosphere relays the nausea induced by the Tyrell Corporation’s surveillance system. The Voight-Kamff test – a means of assessing emotional response (and thus determining whether an individual is human or replicant) by scanning the pupils – is a surveillance mechanism so intrusive it measures not only behaviour, but feelings. The optical imagery throughout the film reinforces the idea of permanent visibility. The result is a claustrophobic paranoia.&#x0D; &#x0D;  Blade Runner is unambiguous in its pessimism about human attempts to regulate society (attempts which it shows to be reliant on surveillance, slavery and swift punishment). It seems unlikely that the God of Genesis is specifically targeted by this film’s parody of the Creator-creation power relationship – its critiques of capitalism and environmental mismanagement are much more overt – but by configuring its dramatis personae in biblical roles, Blade Runner demonstrates that the paradigm for omnisurveillant creators comes from the Bible. In turn, by placing Los Angeles, 2019, at such a distant aesthetic remove from Eden, the film portrays the omnisurveillant creator unrelieved by natural beauty. Foucault’s formulation of panopticism, that power is seeing without being seen, that being seen without seeing is disempowerment, informs all three texts – Genesis, Utopia and Blade Runner. What differentiates them, determines how perfect each text would have its world believed to be, is the extent to which its authors approve this power relationship. &#x0D; &#x0D;   References&#x0D; &#x0D;   Bentham, Jeremy.

"2005","Researching the origins of UK data protection","Our series on privacy, surveillance, trust and regulation continues in this number with Adam Warren & James Dearnley’s account of the formation of data protection legislation in the United Kingdom a generation ago. This article takes us down a route travelled in previous numbers of this journal with the publication of Joseph Fitsanakis’s (2003) and Bert-Jaap Koops’s (2003) studies of historical aspects of communications interception, in that it, too, assembles historical material which casts light on the formation of processes and systems in and around privacy invasion and protection. The story of data protection in the UK has been written about before, but Warren & Dearnley unearth new sources and investigate the public record in order to provide a clearer picture of the politics of regulation and the episodes of obstruction along the road to the establishment of principles, rules, and machinery for controlling what happens to personal data. The policy records of other countries also yield accounts which could be compared with that of the UK (e.g. Regan, 1995). In this context, Bennett’s (1992) and Flaherty’s (1989) comparisons of the USA, UK, Germany, France, Canada and Sweden remain seminal examples of how investigations of the policy process for ‘regulating privacy’ can lead us to think about explanations for differences and similarities. But they can also trigger enquiries about the roles and interactions of individuals, governmental or state organizations and pressure groups in mediating regulatory outcomes. In the case of UK data protection, the central role played by Sir Norman Lindop and his committee is highlighted by Warren & Dearnley. The Lindop report, referred to in the article, helped to advance the argument for a strong regulatory regime, but its recommendations were politically unpalatable. Lindop’s report is worth revisiting for its detailed survey of what was, even in the 1970s, the extensive collection, storage and sharing of personal data in many sectors, including policing and other important public services, and for its delineation of the important issues and possible regulatory routes.","",""
"2005","Surveillance and the human–machine interface","It is a commonplace to note that much of the literature on modern-day surveillance practices focuses on CCTV monitoring of public and private spaces. That literature itself can be said to fall into three broad strands. The first – perhaps the most common and frequently populist in nature – celebrates the capacity of modern technology to ‘make our streets (or other locales) safer’. It celebrates surveillance as a contribution to human well-being, either dismissing the fears of the sceptics or claiming to offer the better of two evils in an increasingly dangerous world. The British Government’s current campaign to sell its proposal for biometrically enhanced identity cards, for example, relies on an explicit exploitation of presumed popular fears in a post 9/11 world. Against this, a second strand in the literature – again much of it advocational – is that which sees the proliferation of CCTV and other surveillance technology as an explicit – and frequently intentional – threat to privacy. A third strand – that which is dominant in the academic literature – while acknowledging elements of truth in the arguments of both the other strands, is inclined instead to focus on the extent to which surveillance technology is rarely as effective as either its proponents or opponents claim. It draws attention both to technical limitations and to human factors in limiting the capacity of CCTV and other systems to realize their promise (or threat) (Norris & Armstrong 1999). A key feature of much of this last strand is its emphasis on the human mediation of technology. Here the concern is with the ways in which technological capacity is limited or shaped by the interventions and practices of human agents. Accounts of this kind take a number of forms ranging from descriptions of deliberate inattention or indolence to analyses of the ways prior beliefs and expectations shape what CCTV operators attend to and even ‘see’. In a recent paper published in this series, for example,","",""

This article argues that, in addition, the role of technical artefacts in shaping surveillance should be taken into account. Through an empirical case study of centralized CCTV, the construction and operation of surveillance from the perspective of the technical, material design of the socio-technical network of video surveillance are explored. The analysis suggests that the application of complex technologies for camera surveillance does not simply augment but also limits the realization of targeted observations. This insight contributes to studies of CCTV and theories of surveillance concerned with analysing the surveillance capacities of contemporary surveillance practices.","",""
"2005","Data protection legislation in the United Kingdom","This paper is primarily concerned with development of data protection legislation in the United Kingdom from the late 1960s through to the enactment of the 1984 Data Protection Act. Following a series of private members' bills calling for varying degrees of privacy legislation, the UK government commissioned two significant reports in the 1970s. The first, the Younger Report on Privacy (1972), established 10 principles for the handling of personal data that were to influence data protection statutes in Europe. The Lindop Report on Data Protection (1978) examined public- and private-sector computer systems, recommending a flexible legislative environment – with a set of broad principles guiding a data protection authority in its development of codes of practice aimed at various sectors of the economy. The far-reaching nature of those recommendations can now be appreciated in the work of the modern Information Commissioner's Office, 25 years after the publication of the Lindop Report. However, the momentum created by the two studies faded during the period 1979–82. Labour and Conservative governments respectively consulted further and objected to additional bureaucracy involved in creating a data protection authority. During this period of entropy, unpublished memoranda and correspondence demonstrated how former members of the Lindop Committee maintained the pressure on government, ensuring that their work was not forgotten. Eventually, overseas legislation and the need for the UK to maintain its position at the ‘crossroads of the information highway’ ensured that the UK, albeit grudgingly, enacted a Data Protection Act in 1984. By that time, the UK had lost the lead in defining data protection law and policy established by the Reports of Younger and Lindop. In highlighting findings from the Committees and efforts by dedicated individuals in lobbying successive governments in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the authors demonstrate the importance of preserving historical memory.","",""
"2005","Information Privacy and Mobile Phones"," Renewed concerns about information privacy and mobile phones have surfaced with the early deployment of location-based services in North America, and specifically with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) led public safety initiative known as Wireless E9-1-1. Initial scholarly research in this area has focussed on the use and disclosure of geographic location information of mobile phone subscribers and on the terms and conditions by which this information can be made available for lawful access or commercial purposes. This paper refers to this body of research as the 'first domain' of information privacy research, and describes some of the key findings and contributions for policy research on customer proprietary information and customer consent. The paper then turns to introduce and describe an emerging 'second domain' of information privacy concerned with the popular adoption of anonymous prepaid mobile phone services. The distinguishing characteristic of this second domain of research is its focus on debates about the legitimacy of regulatory requirements to collect and verify customer details at the point of purchase. This paper draws on findings from an empirical study undertaken in Canada to identify some initial parameters of this second domain of information privacy research with the intent of informing a wider debate about the entitlement to anonymity for customers who elect to use prepaid services over commercial networks.

"2005","When the ‘information revolution’ and the US security                 state collide"," For law enforcement agencies, the ‘information revolution’ is eroding their capacity to regulate money laundering, thereby undermining their ability to combat drug trafficking and terrorism. They argue that without enhanced surveillance powers, these problems will be exacerbated. This emphasis on the control problems precipitated by technology distorts our understanding of the relationship between the ‘information revolution’ and money laundering, much of which has been fuelled not by technology but by the dynamic interaction between technology developments and ongoing changes in criminal justice policy and the US state. An alternative narrative is sketched: the escalation of the US’s failed ‘War on Drugs’ has been a key factor driving both money laundering and the proliferation of surveillance countermeasures. In this context, information and communication technologies have been key resources/sites of struggle for both money launderers and law enforcement. The expansion of surveillance powers will do little to curb illicit action. Indeed, the expansion may escalate laundering as well as erode citizens’ privacy.

I’ve got a good example for you, I’m just trying to think … yeah the worst one I’ve ever seen was the Balga Youth Program where we took these students on a reward excursion all the way to Fremantle and suddenly this very alienated kid started to jump under a bus, a moving bus so the kid had to be restrained. The cops from Fremantle arrived because all the very good people in Fremantle were alarmed at these grown-ups manhandling a kid and what had happened is that DCD [Department of Community Development] had dropped him into the program but hadn’t told us that this kid had suicide tendencies. No, it’s just chronically bad. And there were caseworkers involved and … there is some information that we have to have that doesn’t get handed down. Rather than a blanket rule that everything’s confidential coming from them to us, and that was a real live situation, and you imagine how we’re trying to handle it, we had taxis going from Balga to Fremantle to get staff involved and we only had to know what to watch out for and we probably could have … well what you would have done is not gone on the excursion I suppose (School Principal, quoted in Balnaves and Luca 49).     These comments are from a school principal in Perth, Western Australia in a school that is concerned with “at-risk” students, and in a context where the Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988 has imposed limitations on their work. Under this Act it is illegal to pass health, personal or sensitive information concerning an individual on to other people. In the story cited above the Department of Community Development personnel were apparently protecting the student’s “negative right”, that is, “freedom from” interference by others. On the other hand, the principal’s assertion that such information should be shared is potentially a “positive right” because it could cause something to be done in that person’s or society’s interests. Balnaves and Luca noted that positive and negative rights have complex philosophical underpinnings, and they inform much of how we operate in everyday life and of the dilemmas that arise (49).  For example, a ban on euthanasia or the “assisted suicide” of a terminally ill person can be a “positive right” because it is considered to be in the best interests of society in general. However, physicians who tacitly approve a patient’s right to end their lives with a lethal dose by legally prescribed dose of medication could be perceived as protecting the patient’s “negative right” as a “freedom from” interference by others.      While acknowledging the merits of collaboration between people who are working to improve the wellbeing of students “at-risk”, this paper examines some of the barriers to collaboration. Based on both primary and secondary sources, and particularly on oral testimonies, the paper highlights the tension between privacy as a negative right and collaborative helping as a positive right. It also points to other difficulties and dilemmas within and between the institutions engaged in this joint undertaking.    The authors acknowledge Michel Foucault’s contention that discourse is power. The discourse on privacy and the sharing of information in modern societies suggests that privacy is a negative right that gives freedom from bureaucratic interference and protects the individual. However, arguably, collaboration between agencies that are working to support individuals “at-risk” requires a measured relaxation of the requirements of this negative right. Children and young people “at-risk” are a case in point.    Towards Collaboration   From a series of interviews conducted in 2004, the school authorities at Balga Senior High School and Midvale Primary School, people working for the Western Australian departments of Community Development, Justice, and Education and Training in Western Australia, and academics at the Edith Cowan and Curtin universities, who are working to improve the wellbeing of students “at-risk” as part of an Australian Research Council (ARC) project called Smart Communities, have identified students “at-risk” as individuals who have behavioural problems and little motivation, who are alienated and possibly violent or angry, who under-perform in the classroom and have begun to truant. They noted also that students “at-risk” often suffer from poor health, lack of food and medication, are victims of unwanted pregnancies, and are engaged in antisocial and illegal behaviour such as stealing cars and substance abuse. These students are also often subject to domestic violence (parents on drugs or alcohol), family separation, and homelessness. Some are depressed or suicidal. Sometimes cultural factors contribute to students being regarded as “at-risk”. For example, a social worker in the Smart Communities project stated:     Cultural factors sometimes come into that as well … like with some Muslim families … they can flog their daughter or their son, usually the daughter … so cultural factors can create a risk.     Research elsewhere has revealed that those children between the ages of 11-17 who have been subjected to bullying at school or physical or sexual abuse at home and who have threatened and/or harmed another person or suicidal are “high-risk” youths (Farmer 4).    In an attempt to bring about a positive change in these alienated or “at-risk” adolescents, Balga Senior High School has developed several programs such as the Youth Parents Program, Swan Nyunger Sports Education program, Intensive English Centre, and lower secondary mainstream program. The Midvale Primary School has provided services such as counsellors, Aboriginal child protection workers, and Aboriginal police liaison officers for these “at-risk” students. On the other hand, the Department of Community Development (DCD) has provided services to parents and caregivers for children up to 18 years. Academics from Edith Cowan and Curtin universities are engaged in gathering the life stories of these “at-risk” students. One aspect of this research entails the students writing their life stories in a secured web portal that the universities have developed. The researchers believe that by engaging the students in these self-exploration activities, they (the students) would develop a more hopeful outlook on life.   Though all agencies and educational institutions involved in this collaborative project are working for the well-being of the children “at-risk”, the Privacy Act forbids the authorities from sharing information about them. A school psychologist expressed concern over the Privacy Act:     When the Juvenile Justice Department want to reintroduce a student into a school, we can’t find out anything about this student so we can’t do any preplanning. They want to give the student a fresh start, so there’s always that tension … eventually everyone overcomes [this] because you realise that the student has to come to the school and has to be engaged.       Of course, the manner and consequences of a student’s engagement in school cannot be predicted. In the scenario described above students may have been given a fair chance to reform themselves, which is their positive right but if they turn out to be at “high risk” it would appear that the Juvenile Department protected the negative right of the students by supporting “freedom from” interference by others. Likewise, a school health nurse in the project considered confidentiality or the Privacy Act an important factor in the security of the student “at-risk”:     I was trying to think about this kid who’s one of the children who has been sexually abused, who’s a client of DCD, and I guess if police got involved there and wanted to know details and DCD didn’t want to give that information out then I’d guess I’d say to the police “Well no, you’ll have to talk to the parents about getting further information.” I guess that way, recognising these students are minor and that they are very vulnerable, their information … where it’s going, where is it leading? Who wants to know? Where will it be stored? What will be the outcomes in the future for this kid? As a 14 year old, if they’re reckless and get into things, you know, do they get a black record against them by the time they’re 19? What will that information be used for if it’s disclosed? So I guess I become an advocate for the student in that way?      Thus the nurse considers a sexually abused child should not be identified. It is a positive right in the interest of the person. Once again, though, if the student turns out to be at “high risk” or suicidal, then it would appear that the nurse was protecting the youth’s negative right—“freedom from” interference by others. Since collaboration is a positive right and aims at the students’ welfare, the workable solution to prevent the students from suicide would be to develop inter-agency trust and to share vital information about “high-risk” students.    Dilemmas of Collaboration   Some recent cases of the deaths of young non-Caucasian girls in Western countries, either because of the implications of the Privacy Act or due to a lack of efficient and effective communication and coordination amongst agencies, have raised debates on effective child protection. For example, the British Laming report (2003) found that Victoria Climbié, a young African girl, was sent by her parents to her aunt in Britain in order to obtain a good education and was murdered by her aunt and aunt’s boyfriend. However, the risk that she could be harmed was widely known. The girl’s problems were known to 6 local authorities, 3 housing authorities, 4 social services, 2 child protection teams, and the police, the local church, and the hospital, but not to the education authorities. According to the Laming Report, her death could have been prevented if there had been inter-agency sharing of information and appropriate evaluation (Balnaves and Luca 49). The agencies had supported the negative rights of the young girl’s “freedom from” interference by others, but at the cost of her life. Perhaps Victoria’s racial background may have contributed to the concealment of information and added to her disadvantaged position.   Similarly, in Western Australia, the Gordon Inquiry into the death of Susan Taylor, a 15 year old girl Aboriginal girl at the Swan Nyungah Community, found that in her short life this girl had encountered sexual violation, violence, and the ravages of alcohol and substance abuse. The Gordon Inquiry reported:     Although up to thirteen different agencies were involved in providing services to Susan Taylor and her family, the D[epartment] of C[ommunity] D[evelopment] stated they were unaware of “all the services being provided by each agency” and there was a lack of clarity as to a “lead coordinating agency” (Gordon et al. quoted in Scott 45).      In this case too, multiple factors—domestic, racial, and the Privacy Act—may have led to Susan Taylor’s tragic end.      In the United Kingdom, Harry Ferguson noted that when a child is reported to be “at-risk” from domestic incidents, they can suffer further harm because of their family’s concealment (204). Ferguson’s study showed that in 11 per cent of the 319 case sample, children were known to be re-harmed within a year of initial referral. Sometimes, the parents apply a veil of secrecy around themselves and their children by resisting or avoiding services. In such cases the collaborative efforts of the agencies and education may be thwarted.    Lack of cultural education among teachers, youth workers, and agencies could also put the “at-risk” cultural minorities into a high risk category. For example, an “at-risk” Muslim student may not be willing to share personal experiences with the school or agencies because of religious sensitivities. This happened in the UK when Khadji Rouf was abused by her father, a Bangladeshi. Rouf’s mother, a white woman, and her female cousin from Bangladesh, both supported Rouf when she finally disclosed that she had been sexually abused for over eight years. After group therapy, Rouf stated that she was able to accept her identity and to call herself proudly “mixed race”, whereas she rejected the Asian part of herself because it represented her father. Other Asian girls and young women in this study reported that they could not disclose their abuse to white teachers or social workers because of the feeling that they would be “letting down their race or their Muslim culture” (Rouf 113).    The marginalisation of many Muslim Australians both in the job market and in society is long standing. For example, in 1996 and again in 2001 the Muslim unemployment rate was three times higher than the national total (Australian Bureau of Statistics). But since the 9/11 tragedy and Bali bombings visible Muslims, such as women wearing hijabs (headscarves), have sometimes been verbally and physically abused and called ‘terrorists’ by some members of the wider community (Dreher 13). The Howard government’s new anti-terrorism legislation and the surveillance hotline ‘Be alert not alarmed’ has further marginalised some Muslims. Some politicians have also linked Muslim asylum seekers with terrorists (Kabir 303), which inevitably has led Muslim “at-risk” refugee students to withdraw from school support such as counselling. Under these circumstances, Muslim “at-risk” students and their parents may prefer to maintain a low profile rather than engage with agencies. In this case, arguably, federal government politics have exacerbated the barriers to collaboration.   It appears that unfamiliarity with Muslim culture is not confined to mainstream Australians. For example, an Aboriginal liaison police officer engaged in the Smart Communities project in Western Australia had this to say about Muslim youths “at-risk”:      Different laws and stuff from different countries and they’re coming in and sort of thinking that they can bring their own laws and religions and stuff … and when I say religions there’s laws within their religions as well that they don’t seem to understand that with Australia and our laws.     Such generalised misperceptions of Muslim youths “at-risk” would further alienate them, thus causing a major hindrance to collaboration.    The “at-risk” factors associated with Aboriginal youths have historical connections. Research findings have revealed that indigenous youths aged between 10-16 years constitute a vast majority in all Australian States’ juvenile detention centres. This over-representation is widely recognised as associated with the nature of European colonisation, and is inter-related with poverty, marginalisation and racial discrimination (Watson et al. 404). Like the Muslims, their unemployment rate was three times higher than the national total in 2001 (ABS). However, in 1998 it was estimated that suicide rates among Indigenous peoples were at least 40 per cent higher than national average (National Advisory Council for Youth Suicide Prevention, quoted in Elliot-Farrelly 2).   Although the wider community’s unemployment rate is much lower than the Aboriginals and the Muslims, the “at-risk” factors of mainstream Australian youths are often associated with dysfunctional families, high conflict, low-cohesive families, high levels of harsh parental discipline, high levels of victimisation by peers, and high behavioural inhibition (Watson et al. 404). The Macquarie Fields riots in 2005 revealed the existence of “White” underclass and “at-risk” people in Sydney. Macquarie Fields’ unemployment rate was more than twice the national average. Children growing up in this suburb are at greater risk of being involved in crime (The Age). Thus small pockets of mainstream underclass youngsters also require collaborative attention.     In Western Australia people working on the Smart Communities project identified that lack of resources can be a hindrance to collaboration for all sectors. As one social worker commented: “government agencies are hierarchical systems and lack resources”. They went on to say that in their department they can not give “at-risk” youngsters financial assistance in times of crisis:     We had a petty cash box which has got about 40 bucks in it and sometimes in an emergency we might give a customer a couple of dollars but that’s all we can do, we can’t give them any larger amount. We have bus/metro rail passes, that’s the only thing that we’ve actually got.     A youth worker in Smart Communities commented that a lot of uncertainty is involved with young people “at-risk”. They said that there are only a few paid workers in their field who are supported and assisted by “a pool of volunteers”. Because the latter give their time voluntarily they are under no obligation to be constant in their attendance, so the number of available helpers can easily fluctuate. Another youth worker identified a particularly important barrier to collaboration: because of workers’ relatively low remuneration and high levels of work stress, the turnover rates are high. The consequence of this is as follows:     The other barrier from my point is that you’re talking to somebody about a student “at-risk”, and within 14 months or 18 months a new person comes in [to that position] then you’ve got to start again. This way you miss a lot of information [which could be beneficial for the youth].     Conclusion   The Privacy Act creates a dilemma in that it can be either beneficial or counter-productive for a student’s security. To be blunt, a youth who has suicided might have had their privacy protected, but not their life. Lack of funding can also be a constraint on collaboration by undermining stability and autonomy in the workforce, and blocking inter-agency initiatives. Lack of awareness about cultural differences can also affect unity of action. The deepening inequality between the “haves” and “have-nots” in the Australian society, and the Howard government’s harshness on national security issues, can also pose barriers to collaboration on youth issues.   Despite these exigencies and dilemmas, it would seem that collaboration is “the only game” when it comes to helping students “at-risk”. To enhance this collaboration, there needs to be a sensible modification of legal restrictions to information sharing, an increase in government funding and support for inter-agency cooperation and informal information sharing, and an increased awareness about the cultural needs of minority groups and knowledge of the mainstream underclass.

"2006","HAVE YOU BEEN IDENTIFIED? Hidden boundary work in emergency services classifications","Information technologies, such as the computer-aided dispatch (CAD) system, have fundamentally changed workplace protocols. This paper examines the impacts that the standardized processes associated with the CAD system have on the labour of 9-1-1/police call-takers. Through an analysis of the labour of 9-1-1/police call-takers and their processes for classifying emergency call(er)s, we are able to uncover the negotiated labour between human and machine. It is argued throughout the paper that the standardized processes of the CAD system do not remove the social from call-taking but instead emphasize the use of the social as a resource for classifying call(er)s. The present analysis illustrates how emergency classification is not a standardized process but instead an actively constructed virtual image performed in real space and time by call-takers. It is the call-takers' tacit knowledge and ability to work across the virtual, abstract and material worlds that makes them essential players in emergency response.","",""

Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner Publishers, 2004. xii<b>+</b>274 pp. $59.95 cloth/$23.50 paper. ISBN 1-58826-281-2”","Every now and then a book comes along that is both validating and frustrating. Knowledge Power by Renee Marlin-Bennett is validating because at long last someone is paying adequate attention to information policy issues; and it is frustrating because she does such a great job at covering the various policies, issues, and debates that few could come along and compete without being repetitive. I have the fortunate lifestyle choice that I get to exist both within and as an observer of the world of policymaking. That is, I am an academic who observes the policymaking process but I am also a policy wonk, someone who tries to feed into the policy process. I feel pretty darn smart because I believe that my capacity to feed into the policy process gave me privileged seating to observe the process and thus understand the policies being considered in a way that mere academics couldn’t. Marlin-Bennett’s book managed to put me in my place. She delicately navigates the world of a variety of information policy quagmires, ranging from the protection of the secret formula for Coca Cola, to the use of meteorological data by countries and companies, across to the use of personal data by companies and governments. The academic in me loves the fact that she can do this within a single thread that binds the book together; the policy advocate in me is impressed by her knowledge of these various issue areas that I at least know a bit about, and I am merely assuming that she operates with the same integrity in the areas where I am clueless. For instance she focuses on the significant transformations of U.S. law after September 11 achieved through small regulatory changes to the practices of law enforcement agencies, instead of focusing on the more sexy but less significant changes under the USA PATRIOT Act. This shows that Marlin-Bennett understands the key policy issues and the areas that need greater attention, and is not just recounting what we may read in magazines and newspapers. Her students are much the richer for this, as you will be too. And we need a book like this. Though the readers of this journal are the least deserving of this critique, our collective disciplines are certainly guilty: We pay very little attention to information policy. With our understandings of technology, social actors and institutions, and politics, I have always wondered why we seem to do so little in the area of policy. We are in a position to best understand contemporary politics ranging from environmental policies, intellectual property policies, and even anti-terrorism policies, yet so often we ignore these areas. We are leaving a massive gap open in a world in which we could contribute, but instead it is being left to the lawyers and political scientists who, while they have their contributions to make, do not have the larger understanding of the role of technology and information. Knowledge Power plugs this gap. Policy is seen not as a mere output but as a complex area that is dynamic and often convoluted. Marlin-Bennett reviews a variety of information policy domains and points to the dynamics and convoluted logics that prevail. And then she asks the ultimate question: How does the ability to control intellectual property rights or the ability to regulate the flow of personal information become a source of power? She investigates case after case by going through newspaper articles, reports, seminal academic studies, and even court opinions. This seamless trip from quotations from intellectuals and academics and then onward to political leaders and lobbyists is done with great care. And her ability to incorporate examples and juxtapose cases from countries from around the world only furthers her case that these issues require global attention. She is able to show that all the policy issues involve social constructs, the historical contexts to these policies, the role of Western rules and globalization, and the power borne by those who control data flows and influence rule-making. In a sense this book should be in every university library as the essential reader on information policy. Every","",""

External entities, such as governments and commercial industries, that ‘invade’ people’s rights to be left alone are of less concern now than individuals who voluntarily give up their privacy by willingly providing personal information for other benefits on the internet. Also, in the interactive environment, intended and unintended activities of more diversified and less easily identifiable entities have become more of a threat to individual privacy. In this new environment, rather than ‘providing’ privacy for passive individuals, a more user-oriented, active approach is needed to help users to protect themselves from more diversified and unknown forces and potential loss of control. This article suggests that focusing on the right not to be identified on the network by allowing affirmative acts of secrecy and deception regarding identity and identification might be the most effective-and sometimes only practically viable-way of ensuring privacy in the interactive environment.

"2007","The Architectural Nervous System","&#x0D;         &#x0D; &#x0D;  If the home is traditionally considered to be a space of safety associated with the warm and cosy feeling of the familial hearth, it is also continuously portrayed as a space under threat from the outside from which we must secure ourselves and our families. Securing the home entails a series of material, discursive and performative strategies, a host of precautionary measures aimed at regulating and ultimately producing security. When I was eleven my family returned home from the local fruit markets to find our house had been ransacked. Clothes were strewn across the floor, electrical appliances were missing and my parents’ collection of jewellery – wedding rings and heirlooms – had been stolen. Few things remained untouched and the very thought of someone else’s hands going through our personal belongings made our home feel tainted. My parents were understandably distraught. As Filipino immigrants to Australia the heirlooms were not only expensive assets from both sides of my family, but also signifiers of our homeland. Added to their despair was the fact that this was our first house – we had rented prior to that.    During the police interviews, we discovered that our area, Sydney’s Western suburbs, was considered ‘high-risk’ and we were advised to install security. In their panic my parents began securing their home. Grills were installed on every window. Each external wooden door was reinforced by a metal security door. Movement detectors were installed at the front of the house, which were set to blind intruders with floodlights. Even if an intruder could enter the back through a window a metal grill security door was waiting between the backroom and the kitchen to stop them from getting to our bedrooms. In short, through a series of transformations our house was made into a residential fortress.   Yet home security had its own dangers. A series of rules and regulations were drilled into me ‘in case of an emergency’: know where your keys are in case of a fire so that you can get out; remember the phone numbers for an emergency and the work numbers of your parents; never let a stranger into the house; and if you need to speak to a stranger only open the inside door but leave the security screen locked. Thus, for my Filipino-migrant family in the 1990s, a whole series of defensive behaviours and preventative strategies were produced and disseminated inside and around the home to regulate security risks. Such “local knowledges” were used to reinforce the architectural manifestations of security at the same time that they were a response to the invasion of security systems into our house that created a new set of potential dangers.   This article highlights “the interplay of material and symbolic geographies of home” (Blunt and Varley 4), focusing on the relation between urban fears circulating around and within the home and the spatial practices used to negotiate such fears. In exploring home security systems it extends the exemplary analysis of home technologies already begun in Lynn Spigel’s reading of the ‘smart home’ (381-408). In a similar vein, David Morley’s analysis of mediated domesticity shows how communications technology has reconfigured the inside and outside to the extent that television actually challenges the physical boundary that “protects the privacy and solidarity of the home from the flux and threat of the outside world” (87). Television here serves as a passage in which the threat of the outside is reframed as news or entertainment for family viewing. I take this as a point of departure to consider the ways that this mediated fear unfolds in the technology of our homes.   Following Brian Massumi, I read the home as “a node in a circulatory network of many dimensions (each corresponding to a technology of transmission)” (85). For Massumi, the home is an event-space at the crossroads of media technologies and political technologies. “In spite of the locks on the door, the event-space of the home must be seen as one characterized by a very loose regime of passage” (85). The ‘locked door’ is not only a boundary marker that defines the inside from the outside but another technology that leads us outside the home into other domains of inquiry: the proliferation of security technologies and the mundane, fearful intimacies of the home. In this context, we should heed Iris Marion Young’s injunction to feminist critics that the home does provide some positives including a sense of privacy and the space to build relationships and identities. Yet, as Colomina argues, the traditional domestic ideal “can only be produced by engaging the home in combat” (20). If, as Colomina’s comment suggests, ontological security is at least partially dependent on physical security, then this article explores the ontological effects of our home security systems.   Houses at War: Targeting the Family   As Beatriz Colomina reminds us, in times of war we leave our homelands to do battle on the front line, but battle lines are also being drawn in our homes. Drawing inspiration from Virilio’s claim that contemporary war takes place without fighting, Colomina’s article ‘Domesticity at War’ contemplates the domestic interior as a “battlefield” (15). The house, she writes, is “a mechanism within a war where the differences between defense [sic] and attack have become blurred” (17).    According to the Home Security Precautions, New South Wales, October 1999 report conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 47% of NSW dwellings were ‘secure’ (meaning that they either had a burglar alarm, or all entry points were secured or they were inside a security block) while only 9% of NSW households had no home security devices present (Smith 3). In a similar report for Western Australia conducted in October 2004, an estimated 71% of WA households had window security of some sort (screens, locks or shutters) while 67% had deadlocks on at least one external door (4). An estimated 27% had a security alarm installed while almost half (49%) had sensor lights (Hubbard 4-5). This growing sense of insecurity means big business for those selling security products and services. By the end of June 1999, there were 1,714 businesses in Australia’s security services industry generating $1,395 million of income during 1998-99 financial year (McLennan 3; see also Macken). This survey did not include locksmith services or the companies dealing with alarm manufacturing, wholesaling or installing.   While Colomina’s article focuses on the “war with weather” and the attempts to control environmental conditions inside the home through what she calls “counterdomesticity” (20), her conceptualisation of the house as a “military weapon” (17) provides a useful tool for thinking the relation between the home, architecture and security. Conceiving of the house as a military weapon might seem like a stretch, but we should recall that the rhetoric of war has already leaked into the everyday. One hears of the ‘war on drugs’ and the ‘war on crime’ in the media. ‘War’ is the everyday condition of our urban jungles (see also Diken and Lausten) and in order to survive, let alone feel secure, one must be able to defend one’s family and home.    Take, for example, Signal Security’s website. One finds a panel on the left-hand side of the screen to all webpages devoted to “Residential Products”. Two circular images are used in the panel with one photograph overlapping the other. In the top circle, a white nuclear family (stereotypical mum, dad and two kids), dressed in pristine white clothing bare their white teeth to the internet surfer. Underneath this photo is another photograph in which an arm clad in a black leather jacket emerges through a smashed window. In the foreground a black-gloved hand manipulates a lock, while a black balaclava masks an unrecognisable face through the broken glass.   The effect of their proximity produces a violent juxtaposition in which the burglar visually intrudes on the family’s domestic bliss. The panel stages a struggle between white and black, good and bad, family and individual, security and insecurity, recognisability and unidentifiability. It thus codifies the loving, knowable family as the domestic space of security against the selfish, unidentifiable intruder (presumed not to have a family) as the primary reason for insecurity in the family home – and no doubt to inspire the consumption of security products.    Advertisements of security products thus articulate the family home as a fragile innocence constantly vulnerable from the outside. From a feminist perspective, this image of the family goes against the findings of the National Homicide Monitoring Program, which shows that 57% of the women killed in Australia between 2004 and 2005 were killed by an intimate partner while 17% were killed by a family member (Mouzos and Houliaras 20). If, on the one hand, the family home is targeted by criminals, on the other, it has emerged as a primary site for security advertising eager to exploit the growing sense of insecurity – the family as a target market. The military concepts of ‘target’ and ‘targeting’ have shifted into the benign discourse of strategic advertising.    As Dora Epstein writes, “We arm our buildings to arm ourselves from the intrusion of a public fluidity, and thus our buildings, our architectures of fortification, send a very clear message: ‘avoid this place or protect yourself’” (1997: 139). Epstein’s reference to ‘architectures of fortification’ reminds us that the desire to create security through the built environment has a long history. Nan Ellin has argued that fear’s physical manifestation can be found in the formation of towns from antiquity to the Renaissance. In this sense, towns and cities are always already a response to the fear of foreign invaders (Ellin 13; see also Diken and Lausten 291).    This fear of the outsider is most obviously manifested in the creation of physical walls. Yet fortification is also an effect of spatial allusions produced by the configuration of space, as exemplified in Fiske, Hodge and Turner’s semiotic reading of a suburban Australian display home without a fence. While the lack of a fence might suggest openness, they suggest that the manicured lawn is flat so “that eyes can pass easily over it – and smooth – so that feet will not presume to” (30). Since the front garden is best viewed from the street it is clearly a message for the outside, but it also signifies “private property” (30). Space is both organised and lived, in such a way that it becomes a medium of communication to passers-by and would-be intruders. What emerges in this semiotic reading is a way of thinking about space as defensible, as organised in a way that space can begin to defend itself.   The Problematic of Defensible Space   The incorporation of military architecture into civil architecture is most evident in home security. By security I mean the material systems (from locks to electronic alarms) and precautionary practices (locking the door) used to protect spaces, both of which are enabled by a way of imagining space in terms of risk and vulnerability. I read Oscar Newman’s 1972 Defensible Space as outlining the problematic of spatial security. Indeed, it was around that period that the problematic of crime prevention through urban design received increasing attention in Western architectural discourse (see Jeffery).    Newman’s book examines how spaces can be used to reinforce human control over residential environments, producing what he calls ‘defensible space.’ In Newman’s definition,     defensible space is a model for residential environments which inhibits crime by creating the physical expression of a social fabric that defends itself. All the different elements which combine to make a defensible space have a common goal – an environment in which latent territoriality and sense of community in the inhabitants can be translated into responsibility for ensuring a safe, productive, and well-maintained living space (3).     Through clever design space begins to defend itself. I read Newman’s book as presenting the contemporary problematic of spatialised security: how to structure space so as to increase control; how to organise architecture so as to foster territorialism; how to encourage territorial control through amplifying surveillance. The production of defensible space entails moving away from what he calls the ‘compositional approach’ to architecture, which sees buildings as separate from their environments, and the ‘organic approach’ to architecture, in which the building and its grounds are organically interrelated (Newman 60).    In this approach Newman proposes a number of changes to space: firstly, spaces need to be multiplied (one no longer has a simple public/private binary, but also semi-private and semi-public spaces); secondly, these spaces must be hierarchised (moving from public to semi-public to semi-private to private); thirdly, within this hierarchy spaces can also be striated using symbolic or material boundaries between the different types of spaces. Furthermore, spaces must be designed to increase surveillance: use smaller corridors serving smaller sets of families (69-71); incorporate amenities in “defined zones of influence” (70); use L-shaped buildings as opposed to rectangles (84); use windows on the sides of buildings to reveal the fire escape from outside (90). As he puts it, the subdivision of housing projects into “small, recognisable and comprehensible-at-a-glance enclaves is a further contributor to improving the visual surveillance mechanism” (1000). Finally, Newman lays out the principle of spatial juxtaposition: consider the building/street interface (positioning of doors and windows to maximise surveillance); consider building/building interface (e.g. build residential apartments next to ‘safer’ commercial, industrial, institutional and entertainment facilities) (109-12).   In short, Newman’s book effectively redefines residential space in terms of territorial zones of control. Such zones of influence are the products of the interaction between architectural forms and environment, which are not reducible to the intent of the architect (68). Thus, in attempting to respond to the exigencies of the moment – the problem of urban crime, the cost of housing – Newman maps out residential space in what Foucault might have called a ‘micro-physics of power’.   During the mid-1970s through to the 1980s a number of publications aimed at the average householder are printed in the UK and Australia. Apart from trade publishing (Bunting), The UK Design Council released two small publications (Barty, White and Burall; Design Council) while in Australia the Department of Housing and Construction released a home safety publication, which contained a small section on security, and the Australian Institute of Criminology published a small volume entitled Designing out Crime: Crime prevention through environmental design (Geason and Wilson). While Newman emphasised the responsibility of architects and urban planners, in these publications the general concerns of defensible space are relocated in the ‘average homeowner’.   Citing crime statistics on burglary and vandalism, these publications incite their readers to take action, turning the homeowner into a citizen-soldier. The householder, whether he likes it or not, is already in a struggle. The urban jungle must be understood in terms of “the principles of warfare” (Bunting 7), in which everyday homes become bodies needing protection through suitable architectural armour. Through a series of maps and drawings and statistics, the average residential home is transformed into a series of points of vulnerability. Home space is re-inscribed as a series of points of entry/access and lines of sight. Simultaneously, through lists of ‘dos and don’ts’ a set of precautionary behaviours is inculcated into the readers. Principles of security begin codifying the home space, disciplining the spatial practices of the intimate, regulating the access and mobility of the family and guests.   The Architectural Nervous System   Nowadays we see a wild, almost excessive, proliferation of security products available to the ‘security conscious homeowner’. We are no longer simply dealing with security devices designed to block – such as locks, bolts and fasteners. The electronic revolution has aided the production of security devices that are increasingly more specialised and more difficult to manipulate, which paradoxically makes it more difficult for the security consumer to understand. Detection systems now include continuous wiring, knock-out bars, vibration detectors, breaking glass detectors, pressure mats, underground pressure detectors and fibre optic signalling. Audible alarm systems have been upgraded to wire-free intruder alarms, visual alarms, telephone warning devices, access control and closed circuit television and are supported by uninterruptible power supplies and control panels (see Chartered Institution of Building Service Engineers 19-39).   The whole house is literally re-routed as a series of relays in an electronic grid. If the house as a security risk is defined in terms of points of vulnerability, alarm systems take these points as potential points of contact. Relays running through floors, doors and windows can be triggered by pressure, sound or dislocation. We see a proliferation of sensors: switching sensors, infra-red sensors, ultrasonic sensors, microwave radar sensors, microwave fence sensors and microphonic sensors (see Walker). The increasing diversification of security products attests to the sheer scale of these architectural/engineering changes to our everyday architecture. In our fear of crime we have produced increasingly more complex security products for the home, thus complexifying the spaces we somehow inherently feel should be ‘simple’.    I suggest that whereas previous devices merely reinforced certain architectural or engineering aspects of the home, contemporary security products actually constitute the home as a feeling, architectural body capable of being affected. This recalls notions of a sensuous architecture and bodily metaphors within architectural discourse (see Thomsen; Puglini).  It is not simply our fears that lead us to secure our homes through technology, but through our fears we come to invest our housing architecture with a nervous system capable of fearing for itself. Our eyes and ears become detection systems while our screams are echoed in building alarms. Body organs are deterritorialised from the human body and reterritorialised on contemporary residential architecture, while our senses are extended through modern security technologies. The vulnerable body of the family home has become a feeling body conscious of its own vulnerability. It is less about the physical expression of fear, as Nan Ellin has put it, than about how building materialities become capable of fearing for themselves.   What we have now are residential houses that are capable of being more fully mobilised in this urban war. Family homes become bodies that scan the darkness for the slightest movements, bodies that scream at the slightest possibility of danger. They are bodies that whisper to each other: a house can recognise an intrusion and relay a warning to a security station, informing security personnel without the occupants of that house knowing. They are the newly produced victims of an urban war.   Our homes are the event-spaces in which mediated fear unfolds into an architectural nervous system. If media plug our homes into one set of relations between ideologies, representations and fear, then the architectural nervous system plugs that back into a different set of relations between capital, fear and the electronic grid. The home is less an endpoint of broadcast media than a node in an electronic network, a larger nervous system that encompasses the globe. It is a network that plugs architectural nervous systems into city electronic grids into mediated subjectivities into military technologies and back again, allowing fear to be disseminated and extended, replayed and spliced into the most banal aspects of our domestic lives.

Accordingly, current efforts to protect privacy on the Internet have sought anonymity by breaking, where possible, links with personally identifiable information (PII)—all uses of aggregated data stripped of PII are considered legitimate. This article argues that we need to use a broader concept, general or group identifying information (GII), because even aggregated data stripped of PII violate privacy at the community level. The search engine companies, or anyone else with access to their log files, can use these data to generate a moment-by-moment view of what is on the collective mind. Such a view can be used in a variety of ways, some with deep economic and even political impact. In order to frame this discussion, it is necessary to examine some of the realities of the search engine-mediated associative interface to the World Wide Web. While this interface has enormous benefits for the networked world, it also fundamentally changes a number of issues underlying various current debates about Internet governance.","",""

With the intention of supplementing the displacement of the panoptic paradigm with a less deterministic and more flexible framework, we conceptualize the establishment of public monitoring programmes in terms of the central role of communications and media in surveillance policy development and change. Presenting empirical data from an investigation of public camera surveillance in Canada, we develop theoretical and, necessarily, empirical insights that enable us to move beyond explanatory emphases on responsibilization strategies and social ordering techniques.

In the light of this observation, the article concludes by proposing that in order to address the uncertainty that individuals face in trying to figure out how institutions use personal information to categorize them into different risk groups, a privacy protection scheme that increases the accountability of these automated and manual interpretation processes is needed.

The “therapeutics of the self” builds on the trend observed by scholars studying therapeutic culture in which people are incited to constantly work on, hence change, the self. The author argues that the “therapeutics of the self” promotes as therapeutic the assertion of self-sameness across disparate social spaces (on the shows and in “real” life): stasis.

"2008","SOFTWARE DEFAULTS AS DE FACTO REGULATION The case of the wireless internet","Today's internet presumes that individuals are capable of configuring software to address issues such as spam, security, indecent content, and privacy. This assumption is worrying – common sense and empirical evidence state that not everyone is so interested or so skilled. When regulatory decisions are left to individuals, for the unskilled the default settings are the law. This article relies on evidence from the deployment of wireless routers and finds that defaults act as de facto regulation for the poor and poorly educated. This paper presents a large sample behavioral study of how people modify their 802.11 (‘Wi-Fi’) wireless access points from two distinct sources. The first is a secondary analysis of WifiMaps.com, one of the largest online databases of wireless router information. The second is an original wireless survey of portions of three census tracts in Chicago, selected as a diversity sample for contrast in education and income. By constructing lists of known default settings for specific brands and models, we were then able to identify how people changed their default settings. Our results show that the default settings for wireless access points are powerful. Media reports and instruction manuals have increasingly urged users to change defaults – especially passwords, network names, and encryption settings. Despite this, only half of all users change any defaults at all on the most popular brand of router. Moreover, we find that when a manufacturer sets a default 96–99 percent of users follow the suggested behavior, while only 28–57 percent of users acted to change these same default settings when exhorted to do so by expert sources. Finally, there is also a suggestion that those living in areas with lower incomes and levels of education are less likely to change defaults, although these data are not conclusive. These results show how the authority of software trumps that of advice. Consequently, policy-makers must acknowledge and address the power of software to act as de facto regulation.","",""

A necessary step in this process is deciding what the ‘settings’ should be for the relevant software. One powerful setting in software is defaults.

This normative approach towards software settings stands apart from most previous scholarship, which focuses on the effect of software. The framework is illustrated with an example of an incorrectly set default in Apple's Airport Extreme wireless access point. Policymakers can influence competition, security, and privacy by relying on this framework.

"2009","EXPOSURE","The aim of this paper is to identify a construct which may be used to frame the subjective experience of surveillance in contemporary society. The paper's central question concerns whether there is a concept to describe the experience of surveillance which can then inform empirical studies. Surveillance practice has consequences for the individual, yet surveillance studies do not have a particular take on the subject. Building on some preliminary empirical observations from the workplace, the paper suggests that the notion of ‘exposure’ is a useful starting point. The paper explores the range of ways in which subjects can be exposed under surveillance, and theoretically locates the concept in relation to developments in organization theory, new media theory and surveillance theory. Two observations are made which support the centrality of the ‘exposure’ concept within studies of surveillance. The first argument is that the body interior of the surveilled subject is more open to division, classification and scrutiny, because it is seen as a source of truth, the target of public revelation or fetish. There is now a political economy around the revelation of this interiority, which calls for a non-reductive and multi-dimensional approach to the subjective experience of surveillance. The second argument is that the nature and character of exposure are products of institutional configurations, which have consequences at the level of the individual. A research agenda is developed which will frame future work exploring the experience of surveillance.","",""
"2009","Phenomenology and Surveillance Studies: Returning to the Things Themselves","In response to the increasingly quotidian, even banal character of surveillant practices in postindustrial societies, this article explores the possibility of a theoretical and methodological re-alignment in surveillance studies. This re-alignment entails a move from broadly Foucauldian, macro-level, structural or poststructural analyses, to the existential–phenomenological study of subjective consciousness and experience. This piece illustrates such an experiential study by taking part of Sartre's famous description of “the look,” and comparing it to a similarly experientially based description of an everyday context of surveillance—specifically, a bank machine or ATM transaction. Through the analysis of these descriptions, the piece shows how the study of the lived experience of surveillance highlights the role of the body, of social convention, and also of individual agency in surveillant practices that can be overlooked in other analyses.","",""

"2009","Public Health STI/HIV Surveillance: Exploring the Society of Control","  While Michel Foucault asserted that the sovereign style of rule had disappeared, instead replaced by a disciplinary society (wherein individuals were trained/domesticated in a variety of social institutions), years later, Gilles Deleuze recounted how this social structure had again changed. Within this new system, which Deleuze labelled the society of control, social networks have become so densely intertwined that it no longer matters whether or not someone is disciplined in accordance with social rules because now they are entrapped within a web that would more often than not ensure that socially appropriate trajectories are maintained. Using Deleuze's framework about the society of control, in this paper, we explore the current public health STI/HIV surveillance system. The outcome of this exploration is the suggestion that the system is, in fact, an example of a densely intertwined (rhizomatic) control society, and that it is maintained through the desires of the people.","",""

Outraged by this cynicism - but much to the chagrin of his own party leader - David Davis, the Home Affairs spokesman for the Conservative opposition, flamboyantly resigned his safe parliamentary seat in the Haltemprice and Howden constituency.

Techniques of surveillance and monitoring are part of medical diagnostics, epidemiological studies, aetiologic research, health care management; they also co-shape individual engagements with illness. In medicine, surveillance data come as digital anatomies for educational purposes and clinical diagnostics that subject the body to imaging techniques, but also as databases of patient collectives that are established in large-scale, at times nationwide, epidemiological studies. We will show that techniques of medical surveillance now include more bottom-up and less-centralized modes as well: with web 2.0 applications, one encounters endoscopic clips uploaded and made public on the internet and tools to navigate through patterns of sickness in urban space. Surveillance techniques directed at individual patients and at population health reconfigure the constellation of the body, space and the gaze into a post-panoptic distributed mode.","",""

What are the beginnings of public television? This article explores the use of police CCTV in West Germany between the 1950s and the 1970s. In these early years, the public police cameras served three functions: the use of cameras in traffic management; the repressive use of cameras at demonstrations; and the persuasive use of the images. The second part of the paper takes a closer look at the third function: surveillance images as a means of persuading offenders of their guilt. It is argued, that a persuasive force exists and is consciously exploited by the police. But this force also weakens over time, when subjects acquire more and more media competence. The police respond to this problem with the transition from still to moving images – and beyond.","",""
"2009","Governing with Clean Hands: Automated Public Toilets and Sanitary Surveillance","To anyone familiar with the story of urban decay in major American cities in the 1980s – and with the subsequent abolition of toilets from city streets – the introduction of automated public toilets (APTs) to urban spaces sounds like very good news. This article explores the re-democratizing message that commonly accompanies the introduction of APTs to North American city streets as well as their on-the-ground manifestations. It focuses on two major components of APTs: privatization and automation. The process of privatization, which characterizes most APT operations in North America, carries with it various exclusionary effects that stand in stark contrast to the democratic aspirations of public space. Additionally, the APTs normally feature automated devices, and, most prominently, the auto-flush and the automated faucet and dryer. On the face of things, these devices eradicate the injustices that sometimes accompany human discretion. However, they also conceal the necessarily social and value-ridden human decision making that goes into their design. The article proposes that both the privatization and the automation of public toilets are part of a broader and increasingly expansive sanitary regime, one that imposes a morality in practice on its users. The latter are left with relatively limited options as to how to use the space of the washroom and at times join the nonhuman devices themselves in “kicking-back” at their programmers. By comparing automated toilets with attendant-based ones, the article suggests that the project of sanitary surveillance exemplifies the fluidity between traditional and new forms of surveillance.","",""
"2009","Interrogating Surveillance: The 50 Minute Hour","Psychological assessment, as conventionally understood, forms part of a tradition of investigative practice in psychology. The intake interview furthermore forms the cornerstone of this practice. The practice of psychology is often treated as though it consists only of logical and technical operations performed by """"independent individual investigators on bits of the natural world"""" (Danziger, 1990, p. 4). Psychological assessment and particularly the intake interview, is often not regarded as """"social practice"""" where it is acknowledged that the practitioner acts within a framework determined by the potential consumer of the product of their investigation. Furthermore, in an attempt to achieve scientific standardisation, it is often assumed that the process is divorced from the traditions of prevailing and acceptable practice. Seldom is it acknowledged that the mere format of the setting with its embedded power relations and the questions asked within this initial contact, only allows for a certain set of answers. The 50 Minute Hour consists of a series of three short video clips of approximately 3 minutes each. It attempts to expose the multi-layered surveillance complexes which constitute and construct the psychological interview and position the subject of interrogation. It challenges the notions around spatial arrangement of the assessment setting and discourses informed by (and not informing) pop-psychology. Through our surveillance of the intake interview our images attempt to ask questions about psychology as a ritual and self serving self-perpetuating practice.The clips can be viewed hereLink address: http://blip.tv/file/2930413","",""
"2009","Understanding resistance to digital surveillance: Towards a multi-disciplinary, multi-actor framework","Despite being central to the dynamics of surveillance, the concept of resistance remains underdeveloped within the surveillance studies corpus. We review theoretical work on surveillance before summarising the main treatments of resistance from within surveillance studies. We find that the majority of resistance literature in surveillance studies is focussed on resistance relations between the surveyor and the surveilled, and neglects other relevant actors. To expand the list of relevant actors, we look to what other disciplines have to say about the who and the how of resistance. Using these lessons, we then elaborate a multi-actor framework to better understand complex resistance relationships. Beyond the surveyor and the surveilled, surveillance authorities, commercial enterprises, international governmental and non-governmental agencies, and the surveillance technologies themselves form a complex resistance nexus, capable of resisting and being resisted in a diversity of ways. Further, we conclude that these distinctive roles produce unique methods, directions and opportunities for resistance.  The roles of these additional actors will be demonstrated through a discussion of the United Kingdom National Identity Scheme, where we believe they are presently engaged in a series of multi-level, multi-actor resistance relationships at various stages of the scheme’s development.","",""

It explores various modes of sexualized surveillance, from ‘reality porn’ to webcam footage, and focuses on the ways in which voyeurism and exhibitionism are mobilized within an emerging ‘surveillance aesthetic’ across these forms. Building on work that considers ‘playful’ engagements with surveillance, and discussions of forms of counter-surveillance, the paper attempts to locate ‘sexy surveillance’ within this body of critical engagement that seeks not to hide from surveillance, but to confront its logics head on. In exploring how the omnipresence of surveillance shifts experiences of voyeurism and exhibitionism into new contexts, the paper argues that sexualization is one possible response for the ‘surveillance-savvy’ subject to utilize.","",""

Trying to describe the full range of the problem, the article indiscriminately mixed various surveillance techniques, from workplace spying methods with incidents involving modern ‘Peeping Toms’, quickly followed by descriptions of corporations tracking “your every move”, through mobile positioning systems in cell phones. Discursively, the message was simple: you are susceptible to surveillance and you should take protective measures. Fortunately for the reader, the magazine also offered tips on ‘fighting back’, mainly through commonsense suggestions for individuals, such as tracking the ‘cookies’ in your Internet browser and turning off your cell phone.

"2009","Conspiracy Theorizing Surveillance: considering modalities of paranoia and conspiracy in surveillance studies","In this paper I argue that the notion of paranoia can inform a post-panoptic theory of surveillance, without simply functioning as a pre-emptive dismissal of a critical engagement with technologies and regimes of surveillance as just paranoid. Rather, I seek to address how paranoia can be rearticulated to serve a productive, non-pathological function in an analysis of logics of surveillance. To this end, I consider the manner in which paranoia is characterised in popular cultural narratives and how the advent of cultural paranoia can be understood in the context of the expansion of state and corporate surveillance, especially in the UK and post-9/11 North America. Drawing on this notion of cultural paranoia, I then argue for three modalities of paranoia-as-surveillance theory. The first modality, the paranoia of the subject of surveillance, addresses the divergent panoptic subject who rejects the disciplinary logic of the panopticon; the second modality considers how the paranoid as the suspicious subject could be used to characterise the expansion of surveillance regimes through an ever-present need to observe; and the third modality of conspiracy theory proposes that a paranoid logic, akin to that of the conspiracy theory, sutures over epistemic gaps in the interpretation of information in instances of analytic deficit.","",""

"2009","Networks and Resistance: Investigating online advocacy networks as a modality for resisting state surveillance","This paper explores the network of relationships that emerge from the online activities of privacy advocates. It argues that this advocacy network, through its linking practices, may potentially become a network of meta-surveillance that has the potential to transcend the agency of the individual actors. By reducing the degrees of separation between the actors, through their linking practices, the network can foster links between different sets of data, create links between information about incidents, corroborate information (making it more credible), direct the attention of the public and the traditional media to particular state surveillance practices, and so forth. Through these linking practices the network can draw upon the emergent positive network externalities to realise an information politics that is beyond what any single actor can achieve.  Through the use of social network analysis and a webometrics methodology (supported by web-based crawling applications) we attempt to reveal this emerging online advocacy network. Through our data collection and analysis we show that the online advocacy network seems somewhat fragmented with a relatively small but stable, and geographically biased, core. This tentative analysis and conclusion may have important implications for the way privacy advocates view their online practices. ","",""

"2009","Discrimination by Design: predictive data mining as security practice in the United States’ ‘war on terrorism’","The tactics and strategies employed by the United States in its ‘War on Terrorism' have generally been condemned as departures from the norms of how a democratic government conducts itself. Reforms are thus thought needed to place the ‘War on Terror' under the rule of law and protect civil liberties. This article attempts to counter that view. Using predictive data mining-a technology at the heart of the US National Security Agency's (NSA) surveillance scandal-as an example, it argues that rather than a break with the past, the tactics that the Bush Administration adopted to fight terrorism represent an extension of a particular type of future-oriented power which Foucault (2008) referred to as """"security"""" or """"government."""" And while individual civil liberties are no doubt at stake, they are not at stake equally for everyone. Predictive data mining discriminates by design, designating certain groups as threats relative to others. Thus, persons with Middle Eastern and North African backgrounds will disproportionately bear the burden of this surveillance technique and the innumerable mistakes it produces. Finally, the rule of law would seem to offer little to remedy the situation. The War on Drugs, the policing of immigration, and past international disputes with ‘terrorist regimes' have provided a """"crime jurisprudence"""" (Simon 2007) that legitimizes such discrimination. Paradoxically and pessimistically then, the real hope for change lies in the crisis of legitimacy that one could expect to result from the wider application of such discriminatory technologies or the benevolent reign of an executive branch that has been imbued with an authority beyond its traditional limits.","",""

Drawing on Foucault’s notion of biopower, we examine how digital health resources offer new ways through which to discipline individuals and regulate populations. The emergence of health regulation within and through cyberspace takes place in a context wherein the relationship between the body and technology is rendered more complex. Departing from early literature on cyberspace, which claimed that the body was absent in virtual worlds, we articulate a medicalized cyberspace within which the virtual and corporeal are enmeshed. The range of health issues articulated through surveillance discourses are many and varied, though of significance are those related to weight and health, as they provide a particularly rich example through which to study medical surveillance in cyberspace due to their moral and regulative focus. We argue that the capacity for health resources to encourage disciplinary and regulative practices defies the designation of virtual, as non-reality. Moreover, with the advent of a range of digital platforms that merge entertainment with the regulation of the body, such as Internet based nutrition games, and the use of games consoles such as Nintendo wii fit, cyberspace may be providing a forum for new forms of regulative practices concerning health. These virtual environments expand our understandings of the boundaries of the body, since much of what takes place occurs through both a virtualization of identity, such as the use of an avatar or graphic image of one’s body on screen, and a prostheticisation of the body within cyberspace. To conclude, while surveillance medicine regulates physical selves in real time, we argue that there is a growing tendency towards a prosthetic surveillance, which regulates and defines bodies that are simultaneously hyper-text and flesh.

Yet, the theoretical understanding of surveillance has not developed at the same pace.In this article two dominating metaphors, Big Brother and the panopticon, are critically discussed, and it is argued that fresh theoretical and methodological resources are needed. Using the work of Haraway and Latour the article develops an understanding of surveillance as a situated activity. This is done through an ethnographic study of the Danish Fisheries Inspection. “Situated surveillance” contains the important insight that it is inexpedient to define surveillance in general term and “in advance”. What surveillance is must be studied empirically. When interpreted as “situated” surveillance is never total, as anticipated in Big Brother and the panopticon, but limited and partial. Furthermore, surveillance is a result of work involving exertion, friction and resistance. Finally, the distinction between the observer and the observed is blurred, and surveillance becomes not only a matter of control but also of e.g. care. ","",""
"2009","‘Lost’ Surveillance Studies: A critical review of French work on CCTV","In recent years, the rapidly developing field of ‘surveillance studies’ has sparked a remarkable and revealing body of research, which has led to repeated claims to recognise ‘surveillance studies’ as a cross-disciplinary field of research in its own right. However, the almost exclusive reliance of these independency claims upon Anglophone references raises a series of important questions: Must we conclude that other linguistic traditions in surveillance studies do not exist at all, or are we to assume that such studies are heading in a broadly similar direction as their English counterpart?In order to address these questions, the paper suggests engaging with ‘lost’ CCTV studies published in French academia. It succinctly discusses three specificities of the French CCTV context – the legal regulation of CCTV through the 1995 ‘Loi Pasqua’, the specialised economic journal ‘En toute sécurité’ and the quasi absence of publicly mandated statistical evaluations of open street CCTV systems – thus providing a reading of how they are reflected in the existing CCTV literature. From an analytical standpoint, this approach provides an exploratory framework not only for investigating the key elements that French studies about CCTV can add to the relevant Anglophone literature, but also for examining the broader processes of knowledge generation about surveillance issues and on how these may depend on particular national characteristics.","",""

"2009","‘Wanna still nine hard?’: Exploring Mechanisms of Police Bias in the Translation  and Interpretation of Wiretap Conversations","Wiretaps permit police to intercept telephone conversations among targets of investigation, some of which are judged to be incriminating by those listening to the real-time conversations.  How is the information intercepted from wiretaps interpreted, understood, and used?  What is required to transform raw communications intercepts into evidence of probable cause?  Forensic linguists have studied transcripts of intercepted conversations, focusing on the wiretap entextualization process—that is, the ways in which intercepted conversations are classified as incriminating, and converted into evidence of crimes.  They hypothesize the wiretap entextualization process is prejudiced in favor of police theories of criminal actions.  This paper considers forensic linguists’ police bias arguments, and offers details into mechanisms that create police predispositions to interpret conversations intercepted under a wiretap order as crimes.  The analysis applies Shuy’s (2005) conversational strategies to create crime to nine conversations intercepted in a federal wiretap.  Transcripts are examined by comparing conversations with their police translations.  Findings suggest police bias is embedded deeply into wiretap operations, and that there are several means by which police preconceptions of crime undergird wiretap transcripts.","",""
"2009","Woven of War-Time Fabrics: The globalization of public health surveillance","This article considers the imbrication of war-time logics with the ideational and institutional development of public health surveillance.  It suggests that, as the Cold-War–era gave way to the ‘age of globalization’, public health discourse became less concerned with ideological enemies, and more concerned with ontological enemies. The discourse of emerging infectious disease exemplifies this preoccupation and illustrates how public health surveillance, dominated by war-time logics, is both globalized and predisposed to marginalized local orders of concern. However, at the same time that militarized configurations of public health surveillance set certain tendencies in motion, local orders of concern deconstruct, contest, resist, and negotiate these tendencies. Hence, this article concludes with a call for further empirical attention by Surveillance Studies scholars to the multiplicity of local sites that enact public health surveillance.","",""

The first section of the paper examines the World Health Organization’s global program for comprehensive cervical cancer control, and raises the issue of how gendered and sexualized contexts are implicated in that program. Section Two then examines how health promotion strategies in cervical cancer screening are served by, and help to reinforce, gender constructions of women as ‘docile’ by nature. Section Three, by contrast, examines the ways in which some women respond to the controlling effect of surveillance by attempting to ‘take control’ of the screening process through various forms of activism, and thereby give effect to different gender constructions. The paper concludes that while surveillance contributes to creating screened populations burdened with gender constructs and imperatives, responses to surveillance are also shaped by gender constructs, and contribute to new gender constructs.

"2009","Individualism and Identity: Resistance to Speed Cameras in the UK","As a surveillance technology, speed cameras have produced significant levels of resistance from the general (driving) public. This resistance has not, however, drawn on the kinds of civil liberties or 'Big Brother' narratives that might be expected. Using this context as a case study, this paper suggests that significant resistance to surveillance practices may emerge when surveillance technologies produce data doubles that are antagonistically incompatible with those identities which have emerged 'organically' from the resisting individuals and communities.In this example, the self-ascribed identity of normal, respectable, non-criminal drivers is threatened by technologies of risk and 'techno-fixes' which (through their operation) construct identities as risk-carrying, deviant, and criminal  The sense of unfairness generated by this conflict between how we see ourselves and how the disciplining state sees us generates a sense of injustice. This sense of injustice is fertile ground for resistance. The paper identifies three main narrative themes in discourses of resistance to speed cameras, including the rejection of the official expertise used to justify surveillance and punishment, and the construction of a narrative which positions the drivers as an ordinary person resisting an oppressive state. The final narrative highlights the danger posed by other groups which, being constructed as genuinely and uncontroversially deviant, are more worthy of surveillant attention. As such, the paper suggests that, while offering fertile ground for the generation of resistant strategies, the speed camera context produces a very particular, very individualised, type of resistance which may actually contribute to existing processes of discrimination and 'othering' amongst surveilled populations.","",""
"2009","Surveillance, Gender, and the Virtual Body in the Information Age","In our contemporary 'information age', information and the body stand in a new, peculiar, and ambiguous relationship to one another. Information is plumbed from the body but treated as separate from it, facilitating, as Irma van der Ploeg has suggested, the creation of a separate virtual 'body-as-information' that has affected the very ontology of the body. This 'informatization of the body' has been both spurred and enabled by surveillance techniques that create, depend upon, and manipulate virtual bodies for a variety of predictive purposes, including social control and marketing. While, as some feminist critics have suggested, there appears to be potential for information technologies to liberate us from oppressive ideological models, surveillance techniques, themselves so intimately tied to information systems, put normative pressure on non-normative bodies and practices, such as those of queer and genderqueer subjects. Ultimately, predictive surveillance is based in an innately conservative epistemology, and the intertwining of information systems with surveillance undermines any liberatory effect of the former.","",""

Consumers' confidence in personal privacy is directly affecting and limiting the growth of the Internet commercial development. Therefore, it has become a necessity to address the consumers privacy concerns for the interests of the parties involved.  Examples of the different ways of penetrating the consumers' privacy are reviewed. The national and international efforts to formulate regulatory and self-regulatory programs to protect the consumers' privacy are demonstrated. The different privacy enhancing technologies are presented. The problems and shortages of the current national and international consumers' privacy protection regulatory effort including privacy enhancing technologies are addressed. The argument of the need for an international efforts and the proposed role of the United Nations (UN) towards enforced international privacy legislation is established.

Ironically, the advent of social network sites opens the possibility of a relatively safe place to disclose private information. This article proposes a “privacy box” application to be used within social network sites that would require users to accept a pre–written promise of confidentiality before gaining access to personal information. Although it would not serve as a universal remedy for privacy harms on social network sites, it could serve to carve out a space for relatively safe self–disclosure online.","",""
"2009","A multinational study on online privacy: global concerns and local responses"," This study surveyed 1261 internet users from five cities (Bangalore, Seoul, Singapore, Sydney and New York) to examine multinational internet users' perceptions and behavioural responses concerning online privacy. It identified a set of individual-level (demographics and internet-related experiences) and macro-level factors (nationality and national culture), and tested the extent to which they affected online privacy concerns and privacy protection behaviours. The results showed that individual differences (age, gender and internet experience), nationality and national culture significantly influenced internet users' privacy concerns to the extent that older, female internet users from an individualistic culture were more concerned about online privacy than their counterparts. The study also identified three underlying dimensions of privacy protection behaviour — avoidance, opt-out and proactive protection — and found that they distinctly related to the individual and macro-level factors. Overall, the findings highlight the conditional and multicultural nature of online privacy. ","",""
"2010","New Directions in Surveillance and Privacy","The title of this book accurately sums up the editors’ intentions with collection, which is to cut across the current field of research on surveillance and privacy, highlighting the wide-ranging and multi-disciplinary nature of this field, while examining potential future developments and directions for research. As such, many of the chapters are either examinations of the current state of play, or are jumping off points intended to prompt further questions and reflection. The book is composed of eight chapters and an introduction, and is divided into three thematic sections: regulation, technology and techniques of surveillance, and surveillance futures. Subjects covered include privacy law and regulation, privacy enhancing technologies, communications surveillance, the EU data retention directive, accountability in the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, UK identity cards, potential future developments of surveillance, and literary representations of surveillance. While all the chapters are well written, by competent researchers, the third section on surveillance futures stands as the most thought-provoking and unique contribution in the volume. It features Kevin Haggerty engaging in cautious but well-theorized crystal-ball gazing, towards a surveillant future, and Mike Nellis’ examination of the existing depictions of surveillance across a range of literary genres, including police procedurals, techno-thrillers, and science fiction. This chapter highlights the critical importance of understanding the representations of surveillance technologies and practices in social life, often mediated through fictional accounts more frequently than through academic research. While accessible, this book is not primarily an introduction to surveillance studies. Students in search of such a text would be better served by Lyon (2007); however, the chapters of New Directions point towards a wide range of further reading in the field. Similar collections of contemporary surveillance research include Lyon (2006) and Haggerty and Ericson (2006). Both of these collections also attempt to the answer the question of what could be the future direction for surveillance studies, while showcasing the variety of disciplinary perspectives. Clearly situated in this field, the book is a timely intervention. Surveillance","",""
"2010","NONE OF US IS AS LAZY AS ALL OF US","In this paper we apply theory and research from sociology and social psychology to the problem of collective information sharing and exchange on the internet. We investigate the relationships between pre-existing dispositions to be cautious towards others, the propensity to exert more or less effort as a function of group affiliation, and contribution towards a collective goal. We find that individuals with average or lower levels of general caution are more likely to contribute to a collective pool of information, providing support for Yamagishi's (2001) argument that less cautious individuals exhibit a type of social intelligence by engaging in risky but potentially rewarding social interactions. Consistent with the literature on social loafing, we find that abstract group affiliations have a negative effect on information sharing behaviour. However, the effect of group affiliation is mediated by one's level of general caution. We argue that pre-dispositions to engage in socially risky situations are a critical element of individuals’ decisions to contribute to online information sharing systems or not.","",""

We conducted fifteen one-hour ‘focus groups’ with eighty-five 13 to 16 year-old children in three schools. The pupils were asked a range of questions designed to document their awareness, experience and response to ‘surveillance’ as ‘school children’, but also as ‘regular citizens’ going about their business ‘outside’ of the school. We show how children’s experience and response to surveillance varies across ‘social positionings’ of class and gender, before going on to discuss the implications of our findings for the major theoretical debates on surveillance.","",""
"2010","Surveillance and Child Protection: De-mystifying the Trojan Horse","This paper belongs to an embryonic body of scholarship that documents the camouflaging of political, economic and social agendas under the rhetoric of Child Protection. The Trojan Horse theory of Child Protection, as this scholarship may broadly be termed, alleges the misuse of Child Protection powers for ulterior motives. Years of struggle against the Law and Order, Psychiatric and other discourses have won a raft of Civil and Human Rights protections. Bypassing these protections, Child Protection provides a rhetoric that disguises surveillance and disarms opposition, because a justifiable and apparently benign pretext has been found in the ostensible and entirely laudable, aim of protecting children. The paper collates widespread evidence of how the pretext of Child Protection has been used to extend surveillance and disarm populations.Through the discourse of Child Protection, children are propelled through various constructions from ‘child in need’, to ‘child at risk’, to ‘potentially delinquent’, to ‘delinquent’, but in each case, transgressions of ever more restrictive and constantly morphing laws, regulations and expectations are used to infiltrate techniques of information gathering deeper into more intimate parts of the social body. Child Protection is now used to penetrate where orthodox policing can no longer go. Wherever they are placed in the process of criminalisation, as victim or transgressor, children are constructed as a pretext for expanding power and increasing profit. Transgression by, or against, children, is used to further the economic, political and commercial interests in surveillance. To fully understand the relationship between surveillance and Child Protection, it is necessary to interrogate the information-sharing model that is built into the major Child Protection frameworks. The paper explores the manner in which Child Protection has been structured by the information- sharing model, to benefit the sectional interests in surveillance and the detrimental consequences that this has for children and young people.","",""

It is therefore important to understand the economic organization of these platforms. The discussion of surveillance in web 2.0 is important because such platforms collect huge amounts of personal data in order to work. In this paper, first the example of Google Buzz is discussed. Then, a model that conceptualizes the cycle of capital accumulation and distinguishes between production and circulation of capital is introduced. The role of surveillance in web 2.0 is outlined based on the cycle of capital accumulation. The notions of the Internet prosumer commodity and web 2.0 surveillance are introduced in order to characterize the relationship of production, consumption, and surveillance on web 2.0.","",""

"2010","Participatory Sensing: Building Empowering Surveillance","   Mobile phones could become the largest surveillance system on the planet. These ubiquitous, networked devices can currently sense and upload data such as images, sound, location, and motion using on-board cameras, microphones, GPS, and accelerometers. And they can be triggered and controlled by billions of individuals around the world. But the emergent, wide-scale sensing systems that phones support pose a number of questions. Who will control the necessary infrastructure for data storage, analysis, sharing, and retention? And to what purposes will such systems be deployed? This paper explores whether these questions can be answered in ways that promote empowering surveillance: large-scale data collection used by individuals and communities to improve their quality of life and increase their power relative to corporations and governments. Researchers in academic and industry laboratories around the world are currently coordinating mobile phone networks for purposes that expand the definition of surveillance. Technology movements, variously called personal sensing, urban sensing or participatory sensing, have emerged within the areas of social computing and urban computing. These research programs endeavor to make ubiquitous devices such as phones a platform for coordinated investigation of human activity. Researchers are exploring ways to introduce these technologies into the public realm, a move that anticipates sensing by people across the world. This paper uses ethnographic data collected in a sensing development laboratory to illuminate possibilities that participatory sensing holds for equitable use, meaningful community participation, and empowerment. Analyzing the motivations and values embedded within the design process and resulting technologies reveals ways in which participatory sensing builds tools for empowering surveillance and responds to the many ethical challenges these new technologies raise.","",""

We explain how identities and patterns of difference among border residents are reconstructed by a legal taxonomy that identifies and classifies crossers according to categories of legality. We find that these categories are locally framed and translated into a binary distinction between consumers and workers that reflect a growing gap between the rich and poor in the city. Finally, we conclude that this distinction ignores the transnational character of the city, and in particular, that consumers and workers are not mutually exclusive categories at the borderlands.","",""

"2010","The Politics of Surveillance: Big Brother on Prozac","This paper explores the rise of CCTV in society during the last two decades. It concentrates on state sponsored surveillance schemes in an attempt to answer the question of why it is that CCTV surveillance emerged at this particular point in history. At one level, advancing technology can allow a ‘surveillance society’ to emerge, yet the extent to which CCTV cameras have spread into city centres and residential areas suggests something more profound has changed in ‘public’ life. The exponential rise in the surveillance of society is often understood to reflect the rise of authoritarianism, perhaps particularly in the UK. Whether from a Weberian, a Foucauldian, or even – and perhaps in particular – a neo-Marxist perspective, this development is often understood as an enforcement of power, resulting from an ideological consensus built around ‘rampant’ neo-liberalism; public life is, in part, understood to be undermined by private interests, the power of capital, or techniques of governance associated to one degree or another with neo-liberalism. In this paper, the neo-liberal framework for understanding the rise of surveillance is questioned. Building upon arguments by Baudrillard, Lasch, Bauman and Furedi it is argued that, rather than an aggressive and purposeful moral or neo-liberal authoritarianism lying behind the rise of surveillance cameras the opposite is in fact the case. The diminution of ‘public’ space both reflects and represents the decline of political purpose and meaning within society and especially within the political elite.","",""
"2010","From Border Control to Border Care: The Political and Ethical Potential of Surveillance.","This paper analyzes the use of surveillance by activist groups opposed to the extensive securitization of the US-Mexico border and examines the implications of their activities for scholarship on borders, surveillance, and empowerment. The work of three organizations—the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), No More Deaths, and Humane Borders—is covered. While there is some overlap in their practices, these three organizations, respectively, have concentrated on (1) the use of digital photography and video recording equipment to monitor state agents and vigilante organizations; (2) the coordination of citizen-organized foot patrols to locate and assist migrants in danger; and (3) the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to support the provision of water and high-resolution border maps to migrants. In documenting the practical use and symbolic framing of surveillance by secular and faith-based activists, this article adds necessary complexity to prevailing conceptualizations of observational strategies and practices. It demonstrates that, while they may enhance and extend state control over bounded territories and populations, watching, monitoring, and rendering visible are not inherently exclusionary or repressive acts and can, in fact, be used in the service of undermining borders and their attendant consequences. The groups examined herein have applied surveillance towards contesting official gatekeeping strategies and creating alternative moral geographies where the imperatives of sovereignty and national security are subordinated to social justice and global hospitality.","",""

Increasingly, so-called “panspectric” techniques of predicting consumption choices, and tracking the shifting customer desires, are proving crucial for corporations trying to compete on the market place. Using the Deleuzian concepts of “assemblage” and “societies of control” as a point of departure, this paper explores how a new societal “diagram” is currently actualised in the marketing practices of contemporary corporations. This diagram emerges as the result of the concatenation of technological architectures (increased digital logging of everyday behaviours and data mining) and new perspectives on the human constitution; perspectives that dovetail nicely with contemporary social theory. Thus, social scientists are already complicit in the emergence of new modes of marketing-cum-surveillance.","",""

Using interview data with Australian video activists this paper seeks to understand the motivations, techniques and outcomes of video activism, and its relationship to counter-surveillance and police accountability. Our data also indicated that there have been significant transformations in the organization and deployment of counter-surveillance methods since 2000, when there were large-scale protests against the World Economic Forum meeting in Melbourne accompanied by a coordinated campaign that sought to document police misconduct. The paper identifies and examines two inter-related aspects of this; the act of filming and the process of dissemination of this footage. It is noted that technological changes in the last decade have led to a proliferation of visual recording technologies, particularly mobile phone cameras, which have stimulated a corresponding proliferation of images. Analogous innovations in internet communications have stimulated a coterminous proliferation of potential outlets for images.. Video footage provides activists with valuable tools for safety and publicity. Nevertheless, we argue, video activism can have unintended consequences, including exposure to legal risks and the amplification of official surveillance. Activists are also often unable to control the political effects of their footage or the purposes to which it is used. We conclude by assessing the impact that transformations in both protest organization and media technologies might have for counter-surveillance techniques based on visual surveillance.","",""

"2010","Anti-social behaviour and its surveillant inter-assemblage","This paper describes a recent initiative in NSW, Australia in the state government’s “fight against anti-social behaviour”. The Anti-Social Behaviour Pilot Project has developed a surveillance regime that exempts justice and human service public authorities from existing privacy laws so that these agencies can share risk intelligence about targeted young people for a more integrated and multi-agency intensive management of risk. A detailed account of the ensemble of statements that have shaped and made this highly politicised risk governance possible is outlined. The initiative seeks to establish a more flexible mode of surveillance capable of intervening into cases of persistent risks linked to the possibility of criminal offending and the risks of persistent offending that have both become linked to public safety. Two analytical frames are used to make sense of the project. Firstly, its nodal technique for integrating case management risk across governmental assemblages (police, health etc) is analysed as an exemplar of a post-panoptical surveillant inter-assemblage designed for the networked control of young people. Secondly, Agamben’s (1988, 2005) account of the state of exception is used to demonstrate how the project’s extra-legal administrative procedures for managing risks linked to “the public interest” establish a spatial arrangement for the control of young people based on decisions of exclusion that are paradoxically located inside and outside the law.","",""

"2010","Consumer Databases, Neoliberalism, and the Commercial Mediation of Identity: A Medium Theory Analysis","This paper argues that the systemic nature of contemporary consumer surveillance undermines the most fundamental principle of free market economics: consumer sovereignty. Specifically, this paper argues that the rise of an ‘information’ or ‘knowledge’ society in conjunction with neoliberal capitalism has entrenched routine forms of surveillance within commercial strategies by employing networked databases as a primary medium for the articulation of consumer sovereignty (choice/demand). The communicative relationship between consumers and producers within the market involves effectively ‘listening’ (and then responding) to consumer needs and wants in a timely manner. Surveillance is therefore not only necessary for the operation of globalized consumer capitalism, it is also the primary means by which consumer communicate their sovereignty within the marketplace. By turning to the work of Harold Innis and the intellectual tradition known as medium theory, this paper will theorize how in linking the actions of individual consumers to the decision-making capacities of trans-national corporations (TNC), the prevalence of consumer databases violates the fundamental neutrality of the market, and thus sovereignty, of individual consumers. In sum, by treating the database as a distinct communication medium, this paper will highlight how the commercial mediation of identity under neoliberalism can conceal the potential for the uneven geographic development, the marginalization of ‘less valuable’ consumer segments, and the exploitation of individual vulnerabilities through behavior and profile modeling.","",""

In fusion centers, members of local, state, and federal police and intelligence units, as well as private-sector organizations, share information with each other by means of computerized technology and store it in databases. While the official purpose is to protect public safety, the practice of 'data-mining' and unclear lines of authority lead to fusion centers being unaccountable to the public and, hence, a threat to the democratic process. These conditions are encapsulated in the case of official espionage in the state of Maryland at least between 2004 and 2006. Drawing on official documents, the history of 'homeland security' since World War II and the characteristics of fusion centers, the Department of Homeland Security, and events in Maryland are surveyed. Working within the contexts of social history, surveillance theory, and political economy, this paper is grounded in the work of Beck, Churchill and Wall, Donner, Fuchs, Graham, Lyon, McCulloch and Pickering, and Monahan.","",""

Drawing on ethnographic data from fieldwork in a primary school, I argue that how surveillance actually operated in this context diverged from the panoptic programme in two crucial ways: surveillance was (i) discontinuous rather than total, and therefore open to resistance and evasion, and (ii) exercised through sound and hearing as much as through vision.","",""
"2010","Empowering Residents: A Theoretical Framework for Negotiating Surveillance Technologies","    The aim of this article is to develop an understanding of negotiation as a proactive user behavior in response to persuasive, surveillance-enabling technologies. We work with a case where the ambition is to use maps to persuade residents in marginalized residential areas to take co-ownership of the future of their neighborhood. However, we argue that by negotiating persuasive technologies, residents can domesticate and “reconfigure” these, thus we need to broaden the dominant understanding of persuasion (Fogg 2003) to include the process of negotiation. Inspired by Actor-Network Theory, we argue that we need a framework that takes into account negotiations of other actors than the persuasive designer to bring a more nuanced and active understanding of responses to surveillance technologies. This article suggests that negotiation can be both user empowering as well as a productive measure in an ongoing designer-user relation. While the designer persuades, the user negotiates, and this dynamic relation contributes to potentially better technology development. ","",""
"2010","Surveillance and Alienation in the Online Economy","The critical literature on commercial monitoring and so-called “free labor” (Terranova, 2000) locates exploitation in realms beyond the workplace proper, noting the productivity of networked activity including the creation of user-generated-content and the profitability of commercial sites for social networking and communication. The changing context of productivity in these realms, however, requires further development of a critical concept of exploitation. This article defines exploitation as the extraction of unpaid, coerced, and alienated labor. It considers how such a definition might apply to various forms of unpaid but profit-generating online activity, arguing that commercial monitoring redoubles the conscious, intentional activity of users in ways that render it amenable to a critique of exploitation. Given the role of commercial monitoring in the emerging online economy, the paper emphasizes the importance of supplementing privacy critiques with approaches that identify the ways in which new forms of surveillance represent a form of power that seeks to manage and control consumer behavior.","",""

It is argued that surveillance is a crucial aspect of care and this can be experienced as both negative and positive by children and staff. In particular the research was concerned with how forms of control and monitoring are conducted in relation to food and food practices. Relations of power and resistance within the context of a care home are routinely played out and through food. The paper illustrates the ways in which children variously resist and accept regulation and control in relation to food. It also considers the manner in which staff try to implement an ambience and ethos within the care home that is not overtly institutional yet allows them to provide care for the children. In order to achieve this, often contested conceptions of ‘family’ and ‘home’ are drawn upon and operationalised through food related practices and interactions. Three residential care homes for children in central Scotland were studied using a mix of interviewing and ethnographic techniques.","",""

While its changes in this domain have often prompted privacy advocates and news media to critique the company, Facebook has continued to attract more users to its service. This raises a question about whether or not Facebook's changes in privacy approaches matter and, if so, to whom. This paper examines the attitudes and practices of a cohort of 18- and 19-year-olds surveyed in 2009 and again in 2010 about Facebook's privacy settings. Our results challenge widespread assumptions that youth do not care about and are not engaged with navigating privacy. We find that, while not universal, modifications to privacy settings have increased during a year in which Facebook's approach to privacy was hotly contested. We also find that both frequency and type of Facebook use as well as Internet skill are correlated with making modifications to privacy settings. In contrast, we observe few gender differences in how young adults approach their Facebook privacy settings, which is notable given that gender differences exist in so many other domains online.

Just as representations of Nazism have become inextricably entwined with a specific kind of authoritarian, murderous dictatorship, Garton Ash argues that so too the Stasi and its agents have come to stand in for a certain kind of authoritarian dictatorship in the popular imagination, whose consequences aren’t necessarily as physically harmful as those of National Socialism, but are, instead, dependent on strategies encompassing surveillance, control, and coercion to achieve their objectives.Surveillance societies, such as the former German Democratic Republic, have long been settings for both influential and popular fictions. Social theory has also been illuminated by some of these fictions, with theorists such as Haggerty and Ericson claiming that surveillance models originating in the work of Jeremy Bentham and George Orwell are central to conceptualising and understanding surveillance practices, as well as social attitudes towards them. Orwell’s terminology in particular and his ideas relating to “Thought Police,” “Big Brother,” “Room 101,” “Newspeak,” and others, have entered into popular discourse and, to a large extent, have become synonymous with the idea of surveillance itself. Even the adjective “Orwellian” has come to be associated with totalitarian regimes of absolute control, so much so that “when a totalitarian setup, whether in fact or in fantasy ... is called ‘Orwellian,’ it is as if George Orwell had helped to create it instead of helping to dispel its euphemistic thrall” (James 72).As sociologist David Lyon notes: “much surveillance theory is dystopian” (201). And while the fear, helplessness, and emotional experiences of living under the suspicion and scrutiny of security services such as Von Donnersmarck’s Stasi or Orwell’s Party are necessarily muted by theory, it is often through fictions such as The Lives of Others and Nineteen Eighty-Four that these can be fully expressed. In the case of The Lives of Others and Nineteen Eighty-Four, both use central love stories to express the affective experiences associated with constant surveillance and use these as a way of contrasting and critiquing the way in which surveillance, power, and control operate in both settings. Like many other texts which represent surveillance societies, both fictions present a bleak picture, with the surveillance undertaken by the Party or Stasi being framed as a deindividualising or depersonifying social force which eliminates privacy, compromises trust, and blurs the distinction between the self and the state, the personal and the social, the individual and the ideology. This brings me to the purpose of this paper, which is concerned with two things: firstly, it will discuss these oppositions alongside the role of social surveillance and private lives in Von Donnersmarck’s film. The existing scholarly work on The Lives of Others tends to focus on its historical setting—the former East Germany—and, consequently, emphasises its generic status as a “political thriller,” “fierce and gloomy historical drama” full of “psychological terror,” and so on. Nevertheless, this overstates the film’s social milieu at the expense of the personal drama which drives the narrative—the film is underpinned by multiple overlapping love stories—so my focus is more concerned with highlighting the latter, rather than the former. I am not going to attempt to provide any sort of a comparative case study between the film’s representation of the Stasi and the historical realities upon which it is based, for example. Secondly, much has been made of the transformation of the character Gerd Wiesler, who shifts from “a loyal Stasi officer with an unswervingly grim demeanour” into “a good man” with a conscience—to borrow from Von Donnersmarck’s commentary. I will conclude by briefly addressing this transformation with reference to surveillance and its place within the film’s narrative.The Lives of Others is a film which, like Nineteen Eighty-Four, carries the signifiers of a very specific kind of surveillance. Set in the former German Democratic Republic in the year 1984—perhaps a self-conscious reference to Orwell—the film is concerned with the playwright Georg Dreyman (played by Sebastian Koch), “the only nonsubversive writer who is still read in the West”; his girlfriend, the actress Christa-Maria Sieland (played by Martina Gedeck); and the Stasi Captain Wiesler (played by Ulrich Mühe). In his capacity as expert interrogator and security agent, Wiesler is assigned to spy on Dreyman and Sieland because they are suspected of being disloyal, and as a playwright and actress—and thus, persons of social, intellectual, and cultural influence—this will never do. Accordingly, Dreyman and Sieland’s apartment is bugged and the pair is constantly surveilled. Their home, previously a space of relative privacy, becomes the prime site for this surveillance, forcing their “private or ‘personal life’”—which is understood as “the special preserve of intimacy, affection, trust and elective affinity”—into “the larger world of impersonal and instrumental [social] relations” governed by the East German state (Weintraub and Kumar xiii). The surveillance in the film is a “creature of its social context,” to borrow James Rule’s terminology (300). Rule argued that all systems of surveillance are “distinctive of certain social orders” and that their “continued growth is closely tied to other changes in their social structural contexts” (300). This is certainly true of the surveillance in The Lives of Others, which is characterised by effectiveness through totality, rather than technological sophistication. Broadly speaking, surveillance in the former East Germany was top-down and hierarchical and connected with the maintenance of the ruling party’s power. Metaphors abound when describing the Stasi’s surveillance network—it was an “octopus,” a “multi-headed hydra,” a beast of gargantuan size at the very heart of the East German Party-State (Childs and Popplewell xiii). Needless to say, the Stasi was big. Since Die Wende, especially, much has been made of the enormity of the Stasi’s bureaucracy and its capacity to “intrude.” Between 1950 and 1989 it employed 274,000 people in an official capacity and, after the collapse of the East German regime anywhere up to 500,000 East German Inoffizielle Mitarbeiter—Unofficial Collaborators: ordinary citizens from the East German state who had been coerced into spying on friends or family members, or had volunteered their services—had been identified (Koehler 8). This equated to approximately one Stasi officer, informer or collaborator per 6.5 East German citizens (Koehler 9). Put in perspective, there was one KGB agent per 5,800 citizens in the Soviet Union, while the Gestapo—often held up as the ultimate example of the abuses and evils inherent in many secret police forces—had one officer for every 2,000 Germans (Koehler 9).And it is this hydra, this octopus that Dreyman and Sieland encounter in The Lives of Others. Led by Wiesler and driven by suspicion, the Stasi listens in on their conversations, follows the couple clandestinely, and gathers information which may reveal “politically incorrect behaviour” (Rainer and Siedler 251). The reach of the Stasi’s surveillance network and its capacity to collect information is demonstrated through a variety of means—beginning with the interrogation scene during the film’s opening where the scent of a dissident is stored in a jar for later use, to the final coercion in which Sieland becomes an IM. The Stasi in the film consistently demonstrates an uncanny ability to know: to gather information through surveillance, and to use this surveillance to demonstrate and secure its power. As Rule points out: “the ability of any system of surveillance to control and shape the behaviour of ... [those under surveillance] depends very much on the certainty with which it manages to bring information generated in one social and temporal setting to bear elsewhere” (302). Intense “surveillance and potent mechanisms of control are useless” if those under surveillance can simply hide behind closed doors or escape over a wall—so the “system must arrange its boundaries so that both its surveillance and control activities cover a sufficiently broad area” to prevent escape through movement (Rule 303–304).  In a total surveillance society such as the one seen in The Lives of Others, there is no “escape” from the Stasi other than death—suicide—which defines many of the film’s key turning points. The surveillance undertaken by the Stasi may be stored in jars in some cases; however, it can also be retrieved to confirm suspicions, to coerce and control, and, ultimately, to further the objectives of the Party State.Despite the Stasi’s best attempts, however, Dreyman is consistently loyal—he believes in the principles of socialism and, to quote Wiesler’s superior Grubitz (played by Ulrich Tukur), he “thinks East Germany is the fairest land of them all.” Eventually it is revealed that the real reason for the surveillance is not about suspected disloyalty to the state, but a personal vendetta by the Party’s Minister for Culture, Bruno Hempf (played by Thomas Thieme), who wants Sieland for himself and is using his influence within the Stasi to bring Dreyman down. The use of surveillance for personal gain, rather than for social “good” proves too much for Wiesler who undergoes a “psychological and political transformation” and begins to empathise with the subjects of his investigation (Diamond 811). Dreyman undergoes a similar transformation after the suicide of his mentor and friend Albert Jerska (played by Volkmar Kleinert)—a theatre director whose life was made meaningless after he was blacklisted by the Stasi. This brings me back to the question of the personal and the social, which forms the fundamental tension within the film and is the basis of this paper. Historically, notions of “public” and “private,” “social” and “personal”—as understood in state-socialist societies such as the former East Germany—revolved around “the victimised ‘us’ and the newly powerful ‘them’ who ruled the state” (Gal 87). Nevertheless, the distinction between the personal and the social—or public and private—has long been a social organising principle and, as a result, has acted as a springboard into “many key issues of social and political analysis, of moral and political debate, and of ordering everyday life” (Weintraub and Kumar 1). The idea of “privacy”—which is often conceptualised simplistically as a “uni-dimensional, rigidly dichotomous and absolute, fixed and universal concept” (Marx 157)—is used as a shield against any number of perceived political, social, or moral infringements, including surveillance, and can be said to be organised around the idea of visibility, where “private” encompasses that which is “able and / or entitled to be kept hidden, sheltered or withdrawn from others” (Weintraub and Kumar 6).  The private is thus connected with a life free of surveillance and scrutiny, where people have a reprieve from monitored social relations and the collective self. Privacy is “fundamentally rooted” in a personal life “delineated by private space” without surveillance, and is interlinked with the idea of a “society of strangers,” where strangers are, by definition, individuals who have been denied access to our personal lives and private spaces (Lyon 21). The act of disclosure and the provision of access to our personal affairs is thus regarded as a voluntary gesture of faith and trust—an invitation into the private, which makes our lives—the lives of strangers, the lives of “others”—familiar and knowable. In The Lives of Others it is Dreyman and Sieland who, because of the personal relationship they have maintained in the relative privacy of their apartment, are the “strangers” or “others” the Stasi wants to make knowable. When Wiesler first encounters the couple at the premiere of Dreyman’s play—the tellingly named The Faces of Love—he seems disturbed by the affection they share for one another and for their fellow artists. Later, it is a brief moment of intimacy between Dreyman and Sieland that motivates Wiesler into overseeing the surveillance himself—a decision that contributes to his eventual transformation. Wiesler is disturbed by Dreyman and Sieland’s relationship because it demonstrates personal loyalties born out of private emotions which exist beyond the gaze of the Stasi and, thus, beyond the control of the state. In Wiesler’s world the only true love is social love—the impersonal love of the state—and anything resembling the romantic or the personal is not only unfamiliar, but suspicious and potentially subversive. In Von Donnersmarck’s words, Wiesler has shut out his humanity to adhere to a principle, which he values above and beyond all else. His suspicion of Dreyman and Sieland thus exemplifies how the experience and interpretation of personal emotions is dependent, in part, on social and cultural circumstances. For Wiesler, private emotions are dangerous, unknowable, and unfamiliar. They belong to a realm “which places extraordinary emphasis on the concept of individuality and individual self-identity” in “a society which distinguishes more or less plainly between public positions and personal roles; ... and, perhaps most importantly, [they belong to] a society that grants a high degree of mobility and flexibility in relationships in general, [and] places personal choice at the core of mating and marriage rituals ...” (Solomon xxviii). A society, in other words, quite unlike the one in The Lives of Others. By monitoring the personal lives of Dreyman and Sieland, the Stasi thus collapses the distinction between the personal and the social, the private and the public. Surveillance transforms personal emotions into public information, and it is this information which is later manipulated for the social “good” and at the expense of Dreyman and Sieland’s personal lives. In The Lives of Others there is no separation between the personal and the social, the public and the private—there is only the Party and there is only the Stasi. I want to conclude by briefly discussing the transformation of Wiesler, which is emblematic of the film’s central message about the “capacity of human beings for goodness, [love], compassion and change” (Diamond 812–13). Von Donnersmarck makes this message clear in one of the film’s early scenes, where, at the opening of his play The Faces of Love, Dreyman appeals to Minister Hempf about Jerska’s blacklisting, suggesting that Jerska is remorseful and has changed. Hempf tells Dreyman: “That’s what we all love about your plays ... the idea that people can change. People don’t change.” Hempf is suggesting, of course, that there is no “normalising gaze” in the East German state; that there is only suspicion, discrimination and exclusion. Once you have been identified as “abnormal,” “subversive” or “an enemy” by the Stasi’s surveillance, you can never remove yourself from the category of suspicion—change is impossible. But Wiesler and Dreyman do change, however unlikely Wiesler’s transformation may be. While the film’s style suggest the men are opposites—Dreyman dresses like a chic (West) German intellectual in tweed jackets and horn-rimmed glasses, while Wiesler gets around in stiff Stasi uniforms and grey nylon tracksuits; Dreyman’s home reflects his status as a man of culture and taste, with literature, art, and music dominating the bohemian aesthetic, while Wiesler’s home is cold, empty, characterless, and generic; Dreyman shares a personal life with Sieland, while Wiesler is visited by a prostitute who services all the Stasi men in his building “on a tight schedule”  and so on—they share a fundamental similarity: they both believe in socialism, in the East German state, and the utopian ideals that are now obscured under layers of bureaucracy, surveillance, corruption, and suspicion (Diamond 815). Nevertheless, after discovering that Sieland is being forced into sexual encounters with party Minister Hempf, the instigator of the surveillance, Wiesler begins to identify with the couple, and, for the first time, breaches the boundary between surveillance and interference, between social observation and personal intervention. After seeing the Minister’s car pull up with Sieland inside, Wiesler uses his surveillance technologies to alert Dreyman to her return—he rings the couple’s doorbell whilst muttering, “Time for some bitter truths.” Later, after Sieland showers and collapses “in mute despair,” Dreyman cradles her in his arms, after which the film cuts to a shot of Wiesler still listening, but mirroring their body language (Diamond 817). This is the moment at which the film makes clear that Wiesler’s role has shifted from social monitoring to something more personal—he has developed an emotional investment in the surveillance he is conducting and is identifying and empathising with the subjects of his surveillance. Eventually this goes further—he steals a copy of Brecht’s poems from their apartment and reads “Memory of Marie A.” a poem which “expresses poignant longings for a love that is both enticing and elusive” (Diamond 822).  By breaching the boundary between the social and the personal, Wiesler undergoes a complete transformation, and his continued interventions drive the narrative and dictate outcomes not only for himself, but also for Dreyman and Sieland. In shifting his role from surveillance to engagement, from observation to intervention, and from state suspicion to personal investment, Wiesler eventually, and in his own way, falls in love. Surveillance is the defining characteristic of The Lives of Others—it is both oppressive and redemptive, sinister and salvational, an obstacle and an opening. It defines both the film’s social setting and enables and impacts on the personal relationships between characters. The Lives of Others brings home the horrors of East Germany under the Stasi—albeit in a stylised and technically accomplished fashion—by emphasising the personal and social costs associated with the corrupt, petty, and spiteful regime through human drama. The ultimate result is a film with a surveillance network that swings between care and control, observation and engagement, with Wiesler exemplifying all of these traits. And while the end result of the Stasi’s surveillance is destructive and despairing, in the words of Von Donnersmarck, it also gives characters “the ability to do the right thing, even in social conditions that seem to eradicate the very possibility of personal goodness.”ReferencesChilds, David and Richard Popplewell.

"2011","Suspicious Images: Iconophobia and the Ethical Gaze","If iconophobia is defined as the suspicion and anxiety towards the power exerted by images, its history is an ancient one in all of its Platonic, Christian, and Judaic forms. At its most radical, iconophobia results in an act of iconoclasm, or the total destruction of the image. At the other end of the spectrum, contemporary iconophobia may be more subtle. Images are simply withdrawn from circulation with the aim of eliminating their visibility. In his book Images in Spite of All, French art historian Georges Didi-Huberman questions the tradition of suspicion and denigration governing visual representations of the Holocaust, arguing we have abdicated our ethical obligation to try to imagine. This essay will argue that disruptions to traditional modes of spectatorship shift the terms of viewing from suspicion to ethical participation. By building on Didi-Huberman’s discussion of images and the spectatorial gaze, this essay will consider Laura Waddington’s 2002 documentary film Border. Waddington spent six months hiding with asylum seekers in the area surrounding the Red Cross refugee camp at Sangatte in northern France. I will argue that Waddington proposes a model of spectatorship that implicates the viewer into the ethical content of the film. By seeking to restore the dignity and humanity of the asylum seekers rather than viewing them with suspicion, Border is an acute reminder of our moral responsibility to bear witness to that which lies beyond the boundaries of conventional representations of asylum seekers.The economy managing the circulation of mainstream media images is a highly suspicious mechanism. After the initial process of image selection and distribution, what we are left with is an already homogenised collection of predictable and recyclable media images. The result is an increasingly iconophobic media gaze as the actual content of the image is depleted. In her essay “Precarious Life,” Judith Butler describes this economy in terms of the “normative processes” of control exercised by the mainstream media, arguing that the structurally unbalanced media representations of the ‘other’ result in creating a progressively dehumanised effect (Butler 146). This process of disidentification completes the iconophobic circle as the spectator, unable to develop empathy, views the dehumanised subject with increasing suspicion. Written in the aftermath of 9/11 and the ensuing War on Terror, Butler’s insights are important as they alert us to the possibility of a breach or rupture in the image economy. It is against Butler’s normative processes that Didi-Huberman’s critique of Holocaust iconoclasm and Waddington’s Border propose a slippage in representation and spectatorship capable of disrupting the homogeneity of the mass circulation of images.Most images that have come to represent the Holocaust in our collective memory were either recorded by the Nazis for propaganda or by the Allies on liberation in 1945. Virtually no photographs exist from inside the concentration camps. This is distinct from the endlessly recycled images of gaunt, emaciated survivors and bulldozers pushing aside corpses which have become critical in defining Holocaust iconography (Saxton 14). Familiar and recognisable, this visual record constitutes a “visual memory bank” that we readily draw upon when conjuring up images of the Holocaust. What occurs, however, when an image falls outside the familiar corpus of Holocaust representation? This was the question raised in a now infamous exhibition held in Paris in 2001 (Chéroux). The exhibition included four small photographs secretly taken by members of the Sonderkommando inside the Nazi extermination camp Auschwitz-Birkenau in August 1944. The Sonderkommando were the group of prisoners who were delegated the task of the day-to-day running of the crematoria. The photographs were smuggled out of the camps in a tube of toothpaste, and eventually reached the Polish Resistance.By evading the surveillance of the SS the photographs present a breach in the economy of Holocaust iconography. They exist as an exception to the rule, mere fragments stolen from beneath the all-seeing eye of the SS Guards and their watch towers. Despite operating in an impossible situation, the inmate maintained the belief that these images could provide visual proof of the existence of the gas chambers. The images are testimony produced inside the camp itself, a direct challenge to the discourse emphasising the prohibition of representation of the Holocaust and in particular the gas chambers.  Figure 1 The Auschwitz crematorium in operation, photograph by Sonderkommando prisoners August 1944 © www.auschwitz.org.plDidi-Huberman’s essay marks a point of departure from the iconophobia which has stressed the unimaginable (Lanzmann), unknowable (Lyotard), and ultimately unrepresentable (Levinas) nature of the Holocaust since the 1980s. Denigrated and derided, images have been treated suspiciously by this philosophical line of thought, emphasising the irretrievable gap between representation and the Holocaust. In a direct assault on the tradition of framing the Holocaust as unrepresentable, Didi-Huberman’s essay becomes a plea to the moral and ethical responsibility to bear witness. He writes of the obligation to these images, arguing that “it is a response we must offer, as a debt to the words and images that certain prisoners snatched, for us, from the harrowing Real of their experience” (3). The photographs are not simply archival documents, but a testament to the humanity of the members of the Sonderkommando the Nazis sought to erase.Suspicion towards the potential power exerted by images has been neutralised by models of spectatorship privileging the viewer’s mastery and control. In traditional theories of film spectatorship, the spectator is rendered in terms of a general omnipotence described by Christian Metz as “an all-powerful position which is of God himself...” (49). It is a model of spectatorship that promotes mastery over the image by privileging the unilateral gaze of the spectator. Alternatively, Didi-Huberman evokes a long counter tradition within French literature and philosophy of the “seer seen,” where the object of the spectator’s gaze is endowed with the ability to return the gaze resulting in various degrees of anxiety and paranoia. The image of the “seer seen” recurs throughout the writing of Baudelaire, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, Lacan, and Barthes, negating the unilateral gaze of an omnipotent spectator (Didi-Huberman, Ce que nous voyons).Didi-Huberman explicitly draws upon Jacques Lacan’s thinking about the gaze in light of this tradition of the image looking back. In his 1964 seminars on vision in the Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis, Lacan dedicates several chapters to demonstrate how the visual field is structured by the symbolic order, the real, symbolic and the imaginary. Following Lacan, Didi-Huberman introduces two terms, the veil-image and the tear-image, which are analogous with Lacan’s imaginary and the real. The imaginary, with its connotations of illusion and fantasy, provides the sense of wholeness in both ourselves and what we perceive. For Didi-Huberman, the imaginary corresponds with the veil-image. Within the canon of Holocaust photography, the veil-image is the image “where nobody really looks,” the screen or veil maintaining the spectator’s illusion of mastery (81). We might say that in the circulation of Holocaust atrocity images, the veil serves to anaesthetise and normalise the content of the image.Lacan’s writing on the gaze, however, undermines the spectator’s mastery over the image by placing the spectator not at the all-seeing apex of the visual field, but located firmly within the visual field of the image. Lacan writes, “in the scopic field, the gaze is outside, I am looked at, that is to say, I am the picture...I am photo-graphed” (Lacan 106). The spectator is ensnared in the gaze of the image as the gaze is reciprocated. For Didi-Huberman, the veil-image seeks to disarm the threat to the spectator being caught in the image-gaze. Lacan describes this neutralisation in terms of “the pacifying, Apollonian effect of painting. Something is given not so much to the gaze as to the eye, something that involves the abandonment, the laying down, of the gaze” (101). Further on, Lacan expresses this in terms of the dompte-regarde, or a taming of the gaze (109). The veil-image maintains the fiction of the spectator’s ascendency by subduing the threat of the image-gaze.   In opposition to the veil-image is the tear-image, in which for Didi-Huberman “a fragment of the real escapes” (81). This represents a rupture in the visual field. The real is presented here in terms of the tuché, or missed encounter, resulting in the spectator’s anxiety and trauma. As the real cannot be represented, it is the point where representation collapses, rupturing the illusion of coherency maintained by the veil-image. Operating as an exception or disruption to the rule, the tear-image disrupts the image economy. No longer neutralised, the image returns the gaze, shattering the illusion of the all-seeing mastery of the spectator. Didi-Huberman describes this tearing exception to the rule, “where everyone suddenly feels looked at” (81).To treat the Sonderkommando photographs as tear-images, not veil-images, we are offered a departure from classic models of spectatorship. We are forced to align ourselves and identify with the “inhuman” gaze of the Sonderkommando. The obvious response is to recoil. The gaze here is not the paranoid Sartrean gaze, evoking shame in the spectator-as-voyeur. Nor are these photographs reassuring narcissistic veil-images, but will always remain the inimical gaze of the Other—tearing, ripping images, which nonetheless demand that we do not turn away. It is an ethical response we must offer.   If the power of the tear-image resides in its ability to disrupt traditional modes of representation and spectatorship, I would like to discuss this in relation to Laura Waddington’s 2004 film Border. Waddington is a Brussels based filmmaker with a particular interest in documenting the movement of displaced peoples. Just as the Sonderkommando photographs were taken clandestinely from beneath the gaze of the SS, Waddington evaded the surveillance of the French police and helicopter patrols as she bore witness to the plight of asylum seekers trying to reach England. Border presents her stolen testimony, operating outside the familiar iconography of mainstream media’s representation of asylum seekers.  If we were to consider the portrayal of asylum seekers by the Australian media in terms of the veil-image, we are left with a predictable body of homogenised and neutralised stock media images. The myth of Australia being overrun by boat people is reinforced by the visual iconography of the news media. Much like the iconography of the Holocaust, these types of images have come to define the representations of asylum seekers. Traceable back to the 2001 Tampa affair images tend to be highly militarised, frequently with Australian Navy patrol boats in the background. The images reinforce the ‘stop the boats’ rhetoric exhibited on both sides of politics, paradoxically often working against the grain of the article’s editorial content.    Figure 2 Thursday 16 Apr 2009 there was an explosion on board a suspected illegal entry vessel (SIEV) 36 in the vicinity of Ashmore Reef. © Commonwealth of Australia 2011Figure 3 The crew of HMAS Albany, Attack One, board suspected illegal entry vessel (SIEV) 38 © Commonwealth of Australia 2011 The media gaze is structurally unbalanced against the suffering of asylum seekers. In Australia asylum seekers are detained in mandatory detention, in remote sites such as Christmas Island and Woomera. Worryingly, the Department of Immigration maintains strict control over media representations of the conditions inside the camps, resulting in a further abstraction of representation. Geographical isolation coupled with a lack of transparent media access contributes to the ongoing process of dehumanisation of the asylum seekers. Judith Butler describes this as “The erasure of that suffering through the prohibition of images and representations” (146). In the endless recycling of images of leaky fishing boats and the perimeters of detention centres, our critical capacity to engage becomes progressively eroded. These images fulfil the function of the veil-image, where nobody really looks as there is nothing left to see.  Figure 4 Asylum seekers arrive by boat on Christmas Island, Friday, July 8, 2011. AAP Image/JOSH JERGA Figure 5 Woomera Detention Centre. AAP Image/ROB HUTCHISON                  By reading Laura Waddington’s Border against an iconophobic media gaze, we are afforded the opportunity to reconsider this image economy and the suspicious gaze of the spectator it seeks to solicit. Border reminds us of the paradoxical function of the news image—it shows us everything, but nothing at all. In a subtle interrogation of our indifference to the existence of asylum seekers and their suffering, Border is a record of the six months Waddington spent hidden in the fields surrounding the French Red Cross camp at Sangatte in 2002. Sangatte is a small town in northern France, just south of Calais and only one and a half hours’ drive from Paris. The asylum seekers are predominantly Afghan and Iraqi. Border is a record of the last stop in their long desperate journey to reach England, which then had comparatively humane asylum seeking policies. The men are attempting to cross the channel tunnel, hidden in trucks and on freight trains. Many are killed or violently injured in their attempts to evade capture by the French police. Nevertheless they are sustained by the hope that England will offer them “a better life.”  Figure 6 Still from Border showing asylum seekers in the fields of Sangatte ©Laura Waddington 2002Waddington dedicates the film, “for those I met.” It is an attempt to restore the humanity and dignity of the people who are denied individual identities. Waddington refuses to let “those who I met” remain nameless. She names them—Omar, Muhammad, Abdulla—and narrates their individual stories. Border is Waddington’s attempt to return a voice to those who have been systematically dehumanised, by-products of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In his classic account of documentary, Bill Nichols describes six modes of documentary representation (99–138). In Border, Waddington is working in the participatory mode, going into the field and participating in the lives of others (115). It is via this mode of representation that Waddington is able to heighten the ethical encounter with the asylum seekers. Waddington was afforded no special status as a filmmaker, but lived as a refugee among the asylum seekers during the six months of filming. At no point are we granted visible access to Waddington, yet we are acutely aware of her presence. She is physically participating in the drama unfolding before her. At times, we become alert to her immediate physical danger, as she too runs through the fields away from the police and their dogs.The suspicious gaze is predicated on maintaining a controlled distance between the spectator and the subject. Michele Aaron (82–123) has recently argued for a model of spectatorship as an intrinsically ethical encounter. Aaron demonstrates that spectatorship is not neutral but always complicit—it is a contract between the spectator and the film. Particularly relevant to the purposes of this essay is her argument concerning the “merging gaze,” where the gaze of the filmmaker and spectator are collapsed. This has the effect of folding the spectator into the film’s narrative (93). Waddington exploits the documentary medium to implicate the spectator into the structure of the film. It is in Waddington’s full participatory immersion into the documentary itself that undermines the conventional distance maintained by the spectator. The spectator can no longer remain neutral as the lines of demarcation between filmmaker and spectator collapse.Waddington was shooting alone with a small video camera at night in extremely low-light conditions. The opening scene is dark and grainy, refusing immediate entry into the film. As our eyes gradually adjust to the light, we realise we are looking at a young man, concealed in the bushes from the menacing glare of the lights of oncoming traffic. Waddington does not afford us the all-perceiving spectatorial mastery over the image. Rather, we are crouching with her as she records the furtive movements of the man. The background sound, a subtle and persistent hum, adds to a growing disquiet, a looming sense of apprehension concerning the fate of these asylum seekers.  Figure 7 Grainy still showing the Red Cross camp in Border ©Laura Waddington 2002Waddington’s commentary has been deliberately pared back and her voice over is minimal with extended periods of silence. The camera alternates from meditative, lingering shots taken from the safety offered by the Red Cross camp, to the fields where the shots are truncated and chaotically framed. The actions of the asylum seekers jerk and shudder, producing an image akin to the flicker effect of early silent cinema because the film is not running at the full rate of 24 frames per second. Here the images become blurred to the point of unintelligibility. Like the Sonderkommando photographs, the asylum seekers exist as image-fragments, shards stolen by Waddington’s camera as she too works hard to evade capture.  Tension gradually increases throughout the film, cumulating in a riot scene after a decision to close the camp down. The sweeping search lights of the police helicopter remind us of the increased surveillance undertaken by the border patrols. Without the safety of the Red Cross camp, the asylum seekers are offered no protection from the increasing police brutality. With nowhere else to go, the asylum seekers are forced into the town of Sangatte itself, to sleep in the streets. They are huddled together, and there is a faintly discernible chant repeating in the background, calling to the UN for help. At points during the riot scene, Waddington completely cuts the sound, enveloping the film in a haunting silence. We are left with a mute montage of distressing still images recording the clash between the asylum seekers and police. Again, we are reminded of Waddington’s lack of immunity to the violence, as the camera is deliberately knocked from her hand by a police officer. Figure 8 Clash between asylum seekers and police in Border ©Laura Waddington 2002It is via the merged gaze of the camera and the asylum seekers that Waddington exposes the fictional mastery of the spectator’s gaze. The fury of the tear-image is unleashed as the image-gaze absorbs the spectator into its visual field. No longer pacified by the veil, the spectator is unable to retreat to familiar modes of spectatorship to neutralise and disarm the image. With no possible recourse to desire and fantasy, the encounter becomes intrinsically ethical. Refusing to be neutralised by the Lacanian veil, the tear-image resists the anaesthetising effects of recycled and predictable images of asylum seekers.This essay has argued that a suspicious spectator is the product of an iconophobic media gaze. In the endless process of recycling, the critical capacity of the image to engage the viewer becomes progressively disarmed. Didi-Huberman’s reworking of the Lacanian gaze proposes a model of spectatorship designed to disrupt this iconophobic image economy. The veil-image asks little from us as spectators beyond our complicity. Protected by the gaze of the image, the fiction of the all—perceiving spectator is maintained. By abandoning this model of spectatorship as Didi-Huberman and Waddington are asking us to do, the unidirectional relationship between the viewer and the image is undermined. The terms of spectatorship may be relocated from suspicion to an ethical, participatory mode of engagement. We are laying down our weapons to receive the gaze of the Other.  ReferencesAaron, Michele. Spectatorship: The Power of Looking On. London: Wallflower, 2007.Border. Waddington, Laura.

For instance, even when people claim that they value their information privacy, they often trade their personal information for tangible or intangible benefits. In this article, the research on different ways in which people respond to risks to privacy is examined. They include information seeking to reduce uncertainty, the withholding of information, and the provision of fabricated information. The impact of trust and inducements on Internet users’ willingness to share personal information is also examined. Thereafter, important postulates from theories in communication, social psychology, and sociology are synthesized into a comprehensive theoretical framework for personal information-related behaviors in the online environment.","",""

"2011","Mutual Transparency or Mundane Transgressions? Institutional Creeping on Facebook","This article explores the post–secondary sector’s adoption of social media. Social media plays an increasing role in the visibility of personal information. The term refers to a set of web–based services that facilitate the authorship and distribution of media between users. The most popular social media site is Facebook with over 750 million users worldwide. Facebook was originally launched as a service for university students to author and distribute information about their personal identity, interpersonal connections, and social activities. While Facebook has since expanded its scope beyond universities, student life remains a heavily ‘Facebooked’ phenomenon. University administrators are keenly aware of their students’ presence on this site, and are adopting new practices to harness Facebook as an extension of their professional duties. This paper draws upon findings from a series of fourteen semi–structured face–to–face interviews with various administrators and employees at a medium–sized university in Eastern Ontario. As Facebook first emerged in an academic context, these findings provide a rich example of how institutions can scrutinize populations using social media. These findings suggest that institutional surveillance on Facebook stems from ground–up practices prior to implementing top–down mandates, suggesting that these practices have developed from institutional users’ personal experiences with the site. As well, the visibility of the university and its reputation is offered by respondents as motive for scrutiny, suggesting a discourse of mutual transparency of both the university as an institution as well as its student population.","",""

"2011","In Defense of Privacy:  The Concept and the Regime"," It has recently become fashionable within the surveillance studies community to subject the concept and regime of “privacy protection” to some very rigorous criticism.   “Privacy” and all that it entails is argued to be too narrow, too based on liberal assumptions of subjectivity, too implicated in rights-based theory and discourse, insufficiently sensitive to the social sorting and discriminatory aspects of surveillance, and overly embroiled in spatial metaphors about “invasion” and “intrusion.”  As a concept, and as a way to frame the various social and political challenges encountered within “surveillance societies,” it is inadequate.   These critiques are important, and to some extent, have set scholarly inquiry on a new, exciting and broader, trajectory than that offered by privacy scholars. On closer examination, however, these critiques are often based on some faulty assumptions about the contemporary framing of the privacy issue, and about the governance of the issue.  Privacy, as a concept, regime, a set of policy instruments, and as a way to frame civil society activism, shows an extraordinary resilience. Surveillance scholars must learn to live with it.    ","",""

To this end, in this paper we discuss some of the many forms of obduracy that confront surveillance-capable information systems in hospitals. We draw upon primary data from three years of field research on the implementation and use of tracking and identification systems in U.S. hospitals to show that many of the control functions of hospital information systems are attenuated by individual resistance but also by a host of technical, material, financial, and cultural constraints.","",""

While the cultural approach to Italian fascism has been fertile (de Grazia 1981; 1992; Ghirardo 1996; Whitaker 2000), archival research on police state surveillance is very limited and, due to the language barrier, has remained unknown in the field of Surveillance Studies. This short contribution is both an attempt to reckon with a surveillance past that has been neglected until recent times and to engage with revealing studies specifically related to state surveillance and classification.   Surveillance under the duce was multifaceted and this paper aims at exploring the twenty years of the regime by focusing on different surveillance stages through a socio–historical perspective. Moreover, the concluding remarks briefly address some important issues which are related to political and cultural legacies of the fascist dictatorship that are essential to understanding some contemporary trends","",""

The country is currently experiencing a shift from  from paper-based national ID cards to electronic ID cards. The electronic ID card project commenced in 2007 and a pilot implementation was launched in the province of Bolu in 2008 by the Ministry of Interior, in collaboration with The National Research Institute of Electronics and Cryptology (UEKAE) and the Social Security Institution. The electronic  card incorporates a chip that carries identifying information including identity number, photograph and PIN, and also includes two fingerprints and two finger vein patterns as biometric indicators. The pilot implementation in Bolu has been integrated with social and health security systems in this province and aims to cover every resident of  by November 2010. The ultimate goal of the system is to eventually provide coverage for all citizens and all governmental spheres in the country.  The basic justifications for the centralisation and digitisation of the identity system are to increase efficiency in government administration and to maintain security in the era of e-government projects and European Union participation process. Right of citizenship is proven by means of the identification system and the ID card; therefore, to be out of the identification system means to be out of all administrative, political and commercial spheres of society. This study examines the necessity for and the promises of the electronic ID card and discusses the potential risks of the new system for citizens in terms of privacy, accessibility and other implications. Discussion of the meaning of government identification in the context of Turkey and developments in the identification system serve as a background for the study. ","",""
"2011","Building Biometrics: Knowledge Construction in the Democratic Control of Surveillance Technology"," If surveillance technologies are to be democratically controlled, then knowledge of these technologies is required. What do they do? How do they work? What are the costs? Yet gaining this knowledge in the context of a new surveillance technology such as biometrics can be problematic, because no settled definition exists. Competing versions of biometrics appear in both public and governmental discourse on the technology: different ideas about how often it fails, where it can be used and even what it does.  This paper is an exploration of how these different versions compete with each other, and how knowledge about a new surveillance technology such as biometrics is thus constructed. Through reference to original research in the context of the use of biometrics in the UK, points of stability and instability in the definition of biometrics are identified, and some of the processes through which instable definitions become stable are tracked.  From this empirical story, conclusions are drawn both for the process of construction of the meaning of technologies, and the general practice of surveillance in modern society. In particular, this paper aims to show how notions such as democratic control (central to the legitimation of state surveillance) become problematic when the very meaning of a technology is negotiable.

"2011","Neoliberal Deviants and Surveillance: Welfare Recipients under the watchful eye of Ontario Works","This article examines the current practices of welfare surveillance in Ontario Works (OW). Although neoliberal policy changes to social assistance have been well documented by a variety of scholars, the surveillance technologies behind them have received less scrutiny. The article questions how new surveillance technologies have transformed the administration and everyday practices of OW. Based on primary research of policy documents, legislation, regulations and directives, the paper explores the eight surveillance tools used to police OW recipients including the Consolidated Verification Procedure (CVP); Maintenance Enforcement with Computer Assistance (MECA); Service Delivery Model Technology (SDMT); Ontario Works Eligibility Criteria; Eligibility Review Officers (EROs); Audit of Recipients; Drug Testing and Welfare Fraud Hotlines. I argue the Ontario Works Act (OWA) 1997 justified increased surveillance, regulation and control of poor families creating new forms of surveillance. Additionally, the rationales behind the implementation of OW surveillance (anti–fraud and workfare) were unjustified and have made OW recipients, particularly racialized single mothers more vulnerable. Using a feminist political economy critique, the article endeavours to explore the gendered, classed and racialized implications of welfare surveillance and the expanding ways the state has created ‘deviants’ out of those who fail to be ‘good market citizens’.","",""

Drawing on our research in the cybercommunity Second Life, we observe that surveillance technologies are not heavily used to deal with deviance; instead, it is the power of relationships that form the fabric of social control and the regulation of deviance.

"2011","Playing with surveillance: The design of a mock RFID-based identification infrastructure for public engagement","In many jurisdictions around the globe, governments are developing ID schemes based on radio frequency identification (RFID) and biometric technologies. In Canada, four provinces recently implemented RFID based ‘enhanced’ drivers licences (EDL) in response to the United States’ Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI), which requires all persons entering the United States to present a valid passport or alternative ‘secure’ document to prove their identity and citizenship.  As researchers, we were closely involved in following the EDL policy development process. It became evident, as we attended legislative hearings, that parliamentarians needed clarifications to understand how the RFID identification scheme would function in practice. This project began with the goal of designing prototypes to demonstrate security and civil liberty concerns with a new RFID-based identification (ID) scheme in Canada. Influenced by participatory design and probe approaches to technology design, we built and tested mock infrastructures of RFID-based identification systems including low fidelity paper prototypes, and high fidelity prototypes using RFID-chipped cards, a database, antenna and reader. We also worked closely with civil society organizations to run public engagement activities. This paper reports on our attempts to create spaces for ‘playful’ engagement with RFID-based ID scheme technology at a time of ‘serious’ policy deliberations. Designed in the spirit of serious play, our mock ID infrastructures make the security and civil liberties challenges inherent in the proposed combination of ID cards and databases more visible, while demonstrating how such ID schemes work. At this point, we see future promise in the design and use of mock ID infrastructure for public engagement during relevant policy deliberations about ID schemes and databases which contain personal information.","",""
"2011","Surveillance Cinema: Narrative between Technology and Politics"," Taking as a starting point the recent surge in film and television narratives constructed around and by surveillance technologies, this essay offers a historical and theoretical reexamination of the manner in which screen narrative has organized political, racial, affective, and even material formations around and through surveillance. The essay demonstrates that even when films are focused on insistently visual deployments of surveillance technologies, the narrative construction around those technologies suggests highly complex dynamics—dynamics that neither psychoanalytic conceptions of voyeurism nor Foucault’s discourse on Bentham’s panopticon can entirely account for. A visual orientation has made it these approaches which have, within the realm of cinema studies, overwhelming served to explain the formations and functions of a variety of disparate surveillance-themed narratives. A more phenomenological reading of the relations between technology and narrative, as well as a more dynamic intersection with political philosophy as is represented in the growing field of surveillance studies, allows us to see how what this essay calls “surveillance cinema” serves to consolidate the stakes of surveillance technologies and practices with greater attention to historical and structural specificity.  ","",""

We show how young people’s independent travel  is mediated by (urban and rural) locational context, time of day, age and, in particular, by gender, and how adult efforts at surveillance may help shape resistances in the interstitial spaces which mobility itself provides.","",""

"2011","The Politics of Transparency and Surveillance in Post-Reunification Germany","     After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, reunified Germany intensified its policy of political transparency in an attempt to alleviate European concerns over a new German superpower. As transparency became a means to political legitimacy, the term and the practice acquired a distinctive ethical dimension. Germany’s on-going effort to come to terms with its national socialist past came to encompass the years of state socialism as well. As Germany’s new-found moral legitimacy came to rest on portraying East Germany as an immoral state, the former socialist state became an object that needed to be made fully transparent. The East German secret police (Stasi) and its vast surveillance apparatus became a natural target of transparency, as it inverted the logic of transparency by which the West German state claimed to function. As one form of transparency became key to legitimacy in Germany, its inversion – surveillance – became a marker of illegitimacy. In that sense, surveillance came to justify the unequal treatment of East Germans, of their political system, and of their public life. The conflict between divergent understandings of transparency became especially clear in a debate between two political figures, one from the former East and one from the former West. The case of German reunification serves to highlight the contingency of the meaning of the concepts of transparency, surveillance, and privacy. ","",""

However, an analysis that stressed only the material interaction between public and private actors, or the formal relationships between markets, technologies, policy and politics would leave out a broader understanding of the motives and expectations that are taking shape alongside the increase of surveillance mechanisms.   The fact that Barcelona (Spain) has so far only installed CCTV systems in the city center, in areas used intensively by tourists, reveals a picture that takes the political economy of surveillance beyond the corporation-meets-public-official discourse, which highlights private profit and the role of lobbies and lobbyists as a key reason behind the ascendance of surveillance technologies in public spaces, and addresses a more complex setting where the electoral expectations of local politicians meet the economic interest of the private shop owner meet the political aspirations of local media moguls meet the pressure to sell safe cities in the context of a global drive to see security technology and surveillance as the solution to all urban evils (and fast track to winning elections).   By looking at the actual articulation of the actors and interests involved in promoting security policies based on surveillance and monitoring of behavior in Barcelona’s public spaces, this piece presents less-explored understandings of the political economy of surveillance, making a case that highlights how global pressures, processes and imaginaries are received and negotiated at the local level.","",""

In presenting a series of imaginary spaces where private and public spheres were thought to converge and/or collide, I hope to show that transparency as a political value defended by liberal democracies functions on the basis of a powerful visual and fundamentally spatial metaphor: the window. Privacy is penetrated and protected on the other hand by the architectural construction of an alcove. Cultural relativism does not allow us to avoid the legal, political and social problems that individuals and lawmakers are confronting nations, societies and individuals in the wake of data gathering technologies (Humphreys 2011). The window and the alcove are simple, even primitive elements of built environments, but they are figures for porosity and protection upon which we might be able to construct analogical and theoretical relationships between different times and different cultures.","",""

Inheriting a socio-economic situation devastated by 30 years of guerilla warfare, the current government organised reconstruction efforts around the """"Warsay Ykäạlo Development Campaign"""" including National Service conscription. Over the past decade, the Eritrean state has developed techniques of surveillance of conscripts through the production and distribution of documents (IDs, laissez-passer) that must be presented at hundreds of checkpoints deployed throughout the national territory. Since the duration of National Service has been extended to an unlimited period of time, these surveillance mechanisms have mainly focused on cracking down, identifying and preventing defection. Despite important limitations to its surveillance of conscripts, the Eritrean state successfully keep hundreds of thousand of conscripts working in the National Service for many years. I argue that the surveillance apparatus itself, in both its bureaucratic and its military formulations contributes almost on a daily basis to (re)producing various uncertainties, fears, beliefs and expectations that are the core of relative coercion in the National Service. Moreover, bureaucratic procedures and police interventions contribute to the perpetuation and actualisation of a despotic modality of governance, inducing in conscripts the perception of the existence of a highly authoritarian police state that is effectively omniscient despite their experiences of the low-tech surveillance.","",""

It looks at non-technological practices of person-to-person surveillance of South Asian women by non-authoritative white Americans. The article discusses young women’s accounts of feeling ‘stared at’ by other Americans in public space, and examines how the effects of this surveillance relates to young women’s identities as South Asians in America.

The fieldwork also uncovers an extension of arguments about racialized surveillance to consider cultural bodily practices and clothing artifacts alongside racial identity.","",""

This proposed public-private partnership against crime raises important questions of how to balance values and interests as it situates business actors in an intricate position at the centre of conflicting claims and attributions. Based on an interview study of the banking industry in Sweden, this article analyses how surveillance for the state in relation to anti-money laundering is implemented into the business-as-usual of business actors. The findings support the initial assumption that the role of agent of the state is in conflict with the role of being an agent for private principals. However, a complementary tentative conclusion is that the demands of one principal could also be beneficial for promoting the interests of the other principal. Finally, it is suggested that making oneself more accountable may, in fact, be a means to limit corporate accountability.","",""

In this paper I describe how the use of naked body scanners at today’s airport is a most suitable expression of this dematerialized form of discipline, seeming at the same moment to both threaten and protect privacy, to be both non-intrusive and invasive, to both prepare for and determine seemingly unknowable but inevitable futures.   The flying public, meanwhile, is caught in the confusing middle, not knowing what to believe. They find themselves trapped in an undefined surveillance grid that both threatens and protects their freedoms. Will the scanners see through clothing and catch underwear-bombs, or won’t they? Will security agents scan, save, and distribute their naked images or won’t they? The public is left with questions rather than answers. This whole (visual) apparatus which was designed to create clarity and transparency seems opaque.   I suggest, then, that the opacity both of the issues at stake as well as of the scanned images of our naked bodies, confounds our categories and challenges long taken for granted social conventions about, for example, habeas corpus, privacy, security, the present, the future, potentiality, etc. Appearances, it seems, are still deceiving – even if what’s being made to appear are high-resolution scans of our naked bodies.  ","",""
"2011","Why parents help their children lie to Facebook about age: Unintended consequences of the &amp;lsquo;Children&amp;rsquo;s Online Privacy Protection Act&amp;rsquo;","Facebook, like many communication services and social media sites, uses its Terms of Service (ToS) to forbid children under the age of 13 from creating an account. Such prohibitions are not uncommon in response to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which seeks to empower parents by requiring commercial Web site operators to obtain parental consent before collecting data from children under 13. Given economic costs, social concerns, and technical issues, most general–purpose sites opt to restrict underage access through their ToS. Yet in spite of such restrictions, research suggests that millions of underage users circumvent this rule and sign up for accounts on Facebook. Given strong evidence of parental concern about children’s online activity, this raises questions of whether or not parents understand ToS restrictions for children, how they view children’s practices of circumventing age restrictions, and how they feel about children’s access being regulated. In this paper, we provide survey data that show that many parents know that their underage children are on Facebook in violation of the site’s restrictions and that they are often complicit in helping their children join the site. Our data suggest that, by creating a context in which companies choose to restrict access to children, COPPA inadvertently undermines parents’ ability to make choices and protect their children’s data. Our data have significant implications for policy–makers, particularly in light of ongoing discussions surrounding COPPA and other age–based privacy laws.","",""

Refusal is not a practical option, as data collection is an inherent condition of many essential societal transactions. We present one vernacular response to this regime of everyday surveillance, a tactic we call obfuscation. With a variety of possible motivations, actors engage in obfuscation by producing misleading, false, or ambiguous data with the intention of confusing an adversary or simply adding to the time or cost of separating bad data from good. Our paper develops a political theory of obfuscation, linking contemporary and historical cases to develop a descriptive account of obfuscation that is able to capture key commonalities in systems from radar chaff to BitTorrent.","",""

However, the innovations of Web 2.0 are symptomatic of a re-creation of cyberspace from an original “free for all,” in which websites had no normative constraints, toward a significant shift to website management that addresses privacy concerns. If the laws of the non-virtual world are difficult to apply to the online world, must the non-virtual world create new laws to control the online world? Should a balance be made between laws of the non-virtual and virtual worlds, or should a new set of laws be created specifically to govern the Internet? Concordant with this dilemma is the issue that although precedent may create new laws, when the law changes with the possibilities for uses and abuses of new online technologies, to what extent can it be said to either perpetuate or create to any internally consistent system?","",""

Privacy and the UK Census","Along with informed consent, anonymization is an accepted method of protecting the interests of research participants, while allowing data collected for official statistical purposes to be reused by other agencies within and outside government. The Decennial Census, carried out in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, is a major event in the production of research data and provides an important resource for a variety of organizations. This article combines ethical evaluation, a review of relevant law and guidance, and analysis of 30 qualitative interviews (carried out during the period of the 2001 UK Census), in order to explore the adequacy of the current framework for the protection of informational privacy in relation to census data. Taking account of Nissenbaum's concept of “contextual integrity,” Vedder's concept of “categorical privacy,” and Sen's call to heed of the importance of “actual behavior,” it will be argued that the current “contractarian” view of the relationship between an individual participant and the organization carrying out the Census does not engage sufficiently with actual uses of data. As a result, people have expectations of privacy that are not matched by practice and that the current normative—including the governance—framework cannot capture.","",""

"2012","Second Life Surveillance: Power to the People or Virtual Surveillance Society?","In the virtual world of Second Life, almost all content is user-generated and users retain a significant amount of autonomy. Given this freedom, participants are able to create, acquire, and use their own forms of surveillance. With accessible, affordable, and easy to use options, ordinary participants regularly deploy surveillance to protect themselves and their interests, businesses, and property. This paper examines the applications, awareness, and climate of surveillance within the virtual world. It argues that the socio-technical environment of Second Life facilitates problematic covert surveillance, but also makes possible forms of resistance. Examples of surveillance technologies and applications reveal the ways in which the virtual world supports and obscures surveillance, making these practices challenging for participants to detect, analyze, and respond to. However, the recent controversial case of RedZone not only highlights some of the most pressing issues with Second Life surveillance, but also the ways in which participants are able to respond to perceived threats. Although ostensibly intended to track Internet protocol (IP) addresses in order to prevent in-world harassment and theft, participants expressed widespread concern at the program’s potential for associating online and offline information and for linking together different avatars. In doing so, awareness was raised, protests were made, and counter-technologies were developed. These responses point to the ways in which the virtual world makes possible resistance to surveillance practices, especially when they are seen as a threat or intrusion.","",""

Maybe because an important number of citizens and social groups ask about the effects of surveillance in the redefinition of public and private spaces, the management of personal data, as well as the forms of social classification and the access to citizenship. There is also concern because surveillance devices introduce themes that do not appear in the traditional framework of analysis on democracy, the process of social and state modernization, as well as the administration and governing of society in the Latin-American region – such as identity cards, the use of video surveillance systems, personal databases, and radio-frequency systems, among others. This has brought about new categories of analysis and analytic frameworks, dataveillance, digital identity, devices, digital borders, to mention only a few, forming what is complementary to those which traditionally are used for understanding the dynamics of Latin American society – such as the theory of dependency, modernization, as well as post-colonial studies. Finally, different disciplines, among them sociology, urbanism, political science, law and history, as well as those esthetic studies, have found in the expansion of surveillance in contemporary societies, an important vein of study.","",""
"2012","The Public Domain: Surveillance in Everyday Life","People create profiles on social network sites and Twitter accounts against the background of an audience. This paper argues that closely examining content created by others and looking at one’s own content through other people’s eyes, a common part of social media use, should be framed as social surveillance. While social surveillance is distinguished from traditional surveillance along three axes (power, hierarchy, and reciprocity), its effects and behavior modification is common to traditional surveillance. Drawing on ethnographic studies of United States populations, I look at social surveillance, how it is practiced, and its impact on people who engage in it. I use Foucault’s concept of capillaries of power to demonstrate that social surveillance assumes the power differentials evident in everyday interactions rather than the hierarchical power relationships assumed in much of the surveillance literature. Social media involves a collapse of social contexts and social roles, complicating boundary work but facilitating social surveillance. Individuals strategically reveal, disclose and conceal personal information to create connections with others and tend social boundaries. These processes are normal parts of day-to-day life in communities that are highly connected through social media.","",""

"2012","Zooveillance: Foucault Goes to the Zoo","The last three decades have witnessed a dramatic shift in the governance of North American zoo animals. During this period, captive animal administration has transformed from a materially, geographically, and technologically limited enterprise – focused on the control of individual zoo animals within specific North American zoo institutions – into an ambitious collective project that encompasses all accredited North American zoos and that governs over a million zoo animals. Tapping into a sophisticated voluntary and collaborative self-monitored administration, zoos have been able to rely upon genetics and demography to achieve the ultimate goal of captive animal conservation. The essay frames this story of animal governance as surveillance. It identifies three layers that work interdependently to produce captive animal surveillance in North American zoos: elementary surveillance, which includes the naming, identifying, and recording of captive animals on the institutional level; dataveillance, or the global computerized management of animal populations; and collective reproductive control. What underlies these three modes of surveillance – referred to here as “zooveillance” – are notions of care, stewardship, and conservation. Based on a series of sixty semi-structured, in-depth interviews conducted with prominent zoo professionals in North America between May 2009 and April 2011, as well as on observations of zoo operations and of professional meetings, the essay explores the relevancy and importance of applying the framework of surveillance in the nonhuman context of zoo animals.","",""

The research was conducted at the Command and Control Center (CCC), where the images from all the cameras in the police battalions are brought together and at the police batallion at Copacabana (19thBPM), the first area at the city where surveillance cameras were installed. This system is treated as a sociotechnical network, formed by the interaction of individuals and technological elements, further increasing the importance of an observation from two different levels of this network. Special attention is drawed on what I called “the paradox of the caught in-the-act surveillance scenes”, dilemma emerged around the conflict between the work of surveillance and the aesthetics of surveillance, and also on a main videosurveillance problem: (human and/or technical) overdetermination.","",""

How citizens experience the use of mobile cameras in public nightscapes","In surveillance studies the terms “sousveillance” and “inverse surveillance” describe forms of surveillance that have a bottom-up and democratic character. However, in this paper this democratic notion is questioned by looking into practices and experiences with both Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) and mobile cameras by Dutch citizens. By intervening in the nightlife district of the Rotterdami city centre, data has been gathered on both mobile- and CCTV camera confrontations. From this, an exploration is made into how mobile cameras are experienced in the Nightlife landscape. Comparing these experiences with CCTV provides insight into new surveillance issues that emerge due to the mobile camera. The perspective of analyzing surveillance technologies as hybrid collectives that may take different shapes in different places, allows for a contribution that attempts to improve our understanding of the current changes in the surveillance technology landscape.i Rotterdam is the second largest city in the Netherlands.","",""
"2012","Municipal Corporate Security and the Intensification of Urban Surveillance","This article explores the surveillance work of municipal corporate security (MCS) units in Canadian cities. Drawing on analysis of freedom of information requests, we document the introduction of new and modified surveillance technologies through MCS. These units engage in surveillance of City employees and citizens on municipal lands and in municipal buildings. Although some technologies deployed by MCS (such as electronic access cards and badges) appear mundane, we demonstrate how MCS units are repurposing, enhancing, and recombining these technologies with existing forms in ways that have been described as the intensification of surveillance. While recent attention in the surveillance studies and urban studies literatures has been rightfully placed on private auspices and provision of externally directed urban surveillance, our analysis of MCS activities suggests that scholars should continue to focus on public auspices and provision of security and internally directed surveillance too. What defines the intensification of urban surveillance therefore may be less a privatized and technologically advanced character and more a resolute comfort with a constantly mutating amalgam of public/private, human/technological, and external/internal forms and foci.","",""

Using qualitative data from the first stage of a wider study, the paper reports on the perceptions and experiences of those marked as ‘hyper-visible’ (Khoury 2009); that is, those of middle Eastern appearance, or of South Asian or Arabic heritage and of the Muslim faith, who are presented as members of a suspect community. The paper considers ‘browning’ (Bhattacharyya 2008; Burman 2010; Semati 2010; Silva 2010) and ‘social sorting’ (Lyon 2003a) in relation to perceptions and experiences of surveillance. The paper argues that ethnic hostility features heavily in surveillance, and the impact has serious negative consequences for its subjects. Anti-terror surveillance therefore needs to be understood within the wider context of a racially defined citizenship agenda. This would allow us to more accurately understand its impact, and to ask questions about its fulfilling of safety. More significantly, it would also allow for the mapping of mobilised resistance to problematic and discriminatory surveillance.","",""

"2012","Eyes of Glass: Watching the Watchers in the Monitoring of Public Places in Curitiba, Brazil","Surveillance cameras have become an integral part of the architecture of public and private spaces in large cities, like the eyes of the augmented city (Firmino and Duarte 2008). From the perspective of public security and with the supposed premise of reducing violence, the implementation of security systems and the installation of these “eyes” in critical places have emerged as options available to town planners. However, there are no reliable data confirming a direct relationship between video surveillance and increased security, only the discussion and debate that has been started in an attempt to justify the use of such surveillance. Furthermore, little is known, particularly in Brazil, about the monitoring strategies and procedures used by the professionals who operate a city’s eyes. As cameras are electronic devices whose purpose is merely to record images, the people who control them play a fundamental role in determining how this recording of images influences the day-to-day existence of those being watched and the very way the public space that is ‘under surveillance’ is perceived. To understand monitoring from the perspective of those who carry it out (Kemple and Huey 2005), we propose to show analytically, based on the study of a unit for monitoring public spaces in the center of Curitiba, what the watcher’s procedures and routines are. It is the analysis of the images and of how best to proceed as a result of these that serves as the basis for all the actions involved in the operation of the system. Our aim was to gain first-hand experience of the monitoring unit with the aid of techniques such as participant observation in order to better understand what happens behind the glass eyes of the contemporary city.","",""

However, despite the role of these authorities as enforcers of privacy and data protection legislation, surveillance studies have so far offered little attention to their role in resistance. From the outset of a critical socio-legal examination of the Norwegian Data Inspectorate, the focus of this paper is on the role of data protection authorities in resisting surveillance. More specifically, the paper asks what possibilities the Norwegian Data Inspectorate has for genuinely resisting surveillance, and how its institutional structure affects these possibilities. Through a two-pronged analysis of the Inspectorate, consisting of an institutional mapping and a typology of resistance strategies, the paper finds that there is a fundamental tension between the Inspectorate’s role as a state administrative body and a privacy-advocating ombudsman, exemplified by its role in resisting the implementation of the EU Data Retention Directive in Norwegian law. ","",""

"2012","‘Control Space?: Cinematic Representations of Surveillance Space between Discipline and Control’","Recent developments in surveillance practices and their related technologies suggest that the heretofore dominant Foucauldian paradigm of discipline, with its sites of confinement in which space is “segmented, immobile [and] frozen”, may no longer be an adequate theoretical framework in which to discuss space within surveillance studies (Foucault, 1995: 195). In his essay Postscript on Control Societies, Gilles Deleuze claims that these sites are in the midst of widespread breakdown, leading to a fundamental shift in the notion of space, characterised by the term ‘modulation’ (Deleuze, 1990: 178-179). In the control model, urban surveillance can be said to be characterised by an emphasis on the use of digital surveillance practices, leading to a view of urban space and the city, as well as its inhabitants, which largely resides within a computer mainframe. This raises the question: if the surveillance carried out within this conception of urban space can be described as concentrated, hidden, passive, functional, mobile, and varied, how can these changes be communicated cinematically since there is an obvious problem of representation; when much of the surveillance technology is computer and digital in form, how does cinema make visible the potentially invisible? In considering the question of how film engages with urban space between the paradigms of discipline and control, two cinematic views of the (informational) city will be discussed by considering three scenes from Erasing David (2009) and Minority Report (2002) in order to identify some of the cinematic strategies used in communicating contemporary surveillance practices increasingly characterised as invisible and immaterial.","",""

This paper documents how one media organisation’s overt and tacit approval of ID scanners helped to normalise this form of surveillance as a precondition of entry into ten licensed venues in the Australian city of Geelong. After outlining how processes of governance “from above” and “from below” interweave to generate distinct political and media reactions to the prevention of localised crime problems, a chronological reconstruction of media reports over a three-and-a half year period demonstrates how ID scanning became the centrepiece of a holistic reform strategy to combat alcohol-related violence in the Geelong nightclub precinct. Several discursive techniques helped to normalise this “technological fix”, while suppressing critical discussion of viable concerns over information privacy, data security and system networking. These included pairing reports of an initial “signal crime” with examples of “virtual victimhood” to depict a crisis of violence to validate a radical surveillance-based response and publishing anecdotal statements from key “primary definers” highlighting the success of this initiative in targeting a wider population of antisocial “others”. The implications of these reporting practices are discussed in light of the media’s central role in reforming the Geelong night-time economy and broader trends associated with using novel surveillance technologies to combat urban crime problems at the expense of alternative measures that protect individual liberty.","",""
"2012","Urban Surveillance and the Struggle between Safe and Exciting Nightlife Districts","Cities attract vast numbers of people at night (Roberts and Eldridge 2009). In recent decades the evening economy has started to play a significant role in city centre regeneration, with alcohol related establishments as the driving force (Hollands and Chatterton 2003). Concerns about personal safety and fear of crime have become central in determining the success of these leisure-based inner-city areas (Judd 2003, Bannister et al. 2006). This attitude is also reflected in academic work, where most studies explore the late night economy in terms of alcohol consumption, disorder and anti-social behaviour (Hobbs et al. 2003, Hadfield 2006, Monaghan 2002, Plant and Plant 2006, Winlow and Hall 2006). Nightlife districts are, however, favoured by visitors for their adventure and excitement (Hubbard 2005). The question raised in this paper is how surveillance measures in different nightlife districts are legitimized, taking into account the fact that these districts need not only to be safe but also stimulating. Based on an analysis of policy documents, nighttime observations and expert interviews with stakeholders in the Safe Nightlife Programmes of Rotterdam and Utrecht, different local safety measures, their legitimizations and their outcomes in different local urban settings will be analysed.","",""

These range from using code words and taking out mobile phone batteries during meetings to the use of privacy enhancing technologies. This article discusses such measures by providing interviews with activists from a variety of countries, as well as by analyzing documents from German law enforcement agencies in a recent case against activists. These documents reveal that the meta-data produced via mobile telephony is at least as important for law enforcement as the content of the calls. Furthermore, if there is not enough meta-data, law enforcement will produce it to get to know the whereabouts of activists. This article thus argues that a mutual relationship between resistance and surveillance unfolds as one side reacts to the practices of the other: as soon as activists advance in the protection of their contents of telecommunication, the surveilling parties concentrate on meta-data to explore the whereabouts of their targets. To counter this threat only the discontinuation of mobile phone use has been articulated.","",""

By Surveillance Aesthetics we understand a compound of artistic practices, which include the appropriation of dispositifs such as closed circuit video, webcams, satellite images, algorithms and computer vision among others, placing them within new visibility, attention and experience regimes. The term referred to in the title of this exhibition is intended more as a vector of research rather than the determination of a field, as pointed by Arlindo Machado under the term “surveillance culture”. (Machado 1991) In this sense, a Latin America Surveillance Aesthetics exhibition is a way to propose, starting from the works presented here, a myriad of questions. How and to what extent do the destinies of surveillance devices reverberate or are subverted by market, security and media logics in our societies? If, in Europe and in the USA, surveillance is a subject related to the war against terror and border control, what can be said about Latin America? What forces and conflicts are involved? How have artistic practices been creating and acting in relation to these forces and conflicts? Successful panoramas of so called Surveillance Art already take place in Europe and North America for at least three decades, the exhibition “Surveillance”, at the Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions being one of the first initiatives in this domain. In Latin America however, art produced in the context of surveillance devices and processes is still seen as an isolated event. Our intention is to assemble a selection of works indicating the existence of a wider base of production, which cannot be considered eventual.The online exhibition can be accessed here.http://www.pec.ufrj.br/surveillanceaestheticslatina/","",""
"2012","Surveillance and Regulating Code: An Analysis of Graduated Response in France","This paper analyzes a recent policy initiative in France to deter copyright infringement. In 2009, France passed two laws aimed at fighting online piracy through graduated response, a warning and sanction system. Graduated response depends on surveillance of internet uses and encourages technological regulation (code), such as internet filtering and blocking. We analyze the rationales advocated for copyright and the internet and the argumentation for surveillance and technical protection measures. In the French debate on graduated response, much attention was given to the policy goal – reducing piracy, while the means of reaching the policy goal – surveillance and code, were rarely discussed. Graduated response deals with much more than copyright. It promotes informational control by copyright holders and contributes to the normalization of surveillance and to an increase of centralized control on the internet.","",""

Despite the big differences between the various governments and regimes of its fifty years of existence, the common objects of surveillance by the police remained remarkably constant: trade unions, political parties, cultural associations, women’s movements, student movements, anarchists, communists and terrorists. Foreigners, including diplomats, whose activities raised suspicion of espionage or subversion were also kept a watchful eye on. The contemporary surveillance camera has its signature in the wide-angle plongée machinic abstract style, but in the files of the political police, the watchers are always finding ways to leave traces of their own performances as spies. Agamben’s ideas help us to create, in this exploratory essay, a dialogic link between the booking photographs taken of the political prisoners and the spy photographs of the usual suspects. In this sense, these images of suspicion testify not only to the “facts” or “feats” of those men and women under observation. In the trail left by these old photographs we can still hear the steps that once choreographed the ballet of surveillance, a strange pas-de-deux that found, in the interstice of the photographic act, a place for authorship.","",""

I explore this issue through the case of the Texas Virtual BorderWatch, a network of governmental web-based surveillance cameras mounted at the U.S.-Mexico Border that can be patrolled by anyone with an internet connection. Programs such as the Texas Virtual BorderWatch have proven to be neither particularly effective nor cost-efficient, yet they continue, leading the question of what other logics must justify the sustained funding of these types of programs? I argue that the crowdsourcing of border security represents a new trajectory in the approach to governance and surveillance under Neoliberalism, able to use the power of participatory platforms developed under Web 2.0 as tools to offload the responsibilities of surveillance and security from the state to the populace at little to no cost. Furthermore, the Texas Virtual BorderWatch creates participatory “citizen-soldiers” in the War on Terror, able to welcome the front lines of surveillance into the household, among the most private of spaces. Yet in each case, these practices serve as but one example of the type of decentralized, interactive experiments of reproducing power dynamics that are representative of the Neoliberal movement’s aim to politicize the cultural practices of everyday life.","",""

Latour’s (2005) ‘oligopticon’ and Deleuze and Guttari’s (2003) ‘rhizomatic’ notion of surveillance networks are adopted to question the relevance and significance of Foucault’s (1979) conceptualisation of surveillance within an elite sports academy setting. A contemporary representation of bio-politics (Rose 1999, 2001) is further utilised to discern the mode of governance and control effective within such institutions. In so doing, this article seeks to understand the evolving methods of surveillance technology and governance and how they are situated within the setting of a contemporary institution. Such considerations aim to provoke a line of questioning surrounding the normalisation of intrusive surveillance practices and their impact upon identity construction and an authentic sense of self.","",""
"2012","The Home Under Surveillance: A Tripartite Assemblage","The home is perceived as an enclave of privacy and retreat from the proliferation of surveillance technologies in the spaces ofpublic and semi-public life. Yet the past years have seen a rapid growth in the development and marketing of smart surveillancesystems for domestic use that promise to protect both family and property. As a result, the understanding of ‘home’ as a place forrespite and as an enclave of autonomy is being challenged as residents find themselves continuously under observation. This studyreads the experience of surveilling and of being surveilled within one’s private domain as different from that of being watchedand monitored on the street, in the mall, or at the office. With the understanding that new assemblages—namely social entitiesconstructed from heterogeneous parts—are formed as humans engage with new technical artefacts, it becomes apparent that aunique tripartite amalgamation of technology, humans and space/place is brought into being by the installation of domesticsurveillance systems by residents in their homes. Moving beyond approaches that examine the social contexts from which thesetechnologies emerge and their cultural consequences, the current study investigates the new ontologies of home, technology, andof surveillance itself rewritten in the automated, smart home. Surveillance is shown as altering the notion of home as place, and of setting the home as the site of action and activity. Moreover, an ontological shift takes place in our understanding of surveillanceas many of its binary paradigms are destabilized.","",""

Internet designers were sophisticated in their pragmatic thinking about privacy when evaluated vis-a-vis theoretical developments since that time, viewing privacy as a contextual matter involving boundary setting, and using information architecture and metadata as tools for privacy protection. Those in the social science and legal communities think about the privacy effects of communication on humans, while those in the technical design community must focus on privacy as a set of logistical problems.

Drawing upon the work of historian Carlo Ginzburg (1990) , I argue that new media produce new evidence and that late nineteenth-century media contributed to an emergent ‘evidential paradigm’. From this perspective, the intensification of contemporary surveillance can be seen as an elaboration of late nineteenth-century new media and the proliferation of evidence-producing communication technologies.

The characteristics of digital communication mean technology developers, policymakers, service providers and individuals are rethinking senses of identity, processes of identification and what privacy means in everyday life. To ensure that identity and privacy are respected in communication raises two issues. One, there is a gap between social context of communication practice and the technological feasibility of privacy tools. Two, the concept of privacy is not fully adapted and refined for use in the digital networked age.

"2013","Smooth Effects: The Erasure of Labour and Production of Police as Experts through Augmented Objects","It’s a cool autumn morning and I am grateful for the sun as it warms the wet concrete. I have been told we will be spending some time outside later, so I am hopeful it will remain sunny. When everyone arrives, we go directly to the principal’s office. Once inside, someone points at the PA system. People pull out their cameras and take a quick photo—we were told the PA system in each school can be different so information about the broadcasting mechanism could be helpful in an emergency. I decide to take a photo as well.      Figure 1: PA system inside the principal's office (Photo by Michelle Stewart)    The principal joins us and we begin the task of moving through the school: a principal, two plain clothes police officers, two uniformed police officers, two police volunteers and an anthropologist researcher. Our goal is to document the entire school for a police program called School Action For Emergencies (SAFE) that seeks to create emergency plans for each school on a national Canadian police database. It is a massive undertaking to collect the data necessary to create the interactive maps of each school. We were told that potential hiding spaces were one focus alongside the general layout of the school; the other focus is thinking about potential response routes and staging for emergency responders. We snap photos based on our morning training. Broom closets and cubbyholes are now potential hiding spots that must be documented with a photo and narrated with a strategy. Misplaced items present their own challenges. A large gym mattress stored under the stairs. The principal comments that the mattress needs to be returned to the gym; a volunteer crouches down and takes a picture in the event that it remains permanently and creates a potential hiding spot.      Figure 2: Documenting gym mat in hallway/potential hiding spot (Photo by Michelle Stewart)     We emerge from the school, take a photo of the door, and enter the schoolyard. We move along the fence line: some individuals take notes about the physical characteristics of the property, others jot down the height of the retaining wall, still others take photos of the neighboring properties. Everyone is taking notes, taking photos, or comparing notes and photos.  Soon we will be back at the police station for the larger project of harmonizing all the data into a massive mapping database. Locating the State in Its Objects    Focusing on a Canadian police program called School Action for Emergency (SAFE), this article discusses the material labour practices required to create a virtual object—an augmented map. This mapping program provides a venue through which to consider the ways augmented objects come into the world. In this article, I discuss the labour practices necessary to create this map and then illustrate how labour practices are erased as part of this production and consumption of an augmented technology meant to facilitate an effective emergency response. In so doing, I will also discuss the production of authority and expertise through deployment of these police aids.     As someone concerned with the ways in which the state instantiates itself into the lives of its subjects, I look at the particular enrollment practices of citizen and state agents as part of statecraft  (Stewart). From Weber we are told about the role of police as they relate to state power, “state is a human community that (successfully) claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory. Note that 'territory' is one of the characteristics of the state. Specifically, at the present time, the right to use physical force is ascribed to other institutions or to individuals only to the extent to which the state permits it” (Weber, 34 my emphasis). I would argue that part of this monopoly involves cultivating citizen consent; that the subordination of citizens is equally important to police power as is the state’s permission to act. One way citizen consent is cultivated is through the performance of expertise such that subjects agree to give police power because police appear to be experts. Seen this way, police aids can be critical in cultivating this type of consent through the appearance of police as experts when they appear all knowing; what is often forgotten are the workers and aids that support that appearance (think here of dispatchers and databases).     Becoming SAFE    The SAFE project is an initiative of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), the national police force in Canada. The goal of the program is to “certify” every school in the country, meaning each school will have documentation of the school that has been uploaded into the SAFE computer program. As illustrated in the introduction, this is a time-consuming process requiring not only photos and other data be collected but also all of this data and material be uploaded into the RCMP’s centralized computer program. The desired effect is that each school will have a SAFE program so police and dispatchers can access this massive collection of the data in the event of an emergency.     During my time conducting research with the RCMP, I attended training sessions with John, a young corporal in the national police force. One of John’s duties was to coordinate the certification of the SAFE program that included training sessions. The program was initiated in 2007, and within one year, the province we were working in began the process of certifying approximately 850 of its 1700 schools; it had completed over 170 schools and identified 180 local SAFE coordinators. In that first year alone over 23,000 photos had been uploaded and 2,800 school layouts were available. In short, SAFE was a data heavy, labour-intensive process and one of John’s jobs was to visit police stations to get them started certifying local schools. Certification requires that at least one police officer be involved in the documentation of the school (photos and notes). After all the data is collected it must be articulated into the computer program through prompts that allow for photos and narratives to be uploaded.    In the session described in the introduction, John worked with a group of local police and police auxiliaries (volunteers). The session started with a short Power Point presentation that included information about recent school tragedies, an audio clip from Columbine that detailed the final moments of a victim as she hid from killers, and then a practical, hands-on engagement with the computer software. Prior to leaving for on-site data collection, John had the trainees open the computer program to become familiar with the screens and prompts. He highlighted the program was user-friendly, and that any mistake made could be corrected. He focused on instilling interest before leaving for the school to collect data.     During this on-site visit, as I trailed behind the participants, I was fascinated by one particularly diligent volunteer. He bent, climbed, and stretched to take photos and then made careful notations. Back at the police station he was just as committed to detail when he was paired up with his partner in front of the computer. They poured over their combined notes and photos; making routes and then correcting them; demanding different types of maps to compare their handwritten notes to the apparent errors in the computer map; demanding a street map for one further clarification of the proposed route. His commitment to the process, I started to think, was quite substantial. Because of his commitment, he had to engage in quite a bit of labour.  But it was in this process of refining his data that I started to see the erasure of labour. I want to take some time now to discuss the process of erasure by turning attention to feminist and labour theory emerging from science and technology studies as means to articulate what was, and was not, taking place during the data entry.      Maria Puig de la Bellacasa highlights the role of care as it relates to labour. In so doing, she joins a literature that draws attention to the ways in which labour is erased through specific social and material practices (see for example works in Gibson-Graham, Resnick and Wolf). More specifically, Puig de la Bellacasa investigates care in labour as it effects what she calls “knowledge politics” (85).  In her work, Puig de la Bellaca discusses Suchman’s research on software design programs that produce virtual “office assistants” to assist the user. Suchman’s work reveals the ways in which this type of “assistant” must be visible enough to assist the user but not visible enough to require recognition. In so doing, Suchman illustrates how these programs replicate the office (and domestic servant) dynamics. Seen this way, labour becomes undervalued (think for example interns, assistants, etc.) and labour that is critical to many offices (and homes). Suchman’s work in this area is helpful when thinking about the role of augmented objects such as the augmented police map because in many ways it is a type of office assistant for police officers, handing over virtual notes and information about a location that police would otherwise not necessarily know thereby replicating the office dynamic of the boss that appears all knowing because, in part, s/he has a team that supports every aspect of their work. This devalued work (the lower paid intern or assistant) facilitates the authority—and ultimately the higher wage of the boss—who appears to earn this status. Let me layer this analysis of the “office assistant” with the similar phenomena in scientific knowledge production.   Steven Shapin, a sociologist of science, discusses Robert Boyle’s 17th century laboratory and the various technicians in the background that assisted in experiments but remained ignored. Shapin argues contemporary scientific practice has changed little in this regard as technicians remain unaccounted for in the scientific record. He points out “science could not be made if this technician’s work were not done, but it is thought that anyone can do it” (Shapin, 557). Without these workers and their labour, scientific knowledge would not be possible, and yet they are ignored and their labour contribution erased (for example not included in formal discussion about the research, or more recently not included as authors in articles). Of course many technicians are/were paid, but nevertheless their role in the experiment erased. One figure emerged as the expert, the scientist, whose work appeared to be solely configured and created.     Programs such as the SAFE project illustrate ways in which the police officer can emerge as an authority figure; but the authority rests on labour practices that move around in the background and go unacknowledged. Much like the lab, there are many ignored figures that produce the necessary objects of police work.  In the case of the SAFE program, the ideal is that a police officer will respond to a call for service and with the click of a computer screen will be immersed in this augmented map. One click reveals data about the PA system, another click offers a full layout of the school, instructions about the design of the exits, notes about potential hiding spots inside, the list goes on. Each click is a product of labourer(s) that compiled the data. But these individuals, much like Boyle’s laboratory technicians, fade into the background and are erased as the police officer emerges as an authority. The map, an augmented object, may be credited with the data it holds, but the data collectors are long forgotten as the police officer stands alone as the subject of authority because of the smooth effects of the augmented map.     Smooth Effects    In an era of big data and data-intensive experiences, augmented objects are increasingly present in our daily lives—with expanded tolerance and appetite. When engaging an augmented object, there is a built-in expectation that the object will """"work;"""" meaning it will run smoothly and effectively. Take Google Maps as an example: one expects the program will run on different scales, offer the capacity to map directions, and perhaps most importantly to be accurate. When these augmented objects run smoothly they appear to be a self-contained and organized object in and of themselves. This paper intervenes on these assumptions to illustrate that this “smooth effect” can serve to erase the labour necessary to produce the effect. Thinking here of the commodity fetish, one can recall Karl Marx’s intervention that illustrated how objects, commodities, permeate our social worlds in such ways that we can see the object—that we only see the object. This concept, commodity fetishism, argues that we erase the labour and social relations involved in the production of the objects, that we forget all that was required to create the object, and we don’t see all that was destroyed in its making.  An example is to think of a cup of coffee. As you sip and consume it, do you think of the commodity chain? Do you think of the worker, the working conditions necessary to plant, harvest, roast and distribute the beans; do you think about the production of the bag the beans were transported in; do you think of the warehouse or coffeehouse from which the bag of beans came from? You more likely think about how it tastes—as an object in and of itself, how it is, rather than how it came into being in the world. Similarly, I want to think about this augmented map and how attention turns to it, not how it came into the world.     Thinking about labour as it relates to computer programs and computer worlds, social scientists have investigated the necessary work of computer programmers and other labourers (see for example Kelty). Tiziana Terranova discusses the immaterial and affective labour that makes online communities thrive as individuals lend their labour (often unpaid) to create an online “world” that appears to organically come together—she argues these online communities are a product of free labour.  Although the police are not working for “free” the volunteers are and the valorization of labour, if erased, still results in the similar outcome.  Terranova is concerned about online communities that don’t simply come into being, but rather are the product of free labour. In the case of the SAFE program, labour practices are rendered invisible when augmented objects appear to be running smoothly —when in fact this appearance of smoothness necessarily requires labour and the commodity being exchanged is the claim to authority.     Figure 3: Cross referencing hardcopy map (Photo by Michelle Stewart)  Figure 4: Using a hand-drawn map to assist data entry (Photo by Michelle Stewart)  Moving in a different direction, but still thinking about labour, I want to turn to the work of Chris Kortright. In his work about agricultural scientists, Kortright carefully details the physical practices associated with growing an experimental crop of sorghum. From the counting and washing of the seeds, to the planting and harvesting of the seeds, he delivers rich ethnographic stories from experimental fields and labs. He closes with the story of one researcher as she enters all the data into the computer to generate one powerpoint. He explains her frustration:   “You can’t see all the time we spent. The nights we slept here. All the seeds and plants. The flooding and time at the greenhouse. All the people and the labour.” I nodded, these things had disappeared. In the table, only numbers existed. (Kortright, 20)    Kortright argues for the need to recognize the social relations carved out in the field that are erased through the process of producing scientific knowledge—the young researcher ultimately knowing her labour did have a place on the slide.In much the same way, the police and volunteers engaged in a practice of removing themselves from the map. There was not enough space for long sentences explaining the debate about the best route to take; longer sentences were replace with short-phrased instructions. Conjuring the image of the police officer looking for fast, quick information, quick data was what they would deliver. The focus of the program was to place emergency icons (police cars, ambulance, fire engines and helicopters) onto the map, outline response routes, and offer photos as the evidence. Their role as individuals and their labour and creativity (itself a form of labour) was erased as the desired outcome was ease and access to data—a smooth effect. I was often told that many of the police cars don’t yet have a computer inside but in an idealized future world, police cars would be equipped with a computer console. In this world, officers could receive the call for service, access the program and start to move through layers of data rapidly while receiving the details of the call. This officer would arrive informed, and prepared to effectively respond to the emergency.    Thinking back to labour required to create the SAFE map for each school (photographing, mapping, writing instructions, comparing details, etc.) and then the processes of hiding that labour (limited photos and short instructions) so that the program would appear to run smoothly and be user-friendly, the SAFE program, as an object, serves to abstract and erase labour.  Indeed, the desired result was a smooth running program that operated much like Suchman’s office assistant who should be just visible enough to provide the needed help but otherwise remain invisible; similar in many ways to Shapin/Boyle’s scientific technician who is critical to knowledge production and yet remains formally unrecognized.   Conclusion    This article investigated a map as an entry point to understand the ways in which labour can be erased in augmented objects and, concurrently, how authority figures or experts instead emerge. My goal was to discuss the labour necessary to make one augmented map while also describing the process by which the labour necessary for the map was concurrently erased. Central to this article are the ways in which labour is erased as one clicks between these layers of data and, in the process, thinks the smoothly operating computer program is a measure of the strength of program itself, and not the labour required therein. By focusing on this augmented object, I am pointing out the collective labour needed to co-produce the map but how that map then helps to produce the police officer as authority figure. My intention is to look at the map as an unexpected entry point through which to understand how consent and authority is cultivated.   Accordingly, I am concerned with the labour that is erased as this police figure emerges and authority is cultivated on the ground. I focus on the labour that necessarily to produce the police officer as expert because when that labour is erased we are left only with the authority figure that appears to be self-evident—not co-constructed. To understand state practices, as practices and not magical phenomena, we must look for the ways in which the state comes into being through particular practices, such as policing and to identify the necessary labour involvedReferencesGibson-Graham, J.K., Stephen Resnick, and Richard Wolff, eds.

"2013","Shoshana Amielle Magnet, When Biometrics Fail: Gender, Race, and the Technology of Identity","When the twin towers fell in 2001, the American government began a “war on terror” on a number of fronts. Some we could see, and others we could not. The Bush administration focused its primary military efforts in various parts of the world to combat and disrupt groups identified as “terrorists.” A second front focused on protecting the home soil by identifying and investigating potential threats. The American government deployed probably the most visible part of this strategy in airports where the practice of taking a domestic flight changed almost overnight. Prior to 9/11, one could walk their family member right up to the departure gate to say good-bye. That practiced completely changed and the state set up security screening in every airport to check people and their carry-on items, just like in international departures. Many everyday items could be potential threats and the TSA agents screened everything with scrutiny, even our shoes. The Bush government also implemented another front in the war on terror in digital space that is much more difficult to see. Aided by the Patriot Act, the intelligence agencies developed and deployed many new information technologies for identifying risks and individuals and monitoring groups. These surveillance technologies included linking criminal databases at every level (local, state, national, international), monitoring cell phone and e-mail traffic, checking individual’s library records, full pipe Internet surveillance, digital fingerprinting, retina recognition, and other biometric technologies for capturing human bodies and turning them into digital data.","",""

"2013","Necessary and inherent limits to internet surveillance","Information technologies now play a huge role in both personal and institutional life, playing the role of a global communications medium. As our means of interaction increasingly centre on the internet, there is a desire from nation states to exercise control and obtain access to the communications of citizens. The stated reasons for this access and control are to prevent or investigate crimes, and to protect national security. This article argues that mass untargeted surveillance of internet-based communications is an excessive tool with respect to its potential for abuse against both society and individuals, and that its ability to prevent crime or terrorism are limited. By looking at existing technologies and example cases where surveillance has been applied, this article demonstrates that there are both inherent mathematical and technical limits to the potential for surveillance to achieve broad-scale prevention of crime and terrorism. In addition, the potential of surveillance to result in real harm to society necessarily places severe limits on how this technique should be applied in a free and democratic society.","",""
"2013","To have or not to have: the true privacy question","In light of the recent US National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance scandals, the article reflects on the continued importance of privacy in the information age. Based on a taxonomy of privacy violations provided by Daniel Solove, it takes the reader on an imaginary journey to a world in which privacy has ceased to exist. What does it mean “to have or not to have privacy” in the information age? This essay, part academic, part call for action, explores this question by means of an analogy, focusing on the relationship between citizens and the state. It demonstrates that the invisible presence of the NSA should be a matter of great concern to us. There is no justification for blanket surveillance. The right to security is an illusion. Instead of fighting windmills, we should fight for our right to privacy instead. We need to have privacy; we need it to live and love, to make mistakes, and to grow. We need it as individuals and as a society. And we can have it if we press our legislators to return it to us. It is time to start fighting back.","",""

It raises privacy and ethical issues: there is no universal way to see the faces. The risk is to create disembodied identites. Today people are ever more known through electronic information. The social representation of human beings comes about within a system based for the most part on electronics. These transformations end up involving the anthropology of people as well, through modification of their bodies, creating people who are ‘configured’ with their electronic data. In this way the individuality instead risks being translated into a simple binary code. This is an intelligent and invisible surveillance not so much and not only because it is carried out with detection systems that are, by now, in place everywhere or with hidden video cameras, but principally because of the invisible nature of the processes of categorization, social selection and classification that are undertaken technologically.

"2013","Our Biometric Future: Facial Recognition Technology and the Culture of Surveillance","The need for security, emerged after 9/11, increased the request for a more intrusive government even at the cost of sacrificing civil liberties. The Kelly A. Gates’s book focuses on the visual technologies, specifically on the automated facial recognition technologies on which the research is investing a lot. Through a presentation of the framework for the development of these technologies – which is fruitful since the 1960s – the author carefully examines the constellation of social forces that are shaping technologies for the identification of human faces and facial expressions. The need for security has unified public and private interests earning a place of high priority in the political agenda and the augmenting of the technological research and development in this sector. In the name of the need for greater national security has been given the go ahead for an indiscriminate control of individuals and an accumulation of personal data, as if the acquisition of greater quantities of information could provide higher levels of security. The freedom of citizens is bartered, in this manner, for the (uncritical) acceptance of control and pervasive tracking measures to identify the enemy. The face, with its expressions collected in the database, is considered an index of identity. As these technologies measure the intensity of expression, determining what people are thinking or feeling, human behaviour may be calculated. But the faces are difficult to stabilize, the faces and their representation are not standard objects, they are a set of identities and meanings that can not be classified in a strict manner. Careful to consider the pros and cons of this type of instrument, the author also addresses the philosophical issues that differentiate the ‘see’ from the ‘look’, understood as social and psychological process. The computers only see in a metaphorical sense, and only thanks to a significant human investment. They do not really look at the people. However if we, humans, with our experience go wrong in assessing a person, why a technology could not be wrong? So why do we expect such a perfection from a technology on an issue that is not mechanical?","",""
"2013","PRIVACY PROTECTION STRATEGIES ON FACEBOOK","The privacy paradox describes people's willingness to disclose personal information on social network sites despite expressing high levels of concern. In this study, we employ the distinction between institutional and social privacy to examine this phenomenon. We investigate what strategies undergraduate students have developed, and their motivations for using specific strategies. We employed a mixed-methods approach that included 77 surveys and 21 in-depth interviews. The results suggest that, in addition to using the default privacy settings, students have developed a number of strategies to address their privacy needs. These strategies are used primarily to guard against social privacy threats and consist of excluding contact information, using the limited profile option, untagging and removing photographs, and limiting Friendship requests from strangers. Privacy strategies are geared toward managing the Facebook profile, which we argue functions as a front stage. This active profile management allows users to negotiate the need for connecting on Facebook with the desire for increased privacy. Thus, users disclose information, because they have made a conscious effort to protect themselves against potential violations. We conclude that there is a tilt toward social privacy concerns. Little concern was raised about institutional privacy and no strategies were in place to protect against threats from the use of personal data by institutions. This is relevant for policy discussions, because it suggests that the collection, aggregation, and utilization of personal data for targeted advertisement have become an accepted social norm.","",""

Using post-panoptic theories about the use of information and communication technologies in daily life, it questions how such sites, and the knowledge they generate, relate to existing surveillance structures. It begins with a review of current surveillance literature before turning to the empirical case of the Dutch website Zoekdokter. It situates the site in its specific national health and policy context, which enables not only an analysis of the site, but also the existing rules, norms and structures for monitoring performance and the dynamic between multiple types of surveillance that occur simultaneously in practice. Zoekdokter.nl is one of six cases in this research project and is the only case where patients are encouraged to evaluate individual professionals identified by name and location. I analyze website texts and 15 stakeholder interviews using the post-panoptic concepts of sousveillance, coveillance and infoveillance.

We define captive audiences as audiences without functional opt-out mechanisms to avoid situations of coercive communication. By analyzing the current mobile marketing ecosystem, we show that the Federal Trade Commission's privacy guidelines inspired by the Canadian “privacy by design” paradigm fall short of protecting consumers against invasive mobile marketing in at least three respects: (a) The guidelines overlook how, in the context of data monopolies, the combination of location and personal history data threatens autonomy of choice; (b) the guidelines focus exclusively on user control over data sharing, while ignoring control over communicative interaction; and (c) the reliance on market mechanisms to produce improved privacy policies may actually increase opt-out costs for consumers. We conclude by discussing two concrete proposals for improvement: a “home mode” for mobile privacy and target-specific privacy contract negotiation.","",""

Nashville, TN: Vanderbilt University Press, 2009. 298 pp. $27.95. ISBN 9780826516725 (paper).","When we talk about surveillance, we usually mean something that the government does, most likely to criminals. As David Lyon (2003) writes, once the word surveillance was reserved for highly specific scrutiny of suspects, for police wiretapping or for foreign intelligence. That is no longer the case, as surveillance—the garnering of personal data for detailed analysis “now occurs routinely, locally and globally, as an unavoidable feature in everyday life” (Lyon 2003, 1). For instance, family members are using surveillance techniques to promote the peace of mind for older extended family members (Mynatt, Rowan, Craighill, and Jacobs 2001) and also to manage young children’s health (Jeong, Park, and Zimmerman 2008). The new book Who’s Watching? Daily Practices of Surveillance Among Contemporary Families edited by Nelson and Garey explores the ways in which family members monitor themselves, other families, and their own border” (p. 1). Situated at the intersection of scholarship on family sociology and surveillance studies, the collection of essays in this book demonstrates that constant monitoring has a deep impact on how individuals do and do not conduct themselves. The editors suggest that “examining family practices through the lens of surveillance complicates and informs our understanding of family life. Similarly, expanding surveillance studies to include the realm of the family complicates and informs our understanding of surveillance” (p. 2). The book is comprised of 15 chapters, including an introductory essay. Very broadly, the authors present four major themes that emerge from the analysis of the family as an arena of surveillance and of surveillance as it practiced in families: (1) the dynamic interplay between care and control; (2) the relevance of technology; (3) the nature of resistance; and (4) the abiding significance of social location. The contributing authors present two compelling motivations that drive practices of monitoring: a desire to care for and protect those who are the subjected to surveillance, and a desire to control and impose social order. One of these considerations—“care”—is usually viewed in a positive light (e.g., parents care for their children). The other—“control”—is often seen in a negative light (e.g., how the state is too intrusive into our private lives). Nevertheless, the supposed dichotomy between care and control overlooks the way in which care itself can operate through the mechanism of control, including practices of inclusion and exclusion. Parents monitor the behavior of other persons, such as of nannies and ex-spouses, in order to protect their children. Similarly, decisions that exclude individuals from a family entail an element of control even when they are motivated by a desire to protect its members. For example, performing an amniocentesis on the fetus or selecting artificial insemination from an unknown donor to minimize legal entanglements with parental kin are both forms of care that operate through mechanisms of control. A second theoretical contribution of this book is the sociotechnical approach adopted by the contributing authors. The authors present the two positions in regard to the role of technology; the technological determinist position that views the technology as having an autonomous role in the production and creation of new types of social relations, and a social determinist position that essentially reduces technological developments to preexisting","",""

And yet, I argue through a case study of one genetic disease in particular, Pompe Disease, that DNA screening technology has unprecedented implications for the lives of babies born in the United States in ways that do not simply keep them safer. As noted in van Zoonen’s introduction to this section, we continually hear that, in our postmodern world, identities are multiple and fragmented. Yet, as she argues, new identification technologies – from radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags to biometric technologies to ICTs – ‘actively work against multiplicity and towards the fixation of singular identities’, as corporations and government institutions are invested in producing stable identities that can be reliably read off the body, thus generating new forms of corporate profit as well as new constructions of citizenship. I therefore ask how newborn screening might function as a set of knowledges about identity that we purchase in order to make us feel safer, whether or not this is the actual outcome.

Biometrics and the tensions of material                     practices","Contemporary surveillance practices by both corporate and state actors increasingly rely on information and communication technologies to be able to categorize, process and analyse vast amounts of data. This is especially true of complex government projects created to manage entire populations. One set of technologies, generically referred to as ‘biometrics’, is being developed and implemented in different contexts in order to read characteristics of people’s bodies and physical behaviours with the aim of fixing identities, or authenticating or sorting them, based on pre-determined categories and logics. Some of the more recognizable examples of biometric technologies include digital fingerprinting, facial recognition, iris scanning and DNA profiling, but the list of technologies is long and constantly growing. Part of the allure of using biometrics to organize and segregate people is that our bodies are thought to provide an objective and verifiable source of truth about our identities, motivations and intentions and these technologies give access to these ‘truths’. Biometrics are also believed to be capable of ‘securing’ or ‘fixing’ identity in a way that makes fraudulent or multiple identities much more difficult, if not impossible, to maintain. Through the use of biometrics, organizations aim to individuate entire populations and then fix identities to administrative markers such as unique identification numbers.","",""
"2013","Resisting Public Health Surveillance: Anonymous HIV Testing and the Imperative of Health","To  date, there has been little research published about public health  surveillance and HIV testing/prevention. Accordingly, an exploratory  project was undertaken, involving a detailed review of local public  health law, and the distribution of surveys about self-reported STI  testing/diagnosis, HIV testing practices, and sexual behaviours among  gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men. A review of the  public health law indicated that, in the local context, there is a  pervasive public health surveillance apparatus that requires mandatory  reporting of identified communicable diseases, including HIV. Results of  the survey indicated that individuals who reported a preference for, or  use of, anonymous HIV testing were more likely to have reported having  (a) been tested for, and diagnosed with, STIs, (b) a self-reported  history of anal sex, (c) more sexual partners, and (d) been aware of  criminal prosecutions against people living with HIV for not disclosing  their HIV status. At first glance, it appeared as though anonymous HIV  testing represented a form of resistance to public health surveillance; a  strategy by which individuals who are likely to test positive for HIV  circumvent surveillance. However, when these results were examined using  Lupton’s “Imperative of Health” framework, it became clear that one  must appreciate the two-pronged nature of anonymous HIV testing. On the  one hand, knowing one’s HIV status can be beneficial; for example, it  corresponds with decreased HIV transmission and improved quantity /  quality of life for people living with HIV. On the other hand, anonymous  testing represents a complicit acceptance of the imperative of health,  and an internalization of public health surveillance. From this  perspective, true resistance to public health surveillance would  manifest as an absolute rejection of HIV testing.","",""

Social acceptance is thus a heterogeneous phenomenon, not only because it depends on the situational features of dealing with the technology, but also, notably, because facts and fiction intermingle, sometimes indistinctly, within the discourses on surveillance and security. Mistrust in the technology tends to feed on fictive imageries, while at the same time resting on an unwavering belief in the objectivity of fingerprint data, presumably a clearly decipherable and reliable form of forensic proof. Against this backdrop, the article seeks to investigate the fictive’s critical role in countering security technologies. ","",""

The vision in MR of an effective, pre-emptive and preventive techno-politics reflects important areas of event detection research, but it is also a vision for which the movie has become a common cultural reference. While they express similar conceptions of surveillance and technological potentials, MR also becomes a resource for discussing the broader ‘techno’-culture of event detection, showing how surveillance systems are imbued with cultural assumptions and preferences, most notably that technology has strong enabling capacities. By juxtaposing MR and event detection research, we thus demonstrate that it is an important analytical task to understand the assumptions on which such systems are constructed, as well as their social and political implications.","",""
"2013","Image and exposure: Envisioning genetics as a forensic-surveillance matrix","This paper takes the ‘visual’ as the primary subject to engage in a dialogue about surveillance by drawing upon the specific case of the genetic image. Specifically, the genetic image has shifted from the ‘one gene for one identification’ model used in the criminal law to, what are now, categorical, contextual and pattern-based configurations of DNA profiling that are able to compare multiple genetic samples in a singular image. The ability to profile genetics for law and security purposes is, thus, protracting well beyond the confines of the criminal legal domain (i.e. the crime scene, forensic laboratory, courtroom) and into the realm of surveillance: national security, defense, immigration, military and even humanitarian domains. Such a notable transition in visual profiling has also been met with a synonymous reformation in the status of genetic data as it converts from evidence in the realm of criminal law to, now, intelligence in the surveillance-based contexts noted above. This visual reclassification of genetic data reorients DNA to an informing, as opposed to an identifying role. Finally, how experts, scientists, legalists and other relevant practitioners conceive and represent ‘truth’ and ‘trust’ in light of an increasingly diverse range of genetic imagery is subject for discussion.","",""

Through an appropriation of the Ban-opticon dispositif (Bigo 2006, 2011), this article analyses the changing urban transformations of civic space and mediated messages perpetuated within, and through, the London 2012 Olympic Games. In so doing, we deconstruct London 2012 through a post-panoptic lens, identifying how processes of social control are reiterated and (re)configured through the establishment of a clearly delineated “other”, that which is deemed ‘unwelcome’ and situated as posing a threat to the safety of the normalised, and accepted, majority. Thus, through a reading of the cultural politics of class, race and gender that are embedded within sporting spectacle, we argue that London 2012 capitalised on the institutionalised culture of fear to convey, and thus contain, an accepted vision of multiculturalism, legitimising surveillance practices and security measures that became ingrained within the urban landscape and social fabric of the nation’s capital. In so doing, we point towards a troubling yet all too tangible true London Olympic legacy, one that identifies and subjects specific yet significant ‘others’ to forms of social control and corporeal governance.

"2013","Bargaining with the Machine: A Framework for Describing Encounters with Surveillance Technologies","Relationships between surveillance and inequality (e.g., as surveillance is used for domination, as surveillance affects subjects’ life-chances) have been a central concern of surveillance studies scholars. This concern with inequalities that are produced and sustained by surveillance runs parallel to the longstanding interest of many social theorists more generally with the unequal workings of power in nominally free societies. How is inequality sustained without resort to force? Why do people consent to subjugation? Some form of ideology critique is often employed to answer such questions. However, the work of Rosen (1996) and others has cast serious doubt on the ability of ideology critique to make good on its explanatory claims. Thus, it is necessary to explore other theoretical constructs that carry greater explanatory force as theorists investigate the disadvantageous effects of surveillance on its targets. In this essay, I argue for the use of an alternative framework – a bargaining paradigm – to articulate what happens in individual subjects’ encounters with surveillance technologies. “Bargaining” shifts the focus from systematic domination of social groups to individually situated subjects while also ascribing agency to individuals rather than depicting them as merely helpless victims of larger forces.","",""

This relates specifically to the scholarly conceptualisation of ‘different’ fan types as researchers have attempted to explain the evolving nature of fandom practice in light of late-modern consumer culture and perceived authenticity claims. Such conceptual approaches to football fandom are useful enough to describe alternative modes of practice and yet they do not indicate how fans interpret and monitor authenticity at a cultural level. This paper aims to address this issue by drawing on the lived experiences of football fans to uncover the importance of cultural surveillance towards perceptions of authenticity. Findings indicate that authenticity is a site of internal contestation driven by codes of expected conduct and modes of surveillance.","",""

They provide a virtualised surface for etching personal narrations and bodily actions, whether volitionally (informally/aesthetically) or mandatorily (formally/procedurally), and for contrasting these against predefined taxonomies of normality for indicators of risk, deviance, exceptionalism, grandeur or profitability. That is to say, surveillance systems are text-making assembly lines, reproducing selected details procured from social intra-relationalities, encoding them for circulation before mediating them as compressed signals to a remote audience for diagnosis, calibration and calculation. And they do this principally via iterative processes of extraction, propagation and screening. They are contrivances in the (immensely profitable) business of fabricating and conveying decontextualised biographies and life stories. They create duplicate textual versions or referential copies of an exposed protagonist’s thoughts, motions, actions and biometrics. Such visualised simulacra can then be systematically exploited and put to work for divergent purposes.","",""

Surveillance of unwanted humanity across the EU","Abstract Routinised surveillance systems are generally regarded as public (and corporate) interference in the privacy of citizens.  Yet such comprehensive forms of surveillance intervention can be a counterpart of citizenship rights, and even of the ‘right to have rights’ within EU cities today. This paper is about selective surveillance, here termed screening out, of undocumented people and how it operates inside EU cities today.  A 2002 EU Directive on “Strengthening the Penal Framework to Prevent the Facilitation of Unauthorised Entry, Transit and Residence” underpins coercive policies designed to exclude ‘unwanted humanity’ from the realm of rights-bearing residents within EU urban spaces. Through individual narrative and a range of evidence, the article shows how selective surveillance screens out unwanted humanity from exercising their rights within EU urban spaces.  The key aim is to expose the deliberate governmental use of selective surveillance – to disable and prohibit the access of some people to local resources and urban services vital for a basic decent minimum level of life.  The logic of deterrence strategies underpin screening out and create non-persons, including failed asylum seekers who are the main focus of this article.  Without comprehensive data collection, there is little oversight possible and intervention is lacking which might improve the life chances of undocumented people who live in cities of the EU. Destitution, detention and deportation are the 3-Ds that mean the most basic social and civil rights of undocumented people are routinely neglected. Public institutions, including medical authorities, local authorities and even charities, have become points of exclusion for the unwanted.  Little is known about their health conditions or needs, with the exception of some NGO and academic studies on small samples.  Redefined across most EU cities as ‘unwanted humanity’, undocumented people and those campaigning on their behalf are increasingly a legitimate ‘target group’ for violent forms of privatised security.  Selective surveillance – or screening out - is thus a strong indicator of unwantedness, as shown with some examples from UK, Dutch and French cities.  Comprehensive surveillance could be viewed as a public good, so long as it is applied in a non-selective manner.   ","",""

This focus stems from the realisation that commercially designated event spaces are very important environments for the interests of FWC sponsors, and that the media has a pivotal role in conveying messages about desirable conduct in such environments. In these respects, stakeholder organisations are concerned about safeguarding core event spaces, and with promoting positive messages about the FWC via the media. The paper therefore investigates the interests of key stakeholders at the 2010 FWC: the event owner Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the FWC sponsors and the host city (Cape Town). It is concerned with identifying various surveillance strategies to manage public spaces at the FWC, albeit with a particular emphasis on protecting the interests of sponsors and their brand integrity. It is also concerned with strategies to manage the media at the FWC, with a particular emphasis on how FIFA stymies dissent and forces compliance among reporters and news outlets that undermine critical surveillance into these practices of spatial management. Taken together, these hyper-protectionist approaches demonstrate what we have described as the FIFA-isation of the FWC, where commercial risk is outsourced to the event host, while the commercial benefits flow back to the event owner. Concomitantly, FIFA makes enormous surveillance demands on the event hosts and those residing in the country and city where it is to be held, and upon the media that broadcast and report on the world’s biggest sport mega events.","",""

With the fall of the regime, in fact, the overall surveillance apparatus did not fade away. Former fascists were not purged from political and cultural life and very few were found guilty. The transition to democracy was thus marked by a substantial continuity of men and institutions (Della Porta and Reiter 2004) due to the active involvement of ex-OVRA (Organization of Vigilance and Repression of Anti-Fascism) officers in public institutions (Author 2011). It comes as no surprise that forms of pervasive non-technological social control continued for more than twenty years after the fall of the duce.   Moreover, police state surveillance was combined with a meaningful continuity in other areas. For instance, the welfare state immediately after World War II was actually based upon the model built during Fascism. The “Fascist Social State” (Silei, 2000) had a corporative and authoritarian inspiration and was a strategy of social control and a tool to create consensus. In the 1950s and 1960s the institutional features of the Italian social security system remained fundamentally unchanged (Giorgi, 2009; Silei, 2000): an excess of bureaucracy and discretionary power; a system based on specific categories of people needing assistance and not on a more universal approach. The Italian post-fascist experience is a paradigmatic case-study that allows us to deal with ambiguities of the welfare state experience, described either as a tool of social control or as a vector of social justice.   This paper is an attempt to analyze “social control strategies” in post-Fascist Italy with a focus both on aspects of continuity and on crucial socio-political discontinuities that are often overlooked in the literature.  ","",""

This article seeks to  add to that complexity and prdocutively investigate the ambiguity by putting forward the concept of the 'unvisible' represented in China Mieviile's recent dystopian novel, The City &amp; The City. Mieville's fiction depicts a world in which characters live in two cities that occupy the same space--are, in the novel's terms, 'topolgangers'. In order to maintain this curious situation, people from one city are required to unsee those from the other, to make them unvisible.  Failure to do so incures punishment from a surveillance force. These and other inventive notions challenge what constitutes visibility.  Briefly addressing ideas on visibility by surveillance theorists, the article argues that The City &amp; The City usefully tests out those ideas. Gary T. Marx has written about the potential 'gradations' between the visible and the invisible. Through a detalied reading of the novel, the article argues for the potential value of the 'unvisible' in those gradations.","",""
"2013","'Caught on Camera': The media representation of video surveillance in relation to the 2005 London Underground bombings","This paper explores the representation of video surveillance by the print media in the immediate aftermath of the London Underground bombings in 2005. It presents the findings of a mixed methods analysis, drawing on content and discourse analysis to present the main themes that arise in the print media at the time. The paper shows that there is a recurrent theme of ‘them’ and ‘us’ during this time; a broader theme also found in the traditional sociological literature and other analyses of surveillance. Coverage of the use of video surveillance during this time is resoundingly positive, with only a few dissenting voices drawing out the ethical and social implications of the strong calls for increased surveillance in the immediate aftermath of the bombings (both in the UK and worldwide). Finally, the paper focuses on the dichotomy that exists in the print media at the time; a juxtaposition of visibility and invisibility of the bombers. Alongside this dichotomy there is also a contradiction. There are repeated calls for increased surveillance despite recurrent statements that however much surveillance there had been on the Underground, the bombings would not have been preventable.","",""
"2013","Justicia’s Gaze: Surveillance, Evidence and the Criminal Trial","This paper considers the use of the products of surveillance, primarily images, as evidence within the criminal trial. These products, whether static images, video or voice recordings, are increasingly being mediated for the fact-finder via ‘experts’, proffering an opinion about the meaning of some surveillance image, artefact or trace. Common law courts, including those in Australia, the UK, Canada, and the US, have been surprisingly accommodating towards such evidence—allowing incriminating opinions to be presented by witnesses with questionable or unsubstantiated, ‘expertise’. Institutional and judicial responses tend to be inattentive to the reliability of such evidence, and display a misplaced faith in the capacity of traditional trial safeguards to expose and manage the weaknesses inherent in this type of evidence. In looking at the ways in which courts use CCTV images, voice recordings and other traces generated by surveillant assemblages, this paper offers a legal site for consideration that has not featured as prominently in recent surveillance literature. It suggests that the preoccupations generated by the ubiquitous nature of everyday surveillance do not always map cleanly onto the use of surveillance artefacts (e.g. images and other traces) in the criminal justice system. At the same time this paper explores how ideas and concepts familiar to the analysis of surveillance techniques, cultures, imaginaries and practices might inform our understanding of the criminal trial and its related processes. Fundamentally concerned with the value of such evidence, this paper argues that, given the premium placed upon accuracy and fairness within the criminal trial, the state should be able to guarantee the basic trustworthiness of the opinions before interpretations derived from surveillance assemblages are admitted to assist with proof of identity and guilt.","",""
"2013","‘Abnormal’ Bodies on the Borders of Inclusion: Biopolitics and the Paradox of Disability Surveillance"," When conducted according to the biomedical definition of disability, ‘disability surveillance’ involves monitoring bodies against normative ontological standards, classifying ‘abnormality’ and problematizing ‘abnormal bodies’ as risky. While disability surveillance that operates within a biomedical perspective contributes to the exclusion of disabled people, the counting and classifying of disabled people is necessary to achieve the aims and objectives of the disability rights movement. In examining this paradox, this paper looks at the ways in which the Canadian government defines and measures disability and the implication of discriminatory immigration policies and ableist biometric technologies. A theoretical framework with which to situate and examine disability surveillance is proposed. Drawing from the work of Foucault on normality/abnormality and subsequent literature on biopolitics, this paper contextualizes the paradoxical implications of surveillance practices that target disabled people.

"2013","The Surveillance of Racing Cyclists in Training: A Bourdieusian Perspective","Research into the complexities of social identity construction and maintenance within racing cycling cultures has been neglected in sport sociology and studies of cycling group interactions are lacking. In this paper, preliminary findings from an on-going ethnographic research study on understanding the social world of a group (n= 73) of male racing cyclists aged between 17 and 56 years in the north east of England are discussed primarily through the application of theoretical concepts from the twentieth century sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, including: habitus, field, capital, and symbolic violence. Extracts from field notes and photographs from group training rides are used to reveal how social order is governed via various forms of lateral social surveillance. Social order occurs through a commitment to the shared values of the training group under study, and through acceptance of initiatory rituals where newcomers are tested through acts of what Bourdieu terms symbolic violence. These preliminary findings suggest that whilst the exclusiveness of this sub-cultural field provides much of the attraction to established group members, it may also represent a barrier to participation for newcomers and a better understanding may inform debates related to building broader, more inclusive cycling cultures.","",""
"2013","Failure to collectively assess security surveillance technologies will inevitably lead to an absolute surveillance society.","When assessing any security technology which impacts upon privacy, whether this constitutes a new technology or the novel application of existing technologies, we should do so by examining the combined effect of all security interventions currently employed within a society. This contrasts with the prevailing system whereby the impact of a new security technology is predominantly assessed on an individual basis by a subjective balancing of the security benefits of that technology against any reductions in concomitant rights, such as privacy and liberty. I contend that by continuing to focus on the individual effect, as opposed to the combined effects, of security technologies within a society the likelihood of sleep-walking into (or indeed waking-up in) an absolute surveillance society moves from a possible future to the logically inevitable future. This conclusion is based on two underlying assertions. Firstly that assessing a technology often entails a judgement of whether any loss in privacy is legitimised by a justifiable increase in security; however one fundamental difference between these two rights is that privacy is a finite resource with identifiable end-states (i.e. absolute privacy through to the absolute absence of privacy) whereas security does not have two finite end-states (while there exists the absolute absence of security, absolute security is an unobtainable yet desired goal). The second assertion, which relies upon the validity of the first, holds that one consequence of absolute security being unobtainable yet desirable is that new security interventions will continuously be developed, each potentially trading a small measure of privacy for a small rise in security. Examined individually each intervention may constitute a justifiable trade-off. However this approach of combining interventions in the search for ever greater security will ultimately reduce privacy to zero.","",""

"2013","Sustainability through surveillance: ICT discourses in design documents","In this paper, I examine design documents from three different ICT design and development projects. I argue that they present intersecting visions of sustainability entailing the wide-spread use of ICT, describe the properties of users compatible with such ICT, and provide ways of judging the users. In the design documents, the inhabitants are made individually responsible for living sustainably, and surveillance is positioned as integral to this future with the help of ICT. Underlying the visions, I identify a translation process that captures the traces of the inhabitants' lives, classifies them according to different criteria of sustainable living, and returns them to the tapestry of everyday life to convince the users to behave differently. In the discourses of these documents, surveillance translates the traces, and the translations exert new pressures on existing power relations.","",""

Sporting mega-events such as the Olympic Games and World Cup Football Finals have become occasions of almost unparalleled economic, political and social significance. In the lead up to the London 2012 Olympic Games, scholars have examined issues such as the ‘security legacies’ left by sporting mega-events, the infrastructures and technologies used in an attempt to secure these events, and the planning mentalities underpinning the staggering ‘security spectacle’ of sporting mega-events. This article deals with the subject of how surveillance and security practices at sporting mega-events are organised. It uses an emerging paradigm of ‘security networks’ to call attention to some of the important issues involving the entire ‘security assemblage’ that accompanies sporting mega-events. The article presents five levels of analysis – structural, cultural, policy, technological and relational – to examine these practices and present key areas for further research on sporting mega-events.","",""
"2013","New Media and the power politics of sousveillance in a surveillance-dominated world.","In this paper we address the increasingly complex constructs between power, and the practices of looking, in a mediated, mobile and networked culture.  We develop and explore a nuanced understanding and ontology that examines veillance in both directions:  surveillance and oversight, as well as sousveillance and “undersight”.  In particular, we unpack the new relationships of power and democracy facilitated by mobile and pervasive computing.  We differentiate between the power relationships in the generalized practices of looking or gazing, which we place under the broad term “veillance”.  Then we address the more subtle distinctions between different forms of veillance that we classify as surveillance and sousveillance, as well as McVeillance (the ratio of surveillance to sousveillance).  We start by unpacking this understanding to develop a more specialized vocabulary to talk not just about oversight but also to talk about the implications of mobile technologies on “who watches the watchers”.   We argue that the time for sousveillance, as a social tool for political action, is reaching a critical mass facilitated by a convergence of transmission, mobility and media channels for content distribution and engagement. Mobile ubiquitous computing, image capture and processing, and seamless connectivity of every iPad, iPhone,  Android Device, wearable computer, etc., allows for unprecedented ‘on the ground’ watching of everyday life.  The critical mass of ‘sousveillant’ capable devices in everyday life may make the practice of sousveillance a potentially effective political force that.  Sousveillance can now challenge and balances the possibility for corruption that is inherent in a surveillance-only society (i.e. one that has only oversight without undersight).","",""
"2013","Comparison of Survey Findings from Canada and the USA on Surveillance and Privacy from 2006 and 2012","This research note highlights the comparative findings of a recent repeat survey of surveillance and privacy. It also draws attention to the usefulness of public opinion surveys for scanning popular responses to surveillance in different contexts and between different countries. The findings from a survey administered in Canada and the USA in 2006, then repeated in a 2012 poll, indicate some continuities and some relevant changes in mood over time. Knowledge of the internet and of softwares such as GPS is relatively high in both countries and this is accented among younger groups, especially males. Similarly, while a higher proportion than previously think they have a say over what happens to their personal data, the younger, the more so. In both countries, more people than before believe that camera surveillance is effective. Curiously, knowledge of laws regulating personal data flows has declined while a greater proportion now consider security-surveillance intrusive. And although responses to workplace surveillance are basically similar, the idea that employers may share data with others is censured. At national borders there is less support for giving extra security checks to visible minorities. People take more steps to protect their personal data in each country, although they worry much more about what corporations, as compared with governments, might do with them. Fluctuations by age and gender occur here too.","",""
"2013","Welfare Surveillance, Income Management and New Paternalism in Australia","This article discusses the situation of income support claimants in Australia, constructed as faulty citizens and flawed welfare subjects. Many are on the receiving end of complex, multi-layered forms of surveillance aimed at securing socially responsible and compliant behaviours. In Australia, as in other Western countries, neoliberal economic regimes with their harsh and often repressive treatment of welfare recipients operate in tandem with a burgeoning and costly arsenal of CCTV and other surveillance and governance assemblages. Through a program of ‘Income Management’, initially targeting (mainly) Indigenous welfare recipients in Australia’s Northern Territory, the BasicsCard (administered by Centrelink, on behalf of the Australian Federal Government’s Department of Human Services) is one example of this welfare surveillance. The scheme operates by ‘quarantining’ a percentage of a claimant’s welfare entitlements to be spent by way of the BasicsCard on ‘approved’ items only. The BasicsCard scheme raises significant questions about whether it is possible to encourage people to take responsibility for themselves if they no longer have real control over the most important aspects of their lives. Some Indigenous communities have resisted the BasicsCard, criticising it because the imposition of income management leads to a loss of trust, dignity, and individual agency. Further, income management of individuals by the welfare state contradicts the purported aim that they become less ‘welfare dependent’ and more ‘self-reliant’. In highlighting issues around compulsory income management this paper makes a contribution to the largely under discussed area of income management and the growth of welfare surveillance, with its propensity for function creep, garnering large volumes of data on users approved (and declined) purchasing decisions, complete with dates, amounts, times and locations.","",""
"2013","From surveillant text to surveilling device: The face in urban transit spaces","This paper considers the power, the significance and the operation of the human face as it transitions from being a mere object for defining dispositions to an agency for transmitting control in contemporary transit spaces. Seen as the most idiosyncratic surface of the body, the face has become a critical object for the measurement of truthfulness in recent years. CCTV and facial recognition technologies have increasingly been deployed in various transit spaces such as airports and railway stations to scan, detect and recognise particular facial characteristics of the target face so as to identify risky situations and intervene before they become hazardous events. However, this paper shows that in addition to these techniques of control-at-a-distance, the face is becoming an important site for a different technique of control as well. Specifically, the face is becoming a key site for circulating a particular range of affects to modulate individuals and to maintain security in transit space. A growing number of transport operators are now supplementing ‘detached’ infrastructures such as CCTV and security personnel, with more ‘affective’ infrastructures of social control such as friendly smiling platform staff and welcoming station concierges at information desks. By taking a closer look at one Japanese railway operator, Keikyu Corporation, and its implementation of the ‘Smile Scan technology’, this paper investigates how the face of the passenger is modulated, made receptive and thus turned into an agent of social control in urban transit spaces.","",""
"2013","Leprosy and the Plague: State Surveillance of Low-Income Fathers","Foucault’s theory of state social control contrasts societal responses to leprosy, where deviants are exiled from society but promised freedom from social demands, and the plague, where deviants are controlled and surveyed within society but receive some state assistance in exchange for their cooperation.In this paper, I analyze how low-income fathers in the United States simultaneously experience social control consistent with leprosy and social control consistent with the plague but do not receive the social benefits that Foucault associates with either status.Through interviews with 57 low-income fathers, I investigate the role of state surveillance in their family lives through child support enforcement, the criminal justice system, and child protective services.Because they did not receive any benefits from compliance with this surveillance, they resisted it, primarily by dropping “off the radar.”Men justified their resistance in four ways: they had their own material needs, they did not want the child, they did not want to separate from their child’s mother or compliance was unnecessary.This resistance is consistent with Foucault’s distinction between leprosy and the plague.They believed that they did not receive the social benefits accorded to plague victims, so they attempted to be treated like lepers, excluded from social benefits but with no social demands or surveillance.","",""

As they are left out of direct anti-doping testing and enforcement, it is tempting to argue non-elites are unaffected by anti-doping efforts focused on the elite level of their sport.  However, it is because they are not subject to anti-doping surveillance systems nor forced to comply with anti-doping regulations that non-elites are implicated within the wider arena of disciplinary power that envelops both elite and non-elite athletes and anti-doping agencies (Foucault 1979). Drawing on data from 28 interviews with non-elite runners I argue these runners do conform to the rules and norms of their sport as far as they understand them, but their knowledge of banned substances is inadequate and many non-elite runners have only a superficial and sometimes incorrect understanding of doping.  Many view doping and its associated health risks as a problem only of elite running, as well as a problem limited to only a handful of widely publicized performance enhancing drugs or doping methods.  As a result of these misunderstandings non-elite runners are vulnerable to negative health effects of over the counter (OTC) medications and nutritional supplements, which they view as “safe” and part of normal training as a result of the current elite surveillance model of anti-doping.  The recent death of a non-elite marathon runner linked to use of the unregulated energy supplement DMAA demonstrates, questionable products are used by runners who may not be fully aware of the risks of use.","",""

This paper introduces an analytical framework of digital policy literacy and applies it to young people’s everyday negotiations of mobile privacy, in order to argue for increased policy literacy around privacy and mobile phone communication. The framework is applied to the Canadian context, where a small study engaged undergraduate university students in focus groups around their uses of mobiles and knowledge of mobile privacy issues. Findings reveal that while our participants were aware of a variety of privacy threats in mobile communication, they were not likely to participate in policy processes that might protect their privacy rights. The paper concludes with a discussion of why young people may not be motivated to intervene in policy processes and how their digital policy literacy around mobile privacy is mitigated by the construction of youth as a lucrative target consumer market for mobile devices and services. ","",""

The intent of this study is identify the privacy implications of browsing the Internet within a single browsing session of a group of commonly visited sites (both SNS and non-SNS) doing activities common among most online users. We analysed the HTTP headers resulting from the first author’s browsing and reported on the types of information being shared or leaked, and to whom. We observed that within just a single browsing session of some sites, both the user’s identifiable and non-identifiable information are being leaked to various third party sites and also propagated to more than just one level of third party site. We also found that some SNS are also able to track user’s browsing activities not only within the SNS but also beyond it -particularly among web sites that use SNS widgets.","",""

"2014","Do Cats Know They Rule YouTube? Surveillance and the Pleasures of Cat Videos","Did you see the videos where the cat jumps in the box, attacks the printer or tries to leap from the snowy car? As the availability and popularity of watching videos on the Internet has risen rapidly in the last decade, so has the prevalence of cat videos. Although the cuteness of YouTube videos of cats might make them appear frivolous, in fact there is a significant irony at their heart: online cat videos enable corporate surveillance of viewers, yet viewers seem just as oblivious to this as the cats featured in the videos.  Towards this end, I consider the distinguishing features of contemporary cat videos, focusing particularly on their narrative structure and mode of observation. I compare cat videos with the “Aesthetic of Astonishment” of early cinema and with dog videos, to explore the nexus of a spectatorship of thrills and feline performance. In particular, I highlight a unique characteristic of these videos: the cats’ unselfconsciousness. This, I argue, is rare in a consumer culture dominated by surveillance, where we are constantly aware of the potential for being watched. The unselfconsciousness of cats in online videos offers viewers two key pleasures: to imagine the possibility of freedom from surveillance, and to experience the power of administering surveillance as unproblematic. Ultimately, however, cat videos enable viewers to facilitate our own surveillance, and we do so with the gleeful abandon of a kitten jumping in a tissue box   What Distinguishes Cat Videos?     Cat videos have become so popular, that they generate millions of views on YouTube, and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis now holds an annual Internet Cat Video Festival. If you are not already a fan of the genre, the Walker’s promotional videos for the festival (2013 and 2012) provide an entertaining introduction to the celebrities (Lil Bub, Grumpy Cat, and Henri), canon (dancing cats, surprised cat, and cat falling off counter), culture and commodities of online cat videos, despite repositioning them into a public exhibition context.     Cats are often said to dominate the internet (Hepola), despite the surprise of Internet inventor Tim Berners-Lee. Domestic cats are currently the most popular pet in the world (Driscoll), however they are already outnumbered by smartphones. Cats have played various roles in our societies, cultures and imaginations since their domestication some 8-10,000 years ago (Driscoll). A potent social and cultural symbol in mythology, art and popular culture, the historical and cultural significance of cats is complex, shifting and often contradictory. They have made their way across geographic, cultural and class boundaries, and been associated with the sacred and the occult, femininity and fertility, monstrosity and domesticity (Driscoll, Rogers). Cats are figured as both inscrutable and bounteously polysemic. Current representations of cats, including these videos, seem to emphasise their sociability with humans, association with domestic space, independence and aloofness, and intelligence and secretiveness.    I am interested in what distinguishes the pleasures of cat videos from other manifestations of cats in folklore and popular culture such as maneki-neko and fictional cats. Even within Internet culture, I’m focusing on live action cat videos, rather than lolcats, animated cats, or dog videos, though these are useful points of contrast. The Walker’s cat video primer also introduces us to the popular discourses accounting for the widespread appeal of these videos: cats have global reach beyond language, audiences can project their own thoughts and feelings onto cats, cats are cute, and they make people feel good.  These discourses circulate in popular conversation, and are promoted by YouTube itself. These suggestions do not seem to account for the specific pleasures of cat videos, beyond the predominance of cats in culture more broadly.    The cat videos popular on the Internet tend to feature several key characteristics. They are generated by users, shot on a mobile device such as a phone, and set in a domestic environment. They employ an observational mode, which Bill Nichols has described as a noninterventionist type of documentary film associated with traditions of direct cinema and cinema verite, where form and style yields to the profilmic event. In the spirit of their observational mode, cat videos feature minimal sound and language, negligible editing and short duration. As Leah Shafer notes, cat videos record, “’live’ events, they are mostly shot by ‘amateurs’ with access to emerging technologies, and they dramatize the familiar.”     For example, the one-minute video Cat vs Printer comprises a single, hand-held shot observing the cat, and the action is underlined by the printer’s beep and the sounds created by the cat’s movements. The patterned wallpaper suggests a domestic location, and the presence of the cat itself symbolises domesticity. These features typically combine to produce impressions of universality, intimacy and spontaneity – impressions commonly labelled ‘cute’. The cat’s cuteness is also embodied in its confusion and surprise at the printer’s movements: it is a simpleton, and we can laugh at its lack of understanding of the basic appurtenances of the modern world.  Cat videos present minimalist narratives, focused on an instant of spectacle. A typical cat video establishes a state of calm, then suddenly disrupts it. The cat is usually the active agent of change, though chance also frequently plays a significant role. The pervasiveness of this structure means that viewers familiar with the form may even anticipate a serendipitous event. The disruption prompts a surprising or comic effect for the viewer, and this is a key part of the video’s pleasure.     For example, in Cat vs Printer, the establishing scenario is the cat intently watching the printer, a presumably quotidian scene, which escalates when the cat begins to smack the moving paper. The narrative climaxes in the final two seconds of the video, when the cat strikes the paper so hard that the printer tray bounces, and the surprised cat falls off its stool. The video ends abruptly. This disruption also takes the viewer by surprise (at least it does the first time you watch it). The terse ending, and lack of resolution or denouement, encourages the viewer to replay the video. The minimal narrative effectively builds expectation for a moment of surprise.    These characteristics of style and form typify a popular body of work, though there is variation, and the millions of cat videos on YouTube might be best accounted for by various subgenres. The most popular cat videos seem to have the most sudden and striking disruptions as well as the most abrupt endings. They seem the most dramatic and spontaneous. There are also thousands of cat videos with minor disruptions, and some with brazenly staged events. Increasingly, there is obvious use of postproduction techniques, including editing and music. A growing preponderance of compilations attests to the videos’ “spreadability” (Jenkins, Ford, and Green).    The conventional formal structure of these videos effectively homogenises the cat, as if there is a single cat performing in millions of videos. Indeed, YouTube comments often suggest a likeness between the cat represented in the video and the commenter’s own cat. In this sense, the cuteness so readily identified has an homogenising effect. It also has the effect of distinguishing cats as a species from other animals, as it confounds common conceptions of all (other) animals as fundamentally alike in their essential difference from the human (animal). Cat videos are often appreciated for what they reveal about cats in general, rather than for each cat’s individuality. In this way, cat videos symbolise a generic feline cuteness, rather than identify a particular cat as cute. The cats of YouTube act “as an allegory for all the cats of the earth, the felines that traverse myths and religions, literature and fables” (Derrida 374). Each cat swiping objects off shelves, stealing the bed of a dog, leaping onto a kitchen bench is the paradigmatic cat, the species exemplar.    Mode of Spectatorship, Mode of Performance: Cat Videos, Film History and Dog Videos    Cat videos share some common features with early cinema.  In his analysis of the “Aesthetic of Astonishment,” which dominated films until about 1904, film historian Tom Gunning argues that the short, single shot films of this era are characterised by exciting audience curiosity and fulfilling it with visual shocks and thrills.     It is easy to see how this might describe the experience of watching Cat vs Printer or Thomas Edison’s Electrocution of an Elephant from 1903. The thrill of revelation at the end of Cat vs Printer is more significant than the minimal narrative it completes, and the most popular videos seem to heighten this shock. Further, like a rainy afternoon spent clicking the play button on a sequence of YouTube’s suggested videos, these early short films were also viewed in variety format as a series of attractions. Indeed, as Leah Shafer notes, some of these early films even featured cats, such as Professor Welton’s Boxing Cats from 1894.  Each film offered a moment of spectacle, which thrilled the modern viewer.    Gunning argues that these early films are distinguished by a particular relationship between spectator and film. They display blatant exhibitionism, and address their viewer directly. This highlights the thrill of disruption: “The directness of this act of display allows an emphasis on the thrill itself – the immediate reaction of the viewer” (Gunning “Astonishment” 122).  This is produced both within the staging of the film itself as players look directly at the camera, and by the mode of exhibition, where a showman primes the audience verbally for a moment of revelation.    Importantly, Gunning argues that this mode of spectatorship differs from how viewers watch narrative films, which later came to dominate our film and television screens: “These early films explicitly acknowledge their spectator, seeming to reach outwards and confront. Contemplative absorption is impossible here” (“Astonishment” 123).    Gunning’s emphasis on a particular mode of spectatorship is significant for our understanding of pet videos.  His description of early cinema has numerous similarities with cat videos, to be sure, but seems to describe more precisely the mode of spectatorship engendered by typical dog videos.  Dog videos are also popular online, and are marked by a mode of performance, where the dogs seem to present self-consciously for the camera.  Dogs often appear to look at the camera directly, although they are probably actually reading the eyes of the camera operator.    One of the most popular dog videos, Ultimate dog tease, features a dog who appears to look into the camera and engage in conversation with the camera operator.  It has the same domestic setting, mobile camera and short duration as the typical cat video, but, unlike the cat attacking the printer, this dog is clearly aware of being watched. Like the exhibitionistic “Cinema of Attractions,” it is marked by “the recurring look at the camera by [canine] actors.  This action which is later perceived as spoiling the realistic illusion of the cinema, is here undertaken with brio, establishing contact with the audience” (Gunning “Attractions” 64).      Dog videos frequently feature dogs performing on command, such as the countless iterations of dogs fetching beverages from refrigerators, or at least behaving predictably, such as dogs jumping in the bath.  Indeed, the scenario often seems to be set up, whereas cat videos more often seem to be captured fortuitously. The humour of dog videos often comes from the very predictability of their behaviour, such as repeatedly fetching or rolling in mud. In an ultimate performance of self-consciousness, dogs even seem to act out guilt and shame for their observers.  Similarly, baby videos are also popular online and were popular in early cinema, and babies also tend to look at the camera directly, showing that they are aware of bring watched.   This emphasis on exhibitionism and modes of spectatorship helps us hone in on the uniqueness of cat videos. Unlike the dogs of YouTube, cats typically seem unaware of their observers; they refuse to look at the camera and “display their visibility” (Gunning “Attractions,” 64). This fits with popular discourses of cats as independent and aloof, untrainable and untameable.  Cat videos employ a unique mode of observation: we observe the cat, who is unencumbered by our scrutiny.   Feline Performance in a World of Pervasive Surveillance  This is an aesthetic of surveillance without inhibition, which heightens the impressions of immediacy and authenticity. The very existence of so many cat videos online is a consequence of camera ubiquity, where video cameras have become integrated with common communications devices. Thousands of cameras are constantly ready to capture these quotidian scenes, and feed the massive economy of user-generated content. Cat videos are obviously created and distributed by humans, a purposeful labour to produce entertainment for viewers.   Cat videos are never simply a feline performance, but a performance of human interaction with the cat. The human act of observation is an active engagement with the other. Further, the act of recording is a performance of wielding the camera, and often also through image or voice. The cat video is a companion performance, which is part of an ongoing relationship between that human and that other animal. It carries strong associations with regimes of epistemological power and physical domination through histories of visual study, mastery and colonisation.  The activity of the human creator seems to contrast with the behaviour of the cat in these videos, who appears unaware of being watched. The cats’ apparent uninhibited behaviour gives the viewer the illusion of voyeuristically catching a glimpse of a self-sufficient world. It carries connotations of authenticity, as the appearance of interaction and intervention is minimised, like the ideal of ‘fly on the wall’ documentary (Nichols). This lack of self-consciousness and sense of authenticity are key to their reception as ‘cute’ videos. Interestingly, one of the reasons that audiences may find this mode of observation so accessible and engaging, is because it heeds the conventions of the fourth wall in the dominant style of fiction film and television, which presents an hermetically sealed diegesis.  This unselfconscious performance of cats in online videos is key, because it embodies a complex relationship with the surveillance that dominates contemporary culture. David Lyon describes surveillance as “any focused attention to personal details for the purposes of influence, management, or control” (“Everyday” 1) and Mark Andrejevic defines monitoring as “the collection of information, with or without the knowledge of users, that has actual or speculative economic value” (“Enclosure” 297). We live in an environment where social control is based on information, collected and crunched by governments, corporations, our peers, and ourselves.  The rampancy of surveillance has increased in recent decades in a number of ways. Firstly, technological advances have made the recording, sorting and analysis of data more readily available. Although we might be particularly aware of the gaze of the camera when we stand in line at the supermarket checkout or have an iPhone pointed at our face, many surveillance technologies are hidden points of data collection, which track our grocery purchases, text messages to family and online viewing. Surveillance is increasingly mediated through digital technologies. Secondly, surveillance data is becoming increasingly privatised and monetised, so there is strengthening market demand for consumer information. Finally, surveillance was once associated chiefly with institutions of the state, or with corporations, but the process is increasingly “lateral,” involving peer-to-peer surveillance and self-surveillance in the realms of leisure and domestic life (Andrejevic “Enclosure,” 301). Cat videos occupy a fascinating position within this context of pervasive surveillance, and offer complex thrills for audiences.    The Unselfconscious Pleasures of Cat Videos  Unselfconsciousness of feline performance in cat videos invites contradictory pleasures. Firstly, cat videos offer viewers the fantasy of escaping surveillance. The disciplinary effect of surveillance means that we modify our behaviour based on a presumption of constant observation; we are managed and manipulated as much by ourselves as we are by others. This discipline is the defining condition of industrial society, as described by Foucault. In an age of traffic cameras, Big Brother, CCTV, the selfie pout, and Google Glass, modern subjects are oppressed by the weight of observation to constantly manage their personal performance.   Unselfconsciousness is associated with privacy, intimacy, naivety and, increasingly, with impossibility. By allowing us to project onto the experience of their protagonists, cat videos invite us to imagine a world where we are not constantly aware of being watched, of being under surveillance by both human beings and technology. This projection is enabled by discourse, which constructs cats as independent and aloof, a libertarian ideal. It provides the potential for liberation from technologized social surveillance, and from the concomitant self-discipline of our docile bodies. The uninhibited performance of cats in online videos offers viewers the prospect that it is possible to live without the gaze of surveillance. Through cat videos, we celebrate the untameable.  Cats model a liberated uninhibitedness viewers can only desire. The apparent unselfconsciousness of feline performance is analogous to Derrida’s conception of animal nakedness: the nudity of animals is significant, because it is a key feature which distinguishes them from humans, but at the same time there is no sense of the concept of nakedness outside of human culture.  Similarly, a performance uninhibited by observation seems beyond humans in contemporary culture, and implies a freedom from social expectations, but there is also little suggestion that cats would act differently if they knew they were observed. We interpret cats’ independence as natural, and take pleasure in cats’ naturalness. This lack of inhibition is cute in the sense that it is attractive to the viewer, but also in the sense that it is naïve to imagine a world beyond surveillance, a freedom from being watched.  Secondly, we take pleasure in the power of observing another. Surveillance is based on asymmetrical regimes of power, and the position of observer, recorder, collator is usually more powerful than the subject of their gaze. We enjoy the pleasure of wielding the unequal gaze, whether we hit the “record” button ourselves or just the “play” button. In this way, we celebrate our capacity to contain the cat, who has historically proven conceptually uncontainable.  Yet, the cats’ unselfconsciousness means we can absolve ourselves of their exploitation. Looking back at the observer, or the camera, is often interpreted as a confrontational move. Cats in videos do not confront their viewer, do not resist the gaze thrown on them. They accept the role of subject without protest; they perform cuteness without resistance. We internalise the strategies of surveillance so deeply that we emulate its practices in our intimate relationships with domestic animals.  Cats do not glare back at us, accusingly, as dogs do, to remind us we are exerting power over them. The lack of inhibition of cats in online videos means that we can exercise the power of surveillance without confronting the oppression this implies. Cat videos offer the illusion of watching the other without disturbing it, brandishing the weapon without acknowledging the violence of its impact. There is a logical tension between these dual pleasures of cat videos: we want to escape surveillance, while exerting it.  The Work of Cat Videos in ‘Liquid Surveillance’  These contradictory pleasures in fact speak to the complicated nature of surveillance in the era of “produsage,” when the value chain of media has transformed along with traditional roles of production and consumption (Bruns). Christian Fuchs argues that the contemporary media environment has complicated the dynamics of surveillance, and blurred the lines between subject and object (304). We both create and consume cat videos; we are commodified as audience and sold on as data.   YouTube is the most popular site for sharing cat videos, and a subsidiary of Google, the world’s most visited website and a company which makes billions of dollars from gathering, collating, storing, assessing, and trading our data. While we watch cat videos on YouTube, they are also harvesting information about our every click, collating it with our other online behaviour, targeting ads at us based on our specific profile, and also selling this data on to others.  YouTube is, in fact, a key tool of what David Lyon calls “liquid surveillance” after the work of Zygmunt Bauman, because it participates in the reduction of millions of bodies into data circulating at the service of consumer society (Lyon “Liquid”).  Your views of cats purring and pouncing are counted and monetised, you are profiled and targeted for further consumption. YouTube did not create the imbalance of power implied by these mechanisms of surveillance, but it is instrumental in automating, amplifying, and extending this power (Andrejevic “Lateral,” 396).   Zygmunt Bauman argues that in consumer society we are increasingly seduced to willingly subject ourselves to surveillance (Lyon “Liquid”), and who better than the cute kitty to seduce us? Our increasingly active role in “produsage” media platforms such as YouTube enables us to perform what Andrejevic calls “the work of being watched” (“Work”). When we upload, play, view, like and comment on cat videos, we facilitate our own surveillance.  We watch cat videos for the contradictory pleasures they offer us, as we navigate and negotiate the overwhelming surveillance of consumer society. Cat videos remind us of the perpetual possibility of observation, and suggest the prospect of escaping it.

With the advent of cloud computing, specialised data centres with powerful computational hardware and software resources can be used for processing and analysing a humongous amount of aggregated data coming from a variety of different sources. The analysis of such data is all the more valuable to the extent that it allows for specific patterns to be found and new correlations to be made between different datasets, so as to eventually deduce or infer new information, as well as to potentially predict behaviours or assess the likelihood for a certain event to occur. This article will focus specifically on the legal and moral obligations of online operators collecting and processing large amounts of data, to investigate the potential implications of big data analysis on the privacy of individual users and on society as a whole.","",""

Although the use of CCTV in both public and private surveillance is well documented, footage is now distributed over the Internet for large crowds to monitor. This article briefly introduces the concept of crowdsourcing and explains its shift from a quasi-communitarian mode of production to a business model and crime-fighting strategy. This is followed by a review of relevant scholarly literature that provides a theoretical basis for understanding crowdsourcing as it applies to CCTV surveillance online. This article then considers four case studies of crowdsourced CCTV surveillance on the Internet. These four UK-based examples provide an overview of an emerging phenomenon of how crowds can be integrated into CCTV surveillance, ranging from identifying suspects to designating suspicious behaviour in everyday activity. This article concludes by considering the broader social risks, extending from literature on CCTV, surveillance and crowdsourced labour.","",""
"2014","Power, knowledge, and the subjects of privacy: understanding privacy as the ally of surveillance","The aim of this article is to argue that privacy, rather than serving only as a countermeasure against surveillance, can also be seen as its ‘partner-in-crime’. Normative statements made by governments and companies on privacy can be regarded as a tool of governance in service of informational capitalism. Initially defined as a fundamental freedom, privacy has become a precondition for a blossoming economy in the context of the information society. The notion of privacy, as a critique of information society, has been assimilated and reshaped by and in favour of informational capitalism, notably by being over-individualized through the self-determination principle. To develop this idea, this article builds on the results of a study on the loyalty programmes run by the four biggest retailers of Switzerland and on the Foucauldian concept of biopower. Indeed, sexual liberation and the development of scientific knowledge on sexuality, the democratization of privacy, and the emergence of scientific discourses about privacy are processes that show intriguing similarities. Like sexuality, privacy has become a ‘power-knowledge’ related to moral standards defining what privacy should be. It produces ‘subjects of privacy’ who are supposed to take care of it according to the official conception of privacy advocates and of the legislature. Finally, we suggest understanding the conception of privacy as a terrain of power struggle between the promoters of an informational capitalism based on surveillance of citizens and consumers, and those who would prefer to promote privacy as a common good leading society to more democracy and freedom.","",""

Furthermore, the development of Web 2.0 and the growth of social media allow ordinary people to collaborate and share information on an unprecedented scale. On the positive side, these digital technologies have given rise to citizen journalism that calls authority to account.

"2014","Surveillance, Snowden, and Big Data: Capacities, consequences, critique"," The Snowden revelations about National Security Agency surveillance, starting in 2013, along with the ambiguous complicity of internet companies and the international controversies that followed provide a perfect segue into contemporary conundrums of surveillance and Big Data. Attention has shifted from late C20th information technologies and networks to a C21st focus on data, currently crystallized in “Big Data.” Big Data intensifies certain surveillance trends associated with information technology and networks, and is thus implicated in fresh but fluid configurations. This is considered in three main ways: One, the capacities of Big Data (including metadata) intensify surveillance by expanding interconnected datasets and analytical tools. Existing dynamics of influence, risk-management, and control increase their speed and scope through new techniques, especially predictive analytics. Two, while Big Data appears to be about size, qualitative change in surveillance practices is also perceptible, accenting consequences. Important trends persist – the control motif, faith in technology, public-private synergies, and user-involvement – but the future-orientation increasingly severs surveillance from history and memory and the quest for pattern-discovery is used to justify unprecedented access to data. Three, the ethical turn becomes more urgent as a mode of critique. Modernity's predilection for certain definitions of privacy betrays the subjects of surveillance who, so far from conforming to the abstract, disembodied image of both computing and legal practices, are engaged and embodied users-in-relation whose activities both fuel and foreclose surveillance.

"2014","Recognizing Friend and Foe: Biometrics, Veridiction, and the Iraq War","In analyzing the deployment of biomertics in Iraq, argue that whereas the body was seen as a site of verification in 20th century surveillance and identification practices, in the ongoing War on Terror, and the Iraq War more specifically, it became a site of veridiction - a site in which the truth about the security of the state can be analyzed (Foucault 2008:32). The body thus became the basis for determining not so much one’s unique identity but one’s friendliness to the normative state order. Enemies could thus be identified and confined as a group, and in this process the state could be secured. In the ongoing of the War on Terror, the visual regime of veridiction has been further articulated to the logic of digital technologies in order to categorize an unfamiliar diverse population into a binary simplistic schema consistent of true and false, therefore friend or foe, and thus “go” - allowed to move through the country or “no go” - destined to be detained. In other words, the digitization of veridiction as the primary goal of biometrics is evident in the automation of the recognition method, the conversion of the archive into database, the transition away from the anthropological station onto mobile dispersed data-gathering enterprise, and replacement of scientific expertise with easy-to-use automated intelligence.","",""

In the succeeding century, Washington’s information infrastructure advanced through three technological regimes: first, the manual during the Philippine War (1898–1907); next, the computerized in the Vietnam War (1963–75); and, recently, the robotic in Afghanistan and Iraq (2001–14). While these military missions have skirted defeat if not disaster, the information infrastructure, as if driven by some in-built engineering, has advanced to higher levels of data management and coercive capacity. With costs for conventional military occupations now becoming prohibitive, the U.S. will likely deploy, circa 2020, its evolving robotic regime—with a triple-canopy aerospace shield, advanced cyberwarfare, and digital surveillance—to envelop the earth in an electronic grid capable of blinding entire armies on the battlefield or atomizing a single insurgent in field or favela.","",""

As I argue, youth Internet safety discourses represent what can be conceptualized as a pedagogy of surveillance – reconfiguring both adult and youth conceptions of online practice in ways which establish “trusted adults” as final arbiters of risk and appropriateness, while casting suspicion on the everyday social practices of youth. Through the pedagogy of surveillance provided by youth Internet safety materials, parents and guardians are encouraged to conceptualize social networking sites and other information technologies used by youth as surveillance tools, rather than as social spaces. Additionally, these materials provide adults with a particular conceptual frame through which to make sense of youth sociality online, commonly interpreting everyday communication and actions from the standpoint of an imagined “21st Century” employer.","",""

"2014","Surveillance, Governance and Professional Sport","The surveillance capacities of professional sports clubs and Leagues are directly related to their modes of governance. This paper identifies how private sports clubs enact surveillance through processes of inclusion and exclusion. Using three examples to demonstrate these processes, we argue that the surveillance mechanisms associated with sports governance at times replicate, at other times contradict, and at other times influence those associated with broader law enforcement and security developments. These examples also suggest potential increases in surveillance activities that emerge in club governance often flow from external concerns regarding allegations of crime, national security breaches and corruption. These context-specific case studies (Flyvbjerg 2001) demonstrate how surveillance and identity authentication are closely tied to the complex, multi-tiered governance structures and practices in three distinct sports. We then explore how these patterns can be interpreted as either connected to or distinct from equivalent developments involving the surveillance surge (Murakami Wood 2009) and concepts of inclusion and exclusion under the criminal law. We conclude by discussing how both internal and external regulatory forces can shape interrelated facets of surveillance, governance and exclusion in elite sports.","",""
"2014","Pandemics of the future: Disease surveillance in real time","This paper explores disease surveillance systems in relation to preparedness, a security paradigm that strives to make future catastrophic events available for “real time” intervention in the present. I examine three different disease surveillance systems — the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, which is composed of physical laboratories and online information dissemination tools; Flu Trends, an algorithmic syndromic surveillance system; and EpiSimS and EpiCast, agent-based epidemiological modeling platforms—in relation to three different temporal logics of preparedness—tracking, anticipating, and projecting. These logical modulations all reflect different temporalities of preparedness, or different ways of making the future present, and there are two important implications of my attention to these logics. First, I argue these disease surveillance systems extend surveillance from the present into the future, constructing the very catastrophic threats for which they seek to prepare. Second, I argue the concept of “real time” on which preparedness depends arises from the technologies that construct this particular understanding of temporality. What’s more, the “real time” these systems construct is never the instantaneous erasure of the present; instead, I emphasize real time as multiple, as the proliferation of the present. At stake is an understanding of the ways in which preparedness establishes its own authority to make the future present by creating the very condition of unpreparedness it works to remedy.","",""

Indeed surveillance ought to be considered not only regarding its negative implications (e.g. the infringement of privacy or social sorting) but also regarding ‘the fun features and entertainment value of surveillance’ (Albrechtlund and Dubbled 2005: 216). Drawing on this new direction in the recent years in Surveillance Studies, this paper focuses on the interplay between watcher and watched and the possibility of challenging surveillance through artistic, entertaining or/and playful motives. Play and games within this framework participate both to the active appropriation of the surveillant hegemonic values (and therefore their acceptance) and to the creation of a space of negotiations (and therefore the possibility of resistance). Thus this paper discusses, using several examples, the line between art, entertainment and resistance that has become blurry and has left a wider margin to respond to surveillance processes.","",""

"2014","Making Up Soldiers: The Role of Statistical Oversight and Reactive Path Dependence in the Effectiveness of Canada’s WWII Mobilization Program 1940-1943","This paper demonstrates the relationship between specific surveillance technologies and state actors’ capacity to assert governmentally ascribed social categories, and their associated performances, onto individuals and populations. During the Second World War in Canada, the government passed legislation to conscript individuals into the Armed Forces. The program commenced in 1940, mandating a registration of all those over the age of sixteen. The conscription of men classified to be “mobilized” began soon after, however, the effectiveness of the National Registration and mobilization system to conscript these identified individuals increased dramatically with the adoption of a new set of surveillance technologies in March 1942. These changes led to significant increases in the number of men that were conscripted per month after 1942, pointing to the capacity of these new policies and technologies to assert greater statistical oversight over system staff and its targeted populations. These surveillant practices and technologies also prompted the development of a form of reactive path dependence. Together, these two points served as key factors which worked to alter the observable performances of individuals classified for conscription.","",""

"2014","Gaming Privacy: a Canadian case study of a children’s co-created privacy literacy game","This paper reports the process and outcomes of the design of a game that educates children about management of privacy online. Using a participatory action research process, children worked with the researchers to develop and play a game which simulates certain aspects of online privacy management and allows for scaffolded experiential learning in a safe environment. The game allows children to develop autonomous skills and understandings, not only for more effective learning but also because it is only through autonomy that children can develop a sense of self which is necessary for understanding what it means to be private. The paper shows that children have quite sophisticated understandings of privacy, compared with some adult perceptions, and that these understandings include awareness of the risks posed by commercial organisations seeking to gather personal data from them. The paper shows how engaging children as research and design participants can lead to more successful approaches in the development of privacy literacy.","",""

"2014","Gaps in the gaze: Informatic practice and the work of public health surveillance","Many works that may be situated within the interdisciplinary field of Surveillance Studies have described dangerous potentialities associated with the pervasive, IT-mediated merger of once discrete data sets. In effect, these works cautioned about the rise of “big data” before it was named as such. Even so, they share an uncomfortable consonance with euphoric claims about the revolutionary transformation portended by big data. Situating both euphoric and critical accounts of the IT-mediated gaze within a larger informatic ethos — a spirit in the Weberian sense of this term, defined above all by its concealment of the labor that makes IT work — this article argues that discourse on the data-driven, information revolution must be supplemented by a more modest discourse empirically rooted in the everyday, pragmatic realities of IT. Where it departs from well-established social scientific analyses of IT, however, is in its development of a novel concept: informatic practice. Informatic practice may be defined as the sum of labor or activity that materializes information, including, for instance, such mundane activities as data entry. To empirically illustrate some complexities associated with informatic practice, this article discusses process challenges associated with the implementation of a large-scale (or “big”), regionally interconnected public health information system in Ontario, Canada. Informed by science and technology studies (STS) and actor-network theory (ANT), it uses documentary evidence and interviews with 38 key informants to describe informatic practice and to illustrate the mutations—the natural change—introduced into the IT-mediated gaze by everyday, material practices. This complicates both critical and euphoric claims about big data.","",""

"2014","Coerced to Leave: Punishment and the Surveillance of Foreign-National Offenders in the UK","Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in London among foreign-national offenders facing deportation from the United Kingdom, this paper seeks to examine how foreign-national offenders experience and understand state policies of control. Worldwide, foreign-nationals are increasingly subject to forms of state surveillance, not just when crossing borders but also during their stay within a given state’s territory. Detention centres, weekly or monthly reporting requirements, and electronic monitoring are already common migrant surveillance strategies allied to deportation policies in many countries across the globe. These forms of state control are conceived legally as administrative practices necessary to control foreign-nationals whose status is still being adjudicated and to enforce the removal of unwanted foreign-nationals. Consequently, these strategies are not inflicted through a judicial process, even though these same practices are used within the context of penal incarceration and supervision. The lived experience of deportability and associated state surveillance highlights the punitive and coercive effects of detention and related conditions of bail. Ironically, but perhaps not unintentionally, those who are deemed a risk and subject to surveillance and banishment are therefore constantly feeling vulnerable and in need of protection. Because they do not consider themselves a risk to society, the foreign-national offenders interviewed for this study understand state surveillance not as a measure of control, but rather as punishment for wanting to stay. In their eyes, it is designed to coerce them to leave. An examination of the experiences of detention and bail reveals how such forms of surveillance work to discipline deportable bodies.","",""

Towards a Normative Theory of Surveillance","Despite recent growth in surveillance capabilities there has been little discussion regarding the ethics of surveillance.  Much of the research that has been carried out has tended to lack a coherent structure or fails to address key concerns.  I argue that the just war tradition should be used as an ethical framework which is applicable to surveillance, providing the questions which should be asked of any surveillance operation.  In this manner, when considering whether to employ surveillance, one should take into account the reason for the surveillance, the authority of the surveillant, whether or not there has been a declaration of intent, whether surveillance is an act of last resort, what is the likelihood of success of the operation and whether surveillance is a proportionate response.  Once underway, the methods of surveillance should be proportionate to the occasion and seek to target appropriate people while limiting surveillance of those deemed inappropriate.  By drawing on the just war tradition, ethical questions regarding surveillance can draw on a long and considered discourse while gaining a framework which, I argue, raises all the key concerns and misses none.","",""

Legal scholars are inclined to consider surveillance simply as the (potential) subject of regulation, while scholarship in Surveillance Studies often seems not to grapple with the ways in which legal processes and doctrines are sites of contestation over both the modalities and the limits of surveillance. Put differently, Surveillance Studies takes notice of what law does not—the relationship between surveillance and social shaping—but glosses over what legal scholarship rightly recognizes as essential—the processes of definition and compromise that regulators and other interested parties must navigate, and the ways that legal doctrines and constructs shape those processes. This article explores the fault lines between law and Surveillance Studies and considers the potential for more productive confrontation and dialogue in ways that leverage the strengths of each tradition.","",""

First, I argue that games can creatively misuse surveillance technologies as a form of resistance. Second, such creative misuse creates a particular embodied relationship to surveillance, what I term the “sensory-inscribed body.” Ultimately, the sensory-inscribed body, through creative misuse of locative tracking technologies, demonstrates that surveillance space is not statically inscribed with meaning; instead, the meanings emerge through practice. Playful engagement reinscribes the possible meanings, positioning the embodied player not simply as an object of surveillance but instead as a creative misuser who brings together heterogeneous elements to reconfigure spatial relationships between people and surveillance technologies.","",""
"2014","From self-tracking to smart urban infrastructures: towards an interdisciplinary research agenda on Big Data","Recent debates on surveillance have emphasised the now myriad possibilities of automated, software-based data gathering, management and analysis. One of the many terms used to describe this phenomenon is ‘Big Data’. The field of Big Data covers a large and complex range of practices and technologies from smart borders to CCTV video analysis, and from consumer profiling to self-tracking applications. The paper’s aim is to explore the surveillance dynamics inherent in contemporary Big Data trends. To this end, the paper adopts two main perspectives concerned with two complementary expressions of Big Data: (1) the individual use of various techniques of self-surveillance and tracking and (2) the simultaneous trend to optimise urban infrastructures through smart information technologies. Drawing upon exploratory research conducted by the authors, the paper shows that both expressions of Big Data present a range of common surveillance dynamics on at least four levels: agency, temporality, spatiality and normativity. On these grounds, the paper highlights a series of important issues to explore in future research.","",""

Findings reveal that the articles utilized four frames: confusion and lack of transparency, justification and private interests, law and self-regulation, and commodification of information.

The affordances of social technologies, which enable people to share information about others, further preclude individual control over privacy. Despite this, social media technologies primarily follow technical models of privacy that presume individual information control. We argue that the dynamics of sites like Facebook have forced teens to alter their conceptions of privacy to account for the networked nature of social media.

"2015","Government Surveillance and Counter-Surveillance on Social and Mobile Media: The Case of Iran (2009)","Human history has witnessed varied surveillance and counter-surveillance activities from time immemorial. Human beings could not surveille others effectively and accurately without the technology of their era. Technology is a tool that can empower both people and governments. The outcomes are different based on the users’ intentions and aims. 2,500 years ago, Sun Tzu noted that ‘If you know both yourself and your enemy, you can win numerous (literally, """"a hundred"""") battles without jeopardy’. His words still ring true. To be a good surveiller and counter-surveiller it is essential to know both sides, and in order to be good at these activities access to technology is vital. There is no doubt that knowledge is power, and without technology to access the information, it is impossible to be powerful. As we become more expert at technology, we will learn what makes surveillance and counter-surveillance more effective, and will be more powerful.“Surveillance” is one of the most important aspects of living in the convergent media environment. This essay illustrates government surveillance and counter-surveillance during the Iranian Green Movement (2009) on social and mobile media.  The Green Movement refers to a non-violent movement that arose after the disputed presidential election on June 2009. After that Iran was facing its most serious political crisis since the 1979 revolution. Claims of vote fraud triggered massive street protests. Many took to the streets with “Green” signs, chanting slogans such as ‘the government lied’, and ‘where is my vote?’  There is no doubt that social and mobile media has played an important role in Iran’s contemporary politics. According to Internet World Stats (IWS) Internet users in 2009 account for approximately 48.5 per cent of the population of Iran. In 2009, Iran had 30.2 million mobile phone users (Freedom House), and 72 cellular subscriptions for every 100 people (World Bank). Today, while Iran has the 19th-largest population in the world, its blogosphere holds the third spot in terms of number of users, just behind the United States and China (Beth Elson et al.). In this essay the use of social and mobile media (technology) is not debated, but the extent of this use, and who, why and how it is used, is clearly scrutinised.Visibility and Surveillance  There have been different kinds of surveillance for a very long time. However, all types of surveillance are based on the notion of “visibility”.  Previous studies show that visibility is not a new term (Foucault Discipline). The new things in the new era, are its scale, scope and complicated ways to watch others without being watched, which are not limited to a specific time, space and group, and are completely different from previous instruments for watching (Andrejevic). As Meikle and Young (146) have mentioned ‘networked digital media bring with them a new kind of visibility’, based on different kinds of technology. Internet surveillance has important implications in politics to control, protect, and influence (Marx Ethics; Castells; Fuchs Critique). Surveillance has been improved during its long history, and evolved from very simple spying and watching to complicated methods of “iSpy” (Andrejevic). To understand the importance of visibility and its relationship with surveillance, it is essential to study visibility in conjunction with the notion of “panopticon” and its contradictory functions. Foucault uses Bentham's notion of panopticon that carries within itself visibility and transparency to control others. “Gaze” is a central term in Bentham’s view. ‘Bentham thinks of a visibility organised entirely around a dominating, overseeing gaze’ (Foucault Eye). Moreover, Thomson (Visibility 11) notes that we are living in the age of ‘normalizing the power of the gaze’ and it is clear that the influential gaze is based on powerful means to see others.Lyon (Surveillance 2) explains that ‘surveillance is any collection and processing of personal data, whether identifiable or not, for the purpose of influencing or managing those whose data have been granted…’. He mentions that today the most important means of surveillance reside in computer power which allows collected data to be sorted, matched, retrieved, processed, marketed and circulated.Nowadays, the Internet has become ubiquitous in many parts of the world. So, the changes in people’s interactions have influenced their lives. Fuchs (Introduction 15) argues that ‘information technology enables surveillance at a distance…in real time over networks at high transmission speed’. Therefore, visibility touches different aspects of people’s lives and living in a “glasshouse” has caused a lot of fear and anxiety about privacy.Iran’s Green Movement is one of many cases for studying surveillance and counter-surveillance technologies in social and mobile media. Government Surveillance on Social and Mobile Media in Iran, 2009  In 2009 the Iranian government controlled technology that allowed them to monitor, track, and limit access to the Internet, social media and mobiles communication, which has resulted in the surveillance of Green Movement’s activists.  The Iranian government had improved its technical capabilities to monitor the people’s behavior on the Internet long before the 2009 election. The election led to an increase in online surveillance. Using social media the Iranian government became even more powerful than it was before the election. Social media was a significant factor in strengthening the government’s power.  In the months after the election the virtual atmosphere became considerably more repressive. The intensified filtering of the Internet and implementation of more advanced surveillance systems strengthened the government’s position after the election. The Open Net Initiative revealed that the Internet censorship system in Iran is one of the most comprehensive and sophisticated censorship systems in the world. It emphasized that ‘Advances in domestic technical capacity have contributed to the implementation of a centralized filtering strategy and a reduced reliance on Western technologies’.On the other hand, the authorities attempted to block all access to political blogs (Jaras), either through cyber-security methods or through threats (Tusa). The Centre for Investigating Organized Cyber Crimes, which was founded in 2007 partly ‘to investigate and confront social and economic offenses on the Internet’ (Cyber Police), became increasingly important over the course of 2009 as the government combated the opposition’s online activities (Beth Elson et al. 16). Training of """"senior Internet lieutenants"""" to confront Iran's """"virtual enemies online"""" was another attempt that the Intelligence minister announced following the protests (Iran Media Program).In 2009 the Iranian government enacted the Computer Crime Law (Jaras). According to this law the Committee in Charge of Determining Unauthorized Websites is legally empowered to identify sites that carry forbidden content and report that information to TCI and other major ISPs for blocking (Freedom House). In the late fall of 2009, the government started sending threatening and warning text messages to protesters about their presence in the protests (BBC). Attacking, blocking, hacking and hijacking of the domain names of some opposition websites such as Jaras and Kaleme besides a number of non-Iranian sites such as Twitter were among the other attempts of the Iranian Cyber Army (Jaras).It is also said that the police and security forces arrested dissidents identified through photos and videos posted on the social media that many imagined had empowered them. Furthermore, the online photos of the active protesters were posted on different websites, asking people to identify them (Valizadeh).In late June 2009 the Iranian government was intentionally permitting Internet traffic to and from social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter so that it could use a sophisticated practice called Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) to collect information about users. It was reportedly also applying the same technology to monitor mobile phone communications (Beth Elson et al. 15).On the other hand, to cut communication between Iranians inside and outside the country, Iran slowed down the Internet dramatically (Jaras). Iran also blocked access to Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia, Twitter and many blogs before, during and after the protests. Moreover, in 2009, text message services were shut down for over 40 days, and mobile phone subscribers could not send or receive text messages regardless of their mobile carriers. Subsequently it was disrupted on a temporary basis immediately before and during key protests days.It was later discovered that the Nokia Siemens Network provided the government with surveillance technologies (Wagner; Iran Media Program). The Iranian government built a complicated system that enabled it to monitor, track and intercept what was said on mobile phones. Nokia Siemens Network confirmed it supplied Iran with the technology needed to monitor, control, and read local telephone calls [...] The product allowed authorities to monitor any communications across a network, including voice calls, text messaging, instant messages, and web traffic (Cellan-Jones). Media sources also reported that two Chinese companies, Huawei and ZTE, provided surveillance technologies to the government. The Nic Payamak and Saman Payamak websites, that provide mass text messaging services, also reported that operator Hamrah Aval commonly blocked texts with words such as meeting, location, rally, gathering, election and parliament (Iran Media Program).  Visibility and Counter-Surveillance  The panopticon is not limited to the watchers. Similarly, new kinds of panopticon and visibility are not confined to government surveillance. Foucault points out that ‘the seeing machine was once a sort of dark room into which individuals spied; it has become a transparent building in which the exercise of power may be supervised by society as a whole’ (Discipline 207). What is important is Foucault's recognition that transparency, not only of those who are being observed but also of those who are observing, is central to the notion of the panopticon (Allen) and ‘any member of society will have the right to come and see with his own eyes how schools, hospitals, factories, and prisons function’ (Foucault, Discipline 207).  Counter-surveillance is the process of detecting and mitigating hostile surveillance (Burton). Therefore, while the Internet is a surveillance instrument that enables governments to watch people, it also improves the capacity to counter-surveille, and draws public attention to governments’ injustice. As Castells (185) notes the Internet could be used by citizens to watch their government as an instrument of control, information, participation, and even decision-making, from the bottom up.With regards to the role of citizens in counter-surveillance we can draw on Jay Rosen’s view of Internet users as ‘the people formerly known as the audience’.  In counter-surveillance it can be said that passive citizens (formerly the audience) have turned into active citizens. And this change was becoming impossible without mobile and social media platforms. These new techniques and technologies have empowered people and given them the opportunity to have new identities. When Thompson wrote ‘the exercise of power in modern societies remains in many ways shrouded in secrecy and hidden from the public gaze’ (Media 125), perhaps he could not imagine that one day people can gaze at the politicians, security forces and the police through the use of the Internet and mobile devices.Furthermore, while access to mobile media allows people to hold authorities accountable for their uses and abuses of power (Breen 183), social media can be used as a means of representation, organization of collective action, mobilization, and drawing attention to police brutality and reasons for political action (Gerbaudo).There is no doubt that having creativity and using alternative platforms are important aspects in counter-surveillance. For example, images of Lt. Pike “Pepper Spray Cop” from the University of California became the symbol of the senselessness of police brutality during the Occupy Movement (Shaw).  Iranians’ Counter-Surveillance on Social and Mobile Media, 2009  Iran’s Green movement (2009) triggered a lot of discussions about the role of technology in social movements. In this regard, there are two notable attitudes about the role of technology: techno-optimistic (Shriky and Castells) and techno-pessimistic (Morozov and Gladwell) views should be taken into account. While techno-optimists overrated the role of social media, techno-pessimists underestimated its role. However, there is no doubt that technology has played a great role as a counter-surveillance tool amongst Iranian people in Iran’s contemporary politics.Apart from the academic discussions between techno-optimists and techno-pessimists, there have been numerous debates about the role of new technologies in Iran during the Green Movement. This subject has received interest from different corners of the world, including Western countries, Iranian authorities, opposition groups, and also some NGOs. However, its role as a means of counter-surveillance has not received adequate attention.As the tools of counter-surveillance are more or less the tools of surveillance, protesters learned from the government to use the same techniques to challenge authority on social media.Establishing new websites (such as JARAS, RASA, Kalemeh, and Iran green voice) or strengthening some previous ones (such as Saham, Emrooz, Norooz), also activating different platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube accounts to broadcast the voice of the Iranian Green Movement and neutralize the government’s propaganda were the most important ways to empower supporters of Iran’s Green Movement in counter-surveillance.‘Reporters Without Borders issued a statement, saying that ‘the new media, and particularly social networks, have given populations collaborative tools with which they can change the social order’. It is also mentioned that despite efforts by the Iranian government to prevent any reporting of the protests and due to considerable pressure placed on foreign journalists inside Iran, social media played a significant role in sending the messages and images of the movement to the outside world (Axworthy). However, at that moment, many thought that Twitter performed a liberating role for Iranian dissenters. For example, Western media heralded the Green Movement in Iran as a “Twitter revolution” fuelled by information and communication technologies (ICTs) and social media tools (Carrieri et al. 4). “The Revolution Will Be Twittered” was the first in a series of blog posts published by Andrew Sullivan a few hours after the news of the protests was released.According to the researcher’s observation the numbers of Twitter users inside Iran who tweeted was very limited in 2009 and social media was most useful in the dissemination of information, especially from those inside Iran to outsiders. Mobile phones were mostly influential as an instrument firstly used for producing contents (images and videos) and secondly for the organisation of protests. There were many photos and videos that were filmed by very simple mobile cell phones, uploaded by ordinary people onto YouTube and other platforms. The links were shared many times on Twitter and Facebook and released by mainstream media. The most frequently circulated story from the Iranian protests was a video of Neda Agha-Sultan. Her final moments were captured by some bystanders with mobile phone cameras and rapidly spread across the global media and the Internet. It showed that the camera-phone had provided citizens with a powerful means, allowing for the creation and instant sharing of persuasive personalised eyewitness records with mobile and globalised target populations (Anden-Papadopoulos).Protesters used another technique, DDOS (distributed denial of service attacks), for political protest in cyber space. Anonymous people used DDOS to overload a website with fake requests, making it unavailable for users and disrupting the sites set as targets (McMillan) in effect, shutting down the site. DDOS is an important counter-surveillance activity by grassroots activists or hackers. It was a cyber protest that knocked the main Iranian governmental websites off-line and caused crowdsourcing and false trafficking. Amongst them were Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran's supreme leader’s websites and those which belong to or are close to the government or security forces, including news agencies (Fars, IRNA, Press TV…), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Police, and the Ministry of the Interior.Moreover, as authorities uploaded the pictures of protesters onto different platforms to find and arrest them, in some cities people started to put the pictures, phone numbers and addresses of members of security forces and plain clothes police officers who attacked them during the protests and asked people to identify and report the others. They also wanted people to send information about suspects who infringed human rights.  Conclusion  To sum up, visibility, surveillance and counter-surveillance are not new phenomena. What is new is the technology, which increased their complexity. As Foucault (Discipline 200) mentioned ‘visibility is a trap’, so being visible would be the weakness of those who are being surveilled in the power struggle. In the convergent era, in order to be more powerful, both surveillance and counter-surveillance activities aim for more visibility. Although both attempt to use the same means (technology) to trap the other side, the differences are in their subjects, objects, goals and results.While in surveillance, visibility of the many by the few is mostly for the purpose of control and influence in undemocratic ways, in counter-surveillance, the visibility of the few by the many is mostly through democratic ways to secure more accountability and transparency from the governments.As mentioned in the case of Iran’s Green Movement, the scale and scope of visibility are different in surveillance and counter-surveillance. The importance of what Shaw wrote about Sydney occupy counter-surveillance, applies to other places, such as Iran. She has stressed that ‘protesters and police engaged in a dance of technology and surveillance with one another. Both had access to technology, but there were uncertainties about the extent of technology and its proficient use…’In Iran (2009), both sides (government and activists) used technology and benefited from digital networked platforms, but their levels of access and domains of influence were different, which was because the sources of power, information and wealth were divided asymmetrically between them. Creativity was important for both sides to make others more visible, and make themselves invisible. Also, sharing information to make the other side visible played an important role in these two areas.

He then situates the role of digital media within a multifaceted scenario where powerful mainstream media and political elites are colluded, independent journalists are threatened and struggle to get their voice heard, and governments invest immense resources to spy on citizens and to influence public opinion. While recognizing the importance of the Internet to pursue social change in the Latin American context, Pleyers urges us to look at the broader social, political, and economic picture in order to understand the extent of the transformations on the continent.","",""

Situating the research in a broader context in which non-dominant teens are increasingly surveilled, I demonstrate how teens manage social privacy in at least three ways. First, they negotiate liminal boundaries of what constitutes a communal or shareable mobile device, which are structured around financial constraints. Second, through nonuse, they actively resist the ways mobile and social media reconfigure social and physical spaces. Third, they deliberately use multiple platforms as a way to cope with evolving privacy settings, social norms, and technological affordances; this is a deliberate strategy intended to resist social convergence. Because low-income and non-dominant youth are increasingly surveilled by adults, peers, and institutions, it is imperative that they find spaces that afford greater freedom of expression, interest-based communities, and privacy.","",""

As information is disclosed via social media, it creates new opportunities for engagement, surveillance, and commodification. Based on group interviews with small business owners, we identify the kinds of information that small businesses must manage as participants on social media platforms and the privacy rules they develop.","",""

While critical scholars have drawn attention to the social, political and legal challenges to these practices, the debates in computer and information science have received less analytical attention. This paper proposes to take seriously the critical knowledge developed in information and computer science and reinterpret their debates to develop a critical intervention into the public controversies concerning data-driven security and digital surveillance. The paper offers a two-pronged contribution: on the one hand, we challenge the credibility of security professionals’ discourses in light of the knowledge that they supposedly mobilize; on the other, we argue for a series of conceptual moves around data, human–computer relations, and algorithms to address some of the limitations of existing engagements with the Big Data-security assemblage.

"2015","Data flows and water woes: The Utah Data Center"," Using a new materialist line of questioning that looks at the agential potentialities of water and its entanglements with Big Data and surveillance, this article explores how the recent Snowden revelations about the National Security Agency (NSA) have reignited media scholars to engage with the infrastructures that enable intercepting, hosting, and processing immeasurable amounts of data. Focusing on the expansive architecture, location, and resource dependence of the NSA’s Utah Data Center, I demonstrate how surveillance and privacy can never be disconnected from the material infrastructures that allow and render natural the epistemological state of mass surveillance. Specifically, I explore the NSA’s infrastructure and the million of gallons of water it requires daily to cool its servers, while located in one of the driest states in the US. Complicating surveillance beyond the NSA, as also already imbricated with various social media companies, this article questions the emplacement and impact of corporate data centers more generally, and the changes they are causing to the landscape and local economies. I look at how water is an intriguing and politically relevant part of the surveillance infrastructure and how it has been constructed as the main tool for activism in this case, and how it may eventually help transform the public’s conceptualization of Big Data, as deeply material.

"2015","Surveillance cultures, chains and holes in street level networking: dealing with drug users in Amsterdam (Netherlands) and Porto Alegre (Brazil)","If surveillance is understood as a complex multi-dimensional process, then collaboration between health, social and law enforcement sectors can be viewed as a part of the surveillance culture of particular societies and urban settings. Policies towards illicit drugs usually build on a two-track approach—public health and public order—with different objectives that have to be negotiated daily by street level workers in the light of their differing beliefs on drug use. This paper brings examples of collaboration and non-collaboration among workers from social, health and law enforcement agencies in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and Porto Alegre, Brazil in their daily interactions with drug users, to analyze the types of surveillance arising from these negotiations. The study utilizes results from 80 in-depth interviews with street level workers and 800 hours of participant observation carried out from February 2010 until March 2011, equally divided between the two cities. Different cultures of surveillance produce diverse state-citizen approaches in terms of coercion, care, and rights. In Amsterdam, close collaboration and information exchange among workers produce a ‘chain’ surveillance culture: an intensive screening allows drug users to have more access to care, yet, at the same time this can produce excessive control over users’ lives. In Porto Alegre, by contrast, insufficient collaboration produces a surveillance culture of ‘holes’: less systematic screening and lack of information sharing allows users to slip out of care, and of workers’ surveillance sight. Historically, though coming from apparently opposite extremes in terms of drug surveillance (respectively permissive and controlling), both Amsterdam and Porto Alegre in practice show surveillance cultures which combine care and order. Combinations, however, vary according to different assemblages between actors concerned with transforming drug users’ lives.","",""

"2015","Nurturing Ob-Scene Politics: Surveillance Practices Between In/Visibilities and Disappearances","Moving away from the traditional framing of surveillance in terms of in/visibility, this article proposes a conceptual journey that investigates the potential of the notions of dis-appearance and ob-scene as alternative theoretical tools. In particular, it explores how these different perspectives can help bringing politics back into the study and the critique of surveillance.Visibility is structurally linked to invisibility, and together they configure the different modes of in/visibility allowing for the very functioning of surveillance. However, the in/visibility dyad rather than merely describe surveillance contributes to its operations and stabilisation. In order to better understand and unpack surveillance it is thus necessary to tackle its practices not only in search of who watches whom, or what, but also by studying what is concealed through in/visibility, through both hiding and exposing, and what is left out of the scene (or being pushed away) in these processes.In a dialogue with surveillance and critical security studies, this contribution examines the disappearance of bodies in the deployment of security scanners and post-Snowden developments to illustrate the productivity of dis-appearance and the emergence of surveillance’s ob-scene. Against this background, the paper argues that through the lens of the ob-scene it is possible to grasp surveillance’s ripples, and open up their political discussion.","",""

"2015","Acceptable Surveillance-Orientated Security Technologies: Insights from the SurPRISE Project","Pre-emptive security emphasizes the necessity of envisioning and designing technologies enabling the anticipation and management of emergent risks threatening human and public security. Surveillance functionalities are embedded in the design of these technologies to allow constant monitoring, preparedness and prevention. Yet surveillance-orientated security technologies, such as smart CCTVs or Deep Packet Inspection, bring along with their implementation other risks, such as risks of privacy infringement, discrimination, misuse, abuse, or errors, which have often triggered public outrage and resistance. The same measures meant to foster human security, can potentially make people feel insecure, vulnerable, and exposed. This outcome is the result of a narrow approach toward problem solving that does not take into account those same people the technology is supposed to protect. Drawing from both the socio-cultural and psychometric approaches to risk analysis and from the literature on public engagement in science and technology, this article presents a new methodological tool, which combines traditional citizen summit method with an innovative mixed-method research design. The objective of this new form of participatory exercise is to engage the public and gather socially robust and in context knowledge about the public acceptability of these technologies. The method has been developed as part of the SurPRISE project, funded by the European Commission under the SeventhFramework Program.

In order to contextualise this interplay between these two models, three related areas are considered in this article. Firstly, the growing awareness of the consequences of Big Data, not only within teaching and research institutions, but through the dissemination of (sometimes erroneous) information in popular media and various news platforms is discussed. The British government’s response to such developments with a ‘rhetoric of transparency’, which has been critically undermined with the recent ‘leaks’ from whistleblowers affecting both British and American security agencies, in particular, is considered. Secondly, a brief outline of the changing theoretical models which can be employed to aid understanding of this situation is offered and, thirdly, in examining popular cultural responses to the rise of a Big Data discourse, two films are analysed, Sam Mendes's Skyfall (2012) and Tomas Alfredson's 2011 Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, both of which seek to engage with these changing frameworks. These films in turn contribute to the fictions of transparency in relation to government espionage agencies.","",""
"2015","Surveillance Hegemony","The National Security Agency activity disclosed by Edward Snowden plugs into a larger information ecology made possible by U.S. surveillance hegemony. While the revelations of the NSA’s international spying ambitions have astonished, there is more to U.S. surveillance than secretive programs carried out by its intelligence community. The U.S. also assiduously conducts surveillance on individuals abroad through public programs negotiated with other states. These more public efforts are made possible by institutions and hortatory norms that support international surveillance. This triad of capabilities, norms, and institutions reflect U.S. surveillance hegemony. Hegemony greases the wheels of U.S.-led international surveillance and fosters an information ecology that feeds, and is fed by, secretive programs like those of the NSA and more public surveillance alike. This article unpacks elements of U.S. surveillance hegemony and, using two other public surveillance programs, situates the NSA activity within the resulting information ecology.","",""

"2015","The Snowden Stakes: Challenges for Understanding Surveillance Today","The drip-feed disclosures about state surveillance following Edward Snowden’s dramatic departure from his NSA contractor, Booz Allen, carrying over one million revealing files, have ired some and prompted some serious heart-searching in others.  One of the challenges is to those who engage in surveillance studies. Three kinds of issues present themselves: One, research disregard: responses to the revelations show a surprising lack of understanding of the large-scale multi-faceted panoply of surveillance that has been constructed over the past 40 years or so that includes but is far from exhausted by state surveillance itself. Two, research deficits: we find that a number of crucial areas require much more research. These include the role of physical conduits including fibre-optic cables within circuits or power, of global networks of security and intelligence professionals, and of the minutiae of everyday social media practices. Three, research direction: the kinds of surveillance that have developed over several decades are heavily dependent on the digital – and, increasingly, on so-called big data -- but also extend beyond it. However, if there is a key issue raised by the Snowden revelations, it is the future of the internet. Information and its central conduits have become an unprecedented arena of political struggle, centred on surveillance and privacy. Those concepts themselves require rethinking.","",""
"2015","Lateral Surveillance in Singapore","With the high Internet penetration rate, and the dense saturation of audio-visual-capturing mobile smartphones among its citizens, Singapore provides a ripe technological infrastructure for a surveillance society. Its citizens have been serendipitously capturing, on photo or video, socially undesirable and controversial incidents of daily living. Widespread adoption and use of social media have enhanced the viewership of these behaviours captured, and provided a platform for responses of criticisms.Panopticism, in the modern day context, is used as a metaphor to describe the effect of surveillance by authorities that shapes and manipulates social behaviour. Lateral surveillance is an opposite of panopticism, which portrays the impact of surveillance of the few, by the unseen many. This study explored the perception and impact of these activities on citizens’ social behaviours. Respondents were questioned on their awareness of surveillance in different milieu of their daily lives, such as commuting, driving, interactions in public spaces, and checking into, or uploading of photos onto social media, and its impacts on their social behaviours in those public spaces.This study recruited a sample of 223 university students, aged between 19 and 24 years, comprising of both genders, to undergo an online survey. These students were directed to an online survey, which did not capture identifiable information, by the authors who have access to the students at their university.Data collected provided descriptive statistics of the awareness and impact of panopticism, and lateral surveillance, by media-rich and media-savvy young citizens. Comparisons were made between panopticism versus lateral surveillance’s effect on social behavior. This study found that lateral surveillance had a more powerful effect on social behaviours, contributed significantly by the presence and usage of publicity channels such as FaceBook, and other local popular news websites.","",""

"2015","Integrating subjects: Linking surveillance experiences to social patterns using Ethno‐Epistemic Assemblages","Surveillance can be experienced in a variety of ways, but how these experiences might be linked to broader social patterns is currently underdeveloped. There is a growing body of research exploring the surveillance subject and how individuals may (dis)engage with surveillance practices. This includes (but is not limited to) surveillance as a bargaining process (Pallitto 2013), counter surveillance activities such as sousveillance (Mann, Nolan and Wellman 2003), and surveillance as a process of exposing subjects (Ball 2009). But while shedding light on the experiences of surveillance subjects, how these experiences might be placed in relation to broader social and surveillance structures is not always automatically evident. This paper presents an initial engagement with this topic, and suggests that a possible angle for linking surveillance subjects to broader social patterns may be achieved through concepts from science and technology studies, specifically Irwin and Michael’s (2003) concept of the ethno-epistemic assemblage (EEA). The EEA is a theoretical heuristic originally envisioned to help understand the blurred relationships between science and society, emphasising the heterogeneous composition and relationship of technoscience and society. The EEA specifically links an individual’s contexts (ethnos), and the forms of knowledge relevant to their contexts (episteme), into assemblages, highlighting the interwoven, dynamic, and fluid nature of ethno-epistemes against and in conjunction with other EEAs, and other social narratives. A brief exploration of the marginal positioning of surveillance subjectivities is presented, followed by a detailed description of the EEA, and how it may contribute to structuring and placing the complexities of surveillance subjects in society.","",""
"2015","Patterns of Surveillance Legitimization. The German Discourse on the NSA Scandal","This paper conceptualizes scandals as a special type of discourse in which the legitimacy of institutions or practices like surveillance is in question. This forces surveillance advocates to engage in legitimacy management (Suchmann 1995). They therefore adopt legitimization strategies that can be observed. This paper presents a framework for the study of surveillance legitimizing strategies in scandal discourses that can be used for future cross-case comparisons. The aim is to analyze how the legitimacy of surveillance practices is maintained or repaired by surveillance advocates when it is contested in times of a scandal. The research questions are, what rhetorical strategies are used to legitimize surveillance and to prevent the scandal from escalating? The case that is studied is the reaction by the German federal Government between June and October 2013. Because of the Federal Election in September that year and the strong notions about privacy and data protection within Germany, this discourse is especially relevant. The surveillance legitimizing practices follow an escalation logic: from denial of knowledge, denial of participation, acknowledging of limited participation to complaining about the monitoring of Angela Merkel’s cellphone.","",""
"2015","Surveillance and Ethnography:  Researching Surveillance as Everyday Life","This article argues for a wider and more nuanced understanding of ethnography’s role in Surveillance Studies than has sometimes historically been the case. The article begins by (briefly) deconstructing some of the ways that the concepts of both ‘surveillance’ and ‘ethnography’ have been deployed in empirical surveillance research over time, in order to set the scene for a critical interrogation of the variety of ethnographic approaches so far used within Surveillance Studies. The paper then goes on to review Surveillance Studies approaches broadly, and a range of qualitative and ethnographically-informed approaches in particular, within interdisciplinary empirical research related to surveillance relations. The ensuing discussion identifies several points where the existing empirical evidence base would benefit from more extensive ethnographic studies, at multiple sites and scales, that methodologically recognize surveillance as situated and meaningful everyday life processes and practices, rather than surveillant activities and relationships in settings defined as ‘surveillance’ in an a priori fashion. The article concludes by suggesting that approaches oriented towards empirically understanding surveillance practices as ‘everyday life’ have a significant future contribution to make, particularly with respect to building and developing our theoretical understandings of surveillant assemblages in everyday life contexts.","",""

The critical analysis and conceptual reinterpretation of state and corporate surveillance and its impact on the political agency of civil society is multidisciplinary. An intersection of surveillance studies, political philosophy, and global politics/international relations provides an overview of the policies and practices that states and corporations develop and implement in relation to information and communications technologies (ICT). Clarifying how contemporary society is global and digital, it analyzes the way in which political economies inform contemporary policies and practices of surveillance. A critical analysis the relation of political economy to neoliberal governmentality, biopolitical technologies of power, and contemporary regimes of truth, leads to posit that global mass surveillance is a technology of power deployed by a contemporary biopolitics of information and communication. A conceptual reinterpretation of Foucault’s notion of parrhesia and Mann’s notion of sousveillance leads to posit that parrhesiastic sousveillance is a socio-political and technologically-enabled modality of resistance that can resemantize contemporary politics of truth and lead towards a newborn digital agency for global(ized) civil society.","",""

"2015","Criminal Investigation Through the Eye of the Detective: Technological Innovation and Tradition","Technological elements and scientific knowledge are steadily transforming both the traditional image of the detective and the nature of contemporary police work. However, despite the potential utility of scientific methods and new technologies in criminal investigations, there are many barriers surrounding their application. We explore these barriers through a qualitative and comprehensive methodology, utilising a set of semi-structured interviews and informal conversations with criminal investigators.We use theoretical contributions from social studies of science and technology, surveillance studies and policing research to analyse how soft and hard forms of surveillance are applied in the practices of the Portuguese Criminal Investigation Police (Polícia Judiciária). The technological artefacts are both shaped by and shape how criminal investigators work. Consequently, it is necessary to explore how the collectives of human and non-human elements are constituted. By analysing the fusion of traditional methods of criminal investigation (hard surveillance) with new technologies of collection and use of information (soft surveillance) we see a hybrid figure of the contemporary detective emerging; a product of both the past and the present. In a context where innovation is sometimes constrained, traditional methods continue to endure. Nevertheless, the expansion of computerisation and police databases has had significant impact on how police information is collected and recorded.","",""

The article identifies four technological frames in which CCTV is placed in the period. Three of these are ‘use-directed’ as they point to various ways of using CCTV and identify certain advantages and obstacles for this use. These three frames are ‘CCTV in industries’, ‘CCTV in traffic’, and ‘CCTV in security practices’. The fourth technological frame is critical towards using CCTV; it fears that the relationship between citizens and state is hampered and that the privacy of citizens is at risk. This technological frame is labeled ‘CCTV as a democratic threat’. The article shows how there have been various controversies between the different interpretations of CCTV. Thus, CCTV in Denmark has not evolved through linear and uncontested progression; in fact, CCTV has been at the centre of several controversies in which surveillance practices have been negotiated and regulated.","",""
"2015","Policing Made Visible:  Mobile Technologies and the Importance of Point of View","Cameras are ubiquitous and increasingly mobile. While CCTV has captured considerable attention by surveillance researchers, the new visibility of police activities is increasingly produced by incidental sousveillance and wearable on-officer camera systems. This article considers advocacy for policing’s new visibility, contrasting that of police accountability activists who film police with designers and early adopters of on-officer cameras. In both accounts, these devices promise accountability by virtue of their mechanical objectivity. However, to each party, accountability functions rather differently. By attending to the social and legal privileging of police officers’ perspectives, the article provides an explanation for design decisions that produced Taser’s AXON Flex on-officer cameras and for why police are embracing these new technologies. Critics of these cameras cite privacy concerns, officer discretion in operating cameras, and department disclosure of footage. Nonetheless, advocates of police accountability often presume more video documenting police use of force is always helpful. However, the utility of surveillance video is conditioned by point of view. Police agencies in the U.S. are rapidly adopting on-officer camera systems, because they acknowledge ubiquitous surveillance and that these devices aid in nullifying third-party documentation in favor of a perspective that favors officers. As such, these cameras are counter-sousveillance technologies.","",""

An introduction to activist intelligence as a new field of surveillance.","Building on previous research published in Secret Manoeuvres in the Dark, corporate and police spying on activists (2012), the author proposes a new field of research called Activist intelligence and covert strategy.Using exclusive access to previously confidential sources, Secret Manoeuvres showed how companies such as Nestlé, Shell and McDonald’s use covert methods to evade accountability. The author concluded that corporate intelligence gathering has shifted from being reactive to proactive, and identified a seriously under-researched area: the state’s concern with corporate interests, their close cooperation in collecting intelligence on campaigners, and a shared agenda in dealing with dissent. This paper encompasses an introduction to the published case studies, a definition of the proposed research field, and an exploration of its positioning in a multidisciplinary area as well as its theoretical embedding. The discussion under Methods: Hybrid Projects makes a case for the fusion of journalistic and social scientific approaches to the subject matter. ","",""

While it is generally recognized in public policy making that the right to privacy is challenged in new ways in a structurally transformed online public sphere, the way in which it has been framed does not seem to acknowledge this transformation. This paper therefore argues for a reformulation of “online privacy” in the current global policy debate. It presents the results of a qualitative study amongst 68 Danish high school students concerning how they perceive, negotiate and control their private sphere when using social media and builds a case for utilizing the results of studies as this to inform the ongoing policy discourses concerning online privacy.","",""
"2015","Complicit surveillance, interveillance, and the question of cosmopolitanism: Toward a phenomenological understanding of mediatization"," The institutional and meta-processual dimensions of surveillance have been scrutinized extensively in literature. In these accounts, the subjective, individual level has often been invoked in relation to subject–object, surveillor–surveilled dualities and in terms of the kinds of subjectivity modern and late-modern institutions engender. The experiential, ontological realm of the “mediatized everyday” vis-a-vis surveillance remains less explored, particularly from the phenomenological perspective of the lifeworld. Academic discourses of surveillance mostly address rhetorically oriented macro-perspectives. The same diagnosis largely applies to the debates on the cosmopolitanization process. The literature of cosmopolitan ism revolves around broad cultural and ethical transformations in terms of the relationship between Self and Other, individual and humanity, and the local and the universal. Our aim in this article is to conceptualize the dynamics that yield a cosmopolitan Self and an encapsulated Self under conditions of increasingly interactive and ubiquitous forms of mediation and surveillance.

The simple and swift spread properties of micro-blogging make it different to the conventional SNS. However, little empirical results were provided in prior literature to elaborate individual’s behavior of micro-blogging use. Consequently, this study aims to explore the possible influence of individuals’ motivations on their self-disclosure and instant information sharing behavior as well as the extent of perceived social support in micro-blogging. Individuals who had experiences on Plurk usage were invited as subjects. The partial least squares (PLS) was utilized to examine the proposed model and hypotheses. Analytical results indicate that popularity and interpersonal needs significantly influence individual’s self-disclosure, while interpersonal and entertainment needs significantly influence individual’s instant information sharing behavior. Moreover, both individual’s self-disclosure and instant information sharing behavior have a positive relationship with the perceived extent of social support. ","",""

Individuals in these developmental stages are often described as vulnerable Internet users. But how vulnerable are adults in terms of online informational privacy? This study applied a privacy boundary management approach and investigated Facebook use, privacy concern, and the application of privacy settings on Facebook by linking the results to Erikson’s three stages of adulthood: emerging, young, and middle adulthood. An online survey was distributed among 18- to 65-year-old Dutch-speaking adults ( N = 508, 51.8% females). Analyses revealed clear differences between the three adult age groups in terms of privacy concern, Facebook use, and privacy protection. Results indicated that respondents in young adulthood and middle adulthood were more vulnerable in terms of privacy protection than emerging adults. Clear discrepancies were found between privacy concern and protection for these age groups. More particularly, the middle adulthood group was more concerned about their privacy in comparison to the emerging adulthood and young adulthood group. Yet, they reported to use privacy settings less frequently than the younger age groups. Emerging adults were found to be pragmatic and privacy conscious SNS users. Young adults occupied the intermediate position, suggesting a developmental shift. The impact of generational differences is discussed, as well as implications for education and governmental action.

Do these aspects of Facebook use affect how people share information online? Analyzing Facebook posts young adults shared from different devices and different locations, this article examines the effectiveness of users’ privacy management. By comparing the intended audience with the actual audience of each post, we find considerable mismatch between the two despite most participants expressing confidence in their ability to manage their information on the site. Posts that are accidentally shared with “public”—potentially anyone on the web—are more likely to be shared from non-mobile devices. Interview data reveal that this happens despite the fact that most participants consider non-mobile devices more reliable and convenient to use than mobile devices. ","",""

Re-imagined Scenarios and the Re-Virtualisation of History","Image 1: “Oklahoma State Highway Re-imagined.” CC BY-SA 4.0 2015 by author, using Wikimedia image by Ks0stm (CC BY-SA 3 2013). Introduction This article is divided in three major parts. First a scenario, second its context, and third, an analysis. The text draws on ethnographic research on security practices in the United States among police and parts of the intelligence community from 2006 through to the beginning of 2014. Real names are used when the material is drawn from archival sources, while individuals who were interviewed during fieldwork are referred to by their position rank or title. For matters of fact not otherwise referenced, see the sources compiled on “The Complete 911 Timeline” at History Commons. First, a scenario.  Oklahoma, 2001 It is 1 April 2001, in far western Oklahoma, warm beneath the late afternoon sun. Highway Patrol Trooper C.L. Parkins is about 80 kilometres from the border of Texas, watching trucks and cars speed along Interstate 40. The speed limit is around 110 kilometres per hour, and just then, his radar clocks a blue Toyota Corolla going 135 kph. The driver is not wearing a seatbelt.  Trooper Parkins swung in behind the vehicle, and after a while signalled that the car should pull over. The driver was dark-haired and short; in Parkins’s memory, he spoke English without any problem. He asked the man to come sit in the patrol car while he did a series of routine checks—to see if the vehicle was stolen, if there were warrants out for his arrest, if his license was valid. Parkins said, “I visited with him a little bit but I just barely remember even having him in my car. You stop so many people that if […] you don't arrest them or anything […] you don't remember too much after a couple months” (Clay and Ellis). Nawaf Al Hazmi had a valid California driver’s license, with an address in San Diego, and the car’s registration had been legally transferred to him by his former roommate. Parkins’s inquiries to the National Crime Information Center returned no warnings, nor did anything seem odd in their interaction. So the officer wrote Al Hazmi two tickets totalling $138, one for speeding and one for failure to use a seat belt, and told him to be on his way.  Al Hazmi, for his part, was crossing the country to a new apartment in a Virginia suburb of Washington, DC, and upon arrival he mailed the payment for his tickets to the county court clerk in Oklahoma. Over the next five months, he lived several places on the East Coast: going to the gym, making routine purchases, and taking a few trips that included Las Vegas and Florida. He had a couple more encounters with local law enforcement and these too were unremarkable. On 1 May 2001 he was mugged, and promptly notified the police, who documented the incident with his name and local address (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 139). At the end of June, having moved to New Jersey, he was involved in a minor traffic accident on the George Washington Bridge, and officers again recorded his real name and details of the incident.  In July, Khalid Al Mihdhar, the previous owner of the car, returned from abroad, and joined Al Hazmi in New Jersey. The two were boyhood friends, and they went together to a library several times to look up travel information, and then, with Al Hazmi’s younger brother Selem, to book their final flight. On 11 September, the three boarded American Airlines flight 77 as part of the Al Qaeda team that flew the mid-sized jet into the west façade of the Pentagon. They died along with the piloting hijacker, all the passengers, and 125 people on the ground. Theirs was one of four airplanes hijacked that day, one of which was crashed by passengers, the others into significant sites of American power, by men who had been living for varying lengths of time all but unnoticed in the United States.  No one thought that Trooper Parkins, or the other officers with whom the 9/11 hijackers crossed paths, should have acted differently. The Commissioner of the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety himself commented that the trooper “did the right thing”  at that April traffic stop. And yet, interviewed by a local newspaper in January of 2002, Parkins mused to the reporter “it's difficult sometimes to think back and go: 'What if you had known something else?'"""" (Clay and Ellis). Missed Opportunities  Image 2: “Hijackers Timeline (Redacted).” CC BY-SA 4.0 2015 by author, using the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)’s “Working Draft Chronology of Events for Hijackers and Associates”. In fact, several of the men who would become the 9/11 hijackers were stopped for minor traffic violations. Mohamed Atta, usually pointed to as the ringleader, was given a citation in Florida that spring of 2001 for driving without a license. When he missed his court date, a bench warrant was issued (Wall Street Journal). Perhaps the warrant was not flagged properly, however, since nothing happened when he was pulled over again, for speeding. In the government inquiries that followed attack, and in the press, these brushes with the law were “missed opportunities” to thwart the 9/11 plot (Kean and Hamilton, Report 353). Among a certain set of career law enforcement personnel, particularly those active in management and police associations, these missed opportunities were fraught with a sense of personal failure. Yet, in short order, they were to become a source of professional revelation.  The scenarios—Trooper Parkins and Al Hazmi, other encounters in other states, the general fact that there had been chance meetings between police officers and the hijackers—were re-imagined in the aftermath of 9/11. Those moments were returned to and reversed, so that multiple potentialities could be seen, beyond or in addition to what had taken place. The deputy director of an intelligence fusion centre told me in an interview, “it is always a local cop who saw something” and he replayed how the incidents of contact had unfolded with the men. These scenarios offered a way to recapture the past. In the uncertainty of every encounter, whether a traffic stop or questioning someone taking photos of a landmark (and potential terrorist target), was also potential.  Through a process of re-imagining, police encounters with the public became part of the government’s “national intelligence” strategy. Previously a division had been marked between foreign and domestic intelligence. While the phrase “national intelligence” had long been used, notably in National Intelligence Estimates, after 9/11 it became more significant. The overall director of the US intelligence community became the Director National Intelligence, for instance, and the cohesive term marked the way that increasingly diverse institutional components, types of data and forms of action were evolving to address the collection of data and intelligence production (McConnell). In a series of working groups mobilised by members of major police professional organisations, and funded by the US Department of Justice, career officers and representatives from federal agencies produced detailed recommendations and plans for involving police in the new Information Sharing Environment. Among the plans drawn up during this period was what would eventually come to be the Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative, built principally around the idea of encounters such as the one between Parkins and Al Hazmi.  Map 1: Map of pilot sites in the Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting Evaluation Environment in 2010 (courtesy of the author; no longer available online).   Map 2: Map of participating sites in the Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative, as of 2014. In an interview, a fusion centre director who participated in this planning as well as its implementation, told me that his thought had been, “if we train state and local cops to understand pre-terrorism indicators, if we train them to be more curious, and to question more what they see,” this could feed into “a system where they could actually get that information to somebody where it matters.”   In devising the reporting initiative, the working groups counter-actualised the scenarios of those encounters, and the kinds of larger plots to which they were understood to belong, in order to extract a set of concepts: categories of suspicious “activities” or “patterns of behaviour” corresponding to the phases of a terrorism event in the process of becoming (Deleuze, Negotiations). This conceptualisation of terrorism was standardised, so that it could be taught, and applied, in discerning and documenting the incidents comprising an event’s phases.  In police officer training, the various suspicious behaviours were called “terrorism precursor activities” and were divided between criminal and non-criminal. “Functional Standards,” developed by the Los Angeles Police Department and then tested by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), served to code the observed behaviours for sharing (via compatible communication protocols) up the federal hierarchy and also horizontally between states and regions. In the popular parlance of videos made for the public by local police departments and DHS, which would come to populate the internet within a few years, these categories were “signs of terrorism,” more specifically: surveillance, eliciting information, testing security, and so on.    Image 3: “The Seven Signs of Terrorism (sometimes eight).” CC BY-SA 4.0 2015 by author, using materials in the public domain. If the problem of 9/11 had been that the men who would become hijackers had gone unnoticed, the basic idea of the Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative was to create a mechanism through which the eyes and ears of everyone could contribute to their detection. In this vein, “If You See Something, Say Something™” was a campaign that originated with the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and was then licensed for use to DHS. The tips and leads such campaigns generated, together with the reports from officers on suspicious incidents that might have to do with terrorism, were coordinated in the Information Sharing Environment. Drawing on reports thus generated, the Federal Government would, in theory, communicate timely information on security threats to law enforcement so that they would be better able to discern the incidents to be reported. The cycle aimed to catch events in emergence, in a distinctively anticipatory strategy of counterterrorism (Stalcup). Re-imagination A curious fact emerges from this history, and it is key to understanding how this  initiative developed. That is, there was nothing suspicious in the encounters. The soon-to-be terrorists’ licenses were up-to-date, the cars were legal, they were not nervous. Even Mohamed Atta’s warrant would have resulted in nothing more than a fine. It is not self-evident, given these facts, how a governmental technology came to be designed from these scenarios. How––if nothing seemed of immediate concern, if there had been nothing suspicious to discern––did an intelligence strategy come to be assembled around such encounters? Evidently, strident demands were made after the events of 9/11 to know, “what went wrong?” Policies were crafted and implemented according to the answers given: it was too easy to obtain identification, or to enter and stay in the country, or to buy airplane tickets and fly. But the trooper’s question, the reader will recall, was somewhat different. He had said, “It’s difficult sometimes to think back and go: ‘What if you had known something else?’” To ask “what if you had known something else?” is also to ask what else might have been.  Janet Roitman shows that identifying a crisis tends to implicate precisely the question of what went wrong. Crisis, and its critique, take up history as a series of right and wrong turns, bad choices made between existing dichotomies (90): liberty-security, security-privacy, ordinary-suspicious. It is to say, what were the possibilities and how could we have selected the correct one? Such questions seek to retrospectively uncover latencies—systemic or structural, human error or a moral lapse (71)—but they ask of those latencies what false understanding of the enemy, of threat, of priorities, allowed a terrible thing to happen.  “What if…?” instead turns to the virtuality hidden in history, through which missed opportunities can be re-imagined. Image 4: “The Cholmondeley Sisters and Their Swaddled Babies.” Anonymous, c. 1600-1610 (British School, 17th century); Deleuze and Parnet (150). CC BY-SA 4.0 2015 by author, using materials in the public domain.  Gilles Deleuze, speaking with Claire Parnet, says, “memory is not an actual image which forms after the object has been perceived, but a virtual image coexisting with the actual perception of the object” (150). Re-imagined scenarios take up the potential of memory, so that as the trooper’s traffic stop was revisited, it also became a way of imagining what else might have been. As Immanuel Kant, among others, points out, “the productive power of imagination is […] not exactly creative, for it is not capable of producing a sense representation that was never given to our faculty of sense; one can always furnish evidence of the material of its ideas” (61). The “memory” of these encounters provided the material for re-imagining them, and thereby re-virtualising history.   This was different than other governmental responses, such as examining past events in order to assess the probable risk of their repetition, or drawing on past events to imagine future scenarios, for use in exercises that identify vulnerabilities and remedy deficiencies (Anderson). Re-imagining scenarios of police-hijacker encounters through the question of “what if?” evoked what Erin Manning calls “a certain array of recognizable elastic points” (39), through which options for other movements were invented. The Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative’s architects instrumentalised such moments as they designed new governmental entities and programs to anticipate terrorism.  For each element of the encounter, an aspect of the initiative was developed: training, functional standards, a way to (hypothetically) get real-time information about threats. Suspicion was identified as a key affect, one which, if cultivated, could offer a way to effectively deal not with binary right or wrong possibilities, but with the potential which lies nestled in uncertainty. The “signs of terrorism” (that is, categories of  “terrorism precursor activities”) served to maximise receptivity to encounters. Indeed, it can apparently create an oversensitivity, manifested, for example, in police surveillance of innocent people exercising their right to assemble (Madigan), or the confiscation of photographers’s equipment (Simon).  “What went wrong?” and “what if?” were different interrogations of the same pre-9/11 incidents. The questions are of course intimately related. Moments where something went wrong are when one is likely to ask, what else might have been known? Moreover, what else might have been? The answers to each question informed and shaped the other, as re-imagined scenarios became the means of extracting categories of suspicious activities and patterns of behaviour that comprise the phases of an event in becoming.  Conclusion The 9/11 Commission, after two years of investigation into the causes of the disastrous day, reported that “the most important failure was one of imagination” (Kean and Hamilton, Summary). The iconic images of 9/11––such as airplanes being flown into symbols of American power––already existed, in guises ranging from fictive thrillers to the infamous FBI field memo sent to headquarters on Arab men learning to fly, but not land. In 1974 there had already been an actual (failed) attempt to steal a plane and kill the president by crashing it into the White House (Kean and Hamilton, Report Ch11 n21). The threats had been imagined, as Pat O’Malley and Philip Bougen put it, but not how to govern them, and because the ways to address those threats had been not imagined, they were discounted as matters for intervention (29).  O’Malley and Bougen argue that one effect of 9/11, and the general rise of incalculable insecurities, was to make it necessary for the “merely imaginable” to become governable. Images of threats from the mundane to the extreme had to be conjured, and then imagination applied again, to devise ways to render them amenable to calculation, minimisation or elimination. In the words of the 9/11 Commission, the Government must bureaucratise imagination.  There is a sense in which this led to more of the same. Re-imagining the early encounters reinforced expectations for officers to do what they already do, that is, to be on the lookout for suspicious behaviours. Yet, the images of threat brought forth, in their mixing of memory and an elastic “almost,” generated their own momentum and distinctive demands. Existing capacities, such as suspicion, were re-shaped and elaborated into specific forms of security governance. The question of “what if?” and the scenarios of police-hijacker encounter were particularly potent equipment for this re-imagining of history and its re-virtualisation.  References Anderson, Ben. “Preemption, Precaution, Preparedness: Anticipatory Action and Future Geographies.” Progress in Human Geography 34.6 (2010): 777-98.

Our interviews revealed that young adults do understand and care about the potential risks associated with disclosing information online and engage in at least some privacy-protective behaviors on social media. However, they feel that once information is shared, it is ultimately out of their control. They attribute this to the opaque practices of institutions, the technological affordances of social media, and the concept of networked privacy, which acknowledges that individuals exist in social contexts where others can and do violate their privacy.","",""

In contrast, this article elaborates on communication privacy management theory in the context of network hospitality based on an interview study of how multiperson households regulate access to their domestic sphere as they welcome visitors via Couchsurfing, an online hospitality exchange service. The findings depict how multiperson households (1) establish privacy rules related to hosting, (2) cooperate to control interior and exterior privacy boundaries, and (3) manage privacy with the help of physical and temporal boundaries. The study contributes to communication privacy management theory by applying it to the study of network hospitality and providing insight into how privacy management unfolds as a cooperative process within multiperson households in settings where networked media are used to arrange social encounters that raise questions of physical space and territoriality.","",""
"2016","Data Localization and the Role of Infrastructure for Surveillance, Privacy, and Security","Due to the increased awareness of the politics embedded in Internet technologies, there has been a growing tendency for state and nonstate actors around the world to leverage Internet infrastructure configurations to attain various political and economic objectives. Governments push for infrastructure modifications in pursuit of economic development, data privacy and security, and law enforcement and surveillance effectiveness. Information intermediaries set and enact their infrastructure to maximize revenue by enabling data collection and analytics, but have the capacity to implement tools for protecting privacy and limiting government surveillance. Relying on a conceptual framework of the politics of infrastructure, this article explores tensions and competing interests that emerge around intermediaries’ technical and policy infrastructure through analysis of (a) data localization strategies in a number of countries and (b) privacy and security undertakings by information intermediaries.","",""

"2016","Lightweight Biometric Key Agreement Scheme for Secure Body Sensor Networks","A biometric sensor device is the potential product of the forthcoming biotechnology for real-time tracking of physiological signals to support various healthcare and medical services such as homecare medical service, prevention, diagnosis, and follow-up services. A key agreement scheme between biometric sensor devices is a fundamental requirement to support the security of the healthcare and medical services. Existing key agreement schemes employ high computational cryptography mechanisms or share a pre-deployed key among biometric sensor devices. Due to stringent constraints of hardware capability, it is inadequate to use public cryptography mechanisms for biometric sensor devices. Moreover, it is also inappropriate to install a fixed secret key in implanted devices because, if the key is revealed, a person will have inevitable transplantation surgery for the secret redistribution. In this paper, we propose new lightweight key agreement scheme which requires only symmetric cryptosystem without a pre-deployed secret information for biometric sensor devices.","",""
"2016","The borders, they are a-changin'! The emergence of socio-digital borders in the EU","Relying on big data, modern surveillance becomes increasingly influential in determining societal power relations. Lyon argues that modern surveillance always categorises people entailing social effects, what he conceptualises as social sorting. This paper assesses if patterns of social sorting can be found in the EU surveillance systems for migration Schengen Information System (SIS), Visa Information System (VIS) and EUROpean DACtylographic comparison system (EURODAC), which are planned to be merged in order to ensure maximum efficiency in surveillance. To do so, the paper analyses relevant documents referring to SIS, VIS and EURODAC. These systems have assumed the traditional border function of deciding on societal inclusion and exclusion. I argue that, to some extent, socio-digital borders are drawn along the categories established through social sorting. The paper exemplifies how social sorting relying on big data may be a disempowering surveillance practice.","",""

Discussions in this paper complement existing studies on the implementation of privacy principles stipulated in Fair Information Practices (FIPs) by enhancing understanding about the role of information intermediaries in defining privacy conditions of users within self-regulation.","",""
"2016","The politics of surveillance policy: UK regulatory dynamics after Snowden","The revelations by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden have illustrated the scale and extent of digital surveillance carried out by different security and intelligence agencies. The publications have led to a variety of concerns, public debate, and some diplomatic fallout regarding the legality of the surveillance, the extent of state interference in civic life, and the protection of civil rights in the context of security. Debates about the policy environment of surveillance emerged quickly after the leaks began, but actual policy change is only starting. In the UK, a draft law (Investigatory Powers Bill) has been proposed and is currently discussed. In this paper, we will trace the forces and dynamics that have shaped this particular policy response. Addressing surveillance policy as a site of struggle between different social forces and drawing on different fields across communication policy research, we suggest eight dynamics that, often in conflicting ways, have shaped the regulatory framework of surveillance policy in the UK since the Snowden leaks. These include the governmental context; national and international norms; court rulings; civil society advocacy; technical standards; private sector interventions; media coverage; and public opinion. We investigate how state surveillance has been met with criticism by parts of the technology industry and civil society, and that policy change was required as a result of legal challenges, review commissions and normative interventions. However a combination of specific government compositions, the strong role of security agendas and discourses, media justification and a muted reaction by the public have hindered a more fundamental review of surveillance practices so far and have moved policy debate towards the expansion, rather than the restriction, of surveillance in the aftermath of Snowden.","",""

Examples include untrustworthy hotel and workplace thermostats, digital applications to spy on workers and family members, and commercial and law-enforcement systems that surreptitiously collect mobile phone data. Rather than view such cases as exceptional, I argue that deceptive communication systems are hidden articulations of normal technological orders. If deception in itself is not the primary problem with such systems, then transparency alone cannot be the solution. As troubling as institutional opacity might be, an analysis of deceptive systems reveals more fundamental problems: imbalances in power and widespread acquiescence to corporate and state efforts to control individuals, groups, and their data. By moving beyond a quest for (or belief in) technological veracity, scholars could redirect attention to power inequalities and the pressing question of how to live together ethically.","",""

By gathering information about students as they navigate information systems, learning analytics employs techniques to understand student behaviors and to improve instructional, curricular, and support resources and learning environments. However, learning analytics presents important moral and policy issues surrounding student privacy. We argue that there are five crucial questions about student privacy that we must address in order to ensure that whatever the laudable goals and gains of learning analytics, they are commensurate with respecting students' privacy and associated rights, including (but not limited to) autonomy interests. We address information access concerns, the intrusive nature of information-gathering practices, whether or not learning analytics is justified given the potential distribution of consequences and benefits, and issues related to student autonomy. Finally, we question whether learning analytics advances the aims of higher education or runs counter to those goals.","",""

We need to shift our thinking from definitions of privacy (characteristics of privacy) to models of privacy (how privacy works). Moreover, in addition to the existing models of privacy—the surveillance model and capture model—we need to also consider a new model: the datafication model presented in this article, wherein new personal information is deduced by employing predictive analytics on already-gathered data. These three models of privacy supplement each other; they are not competing understandings of privacy. This broadened approach will take our thinking beyond current preoccupation with whether or not individuals’ consent was secured for data collection to privacy issues arising from the development of new information on individuals' likely behavior through analysis of already collected data—this new information can violate privacy but does not call for consent.","",""
"2016","Putting mobile application privacy in context: An empirical study of user privacy expectations for mobile devices","ABSTRACT Users increasingly use mobile devices to engage in social activity and commerce, enabling new forms of data collection by firms and marketers. User privacy expectations for these new forms of data collection remain unclear. A particularly difficult challenge is meeting expectations for contextual integrity, as user privacy expectations vary depending upon data type collected and context of use. This article illustrates how fine-grained, contextual privacy expectations can be measured. It presents findings from a factorial vignette survey that measured the impact of diverse real-world contexts (e.g., medical, navigation, music), data types, and data uses on user privacy expectations. Results demonstrate that individuals’ general privacy preferences are of limited significance for predicting their privacy judgments in specific scenarios. Instead, the results present a nuanced portrait of the relative importance of particular contextual factors and information uses, and demonstrate how those contextual factors can be found and measured. The results also suggest that current common activities of mobile application companies, such as harvesting and reusing location data, images, and contact lists, do not meet users’ privacy expectations. Understanding how user privacy expectations vary according to context, data types, and data uses highlights areas requiring stricter privacy protections by governments and industry.","",""

The problem is framed as the replacement of targeted surveillance with mass surveillance programs, and the solutions put forward are predominantly technical and involve the use of encryption – or ‘crypto’ – as a defense mechanism. The counter-surveillance movement is timely and deserves widespread support. However, as this article will argue and illustrate, raising the specter of an Orwellian system of mass surveillance, shifting the discussion to the technical domain, and couching that shift in economic terms undermine a political reading that would attend to the racial, gendered, classed, and colonial aspects of the surveillance programs. Our question is as follows: how can this specific discursive framing of counter-surveillance be re-politicized and broadened to enable a wider societal debate informed by the experiences of those subjected to targeted surveillance and associated state violence?

"2016","Group Privacy in Times of Big Data. A Literature Review","Abstract                 New technologies pose new challenges on the protection of privacy and they stimulate new debates on the scope of privacy. Such debates usually concern the individuals’ right to control the flow of his or her personal information. The article however discusses new challenges posed by new technologies in terms of their impact on groups and their privacy. Two main challenges are being identified in this regard, both having to do with the formation of groups through the involvement of algorithms and the lack of civil awareness regarding the consequences of this involvement. On the one hand, there is the phenomenon of groups being created on the basis of big data without the members of such groups being aware of having been assigned and being treated as part of a certain group. Here, the challenge concerns the limits of personal law, manifesting with the disability of individuals to address possible violations of their right to privacy since they are not aware of them. On the other hand, commercially driven Websites influence the way in which groups form, grow and communicate when doing this online and they do this in such subtle way, that members oftentimes do not take into account this influence. This is why one could speak of a kind of domination here, which calls for legal regulation. The article presents different approaches addressing and dealing with those two challenges, discussing their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, a conclusion gathers the insights reached by the different approaches discussed and reflects on future challenges for further research on group privacy in times of big data.","",""

It provides a commentary on the ability of sousveillance to destabilise and disrupt suer/violence by shifting its focus from the centre to the periphery, where Big Data surveillance is tantamount to sur/violence. In these peripheral political spaces, surveillance is not framed by concerns over privacy, democracy and civil society; rather, it is a matter of life and death, a technique of both biopolitical and thanatopolitical power. I argue that the universalist, and universalizing, debates over surveillance cannot be mapped through the anxieties of privileged middle classes as they would neither transcend nor make possible alternative ways of tackling the intersection of surveillance and violence so long as they are couched in the liberal concerns for democracy. I call this phenomenon “liberal luxury,” whereby debates over surveillance have over-emphasised liberal proclivities at the expense of disengaging those peripheral populations most severely affected by sur/violence.

"2016","The unlikely encounter between von Foerster and Snowden: When second-order cybernetics sheds light on societal impacts of Big Data"," Although information and communication technologies (ICT) have created hope for a shared pluralistic world, democratic principles are far from being respected in the public digital environment, and require a detailed knowledge of the laws by which they are governed. Von Foerster's conjecture is one of the early theoretical results that could help to understand these laws. Although neglected for a long time, the advent of the overlying layer of recommendation and ranking systems which is progressively occupying the web has given empirical evidences of this conjecture, which predicts the consequences of increasing inter-individual influences on social dynamics and the susceptibility of these latter to manipulation. With both von Foerster's conjecture and the Snowden revelations in the background, we analyse the impact of ICT on human societies and their governance, in view of the fact that they have a massive impact on the way in which people influence each other in their tastes and actions.

We highlight the possibility that this type of sensitive civic data can be investigated and employed within local communities through creative practice. Community involvement with data can create a countervailing force to powerful dominant narratives and supplement activist projects that hold local officials accountable for their actions. Our analysis examines four Los Angeles County police officer-involved homicide data sets. First, we provide accounts of the semantics, granularity, scale and transparency of this local data. Then, we describe a “counter data action,” an event that invited members of the community to identify the limits and challenges present in police officer-involved homicide data and to propose new methods for deriving meaning from these indicators and statistics.

The impact of legislative and structural attempts of surveillance on investigative journalism"," If we accept that surveillance by the State and ‘sousveillance’ by the media in Western democracies tend towards a relative equilibrium, or ‘equiveillance’ supported by the function of journalism as a watchdog and that the rule of law largely protects fundamental freedoms, this paper argues that the act of ‘mutual watching’ is undesired by the State and comes at a very high cost to journalists. The combination of technological capacity, legislative change and antidemocratic sentiments of the State, in the context of its willingness and ability to collect and process Big Data on an unprecedented scale, disrupt the preconditions for a strong democracy based on free media and free citizens. This paper examines the politics of investigative journalism under the conditions of dominance of the State by investigating the experiences of journalists with surveillance. Our interviews with 48 journalists show that journalists are acutely aware of surveillance and its noxious impact. Well beyond simple ‘watching’ these experiences are remarkably similar in non-Western and Western countries. Journalists are engaging increasingly with technological and other communities, as they aim to defend journalism and their lives. Their activism is operationalised in three areas: (a) in reluctant often-fraught cooperation with hacktivists, (b) in self-directed protection of communications and sources and (c) in not always willingly acting as dissenters vis-a-vis the State. This paper explores the extent to which journalists consider equilibrium to be distorted, and how they are countering any slide into subdued democracy. ","",""

A work-in-development since April 2015, the Archive-in-a-Box is both a research tool and a tool for public education on data surveillance.

When it is turned on, anybody in the vicinity can access the archive by connecting their wireless device to the Snowden Archive WiFi network and browsing to a website. Open the briefcase up and one finds a wood panel with a flatscreen inset, playing back the IP traffic of the archive's current users. Thus, while an audience such as a class of students or workshop group can access the Snowden documents and learn about mass surveillance from primary materials, they are also shown what data surveillance ‘looks like’.

"2016","Towards data justice? The ambiguity of anti-surveillance resistance in political activism"," The Snowden leaks, first published in June 2013, provided unprecedented insights into the operations of state-corporate surveillance, highlighting the extent to which everyday communication is integrated into an extensive regime of control that relies on the ‘datafication’ of social life. Whilst such data-driven forms of governance have significant implications for citizenship and society, resistance to surveillance in the wake of the Snowden leaks has predominantly centred on techno-legal responses relating to the development and use of encryption and policy advocacy around privacy and data protection. Based on in-depth interviews with a range of social justice activists, we argue that there is a significant level of ambiguity around this kind of anti-surveillance resistance in relation to broader activist practices, and critical responses to the Snowden leaks have been confined within particular expert communities. Introducing the notion of ‘data justice’, we therefore go on to make the case that resistance to surveillance needs to be (re)conceptualized on terms that can address the implications of this data-driven form of governance in relation to broader social justice agendas. Such an approach is needed, we suggest, in light of a shift to surveillance capitalism in which the collection, use and analysis of our data increasingly comes to shape the opportunities and possibilities available to us and the kind of society we live in.

I have rationalised state-sponsored street cameras as a component in the cultivation of consent between the state and local communities; a mechanism for government to facilitate the flow of public funds to business through arrangements that are virtually unchecked and non-evidence based; a mechanism for government to facilitate profitable opportunities in and beyond the security technologies industry; and, a mechanism to normalise hegemonic social and political relations at the level of discourse. This article explores how government has assisted growth in the security industry in Australia. I draw on a case study about Kiama Municipal Council’s decision in 2014 to accept funding from the Abbott Government to install CCTV cameras through the Safer Streets Programme. This is despite historically low crime rates in Kiama and an inability to demonstrate broad support for the programme in the local community. This study reveals how politicians have cultivated support for CCTV at the local level and pressured councils to install these systems despite a lack of evidence they reduce, deter or prevent crime. Examined is how the footage captured on local council CCTV has been distributed and its meanings mediated by political and commercial groups. I argue that the politics of CCTV dissemination in Australia is entwined with the imperatives of electoral success and commercial opportunity—a coalescent relationship evident in the Safer Streets Programme. Furthermore, the efficacy of CCTV as an electoral tool in Australia is explained via the proposition that street cameras perform a central role in the discourses and political economy of the state.","",""

Empirically I draw from data on the organizations involved in border surveillance funded by the European Union’s FP7-Security programme. Based on the novel conceptualization of SDCs, coupled with an analysis of new network data, the article demonstrates that important contributions to the design of surveillance are distributed among a small core of central organizations surrounded by communities of actors assembled in overlapping hierarchies. Hence, SDCs are interwoven, multiscalar networks of networks rather than simply a total ‘complex’ or sites for the overlap of the ‘public’ and ‘private’. ","",""

Yet despite the complete disclosure of Elahi’s personal information in this format, Tracking Transience aims to enact a resistive posture to recent developments in digital surveillance. Rather than uphold claims to privacy, Elahi negotiates his security through the release of his personal information. Paradoxically, he voluntarily forgoes his privacy in order to feel more secure. His form of resistance then registers his project of self-surveillance as a performance of transparency. He turns the normative flow of power in digital surveillance into a new critical posture, wherein the artist becomes anonymous to surveillance systems and is able to maintain comfortable levels of security without typical recourse to privacy. And it is precisely this mode of anonymity that Elahi argues is able to produce a mode of resistance to surveillance, one in which the artist participates with digital surveillance in order to avoid it.  By tracing the methodologies that generate data on Elahi’s activity, this paper will speculate on how creative interventions can effect resistive strategies against surveillance systems by moving beyond the historical limits of privacy into the outer reaches of anonymity in our contemporary age of transparency.","",""

The article explores the vernacularization—the process of making things mundane, everyday, unremarkable—of ideas about authenticity and performing, and the implications when it comes to race issues, which are animated in contexts of surveillance, but exceed these and are apparent in contexts not under surveillance. Through a critical examination of Taylor Swift’s video “Shake it off,” and Miley Cyrus’s video “We Can’t Stop,” the author argues self-reflexivity marks their performing behavior as distinct from their authentic self, reassuring audiences there is an authentic (white) self under the performance. This authentic self is presented as stable, a core identity most naturally enacted by white bodies, brought into relief by performing otherness.  ","",""

Like earlier Western technologies and techniques of government that were ‘tested out’ in foreign warzones and then ‘brought back’ to urban centres (the helicopter and its utilization in Vietnam and its return to urban police forces is a clear illustration hereof), contemporary unmanned aerial vehicles hold the potential to act as proverbial ‘Foucauldian boomerangs’ and return from warzones in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan to Western cities. The paper explores how a nexus of Surveillance Studies and mobilities research may be a fruitful way into comprehending this new phenomenon.

"2016","Performing, Translating, Fashioning: Spectatorship in the Surveillant World","Despite the disciplinary power of surveillance, I argue artistic performances may also provide a space of resistance and self-fashioning. Discussions on artistic performance emphasize the ambivalence and uncertainty of art to resist existing power structures and create alternative meaning. However, how concretely, and when, do artistic performances challenge these structures often remains uncertain. Their popularity does not guarantee the depth of their engagement with surveillance practices, and apparent resistance may hide unconscious cooptation and blatant reproduction of existing inequalities and power structures. To understand the political effect of artistic performances, I argue one needs to look at how they participate to the redefinition of individual and collective selves. This must include attention to spectatorship as a different category from state and corporate surveillance. Spectators engage with performers, reinforce or deny their claim to self-fashioning. By looking at spectators one can better understand how a performance can be (or fail to be) self-fashioning not only for the performer but also collectively for the spectators.","",""

This paper investigates the effects of the post-9/11 surveillance surge on state and local policing. It presents original research on interagency intelligence centers New York and New Jersey and deploys Pfaffenberger’s “technological drama” as a process animating the neoliberal constitution of what Bourdieu calls the “bureaucratic field.” Despite seemingly dramatic changes, there exists powerful continuity in the profession of policing. Before or after Snowden, the day-to-day reality of criminal intelligence remains shaped by the immediate demands of investigations and the small politics of interagency rivalries, insulating policing from dramatic reforms and swift change. What reformers see as dysfunction is better understood as a technological drama in the bureaucratic field that paradoxically provides a degree of autonomy and slows the pace of change.  This paper builds on and contributes to the tendency within surveillance studies that emphasizes the ways in which human agents and organizational cultures mediate surveillance.","",""

Residents use the equipment in their daily lives in places where they are both operators and targets of these systems. Thus far, the concrete practices of these systems use or the users’ feelings towards them have not been investigated. This article sets out to examine the surveillance produced with home surveillance systems and the meanings and implications of that surveillance to the resident.The data consist of 13 interviews conducted in Finland with people who have installed surveillance systems in their homes. Through qualitative content analysis of the interviews, this article argues that five types of surveillance is produced with these systems. The first two types are comparable to traditional understanding of surveillance motivated by control and care. Besides these two, the equipment is used for recreational and communicational surveillance which are motivated by more playful purposes. The fifth type of surveillance analyzed here is ‘sincere’ surveillance. Domestic surveillance is sincere in the sense that the residents consider it, along with their motives for conducting it, innocent. The users as overseers wish to separate themselves from voyeurs.This article offers important insight into the everyday life practices of surveillance and expands our previous understanding of domestic surveillance. The surveillance produced with home surveillance systems needs to be understood more broadly than in mere control-care-setting. The playful and entertaining usages of the systems, however, do not remove the ambiguities of domestic surveillance. ","",""
"2016","Performing Diabetes: Surveillance and Self-Management","Sustaining the diabetic body involves visible practices of expert self-management: injecting insulin and testing blood sugar levels. Drawing form qualitative interviews I consider how people with diabetes manage the visibility of these practices relative to space. For many, the practices of diabetes are configured as ‘to be hidden’, and micro-spatial strategies are frequently deployed to conceal injections and tests from possible observing others. Diabetes then, is often a performance, one influenced by the performativity in space and place in which bodies are felt to be monitored. People with diabetes internalise self-disciplinary practices – keeping their diabetes discreet – especially in public. In this paper I contend that because of this performed discretion of diabetes self-management practices, there is a barrier to knowing diabetic bodies and lifeworlds. I suggest that, through increasing awareness of this subtle performance and surveillance, people with diabetes may feel less restricted in their self-management when in public space.","",""
"2016","Camera-friendly Policing: How the Police Respond to Cameras and Photographers","How do police respond to the presence of cameras and photographers? Many speculative theories have been proposed offering mixed and sometimes contradictory answers to this question. Some theories propose that cameras will deter police misconduct, others suggest that cameras might improve police accountability, others suggest that police might respond to cameras by engaging in a risk-averse style of policing. Unfortunately, little empirical data is available to assess these theories. Drawing on data from a participant-observation research study conducted in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, this paper helps fill this gap in research and argues that police might be learning to adapt to cameras by engaging in what I call camera-friendly policing. This style of policing involves efforts to control how the police are perceived by photographers, and how they will be perceived by viewers of any recorded footage. In this paper, I outline the basic elements of the police’s camera-friendly tactics, and discuss the implications of these tactics for contemporary understandings of police visibility.  ","",""
"2016","Beyond data as representation: The performativity of Big Data in surveillance","The article discusses problems of representative views of data and elaborates a concept of the performativity of data. It shows how data used for surveillance contributes in creating suspect subjectivities. In particular, the article focuses on the inductive or explorative processing of data and on the decoupling of data generation and analysis that characterize current use of data for surveillance. It lines out several challenges this poses to established accounts of surveillance: David Lyon’s concept of surveillance as social sorting and Haggerty and Ericson’s “surveillant assemblage”. These problems are attributed to a representationalist view, which focuses on the veracity of data. This can lead to ignoring problematic consequences of surveillance procedures and the full scope of affected persons. Building on an idea by Rita Raley, an alternative account of data as performative is proposed. Using Judith Butler’s concept of “citationality,” this account shows how surveillance is entangled with the production of subjects through data in general. Surveillance is reformulated as a particular way in which subjects are produced that is parasitical to other forms of subjectivation.","",""

Based on fieldwork in Aotearoa New Zealand during campaigns of resistance against offshore and onshore oil and gas proposals, this note explores how surveillance fears impact the public gatherings and information-sharing of citizen-activists and how the researcher may fail to ensure participant confidence and confidentiality, thereby becoming the researched and documented as well. The actions and commitments of both parties, the citizen-activist and the researcher of grassroots and social movements, may be strengthened or impeded by the degree of expected, though rarely verified, political and economic surveillance.","",""

The privacy policies it creates are legally compliant and easy to understand. We developed this system because small Australian organisations seemed to find privacy policies too complicated to manage with the resources they have available.This paper describes the framework behind Simple Privacy and discusses the choices that we made during development. These choices balance the requirements of the privacy legislation and the needs of both organisations and customers.","",""

This paper builds upon Mann’s new work on veillance, which is defined as watching from above (surveillance), watching from below (sousveillance), watching data (dataveillance), and watching everything (uberveillance) (Mann, 2013; Mann and Ferenbok, 2013). This paper expounds upon veillance to include watching each other (coveillance), watching one’s self (self-surveillance), and the umbrella concept of webveillance (watching of and on the Internet). We argue that these forms of veillance, as conducted through self-management programs, techniques, and technologies, affect the relationship between patients and clinicians, transform the allocation of medical responsibilities, alter the architecture of healthcare, and expand the places in which healthcare is performed. This has significant implications on online activities of patients and clinicians, as well as how and by whom healthcare is conducted in the doctor’s office, the home, and public spaces.","",""

We describe a solution to this problem in the form of a secure procedure for data mapping and/or linkage, which allows to identify the correspondence between entities in a distributed dataset. In contrast to existing methods this solution does not require either a trusted or semi-trusted third party, while being simple, efficient and scalable for both large datasets and number of parties.","",""
"2016","Incoded counter-conduct: What the incarcerated can teach us about resisting mass surveillance","This paper reviews penal history in order to consider forms of resistance to mass surveillance. Because experiences of surveillance are endemic to incarcerated life, identifying tactics of protest among these populations provides valuable insights for potential forms of counter-conduct in other circumstances of ubiquitous monitoring. We introduce the term incodification as a means of describing conditions of continuous surveillance ingrained into infrastructures of everyday life, even as these conditions give rise to tactics of resistance. We focus on three forms of protest: hunger strikes, alternate communication networks and viral dance videos, drawing on Foucault’s theory of askesis in order to develop our understanding of incodification. Our objective in introducing this term, and with our analysis as a whole, is to provoke and promote theoretical and activist projects that both address and subvert infrastructures of incodification.","",""
"2016","Lurkers, creepers, and virtuous interactivity: From property rights to consent and care as a conceptual basis for privacy concerns and information ethics","Exchange of personal information online is usually conceptualized according to an economic model that treats personal information as data owned by the persons these data are ‘about.’ This leads to a distinct set of concerns having to do with data ownership, data mining, profits, and exploitation, which do not closely correspond to the concerns about privacy that people actually have. A post-phenomenological perspective, oriented by feminist ethics of care, urges us to figure out how privacy concerns arrive in fundamentally human contexts and to speak to that, rather than trying to convince people to care about privacy as it is juridically conceived and articulated. By considering exchanges of personal information in a human-to-human online informational economy — being friends on social networking sites — we can identify an alternate set of concerns: consent, respect, lurking, and creepiness. I argue that these concerns will provide a better guide to both users and companies about prudence and ethics in information economies than the existing discourse around ‘privacy.’","",""
"2016","‘Y’all need to hide your kids, hide your wife’: Mobile applications, risk and sex offender databases"," This article reflects upon recent developments in sex offender tracking and monitoring. Taking as its focus a suite of mobile applications available for use in the United States, the author explores the impact and consequences of remediating the data held by State offender databases. The article charts the recent history of techno-corrections as it applies to this category of criminal, before then undertaking an analysis of current remediation of this legally obtained data. In doing so, the author identifies how the recontextualizing of data serves to (re)negotiate the relationship between the user, the database and registered sex offenders. The author concludes by arguing that the (mobile) mapping of offender databases serves to obscure the original intentions of these recording mechanisms and might hinder their effectiveness in reducing sex offending.

"2016","Corporate management of visibility and the fantasy of the post-political: Social media and surveillance"," This article sheds light on a challenge to the emancipatory potential of social media for social movements that has so far largely been overlooked: corporations’ monitoring of individuals. In this way, it goes beyond the ways in which corporations draw on ‘big data’ from online sources and instead explores how they (1) monitor and (2) discuss strategies for responding to the activities of individual activists, specifically in social media. Theoretically, it draws on Thompson’s concept of mediated visibility, Mouffe’s concept of the (post)political and Carpentier’s notion of the fantasy of the post-political. Empirically, it focuses on the oil industry and the climate justice movement in the United Kingdom. Here, it draws on files from British Petroleum (BP) and Shell on specific individuals obtained through Subject Access Requests under the Data Protection Act as well as press responses from the two oil companies.

"2016","“Honestly, We’re Not Spying on Kids”: School Surveillance of Young People’s Social Media"," Social media is one of the top activities and sites for young people’s socialization in North America, raising concerns over their social privacy, because of reported instances of cyberbullying and sexting, and their informational privacy, because of commercial data collection. A trend in schools and school districts in the United States is to monitor and track, through third party applications and software, student social media during and after school, in an attempt to prevent or reduce the perceived dissemination of violence, bullying, threats, or hate instigated by students and directed toward other students or entire schools. This article will provide an overview of four of these US companies (Geo Listening, Varsity Monitor, Snaptrends, Digital Fly) and consider the policy and ethical issues of data monitoring with respect to young people’s rights to privacy and their freedom of speech.

"2016","Disclosure Management on Social Network Sites: Individual Privacy Perceptions and User-Directed Privacy Strategies"," The social web and specifically social network sites (SNS) have offered new opportunities for interaction and communication, but have also increased the risk of privacy violations. In this study, we investigated how far users imply different disclosure management strategies in status updates and chat conversations. We hypothesized that users perceive specific information as differently private depending on their personal privacy preference, but generally show the same disclosure management pattern: the higher the perceived privacy level of an information, the less frequently it will be shared. We tested the hypothesis using an online survey with 316 German SNS users. The findings suggest that respondents engaged in disclosure management taking both communication channel and type of information into account. We further found that trust toward SNS contacts and use of privacy settings significantly influenced disclosure management in one-to-many (status updates) but not in one-to-one communications situations (chat conversations). The results complement existing research by showing the pivotal role of individual privacy perceptions in explaining users’ privacy management in the social web. ","",""
"2016","Athenian University Students on Facebook and Privacy: A Fair “Trade-Off ”?"," This article explores how Athenian university students “manage” their privacy on Facebook while socially interacting with other users. Survey data of undergraduate students in Athens reveal that the social network site use “validates” and enhances the pre-existing social context and that the relationship level has an impact on the way users contact other users on it. We find that Facebook users feel that they are able to use most of the privacy settings to protect their personal data. Yet, they are concerned about the disclosure of their personal information which is perceived to be their primary responsibility. Despite these concerns, they appear to feel in control of their privacy through the abilities they are offered by the social networking site (SNS). We also argue that even if they realize that they are disclosing their personal information, this doesn’t cause a great deal of insecurity. ","",""
"2017","Building a Professional Profile: Charles Dickens and the Rise of the “Detective Force”","IntroductionAccounts of criminals, their victims, and their pursuers have become entrenched within the sphere of popular culture; most obviously in the genres of true crime and crime fiction. The centrality of the pursuer in the form of the detective, within these stories, dates back to the nineteenth century. This, often highly-stylised and regularly humanised protagonist, is now a firm feature of both factual and fictional accounts of crime narratives that, today, regularly focus on the energies of the detective in solving a variety of cases. So familiar is the figure of the detective, it seems that these men and women—amateurs and professionals—have always had an important role to play in the pursuit and punishment of the wrongdoer. Yet, the first detectives were forced to overcome significant resistance from a suspicious public. Some early efforts to reimagine punishment and to laud the detective include articles written by Charles Dickens; pieces on public hangings and policing that reflect the great Victorian novelist’s commitment to shed light on, through written commentaries, a range of important social issues. This article explores some of Dickens’s lesser-known pieces, that—appearing in daily newspapers and in one of his own publications Household Words—helped to change some common perceptions of punishment and policing. Image 1: Harper's Magazine 7 December 1867 (Charles Dickens Reading, by Charles A. Barry).

It would be almost another three decades before Henry Fielding established the Bow Street Foot Patrol, or Bow Street Runners, in 1749, “six men in blue coats, patrolling the area within six miles of Charing Cross” (Worsley 35). A large-scale, formalised police force was attempted by Pitt the Younger in 1785 with his “Bill for the Further prevention of Crime and for the more Speedy Detection and Punishment of Offenders against the Peace” (Lyman 144). The proposed legislation was withdrawn due to fierce opposition that was underpinned by fears, held by officials, of a divestment of power to a new body of law enforcers (Lyman 144).The type of force offered in 1785 would not be realised until the next century, when the work of Robert Peel saw the passing of the Metropolitan Police Act 1829. The Police Act, which “constituted a revolution in traditional methods of law enforcement” (Lyman 141), was focused on the prevention of crime, “to reassure the lawful and discourage the wrongdoer” (Hitchens 51). Until these changes were implemented violent punishment, through the Waltham Black Act 1723, remained firmly in place (Cruickshanks and Erskine-Hill 359) as part of the state’s arsenal against crime (Pepper 473).The Black Act, legislation often referred to as the ‘Bloody Code’ as it took the number of capital felonies to over 350 (Pepper 473), served in lieu of consistency and cooperation, across the country, in relation to the safekeeping of the citizenry. This situation inevitably led to anxieties about crime and crime control. In 1797 Patrick Colquhoun, a magistrate, published A Treatise on the Police of the Metropolis in which he estimated that, out of a city population of just under 1 million, 115,000 men and women supported themselves “in and near the Metropolis by pursuits either criminal-illegal-or immoral” (Lyman 144). Andrew Pepper highlights tensions between “crime, governance and economics” as well as “rampant petty criminality [… and] widespread political corruption” (474). He also notes a range of critical responses to crime and how, “a particular kind of writing about crime in the 1720s demonstrated, perhaps for the first time, an awareness of, or self-consciousness about, this tension between competing visions of the state and state power” (Pepper 474), a tension that remains visible today in modern works of true crime and crime fiction. In Dickens’s day, crime and its consequences were serious legal, moral, and social issues (as, indeed, they are today). An increase in the crime rate, an aggressive state, the lack of formal policing, the growth of the printing industry, and writers offering diverse opinions—from the sympathetic to the retributive—on crime changed crime writing. The public wanted to know about the criminal who had disturbed society and wanted to engage with opinions on how the criminal should be stopped and punished. The public also wanted to be updated on changes to the judicial system such as the passing of the Judgement of Death Act 1823 which drastically reduced the number of capital crimes (Worsley 122) and how the Gaols Act, also of 1823, “moved tentatively towards national prison reform” (Gattrell 579). Crimes continued to be committed and alongside the wrongdoers were readers that wanted to be diverted from everyday events by, but also had a genuine need to be informed about, crime. A demand for true crime tales demonstrating a broader social need for crimes, even the most minor infractions, to be publicly punished: first on the scaffold and then in print. Some cases were presented as sensationalised true crime tales; others would be fictionalised in short stories and novels. Standing Witness: Dickens at the ScaffoldIt is interesting to note that Dickens witnessed at least four executions in his lifetime (Simpson 126). The first was the hanging of a counterfeiter, more specifically a coiner, which in the 1800s was still a form of high treason. The last person executed for coining in England was in early 1829; as Dickens arrived in London at the end of 1822, aged just 10-years-old (Simpson 126-27) he would have been a boy when he joined the crowds around the scaffold. Many journalists and writers who have documented executions have been “criticised for using this spectacle as a source for generating sensational copy” (Simpson 127). Dickens also wrote about public hangings. His most significant commentaries on the issue being two sets of letters: one set published in The Daily News (1846) and a second set published in The Times (1849) (Brandwood 3). Yet, he was immune from the criticism directed at so many other writers, in large part, due to his reputation as a liberal, “social reformer moved by compassion, but also by an antipathy toward waste, bureaucratic incompetence, and above all toward exploitation and injustice” (Simpson 127). As Anthony Simpson points out, Dickens did not sympathise with the condemned: “He wrote as a realist and not a moralist and his lack of sympathy for the criminal was clear, explicit and stated often” (128). Simpson also notes that Dickens’s letters on execution written in 1846 were “strongly supportive of total abolition” while later letters, written in 1849, presented arguments against public executions rather than the practice of execution. In 1859 Dickens argued against pardoning a poisoner. While in 1864 he supported the execution of the railway carriage murderer Franz Müller, explaining he would be glad to abolish both public executions and capital punishment, “if I knew what to do with the Savages of civilisation. As I do not, I would rid Society of them, when they shed blood, in a very solemn manner” (in Simpson 138-39) that is, executions should proceed but should take place in private.Importantly, Dickens was consistently concerned about society’s fascination with the scaffold. In his second letter to The Daily News, Dickens asks: round what other punishment does the like interest gather? We read of the trials of persons who have rendered themselves liable to transportation for life, and we read of their sentences, and, in some few notorious instances, of their departure from this country, and arrival beyond the sea; but they are never followed into their cells, and tracked from day to day, and night to night; they are never reproduced in their false letters, flippant conversations, theological disquisitions with visitors, lay and clerical […]. They are tried, found guilty, punished; and there an end. (“To the Editors of The Daily News” 6)In this passage, Dickens describes an overt curiosity with those criminals destined for the most awful of punishments. A curiosity that was put on vile display when a mob gathered on the concourse to watch a hanging; a sight which Dickens readily admitted “made [his] blood run cold” (“Letter to the Editor” 4).Dickens’s novels are grand stories, many of which feature criminals and criminal sub-plots. There are, for example, numerous criminals, including the infamous Fagin in Oliver Twist; or, The Parish Boy’s Progress (1838); several rioters are condemned to hang in Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of Eighty (1841); there is murder in The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit (1844); and murder, too, in Bleak House (1853). Yet, Dickens never wavered in his revulsion for the public display of the execution as revealed in his “refusal to portray the scene at the scaffold [which] was principled and heartfelt. He came, reluctantly to support capital punishment, but he would never use its application for dramatic effect” (Simpson 141).The Police Detective: A Public Relations ExerciseBy the mid-1700s the crime story was one of “sin to crime and then the gallows” (Rawlings online): “Crimes of every defcription (sic) have their origin in the vicious and immoral habits of the people” (Colquhoun 32). As Philip Rawlings notes, “once sin had been embarked upon, capture and punishment followed” (online). The origins of this can be found in the formula relied upon by Samuel Smith in the seventeenth century. Smith was the Ordinary of Newgate, or prison chaplain (1676–1698), who published Accounts of criminals and their gruesome ends. The outputs swelled the ranks of the already burgeoning market of broadsides, handbills and pamphlets. Accounts included: 1) the sermon delivered as the prisoner awaited execution; 2) a brief overview of the crimes for which the prisoner was being punished; and 3) a reporting of the events that surrounded the execution (Gladfelder 52–53), including the prisoner’s behaviour upon the scaffold and any last words spoken. For modern readers, the detective and the investigation is conspicuously absent. These popular Accounts (1676–1772)—over 400 editions offering over 2,500 criminal biographies—were only a few pence a copy. With print runs in the thousands, the Ordinary earnt up to £200 per year for his efforts (Emsley, Hitchcock, and Shoemaker online). For:penitence and profit made comfortable bedfellows, ensuring true crime writing became a firm feature of the business of publishing. That victims and villains suffered was regrettable but no horror was so terrible anyone forgot there was money to be made. (Franks, “Stealing Stories” 7)As the changes brought about by the Industrial Revolution were having their full impact, many were looking for answers, and certainty, in a period of radical social transformation. Sin as a central motif in crime stories was insufficient: the detective was becoming essential (Franks, “True Crime” 239). “In the nineteenth century, the role of the newly-fashioned detective as an agent of consolation or security is both commercially and ideologically central to the subsequent project of popular crime writing” (Bell 8). This was supported by an “increasing professionalism and proficiency of policemen, detectives, and prosecutors, new understandings about psychology, and advances in forensic science and detection techniques” (Murley 10). Elements now included in most crime narratives. Dickens insisted that the detective was a crucial component of the justice system—a figure to be celebrated, one to take centre stage in the crime story—reflecting his staunch support “of the London Metropolitan Police” (Simpson 140). Indeed, while Dickens is known principally for exposing wretched poverty, he was also interested in a range of legal issues as can be evinced from his writings for Household Words. Image 2: Household Words 27 July 1850 (Front Page). Image credit: Dickens Journals Online. W.H. Wills argued for the acceptance of the superiority of the detective when, in 1850, he outlined the “difference between a regular and a detective policeman” (368). The detective must, he wrote: “counteract every sort of rascal whose only means of existence it avowed rascality, but to clear up mysteries, the investigation of which demands the utmost delicacy and tact” (368). The detective is also extraordinarily efficient; cases are solved quickly, in one example a matter is settled in just “ten minutes” (369).Dickens’s pro-police pieces, included a blatantly promotional, two-part work “A Detective Police Party” (1850). The narrative begins with open criticism of the Bow Street Runners contrasting these “men of very indifferent character” to the Detective Force which is “so well chosen and trained, proceeds so systematically and quietly, does its business in such a workman-like manner, and is always so calmly and steadily engaged in the service of the public” (“Police Party, Part I” 409). The “party” is just that: a gathering of detectives and editorial staff. Men in a “magnificent chamber”, seated at “a round table […] with some glasses and cigars arranged upon it; and the editorial sofa elegantly hemmed in between that stately piece of furniture and the wall” (“Police Party, Part I” 409). Two inspectors and five sergeants are present. Each man prepared to share some of their experiences in the service of Londoners:they are, [Dickens tells us] one and all, respectable-looking men; of perfectly good deportment and unusual intelligence; with nothing lounging or slinking in their manners; with an air of keen observation, and quick perception when addressed; and generally presenting in their faces, traces more or less marked of habitually leading lives of strong mental excitement. (“Police Party, Part I” 410) Dickens goes to great lengths to reinforce the superiority of the police detective. These men, “in a glance, immediately takes an inventory of the furniture and an accurate sketch of the editorial presence” and speak “very concisely, and in well-chosen language” and who present as an “amicable brotherhood” (“Police Party, Part I” 410). They are also adaptable and constantly working to refine their craft, through apeculiar ability, always sharpening and being improved by practice, and always adapting itself to every variety of circumstances, and opposing itself to every new device that perverted ingenuity can invent, for which this important social branch of the public service is remarkable! (“Police Party, Part II” 459)These detectives are also, in some ways, familiar. Dickens’s offerings include: a “shrewd, hard-headed Scotchman – in appearance not at all unlike a very acute, thoroughly-trained schoolmaster”; a man “with a ruddy face and a high sun-burnt forehead, [who] has the air of one who has been a Sergeant in the army” (“Police Party, Part I” 409-10); and another man who slips easily into the role of the “greasy, sleepy, shy, good-natured, chuckle-headed, un-suspicious, and confiding young butcher” (“Police Party, Part II” 457). These descriptions are more than just attempts to flesh out a story; words on a page reminding us that the author is not just another journalist but one of the great voices of the Victorian era. These profiles are, it is argued here, a deliberate strategy to reassure readers.In summary, police detectives are only to be feared by those residing on the wrong side of the law. For those without criminal intent; detectives are, in some ways, like us. They are people we already know and trust. The stern but well-meaning, intelligent school teacher; the brave and loyal soldier defending the Empire; and the local merchant, a person we see every day. Dickens provides, too, concrete examples for how everyone can contribute to a safer society by assisting these detectives. This, is perfect public relations. Thus, almost singlehandedly, he builds a professional profile for a new type of police officer. The problem (crime) and its solution (the detective) neatly packaged, with step-by-step instructions for citizens to openly support this new-style of constabulary and so achieve a better, less crime-ridden community. This is a theme pursued in “Three Detective Anecdotes” (1850) where Dickens continued to successfully merge “solid lower-middle-class respectability with an intimate knowledge of the criminal world” (Priestman 177); so, proffering the ideal police detective. A threat to the criminal but not to the hard-working and honest men, women, and children of the city.The Detective: As Fact and as FictionThese writings are also a precursor to one of the greatest fictional detectives of the English-speaking world. Dickens observes that, for these new-style police detectives: “Nothing is so common or deceptive as such appearances at first” (“Police Party, Part I” 410). In 1891, Arthur Conan Doyle would write that: “There is nothing so deceptive as an obvious fact” (78). Dickens had prepared readers for the consulting detective Sherlock Holmes: who was smarter, more observant and who had more determination to take on criminals than the average person. The readers of Dickens were, in many respects, positioned as prototypes of Dr John Watson: a hardworking, loyal Englishman. Smart. But not as smart as those who would seek to do harm. Watson needed Holmes to make the world a better place; the subscriber to Household Words needed the police detective.Another article, “On Duty with Inspector Field” (1851), profiled the “well-known hand” responsible for bringing numerous offenders to justice and sending them, “inexorably, to New South Wales” (Dickens 266). Critically this true crime narrative would be converted into a crime fiction story as Inspector Field is transformed (it is widely believed) into the imagined Inspector Bucket. The 1860s have been identified as “a period of awakening for the detective novel” (Ashley x), a predictor of which is the significant sub-plot of murder in Dickens’s Bleak House. In this novel, a murder is committed with the case taken on, and competently solved by, Bucket who is a man of “skill and integrity” a man presented as an “ideal servant” though one working for a “flawed legal system” (Walton 458). Mr Snagsby, of Bleak House, observes Bucket as a man whoseems in some indefinable manner to lurk and lounge; also, that whenever he is going to turn to the right or left, he pretends to have a fixed purpose in his mind of going straight ahead, and wheels off, sharply at the very last moment [… He] notices things in general, with a face as unchanging as the great mourning ring on his little finger, or the brooch, composed of not much diamond and a good deal of setting, which he wears in his shirt. (278) This passage, it is argued here, places Bucket alongside the men at the detective police party in Household Words. He is simultaneously superhuman in mind and manner, though rather ordinary in dress. Like the real-life detectives of Dickens’s articles; he is a man committed to keeping the city safe while posing no threat to law-abiding citizens. ConclusionThis article has explored, briefly, the contributions of the highly-regarded Victorian author, Charles Dickens, to factual and fictional crime writing. The story of Dickens as a social commentator is one that is familiar to many; what is less well-known is the connection of Dickens to important conversations around capital punishment and the rise of the detective in crime-focused narratives; particularly how he assisted in building the professional profile of the police detective. In this way, through fact and fiction, Dickens performed great (if under-acknowledged) public services around punishment and law enforcement: he contributed to debates on the death penalty and he helped to build trust in the radical social project that established modern-day policing.AcknowledgementsThe author offers her sincere thanks to the New South Wales Dickens Society, Simon Dwyer, and Peter Kirkpatrick.

"2017","The Snowden Disclosures, Technical Standards and the Making of Surveillance Infrastructures","The Snowden documents have revealed that intelligence agencies conduct large-scale digital surveillance by exploiting vulnerabilities in the hardware and software of communication infrastructures. These vulnerabilities have been characterized as “weaknesses,” “flaws,” “bugs,” and “backdoors.” Some of these result from errors in the design or implementation of systems, others from unanticipated uses of intended features. A particularly subtle kind of vulnerability arises from the manipulation of technical standards to render communication infrastructures susceptible to surveillance. Technical standards have a powerful influence on our digital environment: They shape the conditions under which digital citizenship is exercised. The Snowden revelations brought to the forefront the role of intelligence agencies in the standards-making process, lending new urgency to the debate over the adequacy and legitimacy of the current mechanisms used for negotiating standards. This article explores how influence is exercised in the production of standards and the implications this has for their trustworthiness and integrity.","",""
"2017","Digital Citizenship and Surveillance| Digital Citizenship and Surveillance Society — Introduction","Digital citizenship is typically defined as the (self-)enactment of people’s role in society through the use of digital technologies. It therefore has empowering and democratizing characteristics. However, as shown by this Special Section, the context of datafication and ubiquitous data collection and processing complicates this picture. The Snowden revelations have demonstrated the extent to which both state agencies and Internet companies monitor the activities of digital citizens and how the balance of power shifts accordingly. This editorial introduction outlines the challenges and transformations of digital citizenship after Snowden and formulates a set of requirements for digital citizenship in a datafied environment. Having set this thematic framework, it explains the purpose of the Special Section and outlines its contributions.","",""

This goes beyond the important concerns of the  surveillance state  and  surveillance society  to examine how today’s subjects make sense of, respond to, and—in some cases—initiate surveillance activities. Building conceptually on Charles Taylor’s work, the concepts of surveillance imaginaries and surveillance practices are proposed as a means of analysis of how surveillance is engaged today. Previous studies have hinted at surveillance culture both explicitly and implicitly, but more is needed. This article explores further one illustrative dimension—that of online practices of  sharing . These practices are seen, in turn, in relation to  visibility  and  exposure . Finally, the concept of surveillance culture is shown to be relevant to current discussions ethics and of digital citizenship.","",""
"2017","Managing Internal and External Communication in a Competitive Climate via EDI Concept","A biometric sensor device is the potential product of the forthcoming biotechnology for real-time tracking of physiological signals to support various healthcare and medical services such as homecare medical service, prevention, diagnosis, and follow-up services. A key agreement scheme between biometric sensor devices is a fundamental requirement to support the security of the healthcare and medical services. Existing key agreement schemes employ high computational cryptography mechanisms or share a pre-deployed key among biometric sensor devices. Due to stringent constraints of hardware capability, it is inadequate to use public cryptography mechanisms for biometric sensor devices. Moreover, it is also inappropriate to install a fixed secret key in implanted devices because, if the key is revealed, a person will have inevitable transplantation surgery for the secret redistribution. In this paper, we propose new lightweight key agreement scheme which requires only symmetric cryptosystem without a pre-deployed secret information for biometric sensor devices.","",""

It uses the example of predictive policing to consider the difference between panoptic modes of surveillance and emerging practices of environmental surveillance. The former rely on public awareness of surveillance and the internalization of the monitoring gaze, whereas the latter rely on actuarial modes of prediction. The growing emphasis on strategies for preemption rather than on policies for prevention displace political deliberation with technological expertise and work in the direction of automated decision making about resource allocation and armed response.","",""
"2017","Digital Citizenship and Surveillance| The Advent of Surveillance Realism: Public Opinion and Activist Responses to the Snowden Leaks","The Snowden leaks provided unprecedented insights into the workings of state-corporate surveillance programs based on the interception and collection of online activity. They illustrated the extent of “bulk” data collection and the general and widespread monitoring of everyday communication platforms used by ordinary citizens. Yet public response in the United Kingdom and elsewhere has been considerably muted, and there has been little evidence of public outcry, with often conflicting and inconsistent opinions on the subject. Based on research carried out for the project Digital Citizenship and Surveillance Society, this article explores the nuances of public attitudes toward surveillance, including such attitudes among politically active citizens, through focus groups and interviews. We argue that the lack of transparency, knowledge, and control over what happens to personal data online has led to feelings of widespread resignation, not consent, to the status quo that speaks to a condition we identify as “surveillance realism.” We understand this to entail a simultaneous unease among citizens with data collection alongside the active normalization of surveillance that limits the possibilities of enacting modes of citizenship and of imagining alternatives.","",""
"2017","Digital Citizenship and Surveillance| The Normalization of Surveillance and the Invisibility of Digital Citizenship: Media Debates After the Snowden Revelations","Based on an analysis of newspaper and blog coverage of the Snowden revelations and their aftermath, our study demonstrates that newspapers normalize surveillance by highlighting concerns over national security and focusing on surveillance of elites, and minimize the attention given to the mass surveillance of citizens. By contrast, blogs allow more critical discussions relevant to digital citizenship, enabling debates on civil rights and privacy. This article argues that if conventional media limit debates relevant to digital citizenship, blogs may provide a space that contests and makes visible the key problems scantly evident in newspapers. We suggest research on digital citizenship in mediated debates should focus on how political subjects are silenced, as well as the emerging spaces where this silence can be broken.","",""

"2017","Digital Citizenship and Surveillance| Citizen Snowden","What kind of citizenship has Snowden performed? Apparently, it is not American citizenship because American authorities attempted to try him for treason and he became a stateless fugitive. After requesting political asylum in 21 countries, he was eventually granted temporary asylum in Russia. Neither states nor international organizations recognized his act as an act of citizenship. Did Snowden perform a citizenship that is yet to come? Did he perform an international citizenship? The issue of rights usually recognized in the literature on the debate about Snowden’s act concerns its content such as the practices of states spying on their citizens. This article focuses on the act itself as making digital rights claims that do not yet exist in law. We argue that just as Snowden’s act disrupted surveillance practices that evermore traverse national borders, it also called for digital rights and responsibilities that traverse national legal orders.","",""

It seeks to answer two primary questions: (1) Do companies articulate an awareness of the tendency toward the simultaneous use of devices for work and nonwork? (2) What approaches are employed in an attempt to control such use? The findings reveal that 66% of corporate codes articulate some level of tolerance for integration. Despite this general trend toward permitting employees to use company-issued devices for nonwork and personal devices for work, 53% of the companies in this study nonetheless disclaim privacy expectations by employees while 67% engage in monitoring employees’ activities. The article goes on to critique these approaches for failing to reflect social realities of work and proposes an alternative approach to employee privacy in the simultaneous use of electronic devices for work and nonwork.","",""

In so doing, it engages a critical theoretical framework that commences by delineating the contours of media structure, and then investigates how this structure bears on discourses about privacy and surveillance. Rather than viewing intrusions of privacy rights as a perversion of an otherwise egalitarian rights construct, this approach sees privacy discourse as a coded form of a more fundamental discussion about where individuals fit in to prevailing social hierarchies. In so doing, this essay shows how privacy and property rights have an intertwined history, through which an antagonism develops in capitalist society’s attempt to balance property rights, social equity, and public trust. The resulting discourse on privacy is, then, reflective of this antagonism.","",""

The 'Northern Territory Intervention' aimed to combat abuse and violence in remote Indigenous communities, and included far-reaching changes to welfare administration, employment programmes and policing. This paper considers a hitherto obscure aspect of the Intervention: the surveillance of publicly funded computers and internet use. Between 2007 and 2012, providers of internet and computer access facilities in the affected communities were required to audit and record computer use. In this paper we examine the legal and policy dimensions of this case of governmental surveillance, using interviews, published materials and documents obtained through freedom of information processes.","",""
"2017","The passage of Australia’s data retention regime: national security, human rights, and media scrutiny","In April 2015, the Australian Government passed the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Act, which imposes obligations on Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to collect metadata information about their users and store this metadata for a period of two years. This article reviews the operation of the Act and considers the extent to which it conflicts with the human right to privacy. We suggest that the broad scope of the data retention obligations and the lack of judicial safeguards to limit access to collected data presents a clear conflict with the requirements of international law. From its conception through to its ongoing implementation, Australia’s data retention scheme has been controversial. The Government has generally asserted that data retention is necessary to further Australia’s national security interests and to assist law enforcement agencies with criminal investigations. In the face of criticism, however, Government officials have been notably unable to justify the scheme on these grounds, or to show that data retention is a proportionate response to national security and law enforcement concerns. The passage of data retention in Australia is particularly notable for the significant confusion not only over what the scheme would achieve, but what it would actually do. The Data Retention Act does not clearly explain what constitutes “metadata” for the purposes of the Act, nor, famously, was the Attorney-General George Brandis able to define metadata when asked about it. This is part of a broader narrative of disagreement and confusion about what data is suitable for collection and how data collection can impact upon the privacy interests of Australian citizens. We examine how public interest concerns were dealt with during the passage of the Act as reflected in Australian news media. While the Act was controversial and subject to substantial ongoing criticism, the Government ultimately did little to address the human rights concerns that had been raised. The Act was ultimately passed with bi-partisan support, despite severe deficiencies in the justifications, a lack of clarity in the operation of the scheme, and heated public opposition from a small but vocal group of advocates. We show how the complexity of the Act appeared to limit engaged critique in the mainstream media, and how escalating fears over domestic and international terrorist attacks were exploited to secure the Act’s passage through federal Parliament.","",""
"2017","Internet surveillance, regulation, and chilling effects online: a comparative case study","With internet regulation and censorship on the rise, states increasingly engaging in online surveillance, and state cyber-policing capabilities rapidly evolving globally, concerns about regulatory """"chilling effects"""" online—the idea that laws, regulations, or state surveillance can deter people from exercising their freedoms or engaging in legal activities on the internet have taken on greater urgency and public importance. But just as notions of """"chilling effects"""" are not new, neither is skepticism about their legal, theoretical, and empirical basis; in fact, the concept remains largely un-interrogated with significant gaps in understanding, particularly with respect to chilling effects online. This work helps fill this void with a first-of-its-kind online survey that examines multiple dimensions of chilling effects online by comparing and analyzing responses to hypothetical scenarios involving different kinds of regulatory actions—including an anti-cyberbullying law, public/private sector surveillance, and an online regulatory scheme, based on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), enforced through personally received legal threats/notices. The results suggest not only the existence and significance of regulatory chilling effects online across these different scenarios but also evidence a differential impact—with personally received legal notices and government surveillance online consistently having the greatest chilling effect on people's activities online—and certain online activities like speech, search, and personal sharing also impacted differently. The results also offer, for the first time, insights based on demographics and other similar factors about how certain people and groups may be more affected than others, including findings that younger people and women are more likely to be chilled; younger people and women are less likely to take steps to resist regulatory actions and defend themselves; and anti-cyberbullying laws may have a salutary impact on women's willingness to share content online suggesting, contrary to critics, that such laws may lead to more speech and sharing, than less. The findings also offer evidence of secondary chilling effects— where users' online activities are chilled even when not they, but others in their social networks receive legal processes.","",""

The research was based on analysing the movement's official publications and announcements and the journalistic discourse that surrounded their campaign within the political, judicial, and public arenas in 2009-2017.

This paper presents New Zealand-based empirical research findings into people’s actual online information-sharing behaviours rather than their attitudes: the motivations, extent, and conditions under which individuals share their personal information in varying online relationships with commercial providers, with government, and on social networking sites. A grounded theory methodology and an abductive analysis were used to identify patterns in the findings and construct a new taxonomy of online information-sharing behaviours: contrary to existing taxonomies, all participants in this study are very privacy aware and make quite deliberate choices about what personal information they share online, with whom, to what extent, and under what circumstances. Four distinctive classifications of people’s online information-sharing behaviours were derived from this study: privacy pragmatists, privacy victims, privacy optimists, and privacy fatalists.","",""
"2017","Explicit terror prevention versus vague civil liberty: how the UK broadcasting news (de)legitimatise online mass surveillance since Edward Snowden’s revelations","ABSTRACT Snowden’s initial revelations aimed at establishing a public debate on online surveillance informed through the media. Media should serve the public’s need for information and offer various viewpoints and sources to enhance public debates. This study assesses how online surveillance is justified or countered in British broadcast news since the 2013 Snowden revelations for five selected major events in news coverage ending with the Charlie Hebdo aftermath in Paris in early 2015. The critical discourse analysis shows that UK broadcasts cover justification and delegitimation arguments of online surveillance. Online surveillance legitimation combines rationalisation (terror prevention) and moral evaluation (public security) arguments, which are often expressed by governmental actors. The broadcast discourse tends to give governmental, pro-surveillance actors a voice by default. The detailedness of terror threat descriptions increases over time. In 2013, ‘terrorist attacks’ are rather factually mentioned. In 2015, several ways leading to a loss of lives through terror are explicitly stated, which strengthens the instrumental rationality legitimation arguments. Delegitimising arguments predominantly use moralising and mythopoetic arguments (civil liberties) that are expressed by Snowden himself or politicians, yet rarely by non-governmental organisations, and very rarely by citizens. It is harder for non-governmental actors to continuously interpret the broadcast discourse. Therefore, what exactly is at stake when online mass surveillance increases remains obscure in the news discourse. The surveillance discourse should be richer in order to give the audience a chance to understand the vague and less tangible contra-surveillance arguments better.","",""
"2017","The reliance on recognition and majority vote heuristics over privacy concerns when selecting smartphone apps among German and US consumers","ABSTRACT The smartphone app market is a prime example of a digital market where consumers are tasked with selecting one option among a plethora of alternatives, at times indistinguishable from one another. Building upon findings on information processing and decision-making, we postulate that consumers follow simple (rather than complex) heuristic rules to navigate the app market. In particular, we focus on two such strategies: the recognition heuristic and the majority vote heuristic. App privacy information was also considered as a potentially salient cue in the decision-making process, given the personal data stored on smartphones. Results of a mixed-method design (behavioral analysis and think-aloud protocols) study with German (N = 18) and US (N = 25) students find a dominance of the recognition heuristic. Decisions are further supported by majority vote heuristics. Privacy information is largely disregarded, particularly by US participants. Implications for app market design and engagement are discussed.","",""

It asks if the legislation addressed how employers could use SNSs in the hiring process by requesting SNS passwords, if there were consequences for violators, if employer retaliation was prohibited, if third-party access was allowed, if employee SNS monitoring was prohibited, if SNS friend requests by employers was allowed and if employer requested changes in privacy settings were prohibited. In addition, the study also examined the interest groups and political party-affiliated sponsors that were active in the creation of the legislation. The results discover important inconsistencies between the states’ legislation, which question the ability to protect worker and applicant online privacy.

We term this ‘privacy endism,’ locating the phenomenon within a broader category of endist thought. We then analyze 101 newspaper articles between 1990 and 2012 that declare the end of privacy. Three findings follow. First, claims about the end of privacy point to an unusually broad range of technological and institutional causes. Privacy has been pronounced defunct for decades, but there has never been a near consensus about its causes. Second, unlike other endist talk (the end of art or history, etc.), privacy endism appears ongoing and not period specific. Finally, our explanation of the persistence and idiosyncrasy of claims to the end of privacy focuses on Warren and Brandeis’s 1890 negative conception of privacy as ‘the right to be let alone’: namely, modern privacy talk has always been endist because the right to privacy was born out of the conditions for its violation, not its realization. The conclusion comments on implications of that basic proposition.","",""

Utilizing content analytic methods to document and decode popular images of borders, mobility, and insecurity, it assesses three programs from Australia, the UK, and the United States. Despite claims of offering accurate and unfiltered depictions, the programs are ideological and provide visions of enforcement that reinforce stereotypes regarding the risks of permeable borders and exonerate intensive regimes of surveillance and securitization. Our findings suggest this occurs in three ways. First, the programs inflate the extent and seriousness of lawlessness associated with cross-border movement. Second, they offer individualistic explanations of crime that cite personal choices and pathologies as determinants. Finally, alongside neglecting their perspectives and interpretations of events, when compared to the reality of official statistics, the programs disproportionately feature suspected offenders as members of marginalized groups. The social and political implications of these findings are discussed.","",""

Based on a representative survey of Swiss Internet users, it reveals past experiences with privacy breaches as a strong predictor of current protective behavior. Further, in line with the ‘privacy paradox’ argument, caring about privacy (privacy attitudes) alone does not necessarily result in substantial self-protection. Most strikingly, however, general Internet skills are key in explaining users’ privacy behavior. These skills enable users to reduce risks of privacy loss while obtaining the benefits from online activities that increasingly depend on the revelation of personal data. Consequently, Internet skills are an essential starting point for public policies regarding users’ self-help in privacy protection.","",""

This article examines the manifestation of these concerns in news media. Guided by framing theory, it seeks to ascertain the prevailing frames for personal information sharing and to determine whether such framing facilitates debate on issues related to self-disclosure. Articles published in top Israeli online newspapers were analyzed (n = 609). Findings show that the individual user, the state, and corporations are framed as key actors that shape online self-disclosure practices and their outcomes. Furthermore, the individual user, while portrayed as chief actor, is seen as the weakest player.","",""

Indeed, they must conduct a representation of their private life on a public sphere in order to convince peers, who serve as an authority of legitimation, that they have an exclusive privacy. ","",""
"2017","Towards A Networked Privacy Paradigm: Assumptions And Implications","There is a long tradition of research on why and to whom people disclose information and manage their privacy, especially since the emergence of social media. Recently, there has been a push to conceptualize privacy in relation to social media as ‘networked privacy’, where privacy is framed in terms of networks, relationships or people. Despite the popular term it is unclear what makes networked privacy new and how it relates to other privacy conceptualizations. In this paper, we therefore analyze networked privacy together with the following privacy theories; Warren and Brandeis’ right to be left alone, Westin’s privacy control, Nissenbaum’s theory of contextual integrity and Petronio’s communication privacy management theory. Each theory refers (implicitly or explicitly) to different ontological and epistemological claims and we will clarify these and illustrate how fundamentally different the networked privacy paradigm is from its counterparts. The analysis serves as a first step towards defining fundamental principles for a paradigm of networked privacy.","",""

"2017","The needle and the damage done: Of haystacks and anxious panopticons","How should we understand the surveillance state post Snowden? This paper is concerned with the relationship between increased surveillance capacity and state power. The paper begins by analysing two metaphors used in public post Snowden discourse to describe state surveillance practices: the haystack and the panopticon. It argues that these metaphors share a flawed common entailment regarding surveillance, knowledge and power which cannot accurately capture important aspects of state anxiety generated by mass surveillance in an age of big data. The paper shows that the nature of big data itself complicates the power attributed to mass surveillance states by these metaphors and those who use them. Relying heavily on Ezrahi’s distinction between information and knowledge, the paper situates this argument concerning the state and anxiety borne of information overload in the context of literature that concerns the state and information management. Drawing primarily on James Scott’s work on legibility, it argues that the big data born of mass surveillance problematises the concept of information as empowering the state. Instead, understanding mass surveillance in an age of big data requires understanding the relationship between the surveillance state and information in terms of anxiety as well as power.","",""
"2017","Tracing You: How transparent surveillance reveals a desire for visibility"," Tracing You is an artwork that presents a website's best attempt to see the world from its visitors’ viewpoints. By cross referencing visitor IP addresses with available online data sources, the work traces each visitor back through the network to its possible origin. The end of that trace is the closest available image that potentially shows the visitor’s physical environment. Sometimes what this image shows is eerily accurate; other times it is wildly dislocated. This computational surveillance system thus makes transparent the potential visibility of one’s present location on the Earth, while also giving each site visitor the ability to watch other visitor “traces” in real time. By making its surveillance capacity and intention overt, Tracing You provokes questions about the architecture of networks and how that architecture affects our own visibility both within and outside of the network. Further, reactions to the work reveal attitudes towards surveillance post-Snowden, including, in some cases, an angry desire for more visibility than Tracing You currently provides. This commentary describes how the artwork functions, presents and discusses visitor reactions, and briefly theorizes origins for these reactions within the contexts of surveillance, sousveillance, and transparency in the age of ubiquitous online social networks.

"2017","State of urgency: Surveillance, power, and algorithms in France’s state of emergency","The recent terrorist attacks and ongoing state of emergency in France have brought questions of police surveillance into the public spotlight, making it increasingly important to understand how police attain data from citizens. Since 2005, the French police have been using IBM’s computer program, i2 Analyst’s Notebook, to aggregate information and craft criminal narratives. This technology serves to quickly connect suspects with crimes, looking for as many associations as possible, ranking and visualizing them based on level of importance. Recently, surveillance and state power have been theorized as having shifted to a posthegemonic, order. Drawing from literature on power, surveillance, and identity, this paper considers the various ways that algorithms can impact policing under a state of emergency by comparing the technical protocol of i2 Analyst’s Notebook with the administrative protocol of the French state. Using i2 Analyst’s Notebook as an example, this paper argues that posthegemonic theories of power have their place in determining how algorithms can be used for surveillance, but that they cannot completely explain their use under the state of emergency.","",""
"2017","Can the obstacles to privacy self-management be overcome? Exploring the consent intermediary approach","In privacy self-management, people are expected to perform cost–benefit analysis on the use of their personal data, and only consent when their subjective benefits outweigh the costs. However, the ubiquitous collection of personal data and Big Data analytics present increasing challenges to successful privacy management. A number of services and research initiatives have proposed similar solutions to provide people with more control over their data by consolidating consent decisions under a single interface. We have named this the ‘consent intermediary’ approach. In this paper, we first identify the eight obstacles to privacy self-management which make cost–benefit analysis conceptually and practically challenging. We then analyse to which extent consent intermediaries can help overcome the obstacles. We argue that simply bringing consent decisions under one interface offers limited help, but that the potential of this approach lies in leveraging the intermediary position to provide aides for privacy management. We find that with suitable tools, some of the more practical obstacles indeed can become solvable, while others remain fundamentally insuperable within the individuated privacy self-management model. Attention should also be paid to how the consent intermediaries may take advantage of the power vested in the intermediary positions between users and other services.","",""

A perceived lack of transparency about the frequency of police killings amplifies concerns that many such killings are unjustified. This commentary considers efforts by journalists and activists to comprise databases that document and measure police violence, particularly in terms of how these endeavors exemplify the New Transparency.

"2017","Big Data is a big lie without little data: Humanistic intelligence as a human right"," This article introduces an important concept: Transparency by way of Humanistic Intelligence as a human right, and in particular, Big/Little Data and Sur/Sous Veillance, where “Little Data” is to sousveillance (undersight) as “Big Data” is to surveillance (oversight). Veillance (Sur- and Sous-veillance) is a core concept not just in human–human interaction (e.g. people watching other people) but also in terms of Human–Computer Interaction. In this sense, veillance is the core of Human-in-the-loop Intelligence (Humanistic Intelligence rather than Artificial Intelligence), leading us to the concept of “Sousveillant Systems” which are forms of Human–Computer Interaction in which internal computational states are made visible to end users, allowing users (but not requiring them) to “jump” into the computational feedback loop whenever or wherever they want. An important special case of Sousveillant Systems is that of scientific exploration: not only is (big/little) data considered, but also due consideration must be given to how data is captured, understood, explored, and discovered, and in particular, to the use of scientific instruments to collect data and to make important new discoveries, and learn about the world. Science is a domain where bottom-up transparency is of the utmost importance, and scientists have the right and responsibility to be able to understand the instruments that they use to make their discoveries. Such instruments must be sousveillant systems! ","",""

In introducing the theoretical and empirical research papers, artistic, activist and educational provocations and commentaries in this Special Theme, it highlights three central debates. Firstly, concerning theory/practice, it queries how useful theories of veillance and transparency are in explaining mutual watching in the post-Snowden, Big Data era. Secondly, it presents a range of questions concerning norms, ethics, regulation, resistance and social change around veillance and transparency. Thirdly, it interrogates the upsurge in veillance and transparency discourses and practices post-Snowden, and asks whether they are adequate to the task of educating and engaging people on abstract and secretive surveillance practices, as well as on the possibilities and pitfalls of sousveillance.

"2017","A gap in the market: the conceptualisation of surveillance, security, privacy and trust in public opinion surveys.","Understanding the attitudes of members of the public towards the impact of surveillance technologies used to enhance public security on their privacy is an essential, but complex consideration for policy makers, where public trust plays a central role. Understanding public attitudes involves assessing what public opinion surveys reveal. However, in order to ensure that public attitudes are appropriately being measured across all four concepts (privacy, security, trust and surveillance) it is necessary to consider how existing surveys conceptualise and operationalise these terms. This article undertakes precisely this consideration, in order to evaluate existing practices and provide recommendations for future public opinion surveys on surveillance technologies or practices intended to provide security, but which may impact privacy. We have found three issues relating to past approaches: past surveys do not always adequately define or conceptualise the terms they are employing.  Second, surveys sometimes rely on the use of examples in lieu of definitions. Finally, and most importantly, we find that existing surveys do not always adequately examine the impact of the public’s trust towards the use of surveillance technologies to enhance security, but which may affect their privacy.","",""

"2017","Review of Sarat's A World Without Privacy: What Law Can and Should Do?","In 2013, Edward Snowden sparked a global privacy panic by releasing evidence of indiscriminate mass surveillance conducted by several intelligence agencies, most notably members of the network known as the Five Eyes. The surveillance involved mass state access to personal data stored by privately owned information intermediaries that acquired it in the course of providing services such as search engines, email, blogging platforms, social network sites and video calling. The rapid adoption of these services reflects a broad cultural shift towards digitally mediated social life. Appreciating the inherent benefits and risks of this shift requires an analysis of power relations. Legal and surveillance scholarship are both especially useful for this task, particularly when it comes to the topic of privacy. A World Without Privacy offers readers a range of rich and insightful perspectives on the benefits and risks associated with the everdeeper integration of information communication technologies with daily social life.","",""
"2017","Authoritarianism and privacy: The moderating role of terrorism","The resurgence in interest in authoritarianism has been linked to a rise in the acceptance of right-wing ideology and also restrictions on civil liberties, particularly in relation to surveillance and the right to privacy. Whilst we can observe simple correlations between these variables, the dynamics of threat are more complex to understand. The analysis reported here demonstrates how the relationship between authoritarianism and the curtailment of civil liberties is moderated by the threat of terrorism. Using 2005 British Social Attitudes survey data, collected either side of the 7/7 bombings, comparisons between the pre-post samples indicate that the threat of terrorism activates authoritarian tendencies and reduces the protection of rights to privacy from government. Interestingly and importantly, reactions to terrorism in the form of a change in opinion regarding civil liberties for those scoring higher in authoritarianism remained almost constant between the two periods. The results provide support for understanding how minority opinions (removal of rights to privacy) can become majority views during times of threat.","",""
"2017","International Cross-Surveillance: Global IT Surveillance Arbitrage and the Principle of Proportionality as a Counterargument","In the course of the revelations about both U.S. and European national surveillance programmes, remarkable constellations have come to light. Most national programmes are focused on the surveillance of IT-based communication among foreigners and between citizens and foreigners. This fact has often been employed as a mitigating argument within the national legal and policy discourses. This paper examines some of the possible loopholes and “dents” in the law that enable intelligence agencies to engage in international IT surveillance arbitrage. Fundamental rights currently do not protect against this practice. It leads to the factual circumvention of constitutional standards by permitting wider indirect access to domestic communication through processes of information sharing.We briefly assess possible legal answers to this phenomenon from the fields of public international law and global constitutionalism. Since international human rights law is merely territorial in focus it is incapable of constraining the above mentioned arbitrage practices. Territorial concepts of human rights protection are outdated with regards to international communication networks and ineffective for the legal regulation of state surveillance of these networks. We identify the universal legal principle of proportionality as the most promising starting point to structure and rationalise the legal debate on how to constrain international IT cross-surveillance.","",""
"2017","How to silence the lambs? Constructing authoritarian governance in post-transitional Hungary","This paper examines a range of arguments put forward to explain how financial surveillance of non-governmental organisations empowers authoritarianism in the post-transitional Hungarian context. In doing so, it attempts to shed light on the limitations of existing surveillance theories regarding the historical component of surveillance tolerance and the different modes of governance in post-communist European countries. It argues that post-transitional disappointment in democratic governance is causing Hungarians to become resigned to political decisions and to support new forms of authoritarian rules. Such a stoic attitude and the historically embedded surveillance culture facilitate the use of monitoring mechanisms that not only target terrorists as an external security threat, but also target NGOs defined as ‘the enemies of national values’. Hungarian authoritarian policies are not facilitated by extended surveillance practices, as Anglo-Saxon theories have regularly argued, but by the way they are used as an instrument of a political deterrence strategy against political opponents.","",""
"2017","The Global Turn to Authoritarianism and After","This editorial introduces the special responsive issue on the global turn to authoritarianism. It points out the lack of any systematic political theory of the way in which authority and surveillance relate within Surveillance Studies and sketches some possible outlines for such a theory, that involves relationships between surveillance, democracy, authoritarianism, colonialism and capitalism. It argues that the contemporary turn to authoritarianism is predominantly a Global North phenomenon, that adds to an already common situation in the post-colonial Global South, and that the fears that drive the turn to authoritarianism in the North are rooted in fears of the breakdown of a post-colonial global order that was so favourable to the Global North. Finally, it proposes three possible trajectories: multiplying and deepening authoritarianism; the return of neoliberalism on a planetary scale; and new forms of platform authoritarianism that emerging from surveillance capitalism. However, it rejects all of these in favour of the rediscovery of collective desires.","",""
"2017","Post-panoptic pedagogies: The changing nature of school surveillance in the digital age","The aim of this paper is to explore critically the everyday conditions of surveillance in the contemporary secondary school context. Using a classical ethnographic approach, it seeks to unpack the range of surveillance practices and processes that are at work within schools as institutional settings, and how these are encountered and experienced by students, teachers, administrators, and other members of a school community. The main concern is with the hypothesized evolution of panoptic to post-panoptic surveillance and whether or not surveillance in schools emulates such developments, specifically with regards to the levelling of power hierarchies as a result of the incorporation of both vertical and horizontal modes of surveillance. To offer concrete examples of this shift in models of surveillance, this paper examine three manifestations of surveillance in schools: CCTV, mobile phones, and e-learning and content management platforms as modes of dataveillance, a particularized form of surveillance that has come to characterize modern surveillance functions. The primary question that drives this research is what evidence is there for these functions/modes of surveillance, and how are digital technologies implicit in their operation?","",""
"2017","Counter-Mapping Surveillance: A Critical Cartography of Mass Surveillance Technology After Snowden","This article critically examines mass surveillance technology revealed by Snowden’s disclosures. It addresses that we do not only live in a society where surveillance is deeply inscribed but more urgently, that it is increasingly difficult to study surveillance when its technologies and practices are difficult to distinguish from everyday routines. Considerably, many of the technologies and systems utilised for surveillance purposes were not originally designed as proper surveillance technologies. Instead, they have effectively become surveillance technologies by being enrolled into a particular surveillant assemblage. Three contributions are made towards critical scholarship on surveillance, intelligence, and security. First, a novel empirical cartographic methodology is developed that employs the vocabularies of assemblages and actor–networks. Second, this methodology is applied to critically examine global mass surveillance according to Snowden. Multiple leaked data sources have been utilised to trace actors, their associations amongst each other, and to create several graphical maps and diagrams. These maps provide insights into actor types and dependence relations described in the original disclosed documents. Third, the analytical value of three ordering concepts as well as the logistics of surveillance are explored via notable actors and actor groups. In short, this contribution provides empirical cartographic methods, concepts, and analytical targets for critically examining surveillance technology and its particular compositions. It addresses challenges of resisting mass surveillance and some forms of data activism, and calls for the continuing proliferation of counter-maps to facilitate grounded critique, to raise awareness, and to gain a foothold for meaningful resistance against mass surveillance.","",""

"2017","""""Living in the File"""": Kinship &amp; Political Surveillance in Post-Civil War Greece","Little attention has been paid to the ways in which political surveillance practices have historically intersected with a cultural logic of kinship or actual kin relationships, despite the fact that intergenerational effects of state surveillance have been observed. This article aims to open up this important avenue of research through a reflection on the relationship between kinship, political surveillance and state persecution in post-civil war Greece. Drawing on narrative interviews and borrowing from the emerging ethnographic work on the agentic qualities of state documents, this article analyzes the unexpected ways in which the citizen file (fakelos) created a form of political inheritance for the children of leftists.

This collection highlights the importance of individual experiences and collective histories that shape contemporary surveillance culture.

The controversial surveillance practices include the use of confidential informants, undercover operations, and entrapment, and infringing upon civil rights and civil liberties in the name of national security. A decade before 9/11, however, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) conducted the same practices against a completely different demographic – Christian Right militants, through a program called PATCON, short for Patriot Conspiracy. Building upon the concept of surveillance as social sorting (Lyon 2013) and surveillance and terrorism (Monahan 2013), This article will compare the history of surveillance tactics used by the FBI against Christian Right militants and those used by the NYPD against non-militant Muslim Americans, and assess their implications in the context of civil rights, leaving a legacy of mistrust between these respective groups and the federal government that further undermines the national security interests of the United States. ","",""

I draw on women of color feminism, visual cultural studies, and critical race studies to analyze the alley work historical archive as a representational account of black women’s sexual regulation. My argument is that the Bertillon system’s attempts to categorize alley work functions as a strategy of surveillance that regulates black women’s economic and social difference. The police’s efforts to identify alley work as economically transgressive positions black sexual labor as an unruly site of social management in the context of industrializing Minneapolis.","",""
"2017","Leaking Boats and Borders: The virtu of surveilling Australia’s refugee population","When refugees displaced to Australia’s offshore detention do speak, it is through surveillance upended through publicity and violations of privacy. Weak legal rights to privacy in Australia juxtapose the increasing secrecy under which the Australian state operates its own offshore detention centres (Manus Island and Nauru) while increasing the mandate of data retention at home. Australia’s institutional context offers visibility to these concerns of surveillance whereby we find an acceleration of prohibitive privacy for government and prohibitive transparency for individuals. Our analysis of this country synthesises media-law in practice with theories of mediated visibility (Flyverbom 2016, 2017; Brighenti 2010), to understand Australian privacy, media and immigration law in the context of pervasive surveillance and the radical management of visibility.

At that point, the corruption of the regime was evident to most citizens as black markets flourished; illegal monetary exchanges were widespread, and bribery became a legitimate and widespread institution.  However, as the economical sector was slipping out of Soviet control, the public institutions such as media and education were still in business of propagating Soviet ideology. That ideology permeated every aspect of culture, however, it was not enforced through a top-down surveillance, but rather through an internalized surveillance based in belief and faith in authoritarian institutions of power. As a result, it produced individuals torn between faith in the ideals and the reality of the everyday life. In the essay I plan to examine my own experiences through theoretical lens of self-surveillance to make an argument about the production of subjectivity in authoritarian regimes. ","",""

It does so by critically analysing official constructions of suspiciousness, the responsibilisation process of participatory policing, and the assignments of prejudiced amateur detectives. It concludes, firstly, that the agency offered by political campaigns such as “If You See Something, Say Something” is highly illusive since the act of reporting simply demarcates where participation ends, and where fear and paranoia are turned into legitimate intelligence, enabling the state to exercise authoritative action and preemptive violence. Secondly, these kinds of vigilance initiatives also nurture a normalisation of suspicion towards strangers since the encouragements to be aware of anything-and-anyone deemed “out of the ordinary”, as well as the tools for reporting such suspicions, increasingly creep into the mundane realms of everyday life.","",""

"2017","Chilling Developments: Digital Access, Surveillance, and the Authoritarian Dilemma in Ethiopia","This article examines digital surveillance in Ethiopia under the repressive EPRDF regime. It considers the EPRDF’s responses to the Authoritarian Dilemma, in which repressive leaders must decide between extending digital access to their citizens and further tightening their own grip on power. The consequences of this choice are especially significant in the context of an economically and technologically developing nation like Ethiopia. Thus far, its government has largely chosen to use its control of digital networks to clamp down on freedoms in the face of opposition. However, its desire for robust growth has also prompted it to pursue higher rates of digital adoption. In an effort to both maintain control and promote development opportunities, the government is increasingly drawing on a range of digital surveillance techniques. I outline some of the monitoring and targeting techniques it deploys against both the general population and the critics it views as threats to its unilateral authority. Ultimately, I argue that the intensification of digital surveillance is a reckless approach to addressing the Authoritarian Dilemma. The detrimental impacts of state surveillance cannot help but also chill the possibilities of digital usage and adoption and forestall the full potential of national development.","",""

Drawing on research into the repressive strategies of the Iranian state against exiled human rights activists and journalists, I show how digital surveillance allows the regime to monitor political activity outside the country and to prepare counter-measures projecting power beyond borders. With the help of digital media, state authorities can expand the scope and scale of potential threats against outside activists and their ties into the country. The repressive practices of the Iranian state are not only a response to the transnationalisation of political activism but also result of a global securitization of online space. The Iranian case thus demonstrates how contemporary authoritarian power is built and sustained in processes no longer bound to a specific state or territory.","",""

In this article, the surveillance capitalism model, which describes how businesses employ datafication to create value in the digital economy, is used to contextualize PDSs. Focusing on three PDS services, I analyze the social imaginaries they represent, paying attention to the increased agency over data they offer users. This proposed agency reflects the efforts of PDSs to intervene in, but not counter, surveillance capitalism. While their goal is to intensify datafication by increasing the quality and specificity of data that businesses can employ, their interventions also change the structure of data flows, allowing users to more directly benefit from datafication. PDSs envision their users as data-supplying and benefit-demanding market participants, active subjects in value creation instead of passive objects of data extraction. PDSs view themselves as platform providers that facilitate data exchanges and rely on market mechanisms to ensure beneficial services are developed for users to choose from.","",""

Qualitative analysis of encounters with surveillance at Pearson International Airport (Toronto, Canada) demonstrates that participants were attentive to relational concerns during these encounters.

Holding that a key step in a democratic transition must involve the scaling down of state coercive apparatus, the article demonstrates how this has not been the case in Myanmar. The size, expenditure and revenues of the armed forces have been maintained, the surveillance for political and social control continues, while the spread of mobile communication devices, and particularly social media, has opened up more extensive and easier opportunities for monitoring. Subjugating the practices of surveillance to laws is not prioritized in the complex political context of multiple pressing issues.","",""

I illuminate the limits of the counter-surveillance impetus to film the police by contextualizing this strain of social media utopianism within the larger history of what I call “racialization as a way of seeing.” Racialization as a way of seeing is a historical formation that brings together the history of policing, the development of visual epistemologies, and the history of the naturalization of the criminality of blackness. I then track how the optimism of the counter-surveillance discourse has been recuperated by the state into consent for police worn cameras – reforms which threaten to strengthen a system built on structural racism, rather than ameliorate its injustices. I conclude by suggesting an emergent model for how video evidence may be paradoxically working to re-legitimize the police and the state in the newest era of “21st-century policing.”","",""

In the first section, the authors show how Panopticism found breeding ground in social media studies. Yet they claim that despite an expanding critical literature, not much seems to be changing in prosumers’ practices online. Their hypothesis is that this is happening not only because individuals are forced or cheated by the technical systems, as it has been usually argued, but also because they voluntarily submit to them. For this reason, in the second section, the authors introduce the notion of voluntary servitude, coined by Étienne de la Boétie in the XVIth century. Voluntary servitude is a paradoxical notion because it represents the attempt of tidying up two opposite facts: human beings’ will of freedom and their reiterated submission. In the third section, they make the notion operative in the context of social media by focusing on privacy as the counter-discourse of surveillance. In conclusion, the authors deal with the emancipatory character of voluntary servitude, as well as with the concept of subjectivity it entails.","",""

While analyzing how state power in Turkey attempts to suppress dissident and opposite voices, I will particularly focus on the exercises of state in order to control the realm of knowledge production. The state surveillance in Turkey is a complex mixture of the sovereign power, disciplinary mechanisms, and digital surveillance. After a brief discussion on the state surveillance on academy in Turkey, I will argue the conditions imposed to the dismissed academicians by the state as a modern form of Agamben's bare life.","",""

From the perspective of information history the article understands surveillance as a strategy used by the information state and legitimized by either warfare or welfare. In the historical period of the Napoleonic wars the Danish absolutist government primarily focused on surveillance to control the population and less on surveillance for the benefit of the population.","",""
"2017","Bequeathed Legacies: Colonialism and State led Homophobia in Uganda","British colonial involvement in Uganda, and continued western political and economic influence over the affairs of the global south, warrants critical examination if proper context of the Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill is to be understood. In response to the question, how did colonial legacy contribute to state led gendered violence against sexual minorities in Uganda? I advance the argument that authoritarianism and surveillance are both constitutive of colonial and imperial identity and practice, and that the violent attitudes towards gendered and sexual minorities in Uganda are a colonial inheritance. Using critical historiography, I argue that gendered violence, and homophobic attitudes in Uganda cannot be divorced from the seams of Western patriarchy and masculinisms cultivated through the export of legal and religious values. By arguing that surveillance historically was and continues to be a tool for imperial authority to superimpose itself upon formerly colonized territories, I hope to contribute to scholarship in surveillance studies that underscores the utility of history to critiques of the present day divide between western nations and third world former colonial territories.   ","",""

Eight women, all literary scholars, are reflecting and exchanging on the ways to read the files of the secret police of three Communist regimes they know well: Germany, Romania, and Hungary. The age of constant media attention and explosive denunciations of the 1990s is long gone; the scholars have access to files and benefit from the necessary distance to look at them anew. If they all are well aware that this material has been constituted toward a political end, they are nonetheless drawn to the vast possibilities such archives offer in terms of storytelling: in spite of the banal, everyday situations often reported in the files, they see them as an opportunity to retrieve thrilling stories of surveillance and collaboration.","",""

I argue that this ID card belongs to a larger project of surveillance and regulation of identity developed by the Bolivarian Revolution and implemented by the late Hugo Chavez and continued by current president Nicolas Maduro. Amid its worst economic crisis, the government claims that the new ID card will allow citizens a better access to goods from supermarkets, replacing the fingerprint system (“captahuella”) that provoked massive protests in 2014. Opponents to this document have highlighted the parallel with the cards that exist in Cuba (“ration books”), and the manipulation of the database system to benefit only those who support the government and are already registered in previous official databases. The Venezuelan case provides an intriguing scenario that defies the regional region addressed to provide personal cards to undocumented groups. It also provides valuable comparative lessons about the re-emergence of surveillance technology and identity cards in modern authoritarian regimes.","",""
"2017","The Making of a Totalitarian Surveillance Machine: Surveillance in Turkey Under AKP Rule","This article examines surveillance initiatives under the AKP rule in Turkey (2002-present). The AKP had first tested and perfected surveillance methods, including wiretapping, internet surveillance and surveillance by collaborator-informant networks, over its key opponents and dissidents to capture the state apparatus and later applied similar methods to govern the entire society. In the aftermath of the 2013 Gezi protests, surveillance began to have a mass character, even though targeted surveillance practices continued. Fearful of another popular public revolt, the AKP established a mass surveillance mechanism and empowered it by new amendments to security and communication laws, to pre-empt and suppress public dissent. The recent state of emergency measures following the failed coup attempt in July 2016 represented a further drift towards totalitarian surveillance. The personal liberties were suspended and the state of exception became a permanent condition.","",""

While Trump and Brexit inaugurate a consequential shift, even rupture, in the political terrain, we must not lose sight of places and peoples where American Wars – with European support – were overtly and covertly waged in the decades preceding this ‘global turn’, nor the fate of these places today. We argue that the sustained transfer of sophisticated surveillance technologies, as part and parcel of both direct military assault and more expansive support for security states, has had lasting imperial effects outside imperial centres that reverberate today. We take our point of departure in Pakistan – the site of hundreds of drone bombardments under Obama, one of the top recipients of US military aid, and the largest known recipient of funding from the National Security Agency (NSA) – to argue that ’global turns’ must not forget the rest of the world, and Surveillance Studies may have far to go before it fully addresses its Eurocentrism.","",""
"2017","Social Injustice in Surveillance Capitalism","A rapidly accelerating phase of capitalism based on asymmetrical personal data accumulation poses significant concerns for democratic societies, yet the concepts used to understand and challenge practices of dataveillance are insufficient or poorly elaborated. Against a backdrop of growing corporate power enabled by legal lethargy and the secrecy of the personal data industry, this paper makes explicit how the practices inherent to what Shoshana Zuboff calls ‘surveillance capitalism’ are threats to social justice, based on the normative principle that they prevent parity of participation in social life. This paper draws on Nancy Fraser’s theory of ‘abnormal justice’ to characterize the separation of people from their personal data and its accumulation by corporations as an economic injustice of maldistribution. This initial injustice is also the key mechanism by which further opaque but significant forms of injustice are enabled in surveillance capitalism—sociocultural misrecognition which occurs when personal data are algorithmically processed and subject to categorization, and political misrepresentation which renders people democratically voiceless, unable to challenge misuses of their data. In situating corporate dataveillance practices as a threat to social justice, this paper calls for more explicit conceptual development of the social harms of asymmetrical personal data accumulation and analytics, and more hopefully, attention to the requirements needed to recast personal data as an agent of equality rather than oppression.","",""
"2017","Prolepticon: Anticipatory Citizen Surveillance of the Police","This paper introduces the concept of Prolepticon, describing anticipatory citizen surveillance of the police. Over the past four years, the spread of camera-enabled cellphones has allowed citizens to capture moments of police misconduct that previously would have remained unseen. The impact that this ubiquity of cellphone-wielding citizens has on policing is unclear. Former FBI Director James Comey suggests that the increased scrutiny on the actions of law enforcement through citizen video is causing police to retreat from policing, a phenomenon dubbed the YouTube Effect. I propose that as citizens continue to anticipate negative police-citizen encounters and record the interactions, and as officers internalize the potential of being surveilled by citizens, police are likely to moderate their behavior and engage in more professional policing. Through a series of case examples, I introduce the concept of Prolepticon using the Foucauldian lens of the Panopticon, providing a new paradigm to understand the impact of increased citizen surveillance of the police.

Surveillance and Panopticism as modes of authoritarian governmentality in Austria","This paper follows the question if newly introduced surveillance laws and programmes have led to an authoritarian mode of governmentality in Austria in the light of a higher threat perception. As in other countries, terrorism and crime have undergone a process of securitization in Austria, leading to a higher desire for control in order to tackle those threats. However, while other countries have faced serious attacks on their soil, Austria remains free of substantial threats, still the government has introduced strict surveillance laws. Based on Foucault's concept of governmentality and Dean's assumption that governmentality can contain illiberal techniques and practices in liberal regimes, this paper gives an insight in the rationales behind Austrian surveillance governance.","",""

This lack of ability to gain access to information has several major consequences. First, it has created a call for more information to be gathered. It has also affected federal workers’ privacy and whistleblowing capabilities, encouraged a false trust in a fallible system, and has perpetuated the belief that the BI can actually capture the essence or “whole person” of an individual so much that it can tell the future.  All of these elements are problematic and help show how surveillance proliferates in modern society.","",""

Without changing the Constitution, these laws allow the government to undermine the constitutional rights for individuals. The Conspiracy Law, Abe’s next attempt, focuses on placing people’s everyday communications under scrutiny. Against the modern principal of criminal justice, this law criminalizes the communications regarding crimes, without any criminal actions. Due to its extensively invasive character, the bill has been cancelled three times in the Diet in the past decade, but Abe insists that it is necessary for a successful running of 2020 Olympic in Tokyo as an anti-terror measure. While the Olympic gives the authoritarian government the best opportunity to incite nationalism and stabilize the rule, as the Nazi performed in 1936, surveillance comes forth to eliminate both public and private communications that question, criticize or counter the legitimacy of state power.","",""
"2017","Criticising Surveillance and Surveillance Critique: Why privacy and humanism are necessary but insufficient","The current debate on surveillance, both academic and public, is constantly tempted towards a ‘negative’ criticism of present surveillance systems. In contrast, a ‘positive’ critique would be one which seeks to present alternative ways of thinking, evaluating, and even undertaking surveillance. Surveillance discourse today propagates a host of normative claims about what is admissible as ‘true’, ‘probable’, ‘efficient’ – based upon which it cannot fail to justify itself. A positive critique questions and subverts this epistemological foundation. It believes that surveillance must be held accountable by terms other than those of its own making. The objective is an open debate not only about ‘surveillance or not’, but the possibility of ‘another surveillance’. To demonstrate the necessity of this shift, I first examine two existing frames of criticism. Privacy and humanism (appeal to human rights, freedoms and decency) are necessary but insufficient tools for positive critique. They implicitly accept surveillance’s bargain of trade-offs: the benefit of security ‘measured’ against the cost of rights. To demonstrate paths towards positive critique, I analyse risk and security: two ‘load-bearing’ concepts that ground existing rationalisations of surveillance – and thus are ‘openings’ for reforming those evaluative paradigms and rigged bargains on offer today.","",""

Referring to Garfinkel’s methodical approach of “breaching experiments”, a series of so-called subject access requests according to Austrian data protection law are carried out, with an overall number of 29 private video operators examined. The empirical focus lies on the immediate reaction of the data controllers and their formal way of handling and responding to such requests. The research shows that the subjective right of access is largely refused and undermined, with a series of strategies of denial to be identified. The legally grounded entitlement to access one’s personal data ultimately appears socially illegitimate and mostly not exercisable.

My ongoing study demonstrates, there has appeared a market through which various for-profit institutions are selling data services to help the governments conduct domestic governance in China. Through purchasing the Internet information surveillance system which is based on technologies like data mining, sentiment analysis and cloud computing, most Chinese local governments have incorporated the surveillance of public online opinion into their daily work. This phenomenon implies that a neolibral form of governance which aims at monitoring and guiding public sentiment is taking shape in authoritarian China. ","",""

Based on fieldwork conducted primarily in a migrant shelter in Nogales, Mexico, we find that migrants generally have a fairly sophisticated understanding about U.S. Border Patrol surveillance and technology use and that they consciously engage in forms of resistance or avoidance. Heightened levels of border surveillance may be deterring a minority of migrants from attempting immediate future crossings, but most interviewees were undeterred in their desire to enter the U.S., preferring to find ways to avoid government surveillance. Furthermore, migrants exhibit a general lack of trust in the “promise” of technology to improve their circumstances and increase their safety during clandestine border-crossing—often due to fears that technology use makes them vulnerable to state surveillance, tracking, and arrest.","",""

Rawls is widely acknowledged as having played an important role in how we perceive freedom and liberty in Western democracies today, and his work on justice, fairness and liberty appears to be a great source of knowledge for politicians, policy-makers and activists. Several recent events and threats to national security of a technological nature have raised ethical questions about the relationship between state and citizen and how technological power should be divided between these two parties, particularly when it comes to the right to privacy. However, in contrast with a wide-spread perception of Rawls’ work, this article shows that there are cases in which Rawls’ principles actually place a limitation on liberty in these matters. This paper presents a thought experiment in which it becomes clear that Rawls’ advocacy for liberty did not extend to cases in which social cooperation in a well-ordered society would be obstructed. Based on a study of Rawls’ work, the author concludes that whereas Rawls would consider strong encryption both necessary and ethical, completely unbreakable encryption would be considered a violation of social cooperation and thus indefensible for Rawls.","",""

We analyze five actual privacy cases from the Canadian private sector, investigated by the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, and examine whether the privacy “wrong” experienced by Canadian complainants would be illegal in the U.S., how an individual would proceed with a complaint and what the outcome might be. We attempt therefore to bring the debate away from the typically abstract institutional and legal approach to the level of the regime’s practical effectiveness. Despite well-documented flaws in the Canadian privacy protection system, from the point of view of the average citizen, it provides a more consistent, transparent, accessible and effective means for making privacy complaints and having them investigated and resolved, especially when the personal data is captured online.","",""

We argue that the predominant privacy protection regimes based on the privacy self-management framework of “notice and choice” not only fail to protect individual privacy, but also underplay privacy as a collective good. To illustrate this claim, we discuss how two possible individual strategies—withdrawal from the market (avoidance) and complete reliance on market-provided privacy protections (assimilation)—may result in less privacy options available to the society at large. We conclude by discussing how acknowledging the collective dimension of privacy could provide more meaningful alternatives for privacy protection. ","",""

We use Nissenbaum’s framework of contextual integrity to show how the informational norms associated with biometrics in security and policing - their contexts of emergence - are grafted on-line social networks onto their context of iteration. Our analysis reveals a process that has inadvertently influenced the way users understand face recognition, precluding critical questioning of its wider use. It provides an important deepening of contextually-driven approaches to privacy by showing the process through which contexts are co-constitutive of informational norms. Citizens are also offered a critical tool for understanding the trajectory of biometrics and reflect on the data practices associated with the use of face recognition in social media and society at large.

Typically, these popular media accounts are based on adults’ prescriptive views of youths’ attitudes and behaviors. Using qualitative methods including background questionnaires and focus groups, we gathered older teens’ attitudes about online privacy and safety to provide a more complete narrative from a teen perspective. Findings suggest that older teens are concerned with their online privacy and feel discomfort with unintended audiences seeing their personal information, yet most feel tension to share personal information with friends. They are less concerned about safety, tending to feel safe online and to employ protective measures, but viewing older and younger generations as less knowledgeable about online safety. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for teaching teens about online privacy and safety. ","",""

In this article, we propose that cultural factors influence the perception of privacy risks and social gratifications. Based on survey data collected from participants from five countries (Germany [ n = 740], the Netherlands [ n = 89], the United Kingdom [ n = 67], the United States [ n = 489], and China [ n = 165]), we successfully replicated the privacy calculus. Furthermore, we found that culture plays an important role: As expected, people from cultures ranking high in individualism found it less important to generate social gratifications on SNSs as compared to people from collectivist-oriented countries. However, the latter placed greater emphasis on privacy risks—presumably to safeguard the collective. Furthermore, we identified uncertainty avoidance to be a cultural dimension crucially influencing the perception of SNS risks and benefits. As expected, people from cultures ranking high in uncertainty avoidance found privacy risks to be more important when making privacy-related disclosure decisions. At the same time, these participants ascribed lower importance to social gratifications—possibly because social encounters are perceived to be less controllable in the social media environment.

"2017","Social Media Users’ Legal Consciousness About Privacy"," This article explores the ways in which the concept of privacy is understood in the context of social media and with regard to users’ awareness of privacy policies and laws in the ‘Post-Snowden’ era. In the light of presumably increased public exposure to privacy debates, generated partly due to the European “Right to be Forgotten” ruling and the Snowden revelations on mass surveillance, this article explores users’ meaning-making of privacy as a matter of legal dimension in terms of its violations and threats online and users’ ways of negotiating their Internet use, in particular social networking sites. Drawing on the concept of legal consciousness, this article explores through focus group interviews the ways in which social media users negotiate privacy violations and what role their understanding of privacy laws (or lack thereof) might play in their strategies of negotiation. The findings are threefold: first, privacy is understood almost universally as a matter of controlling one’s own data, including information disclosure even to friends, and is strongly connected to issues about personal autonomy; second, a form of resignation with respect to control over personal data appears to coexist with a recognized need to protect one’s private data, while respondents describe conscious attempts to circumvent systems of monitoring or violation of privacy, and third, despite widespread coverage of privacy legal issues in the press, respondents’ concerns about and engagement in “self-protecting” tactics derive largely from being personally affected by violations of law and privacy.

This participatory, collaborative study of 28 low-SES young adults in the New York City area investigates how they view online information sharing. Like most Americans, our participants viewed online privacy as an individual responsibility. We make two primary contributions. First, participants revealed extensive awareness of the risks of sharing information online, and many avoided social media, self-censored, or obfuscated their contributions as a result. Second, many participants had extensive experience with policing and physical surveillance and were aware they could not avoid such encounters through their own efforts. This window into structural discrimination provides an alternate frame to that of “individual responsibility” that educators and researchers can use to conceptualize how privacy is violated online. Framing online privacy violations as inevitable and widespread may not only help foster activist anger and strategic resistance but also avoid the victim-blaming narratives of some media literacy efforts. By examining the experiences of these young people, who are often left out of mainstream discussions about privacy, we hope to show how approaches to managing the interplay of on- and offline information flows are related to marginalized social and economic positions.

We explore in depth the company Affectiva’s attempts to translate, represent and schematize human emotions, as they raise a variety of problems and issues of uncertainty. We analyse the uncertainties concerning the processing of the human face ‘as image’ due to issues concerning temporality and static images as well as polyphony and modulations of the spectrum of expressions. One of our key arguments concerns the temporal character of human emotions, and we address how algorithmically regulated protocols of discretization may be said to prompt specific patterns of emotional responses and expressions based on an ideal of eliminating uncertainty. Through discussions via art pieces by Lauren McCarthy and Kyle McDonald, we question what happens when the protocols of computer systems start to perform aspects of emotional labour for us, making judgments by predicting adequate emotional responses based on the use of the strict metrics criticized in the article.","",""

The operative and the report, Pinkerton's principal surveillance technologies, are analyzed here in relation to each other and in their historical development as information technology, drawing on Pinkerton's fictionalized accounts of cases, secret reports, and other agency documents. Pinkerton management was consistently preoccupied with strict compliance of operatives, their deployment in a network, and the regular submission of reports. This study suggests that information can lead to uncertainty and that the surveillance state was and is compartmentalized, entrepreneurial, and other-than-public.","",""

We explore this dynamic in the context of retail stores by investigating how retailers’ collection of data about customers facilitates new forms of managerial control over workers. We identify four mechanisms through which refractive surveillance might occur in retail work, involving dynamic labor scheduling, new forms of evaluation, externalization of worker knowledge, and replacement through customer self-service. Our research suggests that the effects of surveillance cannot be fully understood without considering how populations might be managed on the basis of data collected about others.","",""
"2018","Privacy at the Margins| Understanding Privacy at the Margins—Introduction","While privacy and surveillance affect different populations in disparate ways, they are often treated as monolithic concepts by journalists, privacy advocates, and researchers. Achieving privacy is especially difficult for those who are marginalized in other areas of life. This special issue interrogates what privacy looks like at the margins, investigating a broad spectrum of issues, methodologies, and contexts. Many make an intervention into mainstream theories of privacy and surveillance, showing how examining the experiences of individuals outside the normative white, American, middle-class subject often complicates assumptions about how privacy operates. Others examine the mundane and the banal in order to analyze how power relations play out in everyday life. By incorporating research outside the canon of privacy research, and by advocating for projects that discuss more diverse conceptualizations of “the user” or the subject, we can envision a future for privacy scholarship that incorporates a wider set of harms and needs, and encompasses the concerns of a larger base of citizens.","",""

Information on privacy attitudes and behaviors and the uses and gratifications (U&G) of social media was gathered through a survey from 353 social media users and analyzed using multivariate multiple regression. Results indicate that social media privacy activities take place at multiple levels, are engaged at points of Internet and application access, and are socially enacted and technologically reinforced. Further, we demonstrate that certain contexts of social media use result in specific privacy-producing behaviors within this hierarchy. These findings provide empirical support for Nissenbaum’s framework of privacy as a contextual practice, as they demonstrate that privacy behaviors adapt to the situated use of social media.","",""

The records collected through the IRSSA represent the most comprehensive documentation of violence against Indigenous populations in Canada: data that range from personal testimonials and records, medical histories, and institutional documents to tested legal statements regarding physical and sexual abuse and its effects. The implementation of the IRSSA has been punctuated by legal conflicts that mobilize discourses and laws centering on liberal-conceived rights concerning access to information and privacy. In this article, we examine how liberal discourses of privacy knowledge and uses of privacy law inform histories and futures of Indigenous and settler memory in the context of state-based violence. The article reveals how liberal notions of privacy, when mobilized alongside federally mandated policies of reconciliation, may reproduce the structural violence of settler colonial governance in liberal democracies.","",""

Using a door-to-door paper-and-pencil household census of public housing communities in a major American city, this study examined three layers of digital privacy experiences among public housing residents—privacy concerns, privacy skills, and privacy-compromising activities. Results showed that privacy concerns are one of the major reasons that hinder residents from adopting the Internet. Regression analysis revealed significant gaps in digital privacy skills among residents by generation and by having private Internet access or not. Moreover, higher levels of privacy skills and relatively private Internet access contribute to more frequent engagement in digital activities that can compromise privacy. This research provides valuable insights on how privacy concerns and skills affect digital inclusion in a marginalized population.","",""

"2018","Counter-surveillance and alternative new media in Turkey","ABSTRACT This study, drawing on alternative media and networked social movements, explores the counter-surveillance practices and oppositional imaginaries of activist citizen journalists (ACJs) in Turkey to combat the surveillance strategies of the authoritarian Turkish government. After the failed coup attempt in July 2016, the ruling party has become more suspicious of dissent of any kind. However, the ACJs who use mobile communication and social media as channels for journalism and counter-surveillance continue their critical journalistic work in this context. Using ethnographic data collected from interviews with these media activists, this study focuses on oppositional imaginaries regarding the surveillance culture as well as counter-surveillance tactics, both offensive and defensive. To do so, we conducted 22 in-depth interviews with the representatives of alternative new media (ANM) initiatives and ACJs who were gathering, producing and disseminating news at the time of the study (between January and July 2017). Backed by the available literature on interdisciplinary approaches, data were gathered from the interviews, thematically coded and critically analysed. The whole process of news-making that criticises the authoritarian surveillance state stands out as an offensive tactic. On the other hand, defensive tactics are very closely related to the safety of journalists, their sources and data. The paper argues that the variety of offensive and defensive tactics should be increased and they should be substantially improved. The study also sheds light on the need for more detailed and extensive interdisciplinary research.","",""

"2018","The privacy paradox: how market privacy facilitates government surveillance","ABSTRACT Although most surveillance studies scholars assume privacy is antithetical to surveillance, critics have recently warned that privacy-based criticisms may facilitate surveillance. That being said, we do not yet have data that show whether privacy claims were used in the past to legitimate government surveillance. This paper addresses that gap by analyzing claims made over one of the U.S.’s most controversial surveillance issues: government control over encryption technologies. A review of Congressional hearings and statements on the Congressional Record (n = 112) reveals that from 1993 to 1999, public debates were dominated by a market liberalization discourse in which participants supported loosening encryption controls as a way to protect privacy from criminal intrusions in market transactions. Also playing a role was a strong skepticism toward government power and a preference for markets as managers of crime prevention. Challenged by these critiques, lawmakers withdrew regulatory proposals and spent the following decade working quietly with private firms to ensure law enforcement surveillance capability. These findings show the expansion of privacy for consumers and entrepreneurs has in fact been used to achieve the contraction of privacy from law enforcement and intelligence agencies.","",""
"2018","Privacy encounters in Teledialogue","ABSTRACT Privacy is a major concern when new technologies are introduced between public authorities and private citizens. What is meant by privacy, however, is often unclear and contested. Accordingly, this article utilises grounded theory to study privacy empirically in the research and design project Teledialogue aimed at introducing new ways for public case managers and placed children to communicate through IT. The resulting argument is that privacy can be understood as an encounter, that is, as something that arises between implicated actors and entails some degree of friction and negotiation. An argument which is further qualified through the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze. The article opens with a review of privacy literature before continuing to present privacy as an encounter with five different foci: what technologies bring into the encounter; who is related to privacy by implication; what is entailed by the spaces of Teledialogue; how privacy relates to projected futures; and how privacy is also an encounter between authority and care. In the end, it is discussed how privacy conceptualised as an encounter is not already there surrounding people or places but rather has to be traced in the specific and situated relations between implicated actors, giving rise to different normative concerns in each case.","",""

"2018","The horizons of technological control: automated surveillance in the New York subway","ABSTRACT Surveillance technologies may be capable of monitoring a domain, but they need a sufficiently orderly domain to monitor. This article examines the secretive effort to institute artificial-intelligence-based ‘smart surveillance’ in the New York subway, using object- and pattern-recognition algorithms to identify dangerous activities in video feeds, such as a person abandoning a package. By considering the necessary preconditions for computer vision systems to recognize patterns and objects, I show how smart surveillance was challenged by the lack of visual and social uniformities necessary for smart surveillance systems to make its fine-toothed distinctions. In spite of vast resources and involvement of a major military contractor, the project was eventually deemed a failure. Although problems in computer vision are being incrementally solved, those improvements do not yet add up to a holistic technology capable of parsing the real-world ambiguity of open-ended settings which do not meet the assumptions of the detection algorithms. In the absence of technologies that can handle the actual mess, the world itself must cooperate, but it often does not. The article demonstrates the importance of looking beyond the claims of technical efficacy in the study of security and surveillance to discover how technologies of inspection and control actually work, as a means to cut through the heavy rhetorical packaging in which they are sold to their publics.","",""

Interpersonal panopticism serves as a theoretical account of the fluid nature of watching and being watched in relationships, especially in consideration of how intimate relationships and sexualities are surveilled and controlled in a digital era. To articulate the utility and potentials of this theoretical approach, we offer five cultural propositions that serve as a basis for interpersonal panopticism. Collectively these propositions illustrate the utility and potentials of unpacking the interplay of surveillance, heteronormativity, and affect through an interpersonal panoptic lens.","",""

To fill this gap, we examine the sharing–privacy nexus by exploring the privacy threats associated with Internet-mediated sharing. Given the popularity of sharing services, users seem quite willing to share goods and services despite the compounded informational and physical privacy threats associated with such sharing. We develop and test a framework for analyzing the effect of privacy concerns on sharing that considers institutional and social privacy threats, trust and social-hedonic as well as monetary motives.","",""

Furthermore, the electoral officials need to be trained intensively to operate the machines and given guidance on how to handle situations when breakdowns occur. While biometric technology does introduce powerful capabilities, it is just one piece of a complex human activity system.","",""

They have been accused of sweeping up massive amounts of information without evidence of the technologies being effective in improving security. The view of critics is clear, but what do intelligence officials themselves say? This paper analyzes statements of intelligence officials in the U.S. and U.K. from 2006 to 2016, examines what criteria officials use in their discourse on effectiveness, and investigates how considerations of cost and proportionality factor into the equation. It identifies seven measures of effectiveness in the statements of intelligence officials, and finds that cost, though rarely discussed, is the driver behind formalized evaluations of surveillance programs.","",""
"2018","The surveillant consumer"," We argue that modern technical and social infrastructures of surveillance have brought a novel subject position to prominence: the surveillant consumer. Surveillance has become a normalized mode of interpersonal relation that urges the person as consumer to manage others around her using surveillant products and services. We explore two configurations of this model: the consumer as observer, effectuated through products for use in the supervision of intimate relations as a component of a normalized duty of care; and the consumer as manager, effectuated through capacities for the customer to manage the labor of workers providing services to her. These models frequently intersect and hybridize as market logics overlap with intimate spheres: the surveillant consumer thus acts as an emotional manager of the experience of everyday surveillance. In turn, this managerial role reifies the equation of financial wealth with moral weight in a hierarchy of oversight, giving the wealthiest the most control and least accountability. ","",""

While government surveillance of activists is well-documented in scholarly research and the media, corporate surveillance of activists remains under-researched. This article examines BP’s surveillance of activists who criticise the company’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) programme as ‘greenwashing’. In this way, it goes beyond corporations’ uses of big data and instead explores how they monitor and discuss strategies for responding to the activities of individual activists in social media. It shows that while social media afford an unprecedented level of visibility for activists, it comes with the risk of being monitored by corporations. Theoretically, it draws on conceptions of visibility in social sciences and media studies as well as literature on activism and political participation in media studies. Empirically, it draws on files from BP on specific civil society individuals obtained through Subject Access Requests under the UK Data Protection Act 1998 as well as press responses from BP. ","",""

After the Federal Communications Commission issued the 1952 Sixth Report and Order, many schools and communities sought to bring educational television to the classroom. However, this model was financially out of reach for most. CCTV was a more affordable version of educational television that could cater to specific classroom needs and allow schools to create their own in-house network. CCTV represents just one of many new technologies that have been promoted as ideal for classroom instruction over the last century. Using articles and advertisements from popular press magazines, educational journals, books, and archival materials, this article seeks to illuminate the ‘social practices and conflicts’ that contributed to the conversations around CCTV’s classroom utility. It concludes by connecting CCTV’s promotion in the 1950s to more recent new media technologies. ","",""

"2018","Regulating Visibility: Secrecy and Surveillance in Insular Religious Communities","Insular religious communities offer significant insights into some of the issues facing contemporary Western societies, including the issues of religious secrecy and surveillance. The role of secrecy in these communities involves dynamic strategies invoked for many reasons in equally numerous contexts. The behaviours and practices of these groups often reflect much larger issues present in today’s society. In this way, they can guide us in understanding the role of surveillance from a sociological perspective in the current climate of tensions and anxieties. These communities are especially useful for thinking about questions of why some religious groups rigidly control and restrict access to bodies of secret, sacred knowledge or activities and in turn how religious secrecy is viewed by the wider social worlds in which their degree of visibility fluctuates. Here, I suggest an opportunity emerges for the study of secrecy in relation to the notion of regulating visibility by reorienting the focus from the roles of secrets and of secretive practices to one that also considers the more visible forms and strategies through which secrets and secretive practices come to be and are sustained.","",""

It is in this context that Muslim New Yorkers partly rely on Islamic theology to question their experience with state surveillance. As this article demonstrates, Muslim interpretations of theology tend to see suspicion and surveillance as sinful conduct, rendering the mission of the informant sinful in the eyes of Muslim New Yorkers. Moreover, as suspicion, monitoring, and spreading rumors is often interpreted as Islamically sinful, targets of surveillance often feel conflicted about suspecting a fellow Muslim of being an informant or even discussing such suspicions with other individuals. Moreover, relying on Islamic theology to deal with their experience as surveilled subjects does not prevent Muslims from toning down their religious visibility in order to avoid state surveillance because of chilling effects and the mechanisms of internment of the psyche.","",""

Respondents can be categorised into two groups with significant differences in their perceptions of online surveillance, quality of regulation, trust in institutions, and trust in other people. The more online-privacy concerned group consists of on average less educated, older people, who spend less time online. Also, there are more females in this cluster. The main finding is that internet users who are very concerned about online surveillance tend to have limited trust in both the government and other people and limited faith in the ability of regulation to protect them. More concerned people tend to adopt countersurveillance strategies such as providing false data on the internet.","",""
"2018","Surveillance, Panopticism, and Self-Discipline in the Digital Age","The objective of this paper is to revisit the metaphor of the Panopticon, borrowed by Michel Foucault from Jeremy Bentham to describe the development of disciplinary institutions in Western societies from the early nineteenth century, and to examine its relevance for the analysis of modern electronic means of surveillance. Widely used in the early stages of the study of new surveillance technologies, the metaphor of the Panopticon, particularly in the field of ‘surveillance studies,’ is growingly seen as inadequate to understand the impact of the latest surveillance tools and practices. This paper seeks to show that dominant interpretations of Foucault’s use of Panopticon as referring to techniques of domination or to ‘power over,’ while legitimate as regards some of his earlier writings, overlook Foucault’s later works on technologies of the self. That is, in Panoptic dispositifs in particular, as well as in settings involving power/knowledge configurations defining ‘normality’ more generally, individuals may end up exercising power over themselves without any coercion. It is argued here that the development of modern information and communication technologies may be said to produce a setting, the description of which as ‘panoptic’ is even more pertinent than was the case with respect to Western societies of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Building upon recent empirical works on the ‘chilling effect,’ particularly in the wake of Edward Snowden’s revelations in 2013, the article discusses modern technologies of the self—self-restraint and self-censorship—that new technologies, enabling different forms of surveillance, produce in Western societies. It also outlines the areas in which the notion of the Panopticon may be useful in terms of guiding research into self-discipline and self-restraint in the context of the proliferation of modern techniques of surveillance.","",""

Results indicate that police departments that underrepresent African Americans in the community are more likely to use or plan to implement surveillance technology, controlling for a range of agency-and contextual-level factors. One potential explanation for these findings is that surveillance technology operates as a form of social control that is differentially applied to racial minorities to manage what is perceived to be a greater proclivity toward criminal behavior. The implications of these findings are discussed.","",""
"2018","Seeing through the Data Shadow: Communing with the Saints in a Surveillance Society","The political theologian Amy Laura Hall has recently suggested that the proliferation of security cameras can be read as an index displaying the quality of a given community’s social fabric. The aim of the paper is to show why this is a plausible reading of the Christian tradition that also helpfully illuminates the various cultural phenomena in western societies that are collectively indicated by the label “surveillance.” The Swedish theologian Ola Sigurdson’s account of modern regimes of perception substantiates this latter claim. An alternative political proposal is then developed around an account of the divine gaze that differs from the panoptic gaze of modernity. This theological positioning of the trusting gaze as ontologically fundamental for human community is paired with an acceptance of the limits of human sight and the multivalence of human knowing. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of the gaze of the saints in training Christian vision to see beyond the characteristic ways of seeing and participating in the social organism characteristic of modern liberal surveillance societies. This conclusion implies, further, that one of the most important ways that the most denuding aspects of the surveillance society can be resisted is by drawing the gatekeepers who do the watching out in to public converse.","",""

While movies are frequent references throughout the scholarship, such citations tend to be limited to plot and imagery and overlook the ways in which the medium can be subject to state intervention or other forms of censorship and self-censorship. This essay uses the case of the 2015 Hong Kong independent film Ten Years to explore how cinema deserves to be considered alongside other media and communications whose vulnerability to institutional control and monitoring are already widely documented by surveillance studies. The film, which reflects Hong Kong residents’ critique of mounting Chinese power, was the object of an aggressive vilification and repression campaign by the mainland Chinese government. It also spawned a grassroots defense in which audiences and filmmakers mobilized around the film as a symbol and site of civic discourse and political critique. Using the concepts of participatory media and online activism and connecting Ten Years with Hong Kong’s 2014 “Umbrella” protests against Chinese rule, this essay shows how cinema invites the same interventions and interactivity as social media and other digital or communications technologies. Indeed, because Ten Years’ history of populist activism resembles well-known instances of media mobilization such as the Arab Spring and Black Lives Matter, this essay demonstrates not only cinema’s multiple dimensions of relevance for surveillance studies but also uncovers new global spaces whose film history will diversify surveillance studies.","",""

I argue that the most significant of Snowden's disclosures have been the Five Eyes agencies’ systematic compromise of the technologies, networks, and standards in use within their own countries and abroad. Attacks on domestic infrastructure contradict the defensive posture of these agencies but are consistent with the project of cyber security as defined by the Five Eyes. The cyber security project of the Five Eyes nations is expansive in scope and has proceeded along dangerous lines. By assigning signals intelligence agencies the dual role of exploiting IT systems as well as securing them, a contradiction has been baked into our evolving notion of cyber security. A comprehensive response should include political and legal reforms, disentangling the Five Eyes' offensive and defensive roles, and narrowing the scope of the cyber security project. However, the most effective forms of resistance for individuals and institutions so far have been through an increased emphasis on IT security practices.     ","",""

First, the paper analyzes how the state’s surveillance moves engendered lateral and anti-surveillance practices. Second, Eric Stoddart’s concept of (in)visibility is used as an analytical framework to track how both the surveilling entity (the state and community surveillers) and the surveilled (religious bodies and their members) actively partook in constructing the visibility and invisibility of the surveilled. The paper concludes that the state’s theoretical ambition of religious surveillance was not fully matched in practice, as implementation was mediated by a pragmatic blend of “seeing” and “unseeing.” Also, the response of the religious sects to the surveillance involved a strategic pursuit of simultaneous visibility and invisibility.","",""

The first two sections of the paper explore the development of surveillance under the first three Tokugawa leaders. The following sections focus on the evolution of these systems (the recruitment of informants, temple registration, the composition of registries, and tests of faith) in subsequent periods and includes some short passages from previously untranslated contemporaneous documents. Finally, the paper offers some thoughts on the efficacy of anti-Christian surveillance, arguing that the toleration of the existence of hidden communities resulted from changes in Christian behaviour that made them harder to discover and a willingness on the part of the authorities to tolerate illegal activity due to economic disincentive and a reduction in the threat that Christianity posed.","",""

In such a milieu, the spectacle of football can suddenly shift to symbolic and factual violence. One of the main tools of the complex Italian counter hooliganism model (CHM) is the Tessera del tifoso, a compulsory fan ID scheme adopted in 2009 to curb football spectator violence. This paper attempts to systematically evaluate this scheme for the first time, adopting as its conceptual frame Giorgio Agamben’s concepts of the state of exception, bare life, the (concentration) camp, and dispositivo (apparatus). It is argued that the Tessera del tifoso serves as a most prominent example of a CHM based on a permanent state of exception manifested by an increase in State surveillance, control, and regulation of fans’ lives with potential implications for their civil liberties and freedom.","",""

Recently, it has taken on another dimension as issues of proselytism (conversion) and the movement of “Ghar Wapsi” or homecoming (reconversion) increasingly endanger the peaceful coexistence of India’s population. Growing religious intolerance to religious minorities under the influence of Hindutva—an ideological persuasion to establish the hegemony of Hindu beliefs and way of life—increases this distorted behaviour and encourages Hindu fundamentalism. This paper investigates this issue of state surveillance of religious minorities, focusing on certain political conspiracies and the perverted behaviour of some religious fundamentalist groups operating behind the veneer of constitutional secularism and state-determined coercive power control. With an analytical and critical discourse methodology, this paper argues that minority religious communities in India are key targets of surveillance and subject to manipulative (political and religious) interests that go against Indian liberalism. Thus, we find in the Indian case a categorical dissimilarity with the West regarding the focus of religious surveillance.","",""
"2018","Review of Lauer's Creditworthy: A History of Consumer Surveillance and Financial Identity in America","In September 2017, Equifax, a leading credit reporting agency, announced a security breach that may have jeopardized the personal information, including Social Security Numbers, of nearly half the American population. In the wake of the breach, the government’s Internal Revenue Service (IRS) awarded a nowsuspended $7.2 million contract, perhaps ironically, to Equifax to verify taxpayer identity. In Creditworthy, Josh Lauer offers many insights that help contextualize that headline: he provides a history of credit that puts the spotlight on the hitherto largely undocumented development of credit institutions to link 19th Century surveillance regimes to 21st Century financialization; he traces the development of how credit reporting agencies use capitalist surveillance as a tool that now gathers information about millions of consumers; he shows how the textualizing of bodies (such as with Social Security Numbers) for the purposes of social monitoring has commercial rather than state origins; and he shows how government agencies—including the Department of Justice, FBI, IRS, and police—have depended on consumer data from credit institutions since at least World War I.","",""

In this article I posit that colonial surveillance at religious sites is different—that, unlike in other colonial spaces, the particularities of holy sites as arenas of contestation can enlarge the scope of worshippers’ negotiation of state surveillance technologies and practices, while enabling new modes of claim-making of rights and resources articulated through surveillance. I draw on the case study of Haram-al-Sharif/Temple Mount, a site in occupied East Jerusalem holy to both Muslim and Jewish worshippers, to explore how different surveillance policies and practices are articulated and contested at religious sites in a (settler) colonial setting. I examine three facets of surveillance employed at this holy site: Israeli digital surveillance, Palestinian grassroots sousveillance, and internationally prescribed adjudicating surveillance. Through an examination of these different facets, this article investigates how particular religious, national, and citizenship claims emerge when surveillance is leveraged in order to balance, mitigate, or resolve conflicts.","",""
"2018","Intelligence Sector Reforms in Romania: A Scorecard","Since 1989, reforms have sought to align the Romanian post-communist intelligence community with its counterparts in established democracies. Enacted reluctantly and belatedly at the pressure of civil society actors eager to curb the mass surveillance of communist times and international partners wishing to rein in Romania’s foreign espionage and cut its ties to intelligence services of non-NATO countries, these reforms have revamped legislation on state security, retrained secret agents, and allowed for participation in NATO operations, but paid less attention to oversight and respect for human rights. Drawing on democratization, transitional justice, and security studies, this article evaluates the capacity of the Romanian post-communist intelligence reforms to break with communist security practices of unchecked surveillance and repression and to adopt democratic values of oversight and respect for human rights. We discuss the presence of communist traits after 1989 (seen as continuity) and their absence (seen as discontinuity) by offering a wealth of examples. The article is the first to evaluate security reforms in post-communist Romania in terms of their capacity to not only overhaul the personnel and operations inherited from the Securitate and strengthen oversight by elected officials, but also make intelligence services respectful of basic human rights.","",""
"2018","Surveillance, Secular Law, and the Reconstruction of Islam in the United States","Surveillance is often understood as simply a tool for collecting information, and opposition to the surveillance practices of the US government frequently relies on the analytical framework of privacy and rights violations. Other critical analyses of surveillance practices use the lenses of racial discrimination and/or neocolonial political domination. While all of these are valuable approaches, they downplay the extent to which specific modes of existence and ways of being have been targeted in the current surveillance paradigm. In this paper I discuss the role of religion and its relationship to the law—in other words, the state’s control of “appropriate” religion—in defining surveillance practices. Using critical interpretive and deconstructive readings of the discourse surrounding the surveillance paradigm, I show that surveillance is used as an instrument to revise and alter modes of non-Western moral and ethical life and to render human subjects more suitable for assimilation into the burgeoning secular/liberal world order, including its concept of “appropriate” religion. I argue that the current mode of government suspicion and surveillance in the US continues long-standing demarcations between acceptable and unacceptable religion in secular law (and in liberal/secular Western societies more broadly), and I demonstrate how this paradigm subordinates and marginalizes non-Protestant religions. In order to fully understand the US surveillance state, we need to pay attention to the way that secular order attempts to define and shape non-Protestant religions and in so doing endangers its own democratic principles of tolerance and neutrality.","",""

My observational analysis of a videostreaming community reveals the central role that surveillance plays in participating and becoming visible in an online environment. The results show that through disciplinary and lateral surveillance, participants produced context-defined I-narrations and formed themselves following the normative judgment of the environment. The same mechanism may be observed in other videostreaming social media environments and the modern social media-saturated society in general. This is an inconspicuous way to produce surveillant individualism. Contrary to the notion of exploitative participation, this study reveals the productive power of surveillance. My research suggests that disciplinary power is integrated into the everyday in online DIY environments and it creates the space and framework for communication in these environments. Surveillance practices offer empowering means for forming identities.","",""
"2018","Terrorists and Revolutionaries: The Achilles Heel of Communist Surveillance","The scholarly understanding of communist state surveillance practices remains limited. Utilising thousands of recently declassified archival materials from communist Czechoslovakia, this article aims to revise our understanding of everyday security practices and surveillance under communist regimes, which have thus far been overwhelmingly understood in relation to the domestic population and social control. In the 1970s and 1980s, Czechoslovakia attracted the Cold War terrorist and revolutionary elite. Visits by the likes of Carlos the Jackal, Munich Olympic massacre mastermind Abu Daoud, and key PLO figures in Prague were closely surveilled by the Czechoslovak State Security (StB). This article investigates the motifs and performance of a wide range of mechanisms that the StB utilised to surveil violent non-state actors, including informer networks and SIGINT. It argues that in the last decade of the Cold War, Prague adopted a “surveillance-centred” approach to international terrorists on its territory—arguably enabled by informal “non-aggression pacts.” Furthermore, it challenges the notion that the communist state security structures were omnipotent surveillance mechanisms. Despite having spent decades perfecting their grip on domestic dissent, when confronted with foreign, unfamiliar, and uncontrollable non-state actors engaged in terrorism or political violence, these ominous institutions were often shown to be anxious, inept, and at times impotent. Finally, it explores the parallel state approaches to international terrorists and revolutionaries, and their shortcomings, across the Iron Curtain jurisdictions. Overall, this article seeks to expand our understanding of the broad and varied complexities of intelligence and surveillance in communist regimes.","",""

"2018","Surveillance and the Body in the Millennium Trilogy","A growing discourse in surveillance studies is leading the field away from socially neutral theories and introducing methodologies that account for factors such as gender, race, ethnicity, class, and sexual orientation. However, scholarship on surveillance in the arts, among which voyeurism and panopticism remain dominant, has been slower to adopt models that address these sociological dimensions of surveillance. This interdisciplinary article argues for expanding the theoretical and sociological scope of scholarship on surveillance in the arts, using Stieg Larsson’s Millennium novels and the Swedish films adapted from them as a case study. This series of narratives features three scopic regimes: the state’s surveillance apparatus, the protagonist’s own surveillant gaze, and the male gaze, each of which operates on and through the body of the central character, Lisbeth Salander. These representations, as so many others, demand that we break away from the panoptic model and employ a theoretically intersectional approach. The author integrates theories from surveillance studies, feminist film theory, and the social sciences to develop such an approach.","",""

However, as technologies for traffic surveillance have developed, so too have technologies enabling individuals to monitor and countersurveil these measures. One of the most recent forms of these countersurveillance platforms can be found on Facebook, where dedicated regional and national RBT and ‘police presence’ pages publicly post the locations of various forms of police surveillance in real-time. In this article, we argue that Facebook RBT pages exemplify a new form of social media facilitated countersurveillance we term crowdsourced countersurveillance: the use of knowledge-discovery and management crowdsourcing to facilitate surveillance discovery, avoidance, and countersurveillance. Crowdsourced countersurveillance, we argue, represents a form of countersurveillant assemblage: an ensemble of individuals, technologies, and data flows that, more than the sum of their parts, function together to neutralize surveillance measures. Facilitated by affordances for crowdsourcing, aggregating, and crowdmapping geographical data information on surveillance actors, crowdsourced countersurveillance provides a means of generating ‘hybrid heterotopias’: mediated counter-sites that enable individuals to contest and circumvent surveilled spatial arrangements.","",""
"2018","Protesters’ Reactions to Video Surveillance of Demonstrations: Counter-Moves, Security Cultures, and the Spiral of Surveillance and Counter-Surveillance","This article analyses protesters’ reactions to police video surveillance of demonstrations in Germany. Theoretically, we draw on the concept of a “spiral of surveillance and counter-surveillance” to understand the interaction processes which—intentionally or not—contribute to the deepening of the “surveillant assemblage” in the field of protest policing. After introducing video surveillance and its importance for selective protest policing, we discuss concepts of counter-surveillance. Widening the individualist scope of former research on “neutralisation techniques,” collective and interactive dimensions are added to cover the full counter-surveillance repertoire. We identified six basic categories of counter-surveillance moves: consider cameras, disguise, attack, hide, sousveillance, and cooperation. They can be classified along the axes of (a) degree of cooperation with the police, and (b) directedness (inwards/outward). It becomes obvious that activists are not predominantly deterred by video surveillance but adapt to the situation. If and how certain counter-surveillance moves are applied depends on the degree of exposure, perceptions of conflict dynamics, political interpretations, and on how these factors are processed in the respective security cultures. Security cultures, which are grounded in the respective relations between protest groups and police, are collective sets of practices and interpretive patterns aimed at securing safety and/or anonymity of activists as well as making their claims visible. Thus, they are productive power effects, resulting from the very conditions under which protest takes place in contemporary surveillance societies. This article elaborates on these ambiguities and unintended effects with regard to sousveillance and disguise techniques, such as masking or uniform clothing. The analysis is based on qualitative data collected between 2011 and 2016 consisting of group discussions and interviews with activists from different political spectra, journalists, politicians, and police officers, as well as observations of demonstrations and document analyses of movement literature.","",""

These animations serve as technical phenomena translating moments of affective and emotional expression into mediated socially legible forms. Through an analysis of these objects and the broader literature on digital animation, this paper critiques the ways these facial recognition systems classify and categorize racial identities in human faces. The paper considers the potential both for racializing logics as part of these systems of classification, and how data regarding emotional expression gathered through these systems might interact with identity-based forms of classification.","",""

Findings at the global level support the socializing role of Facebook in cultivating more relaxed privacy attitudes, subsequently increasing self-disclosure in both offline and online contexts. However, longitudinal trends indicate that while risk perceptions increased for heavy users, they remained stable for light users.

Drawing on research with British police, we contextualize these algorithmic processes within actual police practices, focusing on protest policing. Although aspects of algorithmic decision-making have become prominent in police practice, our research shows that they are embedded within a continuous human–computer negotiation that incorporates a rooted claim to ‘professional judgement’, an integrated intelligence context and a significant level of discretion. This context, we argue, transforms conceptions of threats. We focus particularly on three challenges: the inclusion of pre-existing biases and agendas, the prominence of marketing-driven software, and the interpretation of unpredictability. Such a contextualized analysis of data uses provides important insights for the shifting terrain of possibilities for dissent. ","",""

But how do mobile developers learn what constitutes privacy? We analyze discussions about privacy on two major developer forums: one for iOS and one for Android. We find that the different platforms produce markedly different definitions of privacy. For iOS developers, Apple is a gatekeeper, controlling market access. The meaning of “privacy” shifts as developers try to interpret Apple’s policy guidance. For Android developers, Google is one data-collecting adversary among many. Privacy becomes a set of defensive features through which developers respond to a data-driven economy’s unequal distribution of power. By focusing on the development cultures arising from each platform, we highlight the power differentials inherent in “privacy by design” approaches, illustrating the role of platforms not only as intermediaries for privacy-sensitive content but also as regulators who help define what privacy is and how it works.

A model incorporating these concepts was tested in the context of communication privacy management theory. Study findings suggest that attitudinal measures were stronger predictors of privacy behaviors than were social locators.

"2018","Privacy in Mediated and Nonmediated Interpersonal Communication: How Subjective Concepts and Situational Perceptions Influence Behaviors"," New communication media such as social networking sites (SNSs) and instant messengers (IMs) challenge users’ privacy perceptions. Technical infrastructures and the flow of digital information lead to novel privacy risks that individuals are often not acquainted with. Users’ subjective perceptions of privacy may thus be flawed and lead to irrational behavior. In this work, we investigated a concept that has been addressed only implicitly in academic research on privacy: the user’s subjective perception of a given level of privacy. We examined the literature on how privacy perceptions have been conceptualized in traditional theories of privacy and how these conceptualizations are challenged in social media communication. We first qualitatively explored laypeople’s privacy concepts and investigated their subjective perceptions of privacy levels and subsequent private disclosures in different mediated and nonmediated communication settings. Interviews with N = 33 Germans revealed that, similar to academic privacy theories, they tend to conceptualize privacy as control over social, physical, and psychological boundaries. However, trust and other-dependent privacy emerged as important novel aspects for understanding privacy regulation in online communication. We further found that individuals consistently perceived a high level of privacy in face-to-face situations and a low level of privacy in public communication on SNSs. With regard to IMs, however, their answers were mixed: Uncertainty regarding digital communication properties and audiences as well as limited control over the communication setting prevented a reliable and shared perception of the privacy level. With regard to privacy behavior and private disclosures, we found that people tend to adapt their sharing of private information to the perceived level of privacy. ","",""

A weak state with limited access to reliable population data must use force instead of knowledge to govern the country. I also argue that the digital technologies of surveillance practiced by the Afghan state and the U.S. military to substitute for the lack of traditional forms of government data are not effective and cannot strengthen the state’s capacity to deliver services. In contributing to debates on surveillance and security, this article provides a technological critique of state failure in Afghanistan by highlighting the costs of poor population information.","",""

The case of Finnish high school teachers exposed to the use of Wilma, a distributed computing system used to store, process, and transmit student data, revealed experiences of a need to renegotiate formalized and trackable work processes, faster and more colloquial communication, and intensified day-to-day work. These influence modes of accountability and the need to negotiate visibility, along with understandings of rules as a central coordination mechanism for interpersonal boundary regulation. The authors suggest in addition that these technologies inure various social stakeholders to constant technical monitoring and regular accounting, thereby advancing the normalization of surveillance practices.

This paper examines the four functions of privacy as set out by privacy theorist Alan Westin [1967. Privacy and freedom. New York: Atheneum] and works to construct a revised view of the functions of privacy in a networked world by drawing on feminist theories of relationality. Many basic ideas about privacy, drawn from the Western liberal tradition, have been challenged, redrawn, and re-conceptualized by feminist philosophers of relationality. In section one, this paper defines the ‘networked governance of the self’ and outlines the feminist relational approach, drawing the concepts of networked governance and relationality together. In section two, the paper elaborates a relational perspective on networked privacy, set up against Westin’s traditional formulation of the roles that privacy plays in democratic society. According to Westin, privacy (1) provides a realm of personal autonomy; (2) creates opportunities for emotional release; (3) permits a zone of self-evaluation; and (4) permits limited and protected forms of communication. The paper elaborates a relational perspective on the functions of privacy, emphasizing the importance of relational privacy to the networked governance of the self.","",""

Recent studies on privacy by design shed light on developer practices yet tend to regard these workers as a generic category. The paper draws on two interviews with workers in a late-stage Israeli startup as a step toward localizing developers and the global products they design. The analysis identifies four narratives that juxtapose the local, the global and the commodification of users’ personal information: (1) the origin myth of the company; (2) workers’ personal and professional biographies; (3) reports on external regulations; and (4) accounts of work practices, rituals and communication formats.

Incentives and disincentives to sharing information with institutions online","ABSTRACT What incentives and disincentives do Internet users weigh as they consider providing information to institutional actors such as government agencies and corporations online? Focus group participants list several benefits to sharing information including convenience, access to information, personalization, financial incentives, and more accurate health information, but also recognize that not all sharing may be in their interest. Disincentives to sharing include skepticism, distrust, and fears of discrimination. Decisions about sharing are related to the information type, the context in which information is revealed, and the institution to which they are – or think they are – providing information. Significantly, many participants were mistrustful of both governmental and corporate actors. Participants displayed awareness of privacy risks, but frequently mischaracterized the extent to which information could be aggregated and mined. They displayed resignation towards privacy violations, suggesting that they perceived little control over their ability to protect their privacy, which may influence their privacy behaviors. This calls into question the privacy calculus, as individuals misunderstand the risks of their information provision and do not believe opting out of information-sharing is possible.","",""

As the informed consent paradigm has largely failed to ensure privacy protection online, we examine nudging as a tool of soft paternalism as an alternative intervention to sensitize users towards online privacy. Building upon the criticism that nudging is considered being manipulative and reducing people’s autonomy in decision-making, we inquire how media users themselves evaluate nudges’ effectiveness and intrusiveness. In particular, we distinguish nudges either as targeting heuristic decision-making (system 1) or deliberate decision-making through education and information (system 2). Empirically, we carried out an interview study among German and US media users (N = 52) to address cross-cultural differences in the evaluation of privacy interventions. Our results point to a preference for system 2 nudges. Germans in particular perceive state interventions addressing privacy awareness as more acceptable and helpful than US participants.","",""

In this article, we argue that the experiences and perceptions of vulnerable groups must form the starting point for online researchers’ ethical decision-making, regardless of whether their research population qualifies as ‘vulnerable.’ This is especially important in spaces where privacy violations put people, particularly marginalized individuals, at risk for online harassment and abuse, among other harms. We seek to intervene in online research practices by putting forth a feminist approach to privacy, drawing on two studies related to online harassment. Specifically, we argue that feminist theory and methodology inform an approach to privacy that (a) starts from the lives of socially and politically vulnerable groups, (b) takes an intersectional approach to analyzing power relations, and (c) draws on a moral imperative of care and responsibility in enacting feminist principles of context, dialogue, and reflexivity throughout the research process.

Using a case study situated in the New York subway system, I examine the criminalization of a practice of New York’s poor known as “selling swipes” performed by so-called “swipers”. A high court came to classify the practice as felony forgery, interpreting it though an expert-witness account of how objects physically manipulated by swipers interact with a secretive, proprietary digital information system. Thousands of felony arrests – overwhelmingly of nonwhite men – have been legitimated under this theory, in which the crime occurs on a plane of technical interactions to which swipers have no access. Through close examination of the underlying technology (known as MetroCard), however, I show considerable problems in the authorities’ understanding of the technology, illustrating the hazards of interpreting human action through proprietary or complex systems, especially as they are represented solely through expert accounts. The case demonstrates fresh connections between technology and unequal outcomes in the U.S. criminal justice system, and suggests an emerging form of social vulnerability, to interpretations of our actions through the logic of technologies black-boxed to us.","",""
"2019","Engineering Privacy by Design: Are engineers ready to live up to the challenge?","Abstract Organizations struggle to comply with legal requirements as well as customers’ calls for better data protection. On the implementation level, incorporation of privacy protections in products and services depends on the commitment of the engineers who design them. We interviewed six senior engineers, who work for globally leading IT corporations and research institutions, to investigate their motivation and ability to comply with privacy regulations. Our findings point to a lack of perceived responsibility, control, autonomy, and frustrations with interactions with the legal world. While we increasingly call on engineers to go beyond functional requirements and be responsive to human values in our increasingly technological society, we may be facing the dilemma of asking engineers to live up to a challenge they are currently not ready to embrace.","",""

It does so by investigating the records that the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) extracted from the government agency through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The article first traces the process of discovering and circulating this corpus of information. It then considers what the digital disclosures, including 18-plus hours of aerial surveillance footage, can reveal about the racial and technological dimensions of contemporary state surveillance. In considering the agency’s strategies of public admission, I develop the concept of transparency optics and identify some of its potential logics at work. I then discuss these records’ epistemological limits, such as the shortcomings of analyzing digital processes through ocularcentric approaches. Finally, this article contrasts the FBI videos’ panoptic vantage of the protests with the embodied, ground-level perspective of a local participant’s documentary film. ","",""

"2019","Big Data Biopolitics","Abstract                 This article considers the medial logics of American terrorist watchlist screening in order to study the ways in which digital inequities result from specific computational parameters. Central in its analysis is Secure Flight, an automated prescreening program run by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) that identifies lowand high-risk airline passengers through name-matching algorithms. Considering Secure Flight through the framework of biopolitics, this article examines how passenger information is aggregated, assessed and scored in order to construct racialised assemblages of passengers that reify discourses of American exceptionalism. Racialisation here is neither a consequence of big data nor a motivating force behind the production of risk-assessment programs. Both positions would maintain that discrimination is simply an effect of an information management system that considers privacy as its ultimate goal, which is easily mitigated with more accurate algorithms. Not simply emerging as an effect of discriminatory practices at airport security, racialisation formats the specific techniques embedded in terrorist watchlist matching, in particular the strategies used to transliterate names across different script systems. I argue thus that the biopolitical production of racialised assemblages forms the ground zero of Secure Flight’s computational parameters, as well as its claims to accuracy. This article concludes by proposing a move away from the call to solve digital inequities with more precise algorithms in order to carefully interrogate the forms of power complicit in the production and use of big data analytics.","",""
"2019","MAKING SENSE OF SOCIAL MEDIA PRIVACY: A FRAMING EXPERIMENT","As individuals trade information to access social media products and services, privacy has become increasingly valuable. Elite discourses have tended to frame privacy in terms of its vertical or institutional dimensions, but much less attention has been given to how users individually interpret and make sense of this complex notion. How do privacy sense-making processes intersect with privacy concerns and self-efficacy? What happens to these outcomes when an individual’s ideas about privacy collide with framing by an authoritative source? This project poses a 2x2 survey-based experiment with 628 subjects to explore these questions. We examine differences in privacy concerns and self-efficacy resulting from an individual’s own conceptualization of privacy, as well as from the presentation of similar and alternative framing of the concept. Preliminary results indicate that while individual conceptualizations show no differences in outcomes, higher levels of privacy self-efficacy result from the framing of privacy in horizontal terms and lower levels of privacy concern result when framing is consistent with the individual’s conceptualization. Strategic and practical implications of these findings are discussed.","",""

DISCOURSES ON VISUAL DATA AFTER THE 2017 G20-PROTESTS","A broad body of literature has described contemporary societies as “surveillance societies” or “surveillance cultures” and has expanded on the implications of an increasing “datafication” of society. To date, little attention has been paid to the role of visual data and their analysis in these processes. However, visual data and advancing algorithmic and facial recognition tools can provide particularly rich insights, that may imply both, important potentials and possible tensions. The contribution uses the case of controversial police investigations after the 2017 G20-summit to discuss intersections of datafication, dataveillance and visual communication and to provide insight into how different authorities and stakeholders legitimate and contest the collection of visual data and their algorithmic analysis in the political and public realm. Therefore a qualitative content and discourse analysis of news media articles, tweets, experts’ reports, police statements and minutes of parliamentary debates and committee hearings was conducted. Findings indicate that concrete practices of visual data collection and analysis remained obscure and a critical blind spot in the general media coverage. In turn, they triggered heated debates in the political realm and in specialized media coverage in which trust played a striking key role. Police authorities characterized visual data and algorithmic tools as a """"new standard of proof"""" and thus as particularly powerful, objective and specifically trustworthy. However, indiscriminate practices of visual data collection and analysis also triggered fundamental concerns about the role and the trustworthiness of police authorities in datafied societies.","",""

"2019","Municipal surveillance regulation and algorithmic accountability"," A wave of recent scholarship has warned about the potential for discriminatory harms of algorithmic systems, spurring an interest in algorithmic accountability and regulation. Meanwhile, parallel concerns about surveillance practices have already led to multiple successful regulatory efforts of surveillance technologies—many of which have algorithmic components. Here, we examine municipal surveillance regulation as offering lessons for algorithmic oversight. Taking the 2017 Seattle Surveillance Ordinance as our primary case study and surveying efforts across five other cities, we describe the features of existing surveillance regulation; including procedures for describing surveillance technologies in detail, requirements for public engagement, and processes for establishing acceptable uses. Although the Seattle Surveillance Ordinance was not intended to address algorithmic accountability, we find these considerations to be relevant to the law’s aim of surfacing disparate impacts of systems in use. We also find that in notable cases government employees did not identify regulated algorithmic surveillance technologies as reliant on algorithmic or machine learning systems, highlighting definitional gaps that could hinder future efforts toward algorithmic regulation. We argue that (i) finer-grained distinctions between types of information systems in the language of law and policy, and (ii) risk assessment tools integrated into their implementation would strengthen future regulatory efforts by rendering underlying algorithmic components more legible and accountable to political and community stakeholders.

"2019","Digital identity: Contemporary challenges for data protection, privacy and non-discrimination rights"," The World Bank estimates that over one billion people currently lack official identity documents. To tackle this crucial issue, the United Nations included the aim to provide legal identity for all by 2030 among the Sustainable Development Goals. Technology can be a powerful tool to reach this target. In the digital age, new technologies increasingly mediate identity verification and identification of individuals. Currently, State-led and public–private initiatives use technology to provide official identification, to control and secure external borders, and to distribute humanitarian aid to populations in need. All of these initiatives have profound implications for the protection of human rights of those affected by them. Digital identity technologies may render individuals without legal documentation more visible and therefore less vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. However, they also present risks for the protection of individuals' human rights. As they build on personal data for identification and identity verification, data protection and privacy rights are most clearly affected. The prohibition of discrimination in the digital space is also of concern as these technological advances' societal impact is not yet fully understood. Accordingly, the article argues that emerging digital identity platforms will only contribute to the protection of human rights if the providers adequately mitigate any risks of potential discrimination and promote high standards of privacy and data protection.

"2019","To predict and to manage. Predictive policing in the United States"," This article offers a detailed examination of the content of predictive policing applications. Crime prediction machines are used by governments to shape the moral behavior of police. They serve not only to predict when and where crime is likely to occur, but also to regulate police work. They calculate equivalence ratios, distributing security across the territory based on multiple cost and social justice criteria. Tracing the origins of predictive policing in the Compstat system, this article studies the shift from machines to explore intuitions (where police officers still have control over the machine) to applications removing the reflexive dimension of proactivity, thus turning prediction into the medium for “dosage” metrics of police work quantities. Finally, the article discusses how, driven by a critical movement denouncing the discriminatory biases of predictive machines, developers seek to develop techniques to audit training dataset and ways to calculate the reasonable amount of stop and frisk over the population.

I discuss South Korea’s Resident Registration System (RRS) as the contemporary incarnation of modern colonial power’s control over its colonial subjects, calling into question the maintenance of the colonial legacies within RRS policy innovations. I critically examine the way in which the legitimacy of neo-liberal surveillance is embraced by the anti-privacy scheme entrenched in the colonial and anti-communism legacies that relentlessly allows state power to control and intervene in individual realms.

"2019","Data and Obstacle: Police (Non)Visibility in Research on Protest Policing","The police, in particular the riot police, can be a rather inaccessible object of investigation, whose reservations towards research are analysed with reference to five barriers: 1) police control of access to the field, 2) the doubly asymmetric research relationship, 3) attempts by the police to steer the process, 4) the sceptical attitude of (potential) interviewees, and 5) the restrained discussion behaviour. However, what appears as a hurdle from a researcher’s perspective allows structures of the object itself to be reconstructed. These include a prevalence of narratives of police “innocence” and “powerlessness” with which resistance against external aspirations for control is buttressed. The police view themselves as constantly being under public scrutiny and being unjustly publicly criticised. In this manner the predominant attitude towards research is reserved if not hostile. The police definitional power in its fields of action is thus partially transferred to research on the police. However, police interference has its limits, and counterstrategies will be set forth. Most data used are from a grounded theory methodology (GTM) project on video surveillance and countersurveillance of demonstrations, based primarily on group discussions and expert interviews with riot police.","",""
"2019","Watch Groups, Surveillance, and Doing It for Themselves","This paper focuses on surveillant relations between citizens and police. We consider how online platforms enable the public to support the task of policing, as well as empowering the public to work without and beyond the police. While community-supported policing interventions are not new, more recently mobile and accessible technologies have promoted and enabled a DIY (Do-It-Yourself) culture towards policing amongst the public. The paper examines watch groups or those who task themselves with monitoring suspicious or actual behaviours. We consider two empirical examples: first, a community alert group mediated through social media. Second, a group of businesses that circulate, via a website, CCTV images of (alleged) wrongdoing in their premises. Drawing on David Garland’s (1996) work on responsibilisation, we situate the growth of these types of responsibilised groups within the contemporary economic and political climate of crime control in the UK. We argue that citizens are establishing new surveillant relations that are pushing policing in new and evolving directions.","",""
"2019","China’s Hukou Platform: Windows into the Family","When news media in the UK and US discuss China’s surveillance networks, it is often to imply that the Chinese government is creating a “techno-authoritarian state” to track and monitor its citizens. News outlets, however, are missing a larger point. The specific problem with China’s surveillance apparatus is not that it is technologically “totalizing” and “intrusive,” but that it relies on a newly digitized information platform that connects surveillance subjects to information about their households and family members, allowing the simultaneous identification and monitoring of everyone in each kinship network. Referred to as the Household Register or hukou, this platform is the backbone of China’s “surveillant assemblage” (Haggerty and Ericson 2000). Until the late 1990s when it was digitalized, hukou was an individually separate and distinct surveillance system that contained both general and detailed information about a household and its members. With digitalization, hukou became a platform that integrates different computer systems and databases. CCTV surveillance that involves facial recognition and Internet surveillance practices are connected to, and supported by, information from hukou. In the case of CCTV surveillance, cameras equipped with facial recognition features match the face of surveillance subjects with their ID and trace them back to their families. As for Internet surveillance, the connection between hukou and surveillance subjects happens via telephone number. Access to the Internet and social media platforms such as WeChat, SinaWeibo, and e-mail services requires a telephone number purchased with a government-issued ID card, which is connected to a household register and, therefore, the telephone card owner’s family. Chinese law enforcement’s ability to treat individual Internet users also as “collective units” represents the most distinctive feature of Chinese surveillance, an unlimited source of coercion for the Communist Party to reproduce itself as the ruling party.","",""

Privacy Futures, Digital Activism, and Surveillance Cultures in the Global South","This paper asks the question whether current data regulations designed to curb digital surveillance are enabling for Global South activists seeking to create systemic social change in today’s data-driven societies. This text proposes five measures to answer this question and devise a decolonial pathway to improve the human condition, namely: a) Recognize the long legacy of distrust of the law among activists; b) Channel our energies more on local governance and less on (trans)national regulation; c) Shift focus from the individual to the collective rights approach; d) Attend to motivations for publicity over privacy; e) Re-frame activism from grand movements to everyday creative insurgencies. This paper starts with the premise that laws and regulations have deep political interests often rooted in neocolonial ideologies and are not necessarily designed and executed for the protection of all citizens. Laws may evoke different meanings among the world’s marginalized communities, far from the sacrosanct position they hold among many in the West. This work argues for a decolonial approach—to go beyond the data-centric and individual consent framework to genuinely understand the complex relationship between surveillance, privacy, activism, and law at the peripheries in the Global South and to foster dignity for all.","",""

It argues that automation results in the emergence of post-disciplinary forms of monitoring that no longer rely on the subject’s internalization of the monitoring gaze. Such forms of monitoring do not displace other forms of surveillance but represent a new development made possible by the promise that comprehensive data collection will allow prediction and pre-emption to replace deterrence. In the context of predictive analytics, simulated futures serve as the basis for ongoing processes of intervention that take place in the present. The parsimony of the panopticon, which traded on the uncertainty provided by its partial gaze, is replaced by the tendency toward comprehensive monitoring associated with the proliferation of distributed, embedded, always-on sensing networks. The resulting forms of automated surveillance are characterized by post-representational logics that I describe in terms of operationalism, environmentality, and framelessness.","",""
"2019","Seeing Police: Cinematic Training and the Scripting of Police Vision","While contemporary ethnographies on policing describe the use of televisual and cinematic images as ancillary police training materials (Manning 2003; Moskos 2008), few studies have examined how these visual texts shape the practice of patrol work. One of my primary aims as an ethnographer is to find different ways of understanding everyday policing by bringing the materials that construct officers’ visual worlds under ethnographic analysis. These materials include cinematic images used in police academies to teach police recruits how to see like police officers. Attending to cinema’s mobility in training facilities where trainees learn how to screen situations, bodies, and encounters in the field can offer new insights into understanding police vision. I proceed with the knowledge that Antoine Fuqua’s 2001 film Training Day has been screened in San Diego’s police academy. While Training Day reproduces the kinds of visual practices that are part and parcel of policing praxis, I argue that an ethnographic reading of the film offers critical insight into what happens when an idealized police vision “meets the ground” in practice. I explore the productive tension between cinematic models like Training Day and everyday patrol work through an analysis of the “precarious cinema” of policing, a concept I use to understand how police officers’ engagements with Training Day reflect and reveal a mode of police vision that is often blind to the experiences of the policed, and the performance of ethnography as a visual profiling practice that offers new conceptual frames for approaching how these blinds spots manifest in the visual worlds of patrol officers. In a time when police violence and police brutality are invariably subject to the camera’s scrutiny and a scrutinizing public, the political stakes for an increasingly visible police vision include contending with, accounting for, and being answerable to its own visibility.","",""

Concerns that police conduct is racist and procedurally unjust have generated public sentiments that accountability must be externally imposed on police. One such accountability mechanism is body-worn cameras (BWCs). Optimistic accounts of BWCs suggest that the technology will contribute to the improvement of community–police relations. However, BWCs address consequences, not causes, of poor community–police relations. We argue that the evolving visibility of police associated with BWCs is double-edged, and suggest that the adoption of surveillance technologies such as BWCs in the quest to improve community–police relations will fail without a simultaneous commitment to inclusionary policing practices (such as community policing strategies, community and social development, and local democracy). We outline two initiatives that optimize BWCs by promoting these simultaneous commitments.","",""
"2019","Humanitarian and Human Rights Surveillance: The Challenge to Border Surveillance and Invisibility?","The European border regime has traditionally rested on the hidden surveillance activities of border authorities, which have contributed to human rights violations (including “push-back” and “left-to-die” practices) and a rising migrant death toll. Recently a number of humanitarian and activist organizations, including Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS), Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Sea-Watch, and WatchTheMed, have organized to aid migrants in distress at sea using surveillance technologies, ranging from drones to GPS. By doing so, they presented a challenge to the European border surveillance regime. In dialogue with the concept of countersurveillance, this paper introduces the concepts of humanitarian surveillance and human rights surveillance and deploys them to examine and categorize the activities of MOAS, MSF, Sea-Watch, and WatchTheMed. Humanitarian surveillance narrowly focuses on aiding victims of surveillance without problematizing the logic and hierarchies of surveillance, while human rights surveillance operates as a form of countersurveillance; it aims to protect and advance the human rights of victims of surveillance and expose human rights violations committed by authorities through opposing the hierarchies of surveillance. The paper shows how civilian groups incorporate elements of humanitarian and human rights surveillance in their activities at varying levels and discusses the extent to which they challenge the European border surveillance regime.","",""
"2019","When Citizens Are “Actually Doing Police Work”: The Blurring of Boundaries in WhatsApp Neighbourhood Crime Prevention Groups in The Netherlands","Neighbourhood watch messaging groups are part of an already pervasive phenomenon in The Netherlands, despite having only recently emerged. In many neighbourhoods, street signs have been installed to make passers-by aware of active neighbourhood surveillance. In messaging groups (using WhatsApp or similar communication apps), neighbours exchange warnings, concerns, and information about incidents, emergencies, and (allegedly) suspicious situations. These exchanges often lead to neighbours actively protecting and monitoring their streets, sending messages about suspicious activities, and using camera-phones to record events. While citizen-initiated participatory policing practices in the neighbourhood can increase (experiences of) safety and social cohesion, they often default to lateral surveillance, ethnic profiling, risky vigilantism, and distrust towards neighbours and strangers. Whereas the use of messaging apps is central, WhatsApp neighbourhood crime prevention (WNCP) groups are heterogeneous: they vary from independent self-organised policing networks to neighbours working with and alongside community police. As suggested by one of our interviewees, this can lead to citizens “actually doing police work,” which complicates relationships between police and citizens. This paper draws on interviews and focus groups in order to examine participatory policing practices and the responsibilisation of citizens for their neighbourhood safety and security. This exploration of actual practices shows that these often diverge from the intended process and that the blurring of boundaries between police and citizens complicates issues of accountability and normalises suspicion and the responsibilisation of citizens.","",""
"2019","Predictive Policing and the Platformization of Police Work","Although the revolutionary potential of predictive policing has often been exaggerated, this novel policing strategy nonetheless implies something substantially new: the underlying methods of (crime) data analysis. Moreover, these police prediction tools matter not only because of their capacity to generate near-term crime predictions but also because they have the potential to generally enhance police-related data crunching, ultimately giving rise to the comprehensive datafication of police work, creating an ongoing drive for extensive data collection and, hence, surveillance. This paper argues that because of its enablement of crime data analysis in general, predictive policing software will be an important incubator for datafied police work, especially when executed via data mining platforms, because it has made police authorities aware that the massive amounts of crime data they possess are quite valuable and can now be easily analyzed. These data are perceived to be even more useful when combined with external data sets and when processed on the largest possible scale. Ultimately, significant transformative effects are to be expected for policing, especially in relation to data collection practices and surveillance imperatives.&#x0D;  ","",""

"2019","Designed for Threat: Surveillance, Mass Shootings, and Pre-emptive Design in School Architecture","Contemporary political discourse around security, immigration, and terrorist threat manifests in two trends in educational architectural: the fortress school and surveilled flow. The fortress grows out of the urban-renewal movement of the post-World War II era, particularly on American university campuses. This architecture pre-empts threat by clamping down and fortifying its peripheral walls while controlling, surveilling, and limiting the number of entrances. Lockdown procedures, encouraging surveillance among citizens, metal detectors, increased police presences, and data-mining are all tactics at the fortress’ disposal. The alternative, much newer approach pre-empts threat by surveilling flow; that is, inviting people inside the structure and encouraging traffic while relying on more remote and less obvious tactics for detecting undesirables, such as closed-circuit television (CCTV), data-mining, and, like the fortress model, encouraging peer surveillance. Surveilled flow maintains the gesture of openness; however, this is mainly aesthetic, as other methods of intrusive policing take place at less-visible levels. At the heart of both of these articulations of pre-emptive threat culture is the digital-age anxiety about the alignment and possible misalignment between visual and information-based citizen profiles: Does the student or visitor appear to be a threat? Does his or her online behavior indicate potential threat? The profusion of information in the digital age meets this more primal desire to commensurate the appearance of risk with other forms of information-based evidence of threat. Digital-era concerns about how to interpret a wealth of information at various institutional and cultural levels pervade the riskscape in the developed world, and educational architecture is but one manifestation.","",""

The use of body scanners in airport security illuminates a similar reliance on binary sex categories. However, identity documentation policies and biometrics in airport security operate through different logics about how to solve the problem of affixing individual identities to changing bodies. The experiences of trans people with both identity documentation and airport security body scanners demonstrate that the requirements for passing as a proper citizen differ depending on the context: identity document policies prioritize medical alteration of the body while biometrics register medical alteration of the body as a potential threat to security.","",""

"2019","Mainstreaming Colonial Experiences in Surveillance Studies","Decolonizing surveillance studies is an urgent task, needed to comprehend the unequal impacts of surveillance technologies in the past, present, and future. I discuss three aspects of research in comparison: technological novelty versus past experience, nation building versus colonization, and test versus initial operation of technology. Overall, I argue for the significance of colonial narratives that illustrate the early and severe, often violent experiences of surveillance that tend to be historically underestimated or politically concealed. First, scholarly work has been attracted to technological novelties of digital surveillance. But to grasp the social implications of surveillance, the historical background of technology offers a genealogical thread, and the past awaits as a rich repository to be discovered. Second, previous studies have drawn plural origins of modern surveillance from Western civilization. But modern nation building and colonialism should be examined together in research, rather than separating them and placing nation building as central to modernization while placing colonialism as a side effect or exception of modernization. Such a separation fails to grasp the experiences of modern surveillance as a whole because nation-state is all too often colonial nation-state. Lastly, I question the prevailing concept of a “boomerang effect,” meaning that Western countries first test out harmful techniques on colonies, but soon these techniques come home. This boomerang effect view centers on the West. A “test” of surveillance technology targeted a group of people for its own purpose, and the systematic practice of surveillance left irreversible effects in colonies. Those effects immensely contributed to today’s foundation of global political economy as an ongoing process of technological dominance of the Global North over the South. To decolonize surveillance studies, it would be better to discuss the global experiences of surveillance in the frame of unequal distribution and outcome of technology.","",""
"2019","Platform Policing and the Real-Time Cop","Policing, particularly in the United States, is being progressively datafied. This process has a historical trajectory that is crucial to the analysis and critique of new platform-based security architectures. Predictive policing has already attracted considerable attention, partially due to its seemingly novel fusion of predictive analytics and police work. Hyperbolic early claims—often mobilizing science fiction imagery—that the future could, in fact, be predicted, pointed towards utopic/dystopic imaginaries of seamlessly integrated control. Predictive policing is, however, increasingly only one component of cloud-based data systems that are coursing through police activity. The imaginary of these transformations can be analysed through the security imaginary of policing as a process of real-time data transmission, perpetually self-adjusting and self-augmenting through machine calculation. The historical contextualization of this imaginary suggests useful vectors of inquiry that position platform policing squarely within the mechanisms of contemporary capitalism.","",""
"2019","Amazon: Surveillance as a Service","This essay argues that Amazon, the leading e-commerce platform in many parts of the world, uses surveillance not just as a key tool in the platform logic of its growing constellation of businesses but also increasingly as a service to its consumers. In contrast to prevailing assumptions that platforms will obscure the surveillant aspects of their businesses and that users will resist the intrusive nature of corporate surveillance, Amazon’s business practices point to the rapid normalization, and even embrace, of surveillant logics by consumers. Given the importance of consumer data to its operations, Amazon increasingly designs services whose purpose is, at least in part, to collect more data about consumers. The zenith of Amazon’s surveillance capabilities of its customers is no doubt its family of Echo devices enabled by the artificial intelligence interactive-voice service Alexa, which connects to the cloud run by Amazon, itself, through Amazon Web Services. Alexa is similar to competing digital voice assistants like Apple’s Siri and Google’s Assistant, but with more cultural visibility, worldwide market penetration, and greater integration with a host of Internet-of-Things devices produced by a variety of manufacturers. Amazon seeks to make Alexa an indispensable service to consumers, one that sweetens the granular forms of surveillance in more private spaces and situations that it now has the capability to gather, relative to the company’s more established forms of surveillance. While a typical association with surveillance might be the alienation and disempowerment of social control, I suggest that Amazon’s practices of consumer surveillance cultivate a sense of intimacy, borne of being seen between consumer and brand. In other words, I advocate for recognizing the subjectification of contemporary practices of platform surveillance, in addition to its structural elements.","",""
"2019","Platform Biometrics","This article identifies and analyses the emergence of platform biometrics. Biometrics are measurements of behavioral and physical characteristics, such as facial expressions, gait, galvanic skin response, and palm or iris patterns. Platform biometrics not only promise to connect geographically distant actors but also to curate new forms of value. In this piece I describe Microsoft Face, one of the major facial biometric systems currently on the market; this software promises to analyze which of seven “universal” emotions a subject is experiencing. I then offer a critique of the assumptions behind the system. First, theories of emotion are divided on whether emotions can be reliably and measurably expressed by the face. Second, emotions may not be universal, nor are there likely only seven basic emotions. Third, I draw on the work of Rouvroy and Berns (2013) to identify emotion-recognition technologies as a classic example of algorithmic governance. To outcome algorithmic governance is to enable the subject to creation and govern surveillance.  Platform biometrics will therefore provide a key component of surveillance capitalism’s appropriation of human experience (neuro-liberalism).","",""

"2019","Rethinking the Orwellian Imaginary through Contemporary Chinese Fiction","Although George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four ([1949] 2003) and Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World ([1932] 2006) have long offered contrasting paradigms in surveillance theory, little attention has been paid to how race and cultural difference operate in their respective regimes. This oversight is surprising given race’s centrality in surveillance theory and practice, and it is increasingly anachronistic in light of contemporary geopolitics and the rising power of non-Western states. By contrast, the best-selling and critically acclaimed novels The Fat Years (Koonchung 2013), The Three-Body Problem (Liu 20014), and Death of a Red Heroine (Xiaolong 2000) are all set in modern China and portray issues of surveillance technology, policy, implementation, and resistance previously associated with Western powers. Yet while these later novels’ Chinese settings offer radically different scenarios than our previous touchstones of surveillance imagery, their global popularity also demonstrates their vast resonance and accessibility. Indeed, in strong reaffirmation of Orwell’s and Huxley’s ongoing value—and the value of literature to surveillance theory more generally—these recent China-set novels collapse the Orwell and Huxley dichotomy to offer surprising glimpses into the more culturally diversified twenty-first century global surveillance society.","",""

Drawing on Ewick and Silbey’s (1998) popular socio-legal conception of legal consciousness, the paper constructs a similar concept in the domain of surveillance. Surveillance consciousness of two mobile surveillance technologies—drones and Stingrays—is explored through online data. Upon analyzing reactions to surveillance, the paper expounds on the complexities found therein, which conform to Ewick and Silbey’s tripartite set of schemas. Such complexities contribute to surveillance studies by addressing whether prevalent theoretical models of surveillance can be sufficiently used to capture the current surveillance society. In its entirety, this paper demonstrates how surveillance and socio-legal studies benefit from greater dialogue and cross-fertilization.","",""
"2019","Monitoring Mogadishu","Technology-based surveillance practices have changed the modes of policing found in the global North but have yet to influence police–citizen engagement in Southern cities such as Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia. Based on the role played by monitoring in Mogadishu’s formal security plan and in an informal neighbourhood watch scheme in Waberi district, this article uses a policy-oriented approach to generate insight into surveillance and policing in a fragile and seemingly dysfunctional environment. It shows that while watching is an integral aspect of everyday life, sophisticated technologies capable of digitally capturing real-time events play no part in crime reporting or in the monitoring of terrorist threats, and information is delivered by using basic and inclusive methods such as word of mouth, rather than by mobile telephones or social media. Indeed, the availability of technologies such as CCTV has actually resulted in the reproduction and reinforcement of older models of policing; even when the need to monitor security threats encourages residents to engage with the task of policing, their responses reflect local preferences and legacy issues dating from the 1970s and 2000s. In other words, policing practice has not been reconfigured. In Mogadishu, as in most of the world, the policing task is shaped as much by residents’ expectations as by the technologies available.","",""
"2019","“The Eyes and Ears on Our Frontlines”: Policing without Police to Counter Violent Extremism","As the US public has grown more concerned about domestic terrorist attacks and the abrogation of civil liberties in the pursuit of national security, law enforcement agencies increasingly have applied the principles of community policing to the problem of homegrown terrorism. This community policing approach has anchored Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) initiatives that mobilize local communities to combat terrorist radicalization and recruitment. To do so, this emerging model has tasked community members and social service providers like teachers and mental health professionals with identifying, reporting, and working with potential terrorists. Drawing from a two-year interpretive qualitative research study of CVE policy making and taking across the United States, I examine these emerging police–citizen practices, paying particular attention to how these new institutional arrangements enhance, rather than rein in, policing powers in the name of national security.","",""

With companies that have rapidly become giants in this sector, such as Uber, the phenomenon is spreading to various services at the same overwhelming speed as many companies bet on what is known as Uberization. In this paper, we aim to use one example of such a phenomenon from the Global South to show how a potential hyperconnected society is, in fact, creating the possibility for expanded patterns of immobilization for certain groups. We aim to show how highly indirect corporate surveillance involved in businesses such as Uber can run in parallel with a specific direct form of worker surveillance that, without any legal or social safeguards, increases the vulnerability of the weakest link in this chain.","",""

The Investigatory Powers Act 2016 is the result of a long series of attempts by the UK government to reform communications surveillance legislation. The consultations on this legislation—and on its precursor, the Draft Communications Data Bill 2012—offer unique insight into how such efforts generate resistance to surveillance. This article draws attention to the role of communications service providers (CSPs)—who are increasingly being responsibilised to collect and retain communications data—within a multi-actor network of resistance. It also identifies the reasons CSPs gave for resisting these proposed reforms. Content analysis of the consultation documents reveals three themes that were central to the CSPs’ arguments: technology, territory, and trust. The article concludes by considering the implications for understanding resistance to contemporary digital surveillance.","",""
"2019","Editorial: Platform Surveillance","This editorial introduces this special responsive issue on “platform surveillance.” We develop the term platform surveillance to account for the manifold and often insidious ways that digital platforms fundamentally transform social practices and relations, recasting them as surveillant exchanges whose coordination must be technologically mediated and therefore made exploitable as data. In the process, digital platforms become dominant social structures in their own right, subordinating other institutions, conjuring or sedimenting social divisions and inequalities, and setting the terms upon which individuals, organizations, and governments interact. Emergent forms of platform capitalism portend new governmentalities, as they gradually draw existing institutions into alignment or harmonization with the logics of platform surveillance while also engendering subjectivities (e.g., the gig-economy worker) that support those logics. Because surveillance is essential to the operations of digital platforms, because it structures the forms of governance and capital that emerge, the field of surveillance studies is uniquely positioned to investigate and theorize these phenomena.","",""
"2019","The Platformization of the Classroom: Teachers as Surveillant Consumers","Technology platforms, including learning management systems and monitoring tools, have taken root in schools. While seen as bringing efficiency or innovation into classrooms, they also offer greater capacities for surveillance. Drawing on findings from focus groups with teachers in the US, we explore how teachers’ use of technology platforms produces surveillance. We argue that this positions teachers as surveillant consumers who use monitoring as a way to fulfill their responsibilities to students. We portray two configurations of monitoring in the classroom: tracking student learning and keeping students on task. These configurations reveal how technology platforms orient teachers to see student data as interchangeable with students, which we believe highlights the need for greater scrutiny of technology platforms’ role in the classroom.&#x0D;  ","",""
"2019","Policing as Digital Platform","Much of the discussion about platforms and “platform capitalism” centers on commercial platform companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple. Shoshana Zuboff’s (2015) analysis of “surveillance capitalism” similarly focuses on Google as the trailblazer pushing the new logic of accumulation that is focused on data extraction and analysis of human activities. In his typology of platform companies, Nick Srnicek (2017) includes less visible industrial platforms that situate themselves as intermediaries between companies rather than between companies and consumer-users. In this article, the focus is a platform-building effort that looks something like an industrial platform but differs in the sense that the company in question, Axon Enterprise, aims to situate itself as an intermediary within and among law enforcement agencies (non-market entities) as a means of building a large-scale data-extractive system of monetization. Axon’s business strategy is emblematic of the ways that police evidence and record-keeping systems are being reimagined, and to some extent reconfigured, as sources of data extraction and analytics on the model of the platform. Whether Axon succeeds or is eclipsed by a competitor like Palantir or even Amazon or Microsoft, the process of reimagining and reorganizing policing as a platform is underway—a process that, to paraphrase Zuboff, deeply imbricates public and private surveillance activities, dissolving the boundary between public and private authority in the surveillance project.","",""
"2019","Database-Driven Empowering Surveillance: Definition and Assessment of Effectiveness","This article offers a definition and explores the dynamics of database-driven empowering surveillance. That is, it focuses on surveillance from below that is directed at powerful institutions or groups for the benefit of the marginalized, using a database as its main facilitator. By examining six Israeli NGOs working for the protection of Palestinian human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, I am able to break down the database-driven empowering surveillance process of amassing and disseminating information, to identify its mechanism of action, and to highlight its limiting and enabling factors. This scrutiny in turn helps shed light on the capacity of NGOs to effectively monitor powerful institutions: to surveil from below in spaces with pervasive top-down surveillance; to surveil in territories under the control of the surveillance subjects; to impact policy on polarized issues; and to enforce human rights. Empowering surveillance emerges from this article as a process that requires those carrying it out to maintain a delicate balance between using a forceful mechanism against those monitored and being highly dependent on third parties with coercive power—often from the same organizations being monitored—to exact the desired deterring effect.","",""

In this Dialogue, a selected group of participants present their ideas for “decolonizing surveillance studies.” The idea for this focus on decolonization within surveillance studies scholarship was sparked by the growing recognition in a number of academic fields that certain viewpoints and perspectives have long been prioritized over others, often to the exclusion of important histories, theories, and experiences offered by those whose research or perspectives have not been well represented in the larger body of academic scholarship. The seven pieces published in this Dialogue section seek to examine the broader decolonizing project and propose an agenda for decolonizing surveillance studies as a field of study.","",""

"2019","Eyes on the Road: Surveillance Logics in the Autonomous Vehicle Economy","As emblematic products of a previous industrial era, cars are often tied to a sphere outside the digital economy and its ruling logics and are, therefore, governed by different ideas of privacy, agency, and sovereignty. However, as self-driving cars gain momentum, computerization, and automation, their platformization contributes to transforming the automobile as technology, industry, and cultural artifact. This creates new spaces of consumption within cars, around them, and between them—all of which are premised on highly detailed contextual information that is collected, processed, and transmitted in the process of navigation. Thus, the ads and entertainment delivered to passengers, the landscapes surrounding the vehicles, and the proprietary data networks that link self-driving car fleets are all redefined as revenue streams in the new auto economy. This paper explores the transformation of the existing auto economy in the context of the emergence of self-driving cars by following the transposition of surveillance logics that are central to the digital economy and by considering the implications of their adaptation to the arena of automated mobility.","",""

Using interview data with gay, bi, and queer men on PrEP, field notes, and document analysis, we discuss the individual and institutional practices that produce what we call PrEP citizenship. Drawing on the concept of biosexual citizenship, we show how PrEP citizenship involves surveillance for compliance with use and behavioral guidelines, expanding the PrEP population, and allocating community resources to PrEP users over non-PrEP users. On the individual level, users surveil themselves and others for proper use and sexual behavior, identify nonusers and evangelize PrEP use to them, and stigmatize non-PrEP users as irresponsible, immoral, and potentially infectious. Similarly, on the institutional level, public health, medical authorities, and sexual community infrastructure work to ensure PrEP users remain adherent, increase the user base, and grant material and symbolic resources to PrEP users. PrEP citizenship has implications for the role of the co-production of surveillance in conceptions of biosexual citizenship.","",""

"2019","Predictive Policing for Reform? Indeterminacy and Intervention in Big Data Policing","Predictive analytics and artificial intelligence are applied widely across law enforcement agencies and the criminal justice system. Despite criticism that such tools reinforce inequality and structural discrimination, proponents insist that they will nonetheless improve the equality and fairness of outcomes by countering humans’ biased or capricious decision-making. How can predictive analytics be understood simultaneously as a source of, and solution to, discrimination and bias in criminal justice and law enforcement? The article provides a framework for understanding the techno-political gambit of predictive policing as a mechanism of police reform—a discourse that I call “predictive policing for reform.” Focusing specifically on geospatial predictive policing systems, I argue that “predictive policing for reform” should be seen as a flawed attempt to rationalize police patrols through an algorithmic remediation of patrol geographies. The attempt is flawed because predictive systems operate on the sociotechnical practices of police patrols, which are themselves contradictory enactments of the state’s power to distribute safety and harm. The ambiguities and contradictions of the patrol are not resolved through algorithmic remediation. Instead, they lead to new indeterminacies, trade-offs, and experimentations based on unfalsifiable claims. I detail these through a discussion of predictive policing firm HunchLab’s use of predictive analytics to rationalize patrols and mitigate bias. Understanding how the “predictive policing for reform” discourse is operationalized as a series of technical fixes that rely on the production of indeterminacies allows for a more nuanced critique of predictive policing.","",""
"2019","Surveillance Capitalism and Platform Policing: The Surveillant Assemblage-as-a-Service","Based on empirical research on training webinars, interviews, and promotional material from Vigilant Solutions, this paper investigates the surveillance regime enabled by platform policing: the implementation of cloud-based platforms, designed and run by private corporations, that provide mass surveillance-driven simulations for a range of police operations, including predictive policing, targeted surveillance, and tactical and strategic governance. Building on Amoore’s (2016) work on “cloud geographies,” this paper argues that the platform model embodied by Vigilant Solutions involves multivalent processes of de- and reterritorialization in which new technological and datalogical spaces are formed and these erode older societal boundaries of private, public, and state. Specifically, Vigilant Solutions leverages its multi-sided platform business model through the deterritorializing, cloud-based concatenations of surveillant technologies. It then argues that the resultant reterritorialized cloud space, which is accessible through its Vigilant Investigative Centre (VIC) platform, fuses mass surveillance data from diverse private, public, and state sources in a simulated geography. Further, the VIC furnishes to law enforcement an array of data analytics that exploits this cloud geography to enable a boundary-crossing surveillance regime of association analysis and proximal suspicion.","",""

Since such coverage can define the norms circumscribing the flows of users’ personal information, this study contributes to the debate about the role of the press in alerting the public to privacy issues that carry significant public interest implications. Ultimately, mobile privacy coverage favors certain solutions over others, emphasizes privacy tradeoffs over privacy rights, and balances user powerlessness with mobile app convenience and innovation, with implications for privacy discourses in public and policy arenas.","",""

By means of sensing, seeing and machine learning of facial expressions, voice, gaze, gestures and range of physiological signals (heart rate, skin conductivity and temperature, muscle activity, body temperature, respiration and other bio-signals), the goal is to make interior emotional life machine-readable for personal, commercial and security objectives.In this paper, we focus on computer vision and face-based analytics to consider the nature, method and development of facial coding, the potential demise of existing approaches, and the rise of even more invasive methods. Criticisms of facial coding have long existed, but recent scholarship and industrial development signals a lack of confidence in ‘basic emotions’ and a turn to appraisal-based accounts of emotion. This inevitably entails use of data about internal physiological and experiential contexts, but also factors external to an individual. To explore this, this paper asks and answers the following question: With regard to deployment in out-of-home situations, what are the legal and privacy implications of appraisal-based emotion capture?","",""

We then analyze the ways that education magazines and tech company foundation outreach discuss personalized learning, paying special attention to issues of privacy. Our findings suggest that competing discourses on personalized learning revolve around contested meanings about the type of expertise needed for twenty-first century learning, what self-directed learning should look like, whether education is about process or content, and the type of evidence that is required to establish whether or not personalized learning leads to better student outcomes. Throughout, privacy issues remain a hot spot of conflict between the desire for more efficient outcomes and a whole child approach that is reminiscent of John Dewey’s insight that public education plays a special role in creating citizens.","",""
"2019","Improving privacy choice through design: How designing for reflection could support privacy self-management","In today’s society online privacy is primarily regulated by two main regulatory systems: (command-and-control) law and notice and consent (i.e., agreeing to terms of agreement and privacy policies). Both systems prohibit reflection on privacy issues from the public at large and restrict the privacy debate to the legal and regulatory domains. However, from a socio-ethical standpoint, the general public needs to be included in the privacy debate in order to make well-informed decisions and contribute to the law-making process. Therefore, we argue that privacy regulation must shift from a purely legal debate and simple one-time yes/no decisions by ‘data subjects’ to public (debate and) awareness and continuous reflection on privacy and privacy decisions by users of IT systems and services. In order to allow for this reflective thinking, individuals need to (1) understand what is at stake when interacting with digital technology; (2) have the ability to reflect on the consequences of their privacy decisions; and (3) have meaningful controls to express their privacy preferences. Together, these three factors could provide for knowledge, evaluation and choice within the context of online privacy. In this paper, we elaborate on these factors and provide a design-for-privacy model that introduces friction as a central design concept that stimulates reflective thinking and thus restores the privacy debate within the public arena.","",""

We explore how this process unfolds through a series of ethnographic interviews conducted with young Saudis at different stages of their migratory journey from Saudi Arabia to the United States and back. Our findings hold important implications for viewing privacy as a dynamic concept related to the fluid production of identities in online spaces.

Officers’ primary concerns stem from their perceived inability to control the context of what is recorded, edited, and disseminated to broad audiences online through popular platforms such as YouTube.com , as well as the unwanted visibility (and accountability) that such online dissemination generates. I argue that understanding the effects of this `new visibility’ on policing, and the role played by new media in this process, has become vitally important to our tasks of organizing, understanding, and overseeing the police.

A qualitative analysis of consultation responses is conducted, and two discourse coalitions are identified. The industry coalition promotes market liberalisation to allow the digital future to emerge. The civil society coalition, in turn, argues for rescuing privacy with strict rules. The article suggests that plausibility in relation to the discursive and extra-discursive environment is crucial for the success of storylines. The second storyline was relatively successful because it was more plausible in light of the trend of legalism and the predominant future-oriented narrative of privacy in danger. The ‘anticipatory institutionalism’ approach opens novel perspectives concerning actors’ future-oriented projects in relation to historical processes. ","",""

The study reports how user attitudes change after exposure to inferences made based upon information they have disclosed on an SNS, namely, on Facebook. To demonstrate this, two sub-studies involving three focus group sessions were conducted with Facebook users. In the first sub-study, the users received a general introduction to information that can be inferred from posts by using a prototypical privacy-enhancement tool called DataBait. Then, the second sub-study allowed the users to witness the potential inferences of their own Facebook photos and posts by using the DataBait tool. Next, qualitative content analysis was conducted to analyze the results, and these showed that the participants’ attitudes toward privacy on SNSs changed from affective to cognitive when they became aware of potential inferences from actual information posted on their own Facebook accounts. The results imply that end users require more cognitive awareness regarding their genres of disclosure and the effect of their disclosures on their privacy. Moreover, as privacy awareness is contextual, there is a need for more research and development of online tools that will allow users to manage and educate themselves. ","",""

The article identifies five intersecting logics that explain wider transformations within the humanitarian sector and in turn shape the biometric assemblage. The acceleration of the rate of biometric registrations in the humanitarian sector between 2002 and 2019 reveals serious concerns regarding bias, data safeguards, data-sharing practices with states and commercial companies, experimentation with untested technologies among vulnerable people, and, finally, ethics. Technological convergence amplifies risks associated with each constituent technology of the biometric assemblage. The article finally argues that the biometric assemblage accentuates asymmetries between refugees and humanitarian agencies and ultimately entrenches inequalities in a global context. ","",""
"2019","Digital Surveillance/Militant Resistance: Categorizing the “Proto-state Hacker”"," Rapid developments in digital infrastructure have made all-encompassing surveillance all too possible. However, the same infrastructure has simultaneously enabled the use of new possibility spaces that react to, shape, and resist these structures of control and surveillance. The Israel/Palestine conflict is no different, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) has created an electronic unit with hackers to circumvent and resist the Israeli matrix of control and its surveillance. I argue that out of this dialectical relationship in Palestine, between new possibility spaces of resistance and structures of control, new phenomena arise in the gray area between the nation state hacker and the hacktivist as PIJ emulates the features of a modern state army. To understand the nature of its electronic unit, one must take this dialectic into account by introducing the category, “proto-state hacker.” ","",""
"2019","Decolonizing Privacy Studies"," This paper calls for an epistemic disobedience in privacy studies by decolonizing the approach to privacy. As technology companies expand their reach worldwide, the notion of privacy continues to be viewed through an ethnocentric lens. It disproportionately draws from empirical evidence on Western-based, white, and middle-class demographics. We need to break away from the market-driven neoliberal ideology and the Development paradigm long dictating media studies if we are to foster more inclusive privacy policies. This paper offers a set of propositions to de-naturalize and estrange data from demographic generalizations and cultural assumptions, namely, (1) predicting privacy harms through the history of social practice, (2) recalibrating the core-periphery as evolving and moving targets, and (3) de-exoticizing “natives” by situating privacy in ludic digital cultures. In essence, decolonizing privacy studies is as much an act of reimagining people and place as it is of dismantling essentialisms that are regurgitated through scholarship. ","",""
"2020","A Biometric Logic of Revelation: Zach Blas’s &lt;em&gt;SANCTUM&lt;/em&gt; (2018)","Ubiquitous in airports, border checkpoints, and other securitised spaces throughout the world, full-body imaging scanners claim to read bodies in order to identify if they pose security threats. Millimetre-wave body imaging machines—the most common type of body scanner—display to the operating security agent a screen with a generic body outline. If an anomaly is found or if an individual does not align with the machine’s understanding of an “average” body, a small box is highlighted and placed around the “problem” area, prompting further inspection in the form of pat-downs or questioning. In this complex security regime governed by such biometric, body-based technologies, it could be argued that nonalignment with bodily normativity as well as an attendant failure to reveal oneself—to become “transparent” (Hall 295)—marks a body as dangerous. As these algorithmic technologies become more pervasive, so too does the imperative to critically examine their purported neutrality and operative logic of revelation and readability.Biometric technologies are marketed as excavators of truth, with their optic potency claiming to demask masquerading bodies. Failure and bias are, however, an inescapable aspect of such technologies that work with narrow parameters of human morphology. Indeed, surveillance technologies have been taken to task for their inherent racial and gender biases (Browne; Pugliese). Facial recognition has, for example, been critiqued for its inability to read darker skin tones (Buolamwini and Gebru), while body scanners have been shown to target transgender bodies (Keyes; Magnet and Rodgers; Quinan). Critical security studies scholar Shoshana Magnet argues that error is endemic to the technological functioning of biometrics, particularly since they operate according to the faulty notion that bodies are “stable” and unchanging repositories of information that can be reified into code (Magnet 2).Although body scanners are presented as being able to reliably expose concealed weapons, they are riddled with incompetencies that misidentify and over-select certain demographics as suspect. Full-body scanners have, for example, caused considerable difficulties for transgender travellers, breast cancer patients, and people who use prosthetics, such as artificial limbs, colonoscopy bags, binders, or prosthetic genitalia (Clarkson; Quinan; Spalding). While it is not in the scope of this article to detail the workings of body imaging technologies and their inconsistencies, a growing body of scholarship has substantiated the claim that these machines unfairly impact those identifying as transgender and non-binary (see, e.g., Beauchamp; Currah and Mulqueen; Magnet and Rogers; Sjoberg). Moreover, they are constructed according to a logic of binary gender: before each person enters the scanner, transportation security officers must make a quick assessment of their gender/sex by pressing either a blue (corresponding to “male”) or pink (corresponding to “female”) button. In this sense, biometric, computerised security systems control and monitor the boundaries between male and female.The ability to “reveal” oneself is henceforth predicated on having a body free of “abnormalities” and fitting neatly into one of the two sex categorisations that the machine demands. Transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals, particularly those who do not have a binary gender presentation or whose presentation does not correspond to the sex marker in their documentation, also face difficulties if the machine flags anomalies (Quinan and Bresser). Drawing on a Foucauldian analysis of power as productive, Toby Beauchamp similarly illustrates how surveillance technologies not only identify but also create and reshape the figure of the dangerous subject in relation to normative configurations of gender, race, and able-bodiedness. By mobilizing narratives of concealment and disguise, heightened security measures frame gender nonconformity as dangerous (Beauchamp, Going Stealth). Although national and supranational authorities market biometric scanning technologies as scientifically neutral and exact methods of identification and verification and as an infallible solution to security risks, such tools of surveillance are clearly shaped by preconceptions and prejudgements about race, gender, and bodily normativity. Not only are they encoded with “prototypical whiteness” (Browne) but they are also built on “grossly stereotypical” configurations of gender (Clarkson).Amongst this increasingly securitised landscape, creative forms of artistic resistance can offer up a means of subverting discriminatory policing and surveillance practices by posing alternate visualisations that reveal and challenge their supposed objectivity. In his 2018 audio-video artwork installation entitled SANCTUM, UK-based American artist Zach Blas delves into how biometric technologies, like those described above, both reveal and (re)shape ontology by utilising the affectual resonance of sexual submission. Evoking the contradictory notions of oppression and pleasure, Blas describes SANCTUM as “a mystical environment that perverts sex dungeons with the apparatuses and procedures of airport body scans, biometric analysis, and predictive policing” (see full description at https://zachblas.info/works/sanctum/).Depicting generic mannequins that stand in for the digitalised rendering of the human forms that pass through body scanners, the installation transports the scanners out of the airport and into a queer environment that collapses sex, security, and weaponry; an environment that is “at once a prison-house of algorithmic capture, a sex dungeon with no genitals, a weapons factory, and a temple to security.” This artistic reframing gestures towards full-body scanning technology’s germination in the military, prisons, and other disciplinary systems, highlighting how its development and use has originated from punitive—rather than protective—contexts.In what follows, we adopt a methodological approach that applies visual analysis and close reading to scrutinise a selection of scenes from SANCTUM that underscore the sadomasochistic power inherent in surveillance technologies. Analysing visual and aural elements of the artistic intervention allows us to complicate the relationship between transparency and recognition and to problematise the dynamic of mandatory complicity and revelation that body scanners warrant. In contrast to a discourse of visibility that characterises algorithmically driven surveillance technology, Blas suggests opacity as a resistance strategy to biometrics' standardisation of identity. Taking an approach informed by critical security studies and queer theory, we also argue that SANCTUM highlights the violence inherent to the practice of reducing the body to a flat, inert surface that purports to align with some sort of “core” identity, a notion that contradicts feminist and queer approaches to identity and corporeality as fluid and changing. In close reading this artistic installation alongside emerging scholarship on the discriminatory effects of biometric technology, this article aims to highlight the potential of art to queer the supposed objectivity and neutrality of biometric surveillance and to critically challenge normative logics of revelation and readability.Corporeal Fetishism and Body HorrorThroughout both his artistic practice and scholarly work, Blas has been critical of the above narrative of biometrics as objective extractors of information. Rather than looking to dominant forms of representation as a means for recognition and social change, Blas’s work asks that we strive for creative techniques that precisely queer biometric and legal systems in order to make oneself unaccounted for. For him, “transparency, visibility, and representation to the state should be used tactically, they are never the end goal for a transformative politics but are, ultimately, a trap” (Blas and Gaboury 158). While we would simultaneously argue that invisibility is itself a privilege that is unevenly distributed, his creative work attempts to refuse a politics of visibility and to embrace an “informatic opacity” that is attuned to differences in bodies and identities (Blas).In particular, Blas’s artistic interventions titled Facial Weaponization Suite (2011-14) and Face Cages (2013-16) protest against biometric recognition and the inequalities that these technologies propagate by making masks and wearable metal objects that cannot be detected as human faces. This artistic-activist project contests biometric facial recognition and their attendant inequalities by, as detailed on the artist’s website,making ‘collective masks’ in workshops that are modelled from the aggregated facial data of participants, resulting in amorphous masks that cannot be detected as human faces by biometric facial recognition technologies. The masks are used for public interventions and performances.One mask explores blackness and the racist implications that undergird biometric technologies’ inability to detect dark skin. Meanwhile another mask, which he calls the “Fag Face Mask”, points to the heteronormative underpinnings of facial recognition. Created from the aggregated facial data of queer men, this amorphous pink mask implicitly references—and contests—scientific studies that have attempted to link the identification of sexual orientation through rapid facial recognition techniques.Building on this body of creative work that has advocated for opacity as a tool of social and political transformation, SANCTUM resists the revelatory impulses of biometric technology by turning to the use and abuse of full-body imaging. The installation opens with a shot of a large, dark industrial space. At the far end of a red, spotlighted corridor, a black mask flickers on a screen. A shimmering, oscillating sound reverberates—the opening bars of a techno track—that breaks down in rhythm while the mask evaporates into a cloud of smoke. The camera swivels, and a white figure—the generic mannequin of the body scanner screen—is pummelled by invisible forces as if in a wind tunnel. These ghostly silhouettes appear and reappear in different positions, with some being whipped and others stretched and penetrated by a steel anal hook. Rather than conjuring a traditional horror trope of the body’s terrifying, bloody interior, SANCTUM evokes a new kind of feared and fetishized trope that is endemic to the current era of surveillance capitalism: the abstracted body, standardised and datafied, created through the supposedly objective and efficient gaze of AI-driven machinery.Resting on the floor in front of the ominous animated mask are neon fragments arranged in an occultist formation—hands or half a face. By breaking the body down into component parts— “from retina to fingerprints”—biometric technologies “purport to make individual bodies endlessly replicable, segmentable and transmissible in the transnational spaces of global capital” (Magnet 8). The notion that bodies can be seamlessly turned into blueprints extracted from biological and cultural contexts has been described by Donna Haraway as “corporeal fetishism” (Haraway, Modest). In the context of SANCTUM, Blas illustrates the dangers of mistaking a model for a “concrete entity” (Haraway, “Situated” 147). Indeed, the digital cartography of the generic mannequin becomes no longer a mode of representation but instead a technoscientific truth.Several scenes in SANCTUM also illustrate a process whereby substances are extracted from the mannequins and used as tools to enact violence. In one such instance, a silver webbing is generated over a kneeling figure. Upon closer inspection, this geometric structure, which is reminiscent of Blas’s earlier Face Cages project, is a replication of the triangulated patterns produced by facial recognition software in its mapping of distance between eyes, nose, and mouth. In the next scene, this “map” breaks apart into singular shapes that float and transform into a metallic whip, before eventually reconstituting themselves as a penetrative douche hose that causes the mannequin to spasm and vomit a pixelated liquid. Its secretions levitate and become the webbing, and then the sequence begins anew.In another scene, a mannequin is held upside-down and force-fed a bubbling liquid that is being pumped through tubes from its arms, legs, and stomach. These depictions visualise Magnet’s argument that biometric renderings of bodies are understood not to be “tropic” or “historically specific” but are instead presented as “plumbing individual depths in order to extract core identity” (5). In this sense, this visual representation calls to mind biometrics’ reification of body and identity, obfuscating what Haraway would describe as the “situatedness of knowledge”. Blas’s work, however, forces a critique of these very systems, as the materials extracted from the bodies of the mannequins in SANCTUM allude to how biometric cartographies drawn from travellers are utilised to justify detainment. These security technologies employ what Magnet has referred to as “surveillant scopophilia,” that is, new ways and forms of looking at the human body “disassembled into component parts while simultaneously working to assuage individual anxieties about safety and security through the promise of surveillance” (17). The transparent body—the body that can submit and reveal itself—is ironically represented by the distinctly genderless translucent mannequins. Although the generic mannequins are seemingly blank slates, the installation simultaneously forces a conversation about the ways in which biometrics draw upon and perpetuate assumptions about gender, race, and sexuality.Biometric SubjugationOn her 2016 critically acclaimed album HOPELESSNESS, openly transgender singer, composer, and visual artist Anohni performs a deviant subjectivity that highlights the above dynamics that mark the contemporary surveillance discourse. To an imagined “daddy” technocrat, she sings:Watch me…  I know you love me'Cause you're always watching me'Case I'm involved in evil'Case I'm involved in terrorism'Case I'm involved in child molestersEvoking a queer sexual frisson, Anohni describes how, as a trans woman, she is hyper-visible to state institutions. She narrates a voyeuristic relation where trans bodies are policed as threats to public safety rather than protected from systemic discrimination. Through the seemingly benevolent “daddy” character and the play on ‘cause (i.e., because) and ‘case (i.e., in case), she highlights how gender-nonconforming individuals are predictively surveilled and assumed to already be guilty. Reflecting on daddy-boy sexual paradigms, Jack Halberstam reads the “sideways” relations of queer practices as an enactment of “rupture as substitution” to create a new project that “holds on to vestiges of the old but distorts” (226). Upending power and control, queer art has the capacity to both reveal and undermine hegemonic structures while simultaneously allowing for the distortion of the old to create something new.Employing the sublimatory relations of bondage, discipline, sadism, and masochism (BDSM), Blas’s queer installation similarly creates a sideways representation that re-orientates the logic of the biometric scanners, thereby unveiling the always already sexualised relations of scrutiny and interrogation as well as the submissive complicity they demand. Replacing the airport environment with a dark and foreboding mise-en-scène allows Blas to focus on capture rather than mobility, highlighting the ways in which border checkpoints (including those instantiated by the airport) encourage free travel for some while foreclosing movement for others. Building on Sara Ahmed’s “phenomenology of being stopped”, Magnet considers what happens when we turn our gaze to those “who fail to pass the checkpoint” (107). In SANCTUM, the same actions are played out again and again on spectral beings who are trapped in various states: they shudder in cages, are chained to the floor, or are projected against the parameters of mounted screens. One ghostly figure, for instance, lies pinned down by metallic grappling hooks, arms raised above the head in a recognisable stance of surrender, conjuring up the now-familiar image of a traveller standing in the cylindrical scanner machine, waiting to be screened. In portraying this extended moment of immobility, Blas lays bare the deep contradictions in the rhetoric of “freedom of movement” that underlies such spaces.On a global level, media reporting, scientific studies, and policy documents proclaim that biometrics are essential to ensuring personal safety and national security. Within the public imagination, these technologies become seductive because of their marked ability to identify terrorist attackers—to reveal threatening bodies—thereby appealing to the anxious citizen’s fear of the disguised suicide bomber. Yet for marginalised identities prefigured as criminal or deceptive—including transgender and black and brown bodies—the inability to perform such acts of revelation via submission to screening can result in humiliation and further discrimination, public shaming, and even tortuous inquiry – acts that are played out in SANCTUM.Masked GenitalsFeminist surveillance studies scholar Rachel Hall has referred to the impetus for revelation in the post-9/11 era as a desire for a universal “aesthetics of transparency” in which the world and the body is turned inside-out so that there are no longer “secrets or interiors … in which terrorists or terrorist threats might find refuge” (127). Hall takes up the case study of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab (infamously known as “the Underwear Bomber”) who attempted to detonate plastic explosives hidden in his underwear while onboard a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit on 25 December 2009. Hall argues that this event signified a coalescence of fears surrounding bodies of colour, genitalia, and terrorism. News reports following the incident stated that Abdulmutallab tucked his penis to make room for the explosive, thereby “queer[ing] the aspiring terrorist by indirectly referencing his willingness … to make room for a substitute phallus” (Hall 289).  Overtly manifested in the Underwear Bomber incident is also a desire to voyeuristically expose a hidden, threatening interiority, which is inherently implicated with anxieties surrounding gender deviance. Beauchamp elaborates on how gender deviance and transgression have coalesced with terrorism, which was exemplified in the wake of the 9/11 attacks when the United States Department of Homeland Security issued a memo that male terrorists “may dress as females in order to discourage scrutiny” (“Artful” 359). Although this advisory did not explicitly reference transgender populations, it linked “deviant” gender presentation—to which we could also add Abdulmutallab’s tucking of his penis—with threats to national security (Beauchamp, Going Stealth). This also calls to mind a broader discussion of the ways in which genitalia feature in the screening process. Prior to the introduction of millimetre-wave body scanning technology, the most common form of scanner used was the backscatter imaging machine, which displayed “naked” body images of each passenger to the security agent. Due to privacy concerns, these machines were replaced by the scanners currently in place which use a generic outline of a passenger (exemplified in SANCTUM) to detect possible threats.It is here worth returning to Blas’s installation, as it also implicitly critiques the security protocols that attempt to reveal genitalia as both threatening and as evidence of an inner truth about a body. At one moment in the installation a bayonet-like object pierces the blank crotch of the mannequin, shattering it into holographic fragments. The apparent genderlessness of the mannequins is contrasted with these graphic sexual acts. The penetrating metallic instrument that breaks into the loin of the mannequin, combined with the camera shot that slowly zooms in on this action, draws attention to a surveillant fascination with genitalia and revelation. As Nicholas L. Clarkson documents in his analysis of airport security protocols governing prostheses, including limbs and packies (silicone penis prostheses), genitals are a central component of the screening process. While it is stipulated that physical searches should not require travellers to remove items of clothing, such as underwear, or to expose their genitals to staff for inspection, prosthetics are routinely screened and examined. This practice can create tensions for trans or disabled passengers with prosthetics in so-called “sensitive” areas, particularly as guidelines for security measures are often implemented by airport staff who are not properly trained in transgender-sensitive protocols.ConclusionAccording to media technologies scholar Jeremy Packer, “rather than being treated as one to be protected from an exterior force and one’s self, the citizen is now treated as an always potential threat, a becoming bomb” (382). Although this technological policing impacts all who are subjected to security regimes (which is to say, everyone), this amalgamation of body and bomb has exacerbated the ways in which bodies socially coded as threatening or deceptive are targeted by security and surveillance regimes. Nonetheless, others have argued that the use of invasive forms of surveillance can be justified by the state as an exchange: that citizens should willingly give up their right to privacy in exchange for safety (Monahan 1). Rather than subscribing to this paradigm, Blas’ SANCTUM critiques the violence of mandatory complicity in this “trade-off” narrative. Because their operationalisation rests on normative notions of embodiment that are governed by preconceptions around gender, race, sexuality and ability, surveillance systems demand that bodies become transparent. This disproportionally affects those whose bodies do not match norms, with trans and queer bodies often becoming unreadable (Kafer and Grinberg). The shadowy realm of SANCTUM illustrates this tension between biometric revelation and resistance, but also suggests that opacity may be a tool of transformation in the face of such discriminatory violations that are built into surveillance.ReferencesAhmed, Sara. “A Phenomenology of Whiteness.” Feminist Theory 8.2 (2007): 149–68.Beauchamp, Toby. “Artful Concealment and Strategic Visibility: Transgender Bodies and U.S. State Surveillance after 9/11.” Surveillance &amp; Society 6.4 (2009): 356–66.———.

"2020","Warning: Notifications About Crime on Campus May Have Unwanted Effects","The 1990 Jeanne Clery Act mandates that U.S. colleges and universities issue reports about certain crimes and notifications about immediate threats. While the intent of these policies is to increase safety, researchers have raised concerns about the effectiveness of mobile notifications, the lack of context and detail in these short messages, and the variety in recipients’ interpretations. In this mixed-methods study, we are interested in the relationship between respondents’ worry about crime and their perceptions of and reactions to notifications about crime incidents on campus. We use a media studies approach, employing quantitative and qualitative survey questions as well as in-depth interviews with three campus officials to understand the production and reception of notification messages about crime. We find that some respondents seem inattentive to notifications, whereas others appear to overreact, which suggests that the Clery Act might actually decrease safety on college campuses.","",""

It further investigates whether gender difference exists in relationships among variables. The results of an online survey of Korean adults ( N  = 522, 49.4% females) showed that users’ social networks, privacy concerns, and privacy protection behaviors are significant factors in the increase of eWOM. Conversely, understanding privacy policies has no significant impact on eWOM. The findings about gender difference revealed that women, who have more actual friends, were more likely to engage in eWOM than were men, and that women prefer to create eWOM when they have a higher level of privacy protection behavior. Further implications are discussed in light of expanding social networks and effective privacy settings as well as the need for a gender-sensitive social media marketing strategy.","",""

We demonstrate that their authors are attempting to undermine prevailing practices related to privacy, through OMD production and publication, especially the standard concealment of private information regarding wrongdoing, a practice that OMD authors perceive as exacerbating their own suffering and that of sufferers like them. The study shows that by authoring and disseminating OMDs, authors displace the symbolic boundaries that have been central to informational norms in modern society, including distances between private places and public arenas and among social groups. We observe OMD through the analytical lens of structuration theory, a powerful tool for generation of novel insights into the role human agents now play in constituting privacy-related practices.","",""

"2020","Australia’s encryption laws: practical need or political strategy?","To investigate terrorism, law enforcement and intelligence agencies increasingly require assistance from multinational technology companies including Facebook, Google and Apple. These companies can assist with decrypting secret communications or unlocking personal devices, but not, they maintain, without undermining the privacy and security of all their users. While other western countries continue to debate these issues, Australia legislated quickly to enhance decryption capabilities with little industry consultation. This article examines the encryption laws recently enacted by the Australian federal parliament, which allow law enforcement and intelligence agencies to require technical assistance from ‘designated communications providers’. It interrogates the government’s justifications for these laws and examines the wider legal and political context in which they were enacted. The analysis confirms that Australia’s approach to decryption does not represent sound practice and instead reflects a pattern of rights-infringing lawmaking in response to terrorism.","",""

The legislation is significant both domestically and internationally because of its extraterritorial reach, allowing the development of new ways for Australian law enforcement and security agencies to access encrypted telecommunications via transnational designated communications providers, and allowing for Australian authorities to assist foreign counterparts in both enforcing and potentially circumventing their domestic laws.

"2020","Privacy self-management and the issue of privacy externalities: of thwarted expectations, and harmful exploitation","This article argues that the self-management of one's privacy is impossible due to privacy externalities. Privacy externalities are the negative by-product of the services offered by some data controllers, whereby the price to """"pay"""" for a service includes not just the provision of the user's own personal data, but also that of others. This term, related to similar concepts from the literature on privacy such as """"networked privacy"""" or """"data pollutio"""", is used here to bring to light the incentives and exploitative dynamics behind a phenomenon which, I demonstrate, benefits both the user and the data controller to the detriment of third-party data subjects. Building on these novel elements and on the relevant concepts and examples found in the existing literature, this article draws a comprehensive picture of the phenomenon, and offers two promising paths to address it-better enforcing the principle of data protection by design and by default, and relying on the framework of joint controllership.","",""
"2020","Personal information management systems: a user-centric privacy utopia?","Personal information management systems (PIMS) aka personal data stores (PDSs) represent an emerging class of technology that seeks to empower individuals regarding their data. Presented as an alternative to current ‘centralised’ data processing approaches, whereby user data is (rather opaquely) collected and processed by organisations, PDSs provide users with technical mechanisms for aggregating and managing their own data, determining when and with whom their data is shared, and the computation that may occur over that data. Though arguments for decentralisation may be appealing, there are questions regarding the extent to which PDSs actually address data processing concerns. This paper explores these questions from the perspective of PDS users. Specifically, we focus on data protection, including how PDSs relate to rights and the legal bases for processing, as well as how PDSs affect the information asymmetries and surveillance practices inherent online. We show that, despite the purported benefits of PDSs, many of the systemic issues of online/data ecosystems remain.","",""

While these arrangements aim to protect vulnerable child victims from predatory online behaviour, they also skew established notions of due process and the rule of law to favour US sovereignty and criminal enforcement power. We conclude by explaining the impact of these issues on the dynamics of global online criminal investigations.","",""

However, few individuals were able to recover any damages from the data protection violation that occurred. The EU General Data Protection Regulation contains legal tools to coordinate the interests of data subjects together in the case of infringements that occur across member states of the European Union, not only at the national level (Article 80), but potentially at the transnational level, as implied by Article 81. However, only a reform addressing the rules applicable to the standing of associations and non-governmental organisations in transnational claims as well as those concerning jurisdiction and international lis pendens would allow EU citizens to take full advantage of this opportunity.","",""

"2020","The biggest lie on the Internet: ignoring the privacy policies and terms of service policies of social networking services","ABSTRACT This paper addresses ‘the biggest lie on the internet’ with an empirical investigation of privacy policy (PP) and terms of service (TOS) policy reading behavior. An experimental survey (N = 543) assessed the extent to which individuals ignored PP and TOS when joining a fictitious social networking service (SNS), NameDrop. Results reveal 74% skipped PP, selecting the ‘quick join’ clickwrap. Average adult reading speed (250–280 words per minute), suggests PP should have taken 29–32 minutes and TOS 15–17 minutes to read. For those that didn’t select the clickwrap, average PP reading time was 73 seconds. All participants were presented the TOS and had an average reading time of 51 seconds. Most participants agreed to the policies, 97% to PP and 93% to TOS, with decliners reading PP 30 seconds longer and TOS 90 seconds longer. A regression analysis identifies information overload as a significant negative predictor of reading TOS upon sign up, when TOS changes, and when PP changes. Qualitative findings suggest that participants view policies as nuisance, ignoring them to pursue the ends of digital production, without being inhibited by the means. Implications are revealed as 98% missed NameDrop TOS ‘gotcha clauses’ about data sharing with the NSA and employers, and about providing a first-born child as payment for SNS access.","",""

Across 63 countries, online government monitoring is negatively associated with democratization, while internet censorship exhibits no additional effect. We theorize that suppression technologies erode democratic progress by thwarting collective action and examine how they affect individual-level disruptive political participation in a sub-sample of 21 countries. Together, these results suggest the need for greater scrutiny of countries that use suppression technologies. Political implications are discussed.","",""
"2020","Seeing like a surveillance agency? Sensor realism as aesthetic critique of visual data governance","ABSTRACT Despite the centrality of visual data creation and analysis in security-related governance not only of heavily surveilled battlefields, but of fields as diverse as petty crime, urban mobility and migration, the sensors and systems producing visual data used for security purposes are rarely themselves the focus of close scrutiny. This is surprising as photography, IR, and science and technology studies literature all point towards equipment as being agential and transformative. We argue that in the photo-series Heat Maps, the Irish photographer Richard Mosse opens up for a much-needed discussion of visual data production by appropriating equipment normally used for surveillance. We develop the idea of sensor realism by considering Mosse’s Heat Maps in dialogue with other aesthetic and photographic traditions and concepts. By sensor realism, we mean an aesthetic realism based on the visual replication of technologies used in visualising and governing an issue, rather than on a photorealistic depiction of an issue. Sensor realism, thus, is the critical artistic appropriation of visual data production equipment, aesthetics and practices, and allows viewers to scrutinise how visual data production reassembles and formats that which it observes. We discuss the politics of sensor realism and argue that used as a critical aesthetic it can reveal how visual data production practices are productive and enact ways of seeing that prefigure visual governance by structuring how reality is made available for governance in visual data. But due to its appropriation of sensing technologies, it always risks confirming the practices it seeks to critique.","",""

The analysis reveals a complex supply-chain network entangled with histories of settler-colonialism, racialization and gendered inequities. Bolstered by developments in cloud computing, concealing the human and nonhuman supply-chains, these systems are never detached from material inputs; rather, they are embedded in vast infrastructural systems and complex transnational supply chains powered by logics of extraction, circulation and accumulation of capital. I argue that Amazon Ring cameras are an articulation of “infrastructural power” defined by Laleh Khalili (2018: 915) as an assemblage of “practices, discourses, physical fixtures, laws and procedures” with the aim of (re)producing capitalist relations. Through a material and discursive analysis, this paper aims to draw into the light the complex human and non-human entanglements that constitute community surveillance networks in order to move towards an infrastructural critique so that we may more effectively evaluate the social costs of digital systems that can never be detached from their material and human creators.","",""
"2020","DEFENDING AGAINST SOCIAL MEDIA: HOW PUBLIC CRIMINAL DEFENSE HELPS US   ADDRESS SOCIAL MEDIA GOVERNANCE","As justice-minded academics, we want to understand the role of social media in civil society with a vested interest in ensuring that social media serves a pluralistic society fairly and equitably. Gillespie (2018) has helped frame this task in terms of both governance of platforms and by platforms, but we also want to know what state governments do with social media (Gorwa, 2019). This paper focuses on how social media companies cooperate with state governments to hold users criminally liable, and the lessons this case bears for understanding and improving the fairness and equity of judicial governance. We draw on interviews with twenty public criminal defenders in NYC in which we asked: 1) where social media appears in their cases and the role it plays; 2) their access to user content and social media companies; and, 3) how they use social media as evidence and defend against it. We identified three problem areas around fair and equal access to the law. First, we heard concerns that the cooperation of social media companies was asymmetrical because companies worked almost exclusively with law enforcement. Second, public defenders were upset about overly broad search warrants that furnished the full contents of a suspect’s social media account. Third, public defenders complained about the use and admission of prejudicial evidence that played to negative, racial stereotypes of their clients. We suggest several reforms for judicial governance, including more nearly equitable cooperation practices, restrictions on search warrants, and admissibility protocols and disclaimers on admitted materials.","",""

How do we make sense of our present state of concurrent awareness of and obliviousness of living our everyday lives under ubiquitous surveillance? This presentation will explore these questions through an analysis of a selection of creepypasta stories that draw their horror from the experience of being watched by - or through - a machine. Conceptualized as “digital urban legends” and “contemporary folklore” creepypastas are short internet-based horror stories often posted anonymously and copied and pasted from forum to forum and collected in online archives.The stories analysed in this paper bring their horror to the technological devices that permeate our everyday lives, such as web cameras, GPS navigation, home security systems, and baby monitors. In these stories, the topic of surveillance and the experience of being watched is a pervasive theme, and quotidian technological devices take on a threatening presence. Sometimes the threat is connected to the idea of surveillance by nefarious corporations or hostile individuals, while in other stories the horror emerges from the realization that the watcher is not human at all. Combining horror tropes with the idea of digital surveillance, these stories function as affective articulations that reveal the anxieties that haunt our relationship with the devices with which we surround ourselves. Through its analysis, this paper argues that the fears articulated in these stories revolve around how machine vision technologies mediate our relationship with reality and redistribute agency within human/machine assemblages.","",""

PRIVACY NORMALIZATION TRENDS IN EMERGING   TECHNOLOGY","In the last few years, smart security and physical identification technologies have grown exponentially; people are increasingly installing smart video devices to monitor their homes and buying DNA kits to collect and analyze their genetics. As the number of users and profits of these businesses increase, so too does the potential for privacy violations and exploitation. To explore these dynamics of privacy in emerging technology, we conducted a U.S. nationally representative survey (N=1,587) and asked respondents for their perceptions of a number of emerging technologies such as facial recognition, DNA collection and biometrics monitoring. We also measured individual-level traits that have been found to influence technology acceptance. The results show that the actor wielding the technology matters for people’s acceptance. Respondents were overall more comfortable with public officials and airlines using more invasive technologies to guarantee people’s safety, as compared to private companies or non-profits using data for research. When keeping the actor constant across privacy technologies, there was an overwhelming preference for less invasive means of privacy data sharing. These findings indicate how the concept of normalization, social context and agents of control play a critical role in the way people accept emerging technology into their lives.","",""

Presently, cameras are located in over 680 sites around the city. The surveillance initiative’s rapid expansion has been met with significant pushback from the community regarding its quiet incorporation of automated face recognition technologies. As activists have argued, the use of a technology with a significantly higher error rate for people of color to surveil a population that is over 80% nonwhite risks reproducing and exacerbating existing racial biases within the criminal justice system (Detroit Community Technology Project, 2019). Many of the concerns that community members have raised, including the possibility of algorithmic misidentification and the influence of PGL cameras on residents’ use of public space, speak to the question of what human and nonhuman agencies and relationalities exist in PGL spaces and their impact on the residents and landscape of Detroit. In this paper, I focus on the discursive flexibility of the term real time in PGL to diagram the web of human and nonhuman relations within the space. I trace three narratives of real time mapping the human and nonhuman temporalities they reference. Informed by a theoretical framework of Digital Studies, Critical Race Studies, and Indigenous Studies, I explore the racial justice possibilities of theorizing resistance inclusive of more-than-human perspectives and ethics.   ","",""

It teases out various moments of “collision of information norms” or “context collapse” (Marwick and boyd, 2014, p. 1054), which complicate privacy and regulations thereof in recent years. As we are at a critical juncture where information norms are being enshrined in different parts of the world including the EU's GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and the CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) in the U.S., understanding complex layers of context collapses can shed light on the legal grey areas that would need further examination. This study investigated the U.S. news coverage on digital privacy between January 2018 and June 2020 to explore any layers/moments of “context collapses” with regard to privacy. I conducted a Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) (Fairclough, 2013), closely examining 300 samples out of 5,874 articles.

To control the outbreak and maintain the state, the Chinese government implemented the """"Alipay Health Code” in collaboration with technology giants like Alibaba, while South Korea launched a “self-quarantine safety protection app” to enforce home isolation to suspected carriers and monitor their health statuses. By comparatively analyzing these quarantine surveillance mobile applications that the Chinese and South Korean governments are utilizing in pandemic control, we investigate how these two different governmental regimes - one authoritarian and the other democratic - construct and propagate what their state-of-the-art surveillance technologies can offer to the public in moments of emergency. Through a mixture of walk-through method and situational analysis, this article aims to unpack the processes in which these technologies become developed and examine the politics around their deployment. More broadly, we argue that analyzing them offers new opportunities to investigate the relationship between state surveillance and personal privacy in the context of a national crisis. As surveillance tactics that were deemed oppressive and undemocratic in ordinary times get easily normalized in crisis situations, these moments allow us to reveal the precarious and flexible nature of surveillance and privacy while destabilizing the West-oriented, dichotomic understanding of these concepts. This article tackles this question by observing the relationships among relevant actors – the state officials, industry professionals, and general users – and various contestations/negotiations involved in the processes of designing and deploying these quarantine surveillance apps.","",""

There is also keen interest in using these technologies to regulate and optimize the emotional experiences of spaces, such as workplaces, hospitals, prisons, classrooms, travel infrastructures, restaurants, retail and chain stores. Developers frequently claim that their applications do not identify people. Taking the claim at face value, this paper asks, what are the privacy implications of emotional AI practices that do not identify individuals? To investigate privacy perspectives on soft non-identifying emotional AI, the paper draws upon the following: over 100 interviews with the emotion detection industry, legal community, policy-makers, regulators and NGOs interested in privacy; a workshop with stakeholders to design ethical codes for using data about emotions; a UK survey of 2068 citizens on feelings about emotion capture technologies. It finds a weak consensus among social stakeholders on the need for privacy, this driven by different interests and motivations. Given this weak consensus, it concludes that there exists a limited window of opportunity to societally agree principles of practice regarding privacy and the use of data about emotions.","",""

The attempts made by these organisations to connect analytically with users raise questions about whether surveillance, and its associated ethical and rights-based concerns, are intensified. The articles in this special themed issue explore this question from both organisational and user perspectives. They highlight the hype which firms use to drive consumer, employee and service user engagement with analytics within both private and public spaces. Further, they explore extent to which, through Big Data, there is an attempt to expand surveillance into the emotional registers of domestic, embodied experience. Collectively, the papers reveal a fascinating nexus between the much-vaunted potential of analytics, the data practices themselves and the newly configured intimate spheres which have been drawn into the commercial value chain. Together, they highlight the need for conceptual and regulatory innovation so that analytics in practice may be better understood and critiqued. Whilst there is now a rich variety of scholarship on Big Data Analytics, critical perspectives on the organising practices of Big Data Analytics and its surveillance implications are thin on the ground. Combined, the articles published in this special theme begin to address this shortcoming. ","",""
"2020","Cambridge Analytica’s black box"," The Cambridge Analytica–Facebook scandal led to widespread concern over the methods deployed by Cambridge Analytica to target voters through psychographic profiling algorithms, built upon Facebook user data. The scandal ultimately led to a record-breaking $5 billion penalty imposed upon Facebook by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in July 2019. The FTC action, however, has been criticized as failing to adequately address the privacy and other harms emanating from Facebook’s release of approximately 87 million Facebook users’ data, which was exploited without user authorization. This Essay summarizes the FTC’s response to the Cambridge Analytica–Facebook scandal. It concludes that the scandal focuses attention on the need to explore the potential for embedding due process-type inquiries and protections within the enforcement actions by regulatory agencies such as the FTC. These protections are increasingly important in addressing the problem of “black boxing the voter” that is now presented by data- and algorithmic-driven companies such as Cambridge Analytica and Facebook.

We show that although home has never been private, the rapid adoption and acceptance of technologies in the home for quarantine, work and study, enabled by the pandemic, is rescripting privacy. The acceleration of technology adoption and surveillance in the home has implications for privacy and potential discrimination, and should be approached with a critical lens. ","",""

Forging through the uncertain epidemiology of environmental illness, “Beacon” mothers began documenting their children’s ailments after the new carpet installation, but the school district dismissed the mothers' citizen science.  The Superintendent continued to vouch for the carpet’s safety based on the industry’s voluntary “Green Label.”  A historical section of this article therefore recounts how and why the carpet industry invented this label in the aftermath of a scandal in which new carpets sickened a fifth of the EPA workforce at their headquarters in Washington, DC between 1987 and 1988.  Thirty years later, once again, three California environmental regulatory agencies are scrutinizing the carpet industry for hazardous ingredients.&#x0D;  ","",""

Bringing together literature from communication, criminology, and science and technology studies, we use a case study of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA to outline that predictive policing, rather than being a novel development, is in fact part of a much larger, historical network of power and control. By examining the mechanics of these policing practices: the data inputs, behavioral outputs, as well as the key controllers of these systems, and the individuals who influenced their adoption, we show that predictive policing as a form of big data surveillance is a sociotechnical system that is wholly human-constructed, biases and all. Identifying these elements of the surveillance network then allows us to turn our attention to the resistive practices of communities who historically and presently live under surveillance – pointing to the types of actions and imaginaries required to combat the myth and allure that swirls around the rhetoric of big data surveillance today.

"2020","Everyday Surveillance, Goffman, and Unfocused Interaction","It is often said that surveillance has massively transformed our social lives (Lyon, Haggerty, and Ball 2012: 1), but this claim is weakened by the admission that its “effects are difficult to isolate or observe, as they are embedded within many normal aspects of daily life.” Picking up this analytic challenge, this paper investigates the everyday interactional practice and experience of being surveilled. To do so, it draws on Goffman’s account of the interaction order, dwelling closely on unfocused interaction in which people maintain a side-of-the-eye, half-an-ear awareness of the people, objects, and events in the space around them. After introducing key concepts from Goffman, the paper discusses three scenes of surveillance: a woman walking down a city street, two men putting up street stickers (a civil offence), and passengers being scanned at an airport (Pütz 2012). It shows how different senses of potential threat and illegality enter the experience of surveillance, and it builds a rudimentary model. This paper considers only a tiny fraction of contemporary surveillance, but it shows Goffman’s value as an analytic resource that can hold large-scale generalisations about the surveillance society to account, allowing us to see agentive responses to surveillance that are too subtle to be captured by notions like subversion and resistance. Indeed, Goffman corroborates Green and Zurawski’s (2015) suggestion that surveillance is a basic mode of the social, elaborated in different ways in different environments.","",""
"2020","Lawful Illegality: Authorizing Extraterritorial Police Surveillance","This paper examines Lisa Austin’s (2015) concept of lawful illegality, which interrogates the legal foundations for potentially unlawful surveillance practices by United States (US) signals intelligence (SIGINT) agencies. Lawful illegality involves the technically lawful operation of surveillance powers that might be considered unlawful when examined through a rule of law framework. We argue lawful illegality is expanding into domestic policing through judicial decisions that sanction complex and technically sophisticated forms of remote online surveillance, such as the use of malware, remote hacking, or Network Investigative Techniques (NITs). Operation Pacifier targeted and dismantled the Playpen dark web site, which was used for distributing child exploitation material (CEM), and has generated many judicial rulings examining the legality of remote surveillance by the FBI. We have selected two contrasting cases that demonstrate how US domestic courts have employed distinct logics to determine the admissibility of evidence collected through the NIT deployed in Operation Pacifier. The first case, United States v. Carlson (2017 US Dist. LEXIS 67991), offers a critical view of the use of NITs by the FBI, with physical geography constraining the legality of this form of surveillance in US criminal procedure. The second case, United States v. Gaver (2017 US Dist. LEXIS 44757), authorizes the use of NITs because the need to control crime is believed to justify suspending the geographic limits on police surveillance to identify people involved in the creation and dissemination of CEM. We argue this crime control emphasis expands the reach of US police surveillance while undermining due process of law by removing the protective function of geography. We conclude by suggesting the permissive geographic scope of police surveillance reflected in United States v. Gaver (2017 US Dist. LEXIS 44757), and many other Playpen cases, erodes due process for all crime suspects, but is particularly acute for people located outside the US, and suggest a neutral transnational arbiter could help limit contentious forms of remote extraterritorial police surveillance.","",""

After a brief review of surveillance in Indian education, this essay examines a cycle of films—The Only Good Indian (2009), Savage (2009), The Dead Can’t Dance (2010), Rhymes for Young Ghouls (2013), and SNIP (2016)—wherein the practices and technologies of surveillance mediate a dynamic interplay between settler educational institutions and the Native runaway or truant. These films converge a popular undead motif with this longstanding genre figure of resistance by Native/First Nations children to settler systems of administration, drawing on its literary formation that extends back to the first Indigenous writing on federal Indian education. Within this larger field of what we may call Indigenous surveillance cinema, discourses of bureaucratic rationality frame the figure of the truant. These films articulate the ways that representational practices ranging from literacy to cinema uphold systems of identification by which administrative surveillance of Indigenous people continues. Cinematic representations of the supervision of Indigenous bodies recall settler-colonialism’s mobilization of an array of early surveillance technologies for the assimilation of Native children. In this context, the watchful eye of the teacher—a proxy for administrative media—suggests a deeper embedding in settler systems of control. A visual poetics of truancy emerges in Indigenous surveillance cinema, as the truant figure operates dialectically with settler surveillance. The truant spatializes settler management and surveillance in her desire to escape cultural conversion at the hands of these proliferating technologies of representation.","",""
"2020","The I’s of the Informant: Memoirs of Surveillance Society","The informant is both a controversial medium of security and a maligned cultural figure. Their actions and stories about their actions are integral nodes in the economy of fear that structures surveillance society. This paper examines how Cold War and war on terror informants tell stories about themselves (Budenz 1947; Speckhard and Shaikh 2014) against the backdrop of a “fear of small numbers” (Appadurai 2006) on the home front. The overlapping intentions (confession, memoir, apology) and I’s (narrated, narrating, and ideological) in their memoirs provide an entry point for assessing how informants assert their authority and how they reproduce the security cultures in which they find themselves. Each memoir draws on ideological pairings central to discourses of infiltration and radicalization, respectively. The authors confess to having been the duped or radicalized westerner but narrate from the position of the patriotic Catholic or “good Muslim.” Ultimately, I argue that the narrative and ideological climax of the memoirs lies in how the transformation from enemy to friend is presented: as the result of a chance encounter. This shifts the fear of small numbers from the one amongst us who might become a traitor to the slim and incalculable probability through which one returns from extremism, which is by definition less than one. Marked as the exception, the narrative reinforces the necessity of the informant in security practices.","",""
"2020","Police Bodycams as Equiveillance Tools?: Reflections on the Debate in the Netherlands","In the United States of America, police body-worn cameras (bodycams) were introduced to protect civilians against violence by law enforcement authorities. In the Netherlands, however, the same technology has been introduced to record and discipline the behavior of the growing number of citizens using their smartphone cameras to film the (mis)conduct of police. In answer to these citizens sousveilling the police and publishing their images on social media, the bodycam was introduced as an objective referee that also includes the perspective of the police officer. According to this view, the bodycam is a tool of equiveillance: a situation with a diversity of perspectives in which surveillance and sousveillance are in balance (Mann 2005). Various factors, however, hamper the equiveillant usage of bodycams in the Netherlands. Firstly, the attachment of the bodycam to the uniform of the officer leads to an imbalanced representation of perspectives. The police perspective is emphasized by the footage that is literally taken from their perspective, in which others are filmed slightly from below, making them look bigger and more overwhelming. Also, the police officers’ movements create shaky footage with deceptive intensity that invokes the image of a hectic situation that calls for police action. Secondly, it is the officer who decides when to wear a camera and when to start and stop recording. This leaves the potential to not record any misconduct. Thirdly, access to the recorded images, whilst in theory open to police and citizens alike, is in practice exclusively for the police. Within the current regulatory framework, bodycams are thus not neutral reporters of interactions between civilians and the police. We will end our contribution to this Dialogue section with suggestions for the improvement of those rules and reflect on the question of whether bodycams can ever be objective referees.","",""
"2020","“Stay Vigilant”: Copwatching in Germany","In the US, forms of sousveillance have been part of the repertoire of black liberation movements since the times of slavery. Opposing racialized surveillance by inverting the gaze of the oppressor can be an empowering practice for marginalized populations, yet it also raises important questions: Could sousveillance inadvertently support the ideology of surveillance? When does “dark sousveillance” (Browne 2015: 21) succeed in criticizing and subverting the status quo of racialized surveillance? How do activists negotiate the risk of providing even more data that can be de-contextualized, misinterpreted, and, ultimately, even used against practitioners of sousveillance? I will address these questions with regard to current copwatching practices in Germany. Using the project Cop Map as a case study, I will examine both the potentially liberating power and ambiguities of sousveillance as well as critical factors for success. Cop Map (https://www.cop-map.com), a German copwatching website designed by two artivist collectives, allows citizens to report police presence and racial profiling while ensuring data protection for users of the app. Cop Map is directed against increased state surveillance and police powers, but also reaches out to organizations that mainly address racial profiling. Building on intersectional alliances and networks of solidarity, sousveillance can create spaces to counter racist police practices and raise awareness—especially if embedded in broader efforts and organizational structures to combat (police) surveillance and protect data privacy. The subversive potential of forms of “surveillance from below” is complex, culturally and historically contingent, and predicated on their contextualization within broader movements.","",""
"2020","Safe is a Wonderful Feeling: Atmospheres of Surveillance and Contemporary Art","This paper examines how the combined prism of contemporary art and the notion of atmosphere may offer alternative perspectives on our encounters with places and practices of surveillance. Specifically, this article investigates the atmospheres of surveillance surfacing in the video installation Safe Conduct (2016a) by British contemporary artist Ed Atkins. The artwork recreates the well-known situation of going through an airport security check. Through a combination of visual narrative and a soundscape blending the sounds of the conveyor belt and X-ray machines with heavy breathing and Ravel’s Boléro, the work builds up an uncanny anticipation of something awful. Death and violence linger at its edges, and a disquieting atmosphere fills the exhibition space. The objective of the article is twofold: First, it explores the shifting and ambiguous atmospheres produced by contemporary surveillance practices through an immersive reading of the artwork Safe Conduct. Second, and connected to the first, it offers an experimental methodology of written vignettes responding to the embodied, aesthetic experience of atmospheres of surveillance. The article concludes that being more sensitive to the atmospheres of surveillance in our environment can give us a space to think critically about how these atmospheres affect us, how they are absorbed bodily, and how they attune our being: how surveillance is “in the air.”","",""

"2020","Identifying Suspicious Bodies? Historically Tracing Criminal Identification Technologies in Portugal","This article explores how criminal identification technologies evolved in Portugal since the end of the nineteenth century from anthropometric measurements to descriptive, photographic, dactyloscopic, and genetic methods. The historical trajectory of these identification technologies allows us to reflect on the continuities and discontinuities of past and current practices that aim to inscribe the individual identity as a bureaucratic category. The chronological and geographical contexts are fundamental to understanding the archival uses of different techniques that seek to document (on paper and electronically) the suspicious body. Through the collection of documentary evidence (such as case files, reports, personal records, and legislation), this historical analysis situates the use and implementation of these techniques in the Portuguese context. This article demonstrates that the need to identify the criminal and to follow technological developments has been constantly used as a political argument to legitimise the implementation of these technologies. But it also concludes that these identification procedures tend to be extended to the entire population, widening the political will to identify and monitor not only “suspicious” bodies but also those who are regarded as “respectable” citizens.","",""

"2020","Metadata, Jailbreaking, and the Cybernetic Governmentality of iOS: Or, the Need to Distinguish Digital Privacy from digital privacy","Digital privacy tends to be understood as the “top-down” regulation and control of personal information on the behalf of corporate and governmental institutions, realized through various policies and practices. While smartphone manufacturers increasingly innovate and alter their policies and practices to reflect new and ongoing cyber challenges, they tend to emphasize the protection of personal information in the form of content data. On the other hand, there is metadata: the measurements and math of content data. Abundant and ubiquitous in their discrete movements, they are the most precious commodity in the world of big data mobile analytics. Smartphone metadata are also one of the most pressing privacy concerns precisely because it is exceedingly difficult to see, study, and analyze. However, there is another realm through which digital privacy exists: a realm where the inability to see and study metadata is unacceptable. This entirely differently realm is comprised of jailbreakers—a network of hacktivist programmers injecting software-based “tweaks” into Apple mobile devices in ways that reveal metadata to users and allow users to control them. By doing so, jailbreakers allow users to build previously unrealized relationships with metadata and thereby radically distinguishing “top-down” Digital Privacy from “bottom-up” digital privacy. Although Apple has routinely resisted jailbreaking citing fears over device instability, user security vulnerability, and Terms of Use violations, this article reveals that many key privacy-first jailbreaking tweaks undermine Apple’s ability to monopolize metadata flows. Theorised through a cybernetic governmentality, this intervention demonstrates the extents to which Apple goes to reify its profit-first vision of information protection, one which insulates many metadata flows from its users. Through this theoretical approach, we as analysts can critically glean awareness of the politics of the (in)visibility and (il)legibility of metadata and the role they play in the discourse on digital, mobile data protection.","",""
"2020","Mapping Interfacial Regimes of Control: A Qualitative Analysis of America’s Post-9/11 Security Technology Infrastructure","Recent technological advancements in surveillance and data analysis software have drastically transformed how the United States manages its immigration and national security systems. In particular, an increased emphasis on information sharing and predictive threat modeling following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, has prompted agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security to acquire powerful data analysis software from private sector vendors, including those in Silicon Valley. However, the impacts of these private sector technologies, especially in the context of privacy rights and civil liberties, are not yet fully understood. This article interrogates those potential impacts, particularly on the lives of immigrants, by analyzing the relational database system Investigative Case Management (ICM), which is used extensively by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to track, manage, and enforce federal immigration policy. As a theoretical framework, the we use Benjamin Bratton’s concept of the “interfacial regime,” or the layered assemblages of interfaces that exist in modern networked ICT infrastructures. By conducting a document analysis, we attempt to visually situate ICM within the federal government’s larger interfacial regime that is composed by various intertwined databases both within and outside the government’s realm of management. Furthermore, we question and critique the role ICM plays in surveilling and governing the lives of immigrants and citizens alike.","",""
"2020","Normative Paradoxes of Privacy: Literacy and Choice in Platform Societies","Privacy scholars, advocates, and activists repeatedly emphasize the fact that current measures of privacy protection are insufficient to counter the systemic threats presented by datafication and platformization (van Dijck, de Waal, and Poell 2018: 24). These threats include discrimination against underprivileged groups, monopolization of power and knowledge, as well as manipulation. In this paper, we take that analysis one step further, suggesting that the consequences of inappropriate privacy protection online possibly even run counter to the normative principles that underpinned the standard clause for privacy protection in the first place. We discuss the ways in which attempts at protection run the risk of producing results that not only diverge from but, paradoxically, even distort the normative goals they intended to reach: informational self-determination, empowerment, and personal autonomy. Drawing on the framework of “normative paradoxes,” we argue that the ideals of a normatively increasingly one-sided, liberal individualism create complicities with the structural dynamics of platform capitalism, which in turn promote those material-discursive practices of digital usage that are ultimately extremely privacy-invasive.","",""

"2020","Hiding in Plain Sight: Directed Surveillance as a Bodily Practice","In this article, we empirically explore directed surveillance as bodily practice—material bodies observing other material bodies. Such low-tech police surveillance practice (Haggerty 2012) relies on a police officer’s body as a tool and medium for information gathering. The theoretical framework used in this article is inspired by Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology of perception and the body (Merleau-Ponty [1945] 2005). The empirical starting point for our analysis is in-depth interviews with police officers conducting directed surveillance of mobile organised crime groups, supplemented by some observations. Findings illustrate how police officers conducting directed surveillance have internalised advanced perceptual and bodily skills that enable them to keep an optimal distance from the subject of their surveillance, suppress bodily responses, stay in character to protect their cover story, and appear relaxed when they are, in fact, vigilant. With this article we aim to contribute to increased knowledge and more precise discussions concerning the tacit and corporeal aspects of directed surveillance.","",""

"2020","Making the Body Electric: The Politics of Body-Worn Cameras and Facial Recognition in the United States","This paper explores the rapid deployment of police body-worn cameras (BWCs) and the subsequent push for the integration of biometric technologies (i.e., facial recognition) into these devices. To understand the political dangers of these technologies, I outline the concept of “making the body electric” to provide a critical language for cultural practices of identifying, augmenting, and fixing the body through technological means. Further, I argue how these practices reinforce normative understandings of the body and its political functionality, specifically with BWCs and facial recognition. I then analyze the rise of BWCs in a cultural moment of high-profile police violence against unarmed people of color in the United States. In addition to examining the ethics of BWCs, I examine the politics of facial recognition and the dangers that this form of biometric surveillance pose for marginalized groups, arguing against the interface of these two technologies. The pairing of BWCs with facial recognition presents a number of sociopolitical dangers that reinforce the privilege of perspective granted to police in visual understandings of law enforcement activity. It is the goal of this paper to advance critical discussion of BWCs and biometric surveillance as mechanisms for leveraging political power and racial marginalization.","",""
"2020","Fusing Race: The Phobogenics of Racializing Surveillance","This paper sets up a framework to assess how purportedly passive state surveillance comprises an infrastructure of active racialization. Frantz Fanon’s concept of “racial phobogenics,” or the process of making a raced body into an object of anxiety, can be useful for scholarship at the intersection of communication, race, data, security, policing, affect, and biopolitics. To read how local state surveillance justifies the aggregation of data by means of phobogenics, I analyzed 120 hours of field observations and conducted fourteen interviews from June 2017 to March 2018 in one US Homeland Security Fusion Center, part of the integrated intelligence system and national security strategy after 9/11. I argue that Fusion Centers’ use of “situational awareness,” the trained ability to know what is deemed “suspicious” in everyday life, fuses race or taxonomizes what is out of place and what is inflammatory according to nonconscious racializing affects. I therefore urge for a critical scholarship that attends to “prelogical rationality and affectivity” (Fanon 1986: 133) as exercises of power.","",""

Passion is a better master than discipline (to paraphrase Albert Einstein’s “Love is a better master than duty”). Our aim is not to eliminate “big science,” “big data,” and “big watching” (surveillance), but to complement these things with a balancing force. There will still be “ladder climbers,” but we aim to balance these entities and individuals with those who embody the “integrity of authenticity” and to provide a complete picture that is otherwise a half-truth when only the “big” end is present. This generalizes the notion of “open source,” where each instance of a system (e.g., computer operating system) contains or can contain its own seeds (e.g., source code). Sousveillant systems are an alternative to the otherwise sterile world of closed-source, specialist silos that are not auditable by end-users (i.e., are only auditable by authorities from “above”).","",""

"2020","The Ambivalent Subject: Reconciling Contradictory Subjective Experiences of Surveillance","This article discusses the surveillant assemblage operating within the brandscape of two American mega–casinos and the ways in which the mechanisms of this surveillance impact the subjective experiences of older adults who frequent these facilities in retirement. Based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted at these sites from 2015 to 2017, I argue that these immersive and all-inclusive spaces deploy a variety of intensive surveillance methods to ensure profitability but largely avoid many of the negative associations that this level of surveillance engenders in other settings. Older adults present an especially interesting demographic when examining intensive surveillance. While they often benefit from increased oversight and security, they are generally opposed to accessing it through other institutions, such as assisted living or nursing facilities. This apparent contradiction produces ambivalent subjects who dislike the notion of intrusive surveillance but simultaneously appreciate the benefits it can convey. This paper contributes to the ongoing dialogue in surveillance studies about the complexities of surveillant subjects, as well as presents a new perspective on the attitudes of senior citizens towards institutionalized surveillance in private and public space.","",""

To illustrate the potential of this method, I employ quantitative network analytic methods to trace the changes in and development of the vast network of public and private organizations involved in surveillance operations in the United States—what I term the “US surveillant assemblage”—from the 1970s to the 2000s. The results of the network analyses suggest that the US surveillant assemblage is becoming increasingly privatized and that the line between “public” and “private” is becoming blurred as private organizations are, at an increasing rate, partnering with the US government to engage in mass surveillance.","",""

To contextualize an understanding of the archival practices of the NSA within a wider conquest for complete security and US hegemony, this article outlines the US Department of Defense’s vision for full spectrum dominance, stressing that a show of force is exercised according to a logic of appropriate response that ranges from soft to hard power. As an organization that produces knowledge and risk factors based on data collection, the NSA is considered a central actor for understanding the US security regime’s increasing propensity for data-based surveillance that is fundamentally structured around the data center: a specific kind of archive.","",""

CCTV not only involves a technical assemblage that is used to discipline the surveilled, it is also a social assemblage in which the informal practices of operators play a major role in the multiple interpretations of images. This paper provides insights into the daily work practices and discourses of CCTV operators and their supervisors through observations of and interviews in the control room of public CCTV surveillance in Rotterdam. By providing a better understanding of the role of people in socio-technical assemblages, this paper contributes to the discussion on human mediation in computerized networks. The paper contributes to the expanding literature on surveillance as a cultural practice by combining insights on social sorting with insights on collective evaluation of unfolding situations—i.e., how group dynamics within the control room influence how people are “judged.” Building on Goffman’s frame analysis, the paper reveals the crucial role of talk and humor in re-performing what happens on the streets as well as evaluating situations and the people watched. Moreover, it discusses how these collective re-performances of what is being watched both reproduce and reshape “othering” practices within the control room. The paper shows how humorous utterances play an important part in overcoming hierarchy and collectively managing emotions, and explores how this humor influences profiling on the basis of bodily appearance.","",""

While the metaphor of the panopticon, following Michel Foucault’s work, was often applied to workplace and workplace surveillance to highlight the “disciplining” power of the supervisor’s “gaze,” this paper argues that it is only with the recent advent of digital employee monitoring technology that the workplace is becoming truly “panoptic.” With modern electronic means of surveillance, the supervisor is always “looking”—even when not physically present or not actually watching employees—as all worker actions and movements may now be recorded and analyzed (in real time or at any time in the future). This paper argues that the modern workplace approximates Bentham’s panoptic prison much more than the “traditional” workplace ever did and examines the implications of this fundamental historical change in the paradigm of employee monitoring for power relations in the modern workplace.","",""

Among other charges of wrongdoing, the ruling accused the agency of not having been forthcoming with the Court about the existence of its “Operational Data Analysis Center” (ODAC), an advanced analytics bulk metadata exploitation program that had been operational since 2006. The ruling also revealed that a significant portion of the metadata collected by CSIS should not have been retained in ODAC, a practice that the ruling declared illegal. Drawing from the ruling, a series of classified CSIS documents obtained via requests made under the Access to Information Act, various public reports from both CSIS and the Security Intelligence Review Committee, as well as a Senate Committee hearing transcript, this article examines CSIS’s conduct, justifications, and statements relating to its bulk metadata retention activities spanning from the year of ODAC’s inception in 2006 to the publication of the ODAC ruling in 2016. The paper demonstrates how CSIS engaged in various forms of secrecy and how it successfully constructed and disseminated its own big data related language to effectively “gerrymander” the national security narrative, thereby ultimately ensuring its tight control over the knowledge that the Court would have of big data surveillance and CSIS’s engagement with it. This would enable the Service to keep its metadata exploitation program out of sight and operational for ten years until the Court ended up declaring a significant portion of ODAC illegal in 2016.","",""

After acknowledging the theoretically and politically fraught implications of fighting surveillance with even more surveillance—especially given the complexities of digital capitalism’s endless desire to produce data—we conclude by exploring some of the political possibilities that lie at the margins of sousveillance capitalism (in particular, the extra-epistemological political value of sousveillance). ","",""

Most of the empirical work explicitly examining whether individuals meet the trade-off framework’s core attitudinal assumptions comes from European studies. This study uses a survey of US residents to assess the veracity of the assumptions embedded in the trade-off framework, namely whether domestic counterterrorism policies are simultaneously viewed as improving security and decreasing liberty. We find that the vast majority of US respondents do not meet the basic attitudinal assumptions of the trade-off frame. Next, we evaluate the source of these attitudes with a focus on whether attitudes toward surveillance policies merely relate to core political values or whether they also depend on the messages from political leaders. We find that both political values and opinion leadership shape these attitudes. Finally, because general attitudes towards surveillance and privacy often fail to have practical implications, we assess whether these attitudes matter for understanding the structure of policy support. Our results show that heightened terrorism threat positively associates with increased support for counterterrorism policies only when people believe these policies are effective security tools.","",""
"2020","How to Govern Visibility?: Legitimizations and Contestations of Visual Data Practices after the 2017 G20 Summit in Hamburg","Technological changes shift how visibility can be established, governed, and used. Ubiquitous visual technologies, the possibility to distribute and use images from heterogeneous sources across different social contexts and publics, and increasingly powerful facial recognition tools afford new avenues for law enforcement. Concurrently, these changes also trigger fundamental concerns about privacy violations and all-encompassing surveillance. Using the example of police investigations after the 2017 G20 summit in Hamburg, the present article provides insights into how different actors in the political and public realm in Germany deal with these potentials and tensions in handling visual data. Based on a qualitative content analysis of newspaper articles (n=42), tweets (n=267), experts’ reports (n=3), and minutes of parliamentary debates and committee hearings (n=8), this study examines how visual data were collected, analyzed, and published and how different actors legitimated and contested these practices. The findings show that combined state, corporate, and privately produced visual data and the use of facial recognition tools allowed the police to cover and track public life in large parts of the inner city of Hamburg during the summit days. Police authorities characterized visual data and algorithmic tools as objective, trustworthy, and indispensable evidence-providing tools but black-boxed the heterogeneity of sources, the analytical steps, and their potential implications. Critics, in turn, expressed concerns about infringements of civic rights, the trustworthiness of police authorities, and the extensive police surveillance capacities. Based on these findings, this article discusses three topics that remained blind spots in the debates but merit further attention in discussions on norms for visual data management and for governing visibility: (1) collective responsibilities in visibility management, (2) trust in visual data and facial recognition technologies, and (3) social consequences of encompassing visual data collection and registered faceprints.","",""

These three artworks deploy new technologies of machine vision and algorithmic face recognition in order to develop a critical account of surveillance. This article’s main hypothesis is that the critical potential of the three selected artworks stems from their ability to render visible a twofold tension that defines contemporary social formations. First, these works nurture a certain ambiguity between two modes of understanding the relation between images and power (representation and performativity), highlighting the difficulties in conceptualising and redefining new critical strategies for artists today. Second, this article highlights the tension between individualisation and personalisation as two parallel tendencies of contemporary power. In this context, the modern notion of political emancipation, grounded mainly on the figure of the individual subject, has to be called into question. The three selected artworks point out the intersection between two logics of power (discipline and governmentality), drawing attention to the limits of the notion of emancipation for a critique of algorithmic face recognition technologies.","",""

Instead, I argue that research should focus on both personal and interpersonal privacy management to ultimately understand teens’ privacy practices. Using a survey study ( n = 2000), I investigated the predictors of teens’ personal and interpersonal privacy management on social media and compared different types of boundary coordination. The results demonstrate that feelings of fatalism regarding individual control in a networked social environment, which I call networked defeatism, are positively related with interpersonal privacy management. Also, interpersonal privacy management is less important when coordinating boundaries with peers than it is when coordinating sexual materials, and dealing with personal information shared by parents.

A recent approach focuses on user resignation, apathy, or fatigue. In this piece, we concentrate on privacy cynicism, an attitude of uncertainty, powerlessness, mistrust, and resignation toward data handling by online services that renders privacy protection subjectively futile. We discuss privacy cynicism in the context of data capitalism, as a coping mechanism to address the tension between digital inclusion and a desire for privacy. Moreover, we introduce a measure for privacy cynicism and investigate the phenomenon based on a large-scale survey in Germany. The analysis highlights the multidimensionality of the construct, differentiating its relationships with privacy concerns, threat experience, Internet skills, and protection behavior. ","",""

The temporality of pre-emption attempts to project the past into a simulated future that can be acted upon in the present; a temporality of pure imminence. Yet, inherently paradoxical, pre-emption is marked by myriads of contrasts and frictions as it is caught between the supposedly all-encompassing knowledge of the data-processing ‘Machine’, and the daily reality of decision-making practices by relevant social actors. In this article, we explore the contrasting temporalities of automated data processing and predictive analytics, using policing as an illustrative example. Drawing on insights from two cases of predictive policing systems that have been implemented among UK police forces, we highlight the prevalence of counter-temporalities as predictive analytics is situated in institutional contexts and consider the conditions of possibility for agency and deliberation. Analysing these temporal tensions in relation to ‘slowness’ as a mode of resistance, the contextual examination of predictive policing advanced in the article provides a contribution to the formation of a deeper awareness of the politics of time in automated data processing; one that may serve to counter the imperative of pre-emption that, taken to the limit, seeks to foreclose the time for politics, action and life.

"2020","Tracking sex: The implications of widespread sexual data leakage and tracking on porn websites"," This article explores tracking and privacy risks on pornography websites. Our analysis of 22,484 pornography websites indicated that 93% leak user data to a third-party. Tracking on these sites is highly concentrated by a handful of major companies, which we identify. We successfully extracted privacy policies for 3856 sites, 17% of the total. The policies were written such that one might need a 2-year college education to understand them. Our content analysis of the sample’s domains indicated 44.97% of them expose or suggest a specific gender/sexual identity or interest likely to be linked to the user. We identify three core implications of the quantitative results: (1) the unique/elevated risks of porn data leakage versus other types of data, (2) the particular risks/impact for “vulnerable” populations, and (3) the complications of providing consent for porn site users and the need for affirmative consent in these online sexual interactions.

"2020","Infrastructural surveillance"," This article proposes a new model of privacy: infrastructural surveillance. It departs from Agre’s classic distinction between surveillance and capture by examining the sociotechnical claims of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) as requiring totalising surveillance of passengers and environment in order to operate. By doing so, it contributes to the ongoing debate on the commodification and platformisation of life, paying attention to the under-explored infrastructural requirements of certain digital technologies, rather than its business model. The article addresses four distinct characteristics of infrastructural surveillance: the aggregation of data, initialisation of protocols limiting possible actions, the prioritisation of distributed modes of governance and the enclosure of the driver in a personalised bubble of sovereign power. Ultimately, unlike previous modes of computer privacy in which activities are being constructed in real time from a set of institutionally standardised parts specified by a captured ontology, we observe the creation of new ontologies.

Using data from a unique search engine, DuckDuckGo, we show that chilling effects indeed exist. However, further analysis including the stock prices of the largest cybersecurity companies demonstrate a muted market response to the revelations, while cybersecurity spending data suggest resulting economic harm in the form of increased opportunity costs of buyers of cybersecurity services.

"2020","More Than Just Privacy: Using Contextual Integrity to Evaluate the Long-Term Risks from COVID-19 Surveillance Technologies"," The global coronavirus pandemic has raised important questions regarding how to balance public health concerns with privacy protections for individual citizens. In this essay, we evaluate contact tracing apps, which have been offered as a technological solution to minimize the spread of COVID-19. We argue that apps such as those built on Google and Apple’s “exposure notification system” should be evaluated in terms of the contextual integrity of information flows; in other words, the appropriateness of sharing health and location data will be contextually dependent on factors such as who will have access to data, as well as the transmission principles underlying data transfer. We also consider the role of prevailing social and political values in this assessment, including the large-scale social benefits that can be obtained through such information sharing. However, caution should be taken in violating contextual integrity, even in the case of a pandemic, because it risks a long-term loss of autonomy and growing function creep for surveillance and monitoring technologies.

The color-based code can determine people’s exposure risks and freedom of movement based on factors like travel history, duration of time spent in risky areas, and relationships to potential carriers. This essay discusses the rise of Health Code from a platform perspective, arguing that digital platforms are key players conducting health surveillance and mediating state–citizen relations in China. More importantly, tracing apps might become a normal practice in many countries, suggesting that platforms will be substantially adopted for health surveillance. ","",""
"2020","“Should I Stay or Should I Leave?”: Exploring (Dis)continued Facebook Use After the Cambridge Analytica Scandal"," Social media platforms bring both benefits and risks which have been documented copiously in extant academic literature. A range of issues related to privacy and trust inhibit the fulsome enjoyment of social media by users. In 2018, several news sources documented that Cambridge Analytica acquired psychographic data for Facebook users and used that data to target ads for the November 2016 US election. Although none of the news reports indicated that Facebook was complicit in this matter, some Facebook users publicly announced they would leave Facebook and encouraged others to do so. Using in-depth interviews with 10 undergraduate and graduate college students aged 18–29 years, this research study explores decisions to stay with or leave Facebook following the Cambridge Analytica case as such decisions intersect with privacy concerns. While all the respondents were concerned about their privacy, many of them believed that participation in social media requires an exchange of personal data for the use of the service. None of the respondents left Facebook permanently because of the Cambridge Analytica incident. But several reported non-use and reduced use prompted by privacy concerns and other social concerns associated with the use of Facebook. Although these research interviews are centered on a very specific event, they are instructive on the various approaches to privacy patterns and trust in social media. Greater transparency, advocacy, and transnational cooperation would be critical interventions to inspire greater trust in social media platforms. ","",""

Our analysis highlights privacy literacy as a potentially understudied dimension of the digital divide and unpacks how traditional markers of marginalization explain distinct dimensions of privacy-protecting behaviors.

"2020","Cybervetting and the Public Life of Social Media Data"," The article examines whether and how the ever-evolving practice of using social media to screen job applicants may undermine people’s trust in the organizations that are engaging in this practice. Using a survey of 429 participants, we assess whether their comfort level with cybervetting can be explained by the factors outlined by Petronio’s communication privacy management theory: culture, gender, motivation, and risk-benefit ratio. We find that respondents from India are significantly more comfortable with social media screening than those living in the United States. We did not find any gender-based differences in individuals’ comfort with social media screening, which suggests that there may be some consistent set of norms, expectations, or “privacy rules” that apply in the context of employment seeking—irrespective of gender. As a theoretical contribution, we apply the communication privacy management theory to analyze information that is publicly available, which offers a unique extension of the theory that focuses on private information. Importantly, the research suggests that privacy boundaries are not only important when it comes to private information, but also with information that is publicly available on social media. The research identifies that just because social media data are public, does not mean people do not have context-specific and data-specific expectations of privacy. ","",""
"2020","The Biopolitics of Social Distancing"," As COVID-19 spreads across the globe, new technologies are being leveraged to enforce social distancing requirements. I explore social distancing through the theoretical lens of Michel Foucault’s biopolitics, with an emphasis on recognizing unauthorized movement and controlling circulation. Although reporting and widely shared data visualizations about COVID-19 have made many people newly aware that their movements are being tracked and surveilled, governments are already implementing new measures such as geofencing and artificial intelligence (AI)–based facial recognition to facilitate the enforcement of social distancing. The tracking of COVID-19 spread and social distancing behaviors of the public has made more visible the practices of biopolitics but also generated new opportunities for even greater surveillance and control. The current moment offers an opportunity to shift public perceptions about data surveillance, technological control, and the racial disparities of biopower, much in the same way that public perceptions around social media shifted during and after the Arab Spring. How we collectively respond to these biopolitical processes will, in part, determine how such power relations are articulated in the future. ","",""

"2020","The Privacy Calculus of “Friending” Across Multiple Social Media Platforms"," Relationship building through social network sites (SNSs) requires privacy disclosure that involves a calculus of potential benefits against privacy risks. Tie formation (e.g., friending, following, or connecting) on SNSs is one of the most significant forms of privacy disclosure that not only communicate one’s willingness to disclose but can also reveal past activity history and invite future interactions. Based on the communication privacy management theory, the current study examines how users consider the privacy calculus and tie-formation affordances of the SNSs to manage ties across multiple SNSs. Using an online survey of 630 Facebook and/or Instagram users, the study revealed that individuals with higher privacy concerns strategically manage their privacy by connecting with different relationship ties through different SNSs as a way to construct sociotechnical boundaries between networks. The findings have implications for understanding privacy management online and provide a potential explanation for the privacy paradox. ","",""

This paper investigates these default effects among adolescents configuring apps that either satisfy relatedness or enhance autonomy by protecting privacy. Relatedness and privacy are two innate needs that adolescents can satisfy with the use of smartphone apps. This study argues that adolescents’ choice of features supporting either privacy protection or social relatedness is a consequence of default effects, so that adolescents adhere to preselected defaults. We test this assumption in an experimental survey design including four app configuration tasks with N = 280 German adolescents aged 11 to 20 years. The study finds support for default effects for privacy as well as social relatedness. Effects for further variables, particularly age are discussed. ","",""

A Comparative Study of Students at a Kenyan University and at a Large American Midwestern University","Guided by the communication privacy management theory (CPM), the overarching goal of this study was to examine the extent to which perceived privacy influences patient satisfaction among students at a Kenyan university and at a large Midwestern university. Data were collected using surveys with 349 Kenyan students and 420 U.S. students, recruited using convenience sampling. Privacy was measured using a multidimensional Likert privacy scale, while patient satisfaction was measured using a patient satisfaction scale. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, multiple linear regression, two-way MANOVA, and moderation analysis. The results revealed that all three types of privacy (psychological, physical, and informational) had a strong positive correlation with patient satisfaction. Perceived privacy predicted perceived patient satisfaction, and men and women did not have different concerns for privacy. Participant country moderated the relationship between privacy and patient satisfaction. These results suggest that physicians and hospitals should emphasize effective patient privacy in spaces where medical interactions occur.","",""

"2021","Programming the machine: gender, race, sexuality, AI, and the construction of credibility and deceit at the border","There is increasing recognition of the significance of the political, social, economic, and strategic effects of artificial intelligence (AI). This raises important ethical questions regarding the programming, use, and regulation of AI. This paper argues that both the programming and application of AI are inherently (cis)gendered, sexualised and racialised. AI is, after all, programmed by humans and the issue of who trains AI, teaches it to learn, and the ethics of doing so are therefore critical to avoiding the reproduction of (cis)gendered and racist stereotypes. The paper’s empirical focus is the EU-funded project iBorderCtrl, designed to manage security risks and enhance the speed of border crossings for third country nationals via the implementation of several AI-based technologies, including facial recognition and deception detection. By drawing together literature from 1) risk and security 2) AI and ethics/migration/asylum and 3) race, gender, (in)security, and AI, this paper explores the implications of lie detection for both regular border crossings and refugee protection with a conceptual focus on the intersections of gender, sexuality, and race. We argue here that AI border technologies such as iBorderCtrl pose a significant risk of both further marginalising and discriminating against LGBT persons, persons of colour, and asylum seekers and reinforcing existing non entree practices and policies.

Google and Apple are gatekeepers of these app ecosystems and exercise control on different layers, shaping the pandemic app response as well as the relationships between governments, citizens, and other actors. We suggest that this global ecosystem of pandemic responses reflects an exceptional mode of what we call ‘pandemic platform governance’, where platforms have negotiated their commercial interests and the public interest in exceptional circumstances. © 2021, Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society.

Based on empirical case studies from the Netherlands and Sweden, the present contribution outlines possible remedies that mitigate this problem, but the fundamental issue appears unsolvable.

Looking at newspaper and blog coverage surrounding two similar invasions of privacy – the NSA espionage programs that Edward Snowden brought to light alongside Verizon and other corporations’ use of a tracking code called a supercookie – we show key differences in the how media reactions to the topic are discursively constructed. Our findings show more moral polarization surrounding the characterization of the NSA and the perceived threat of their actions compared to media coverage on supercookies. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how neoliberal techniques of governance shift social perceptions of institutional actors and the potential harm they might produce in society.","",""

Through a critical analysis of the Ring surveillant assemblage, this paper reveals the way Ring and its associated apps produce fear and paranoia of the racialized Other, promote community buy-in that more surveillance will improve safety, while obscuring private partnerships with local law enforcement. I argue Ring cannot be viewed in isolation from its entangled corporate owner, Amazon, which relies on an ever-expanding infrastructural network, including surveillance of their highly prized package delivery service. Ring is more than individual community members installing doorbells with cameras that extend beyond their property into public space; it is the blurring of boundaries between police work and civilian surveillance, the reliance on obscured digital infrastructures that hide to whom and what users are connecting when they install a Ring device, and the expansion of Amazon’s vast infrastructural power. By recentering critique on the infrastructural backbone, made up of discourses and fixtures, this paper argues for the need for infrastructural accountability from companies such as Amazon, who not only profit from fear, but actively reproduce structural violence through their data infrastructures.","",""

We propose: (1) the popularity of a potentially privacy-violating technology leads individuals to expect that others approve of privacy violations and simultaneously increases their trust in the technology provider; (2) the frequency of privacy violations by other similar providers leads individuals to expect that a specific provider will engage in privacy-violating behaviors and decreases trust in that provider; (3) trust in a specific provider and expectations that others approve of the provider violating users’ privacy increase, and expectations that other similar providers are likely to violate privacy decrease, willingness to use a technology. We test our propositions using two vignette experiments in the context of a household energy app. Our results are generally consistent with our hypotheses. Our findings have implications for understanding privacy norms and highlight the potential consequences of major technology roll-outs.","",""

This article identifies the available research on how children understand, value and negotiate their personal data and privacy online. The results are interpreted according to a framework that distinguishes different privacy contexts (interpersonal, institutional and commercial) and data types (given, traces and inferred). Our systematic evidence mapping of research published by multiple disciplines in the English language from 2007 to 2019 reveals substantial gaps in current knowledge. First, even though children now use the internet from infancy onwards, very few studies include younger children, impeding regulatory or educational policy and practice tailored to socio-developmental differences among children. Second, the majority of research concerns privacy in interpersonal contexts, with less attention paid to commercial or institutional contexts. Relatedly, most research conceives of data that is deliberately and knowingly provided, with fewer studies recognising that data traces and inferred (or metadata) also matter for children’s privacy. Finally, most empirical studies concern children’s behaviours and practices but much less common are studies of children’s media literacy, especially relating to their capacity to consent to data protection practices. Notwithstanding rising concern over the datafication of childhood, few researchers have investigated the possible harms associated with infringements of children’s privacy online, or the value of any social support children receive. We conclude by calling for a more comprehensive and policy-relevant approach to researching children’s practices and understanding of their online data and the privacy implications of engaging in today’s increasingly commercial digital environment.","",""

Contemporary surveillance and its normalisation hinge on us actively engaging with, negotiating and sometimes initiating an array of monitoring practices [Lyon (2018). The culture of surveillance: Watching as a way of life. Cambridge: Polity Press.]. In this context, this article examines young people’s understandings and deployment of social media profile checking – that is the practices of covertly looking at someone’s profiles on social media platforms to gather and/or corroborate information about this person. Drawing upon in-depth interviews with young people, the article explores how social media profile checking has become taken for granted, not only encouraging surveillance practices as part of social media interactivity but also producing specific understandings of social screening. Combining insights from Foucault and Bourdieu’s works, the article argues that the normalisation of profile checking needs to be understood as a specific type of practical knowledge of the social world which is embedded in broader neoliberal governmentalities and legitimises a greater social sorting of interpersonal sociality.","",""

We base our analysis on two sets of in-depth face-to-face interviews we conducted with young adults in Israel—26 before the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which we had already conducted for a study on privacy, and 24 after the scandal erupted. To analyze our respondent’s rationales, we employ Boltanski and Thévenot’s regimes of justification framework. Before the scandal, our respondents largely saw privacy as a commodity, a tradeoff made by the individual—information disclosure in exchange for free personalized digital services. However, there were some respondents who rejected the notion of privacy as a commodity and advanced an alternative perspective that considers it to be a human right. After the Cambridge Analytica scandal, there was a marked shift away from understanding of privacy as a right, which our respondents neither saw an unconditional right nor something enforceable by regulators. Instead, they largely saw economic surveillance as something inherent to the digital world, which one needs to accept if one wants to participate in it.","",""

In this market-oriented analysis, I introduce the metaphor of elasticity to capture the responsiveness of demand for social media to the data (price) charged by social media companies. Overall, this article positions social media as inelastic, relative to privacy costs; highlights the role of the social collective in the privacy crises; and ultimately underscores the need for structural interventions in addressing privacy risks.

"2021","Kind of Blue","This paper considers emotion recognition and sentiment analysis in relation to social media photographs. It addresses this as part of a larger regime of surveillance and control, in which photographs are treated as symptoms for a diagnosis, and are quantified as data. Automated emotion recognition approaches are capable in principle of analysing the visual qualities of social photos insofar as these can be measured and represented numerically. In reducing the photograph to data, they select out features of the image, as a means to explain or describe a mental state that lies behind or beyond the image. To treat photographs as emotionally expressive goes against the historical idea of the photograph as objective recording. Originally, the idea that photographs could move their viewers was linked to the sense of photography as detached documentation. Today, more and more people take and share photographs as part of a larger shift in emotional culture, which places a therapeutic sense of self at the heart of economy and governance. Yet while people use mobile phone photos as a means of expressive documentation and self-representation, emotion recognition relies on a behaviourist and positivist model that is indifferent to their intentions and to culture, and which is premised on a myth of total knowledge.","",""

They are associated with self-disclosure behavior, enjoyment, and, perhaps most importantly, a user’s intention and ability to form and sustain social ties on SNSs. While conceptual integration of different approaches to studying IPCs has already been pursued, prior research has pointed to potential problems with respect to the survey measurements of IPCs. More specifically, a plethora of self-assessment scales have been developed but the differences among them have not yet been systematically elaborated, and this is further complicated by many methodologically questionable adaptations of existing IPC survey scales to ever-emerging online contexts and SNS platforms. Accordingly, this study comprises a systematic literature review based on the COSMIN methodology to comprehensively examine the quality of survey scales used for measuring IPCs among SNS users. The results have unveiled significant variety with 35 uni- or multidimensional survey scales used in 71 articles published since 2009. Many of the scales are of questionable quality in terms of structural validity, and only a few of the studies tested them for measurement invariance. Nevertheless, we identified some scales that are promising candidates for future use, although further testing and potential improvements are needed. Our findings could also act as the foundation for a unified measurement approach to IPCs that could be used across different SNSs platforms.","",""

Surveillance in journalism has been depicted under an Orwellian aura that implies an inner negativity and malignity. Given the worrisome number of published on the mounting dangers and threats that journalism faces, especially in the digital realm, this scary depiction of surveillance is still dramatically true.

In the light of the challenges brought arising from the surveillance cultures, do journalists need to review their ethical guidelines for the use of surveillance technology?

Should a debate within their community be stimulated through a bottom-up approach, and foster a new professional culture more aware of the opportunities, dangers and responsibilities connected to such technology?

In 2017, Idaho became the first state to implement a         statewide tracking platform. The Idaho Sexual Assault Kit Tracking System (IKTS) allows the         public to track kits from distribution to collection, and testing at law enforcement         facilities. The emergence of tracking platforms raises questions about what governance         paradigms, data relations, and discourses these systems enable. I find concerns about         """"timeliness"""" and the temporal life of forensic evidence structured the creation, deployment,         and maintenance of IKTS. I argue timeliness is a data governance paradigm with multiple and         shifting meanings of temporality that comprise various legal, social, and data         relationships. I show how the discourse of tardy, slow, and untimely forensic evidence is a         mechanism to codify consistent statewide forensic practice and centralize legal         decision-making. The legislature's treatment of SAK disorganization as a problem of         unmanaged """"temporality"""" assumes a view of evidence processing as merely and neutrally         unmechanized. On one hand, this treatment obscures how racialized rape myths shape police         decision-making; on the other, IKTS protocols offer some intervention. I argue this should         not be read as signs of a racial justice technofix, but as indications of the limits and         possibilities of a """"technolegal"""" response to violence.","",""

Interviews were conducted with individuals whose profiles appeared on the         platform (N=37) to reveal users’ reactions and rationalizations of the data collected about         them.

Ultimately, these contribute to feelings of         resignation often paired with the unrealistic alternative of total platform non-use. We         argue that these complex discourses of self-blame, independence/choice, and         resignation/non-use as the only options are intertwined with data privacy reform efforts.         Understanding the sources of self-blame and how deep it runs is an important step to         interrogating and refuting some of these assumptions, if broader reforms hope to garner         support and implementation.","",""
"2021","FROM WATCHED AT WORK TO WATCHED AT HOME: WORKPLACE SURVEILLANCE DURING A         PANDEMIC","The COVID-19 pandemic has created new opportunities and new tensions         related to workplace surveillance. Monitoring workers via digital tools to analyze         everything from keystrokes to email and social media to the websites they visit is         increasingly common, and the shift to remote work in the early days of the pandemic led many         employers to consider new ways to monitor their employees while working from home. In this         paper, we consider how the pandemic has affected office workers’ experience of surveillance,         focusing on the types of monitoring they currently experience and their concerns related to         future forms of surveillance. In particular, we unpack the sociotechnical implications of         shifting work surveillance practices due to COVID-19, focusing on how evolving and emergent         workplace surveillance practices may impact workers. Using factorial vignettes, survey         respondents (N=645) read and responded to 35 scenarios about future workplace surveillance         practices. Each scenario randomly varied four factors about workplace monitoring: the type         of data being collected, the purpose for data collection, the actors who can access the         data, and the transmission principle guiding data collection. For each scenario, respondents         assessed both the appropriateness of each scenario and how concerning they found it. We         evaluate this data, as well as data about respondents’ work environment before and during         the pandemic, using Nissenbaum’s framework of privacy as contextual integrity. We also         consider the potential harms associated with different types of monitoring.","",""

Crucially,         governments are leveraging the power of platforms to impose new forms of restrictions on         free expression, and engage in surveillance of individuals and online activism. This has         profound implications for the rights to freedom of expression, privacy, and data protection.         Further, platforms that once refused to cooperate with governments in identifying users         responsible for disseminating allegedly illegal or harmful content are now expanding         cooperation with authorities, including sharing data about users flagged by law enforcement         and other authorities. As civil society organisations warn, this trend is contributing to         ‘invasive and unlawful digital surveillance’ (Amnesty International, 2019, p. 24). This         paper examines how European governments are leveraging the power of digital platforms to         engage in government surveillance online, and assesses the compatibility of these measures         with European human rights law. The paper applies a unique interdisciplinary perspective,         bringing together law, political communication and surveillance studies. First, the paper         examines how platforms’ algorithmic systems shape (and limit) information dissemination. The         paper then critically analyses government-platform initiatives that exist to surveil         citizens and gather information, including new measures under the EU’s proposed Digital         Services Act. Third, it assesses how these measures comply with freedom of expression and         the right to privacy, and concludes with recommendations on remedying problematic elements         of the role platforms play in digitisation of government surveillance.","",""

As the biometrics industry increasingly moves towards a ‘Video         Surveillance as a Service’ (VSaaS) model, the study of facial recognition infrastructures is         becoming a crucial aspect of the interrogation of the Internet of Things. We demonstrate         that the facial recognition industry is acutely aware of critiques of facial recognition         cameras and biometric technologies as enabling social harms related to intrusiveness and         bias (see Stark, 2019), and that members of the industry are keen to promote a more         prosocial public image of the technology. Towards this end we find that biometric monitoring         of children has gained a prominent place in the promotion of facial recognition technologies         as a mode of ‘careful’ surveillance. We identify three key ‘use cases’ in which the face of         the child takes on a prominent role as justifying and legitimating the use of facial         recognition technologies – in the auditing of humanitarian food supply programs, in the         detection of so-called ‘staging’ of family units at the US border, and in the detection of         underage gambling in Australia. We argue that the immanent ‘ethical’ framing of the child’s         face in this context serves to obscure the political ramifications of the extension of         facial recognition and of biometric surveillance tools more broadly.","",""

It is part of a book I am         writing on perceptions of privacy and surveillance in China and is grounded in an inductive         content analysis of 58 semi-structured in-depth interviews I conducted late 2019 in Beijing,         Shanghai, and Chengdu. Privacy is written with two different words in Mandarin: $2 (a         personal thing you do not wish to disclose in public akin to Western definitions) and $2         (hiding a shameful secret). Most of my interviewees used the latter meaning: $2 . Privacy,         thus, was $2 , understood as $2 (moral face - e.g., purchases of personal medicine,         underwear and sex-related products, or weapons) and $2 (social face - eg., financial         information). Moreover, they perceived the need to hide shameful information $2 : parents         and supervisors, or hackers who would disclose personal information, but less so an abstract         entity such as the government. For instance, several interviewees felt they could “hide on         Weibo” using a pseudonym, despite the real-name registration policy. These findings on         privacy may shed slight on how Chinese citizens view the digitalization of surveillance         through facial recognition monitoring and the building of the social credit system, and         contribute to culture-sensitive surveillance research.","",""

In Hong Kong's context, the paradox involves declining trust of the government's protection of data privacy and growing concern about data surveillance since the 2019 social unrest I argue that exploring the idea of sociality is valuable in that it re-reconfigures the datafication of pandemic control by revealing different sets of social relations, particularly the asymmetrical power relation between the government and its people.

The how and why of potential surveillance are thus wrapped in a form of continuously produced uncertainty. How then, do affected groups and individuals determine how to counter the threats and harms of surveillance? Responding to an interdisciplinary concern with agency amidst datafication, this article explores what I term ‘anticipatory data practices’ – future-oriented practices which provide a concrete anchor and a heuristic for action amidst the persistent uncertainties of life with data. This article traces how anticipatory data practices have emerged within civil society practices concerned with countering the harms of surveillance and data exploitation. The mixed-method empirical analysis of this article draws from 50 interviews with digital security educators and technology developers; participant observation at 12 civil society events between 2016 and 2019 and the textual analysis of 100 security manuals produced by NGOs and grassroots groups.

Often advanced on the premise of efficiency and accuracy, they have also been the subject of significant controversy. Much attention has focussed on longer-standing biometric data collection, such as finger-printing and facial recognition, foregrounding concerns with the impact such technologies can have on the nature of policing and fundamental human rights. Less researched is the growing use of voice recognition in law enforcement. This paper examines the case of the recent Speaker Identification Integrated Project, a European wide initiative to create the first international and interoperable database of voice biometrics, now the third largest biometric database at Interpol. Drawing on Freedom of Information requests, interviews and public documentation, we outline the emergence and features of SiiP and explore how voice is recognised and attributed meaning. We understand Speaker Identification Integrated Project as constituting a particular ‘regime of recognition’ premised on the use of soft biometrics (age, language, accent and gender) to disembed voice in order to optimise for difference. This, in turn, has implications for the nature and scope of law enforcement, people's position in society, and justice concerns more broadly. ","",""
"2021","Making sense of algorithms: Relational perception of contact tracing and risk assessment during COVID-19"," Governments and citizens of nearly every nation have been compelled to respond to COVID-19. Many measures have been adopted, including contact tracing and risk assessment algorithms, whereby citizen whereabouts are monitored to trace contact with other infectious individuals in order to generate a risk status via algorithmic evaluation. Based on 38 in-depth interviews, we investigate how people make sense of Health Code ( jiankangma), the Chinese contact tracing and risk assessment algorithmic sociotechnical assemblage. We probe how people accept or resist Health Code by examining their ongoing, dynamic, and relational interactions with it. Participants display a rich variety of attitudes toward privacy and surveillance, ranging from fatalism to the possibility of privacy to trade-offs for surveillance in exchange for public health, which is mediated by the perceived effectiveness of Health Code and changing views on the intentions of institutions who deploy it. We show how perceived competency varies not just on how well the technology works, but on the social and cultural enforcement of various non-technical aspects like quarantine, citizen data inputs, and cell reception. Furthermore, we illustrate how perceptions of Health Code are nested in people’s broader interpretations of disease control at the national and global level, and unexpectedly strengthen the Chinese authority’s legitimacy. None of the Chinese public, Health Code, or people’s perceptions toward Health Code are predetermined, fixed, or categorically consistent, but are co-constitutive and dynamic over time. We conclude with a theorization of a relational perception and methodological reflections to study algorithmic sociotechnical assemblages beyond COVID-19. ","",""
"2021","Auto-essentialization: Gender in automated facial analysis as extended colonial project"," Scholars are increasingly concerned about social biases in facial analysis systems, particularly with regard to the tangible consequences of misidentification of marginalized groups. However, few have examined how automated facial analysis technologies intersect with the historical genealogy of racialized gender—the gender binary and its classification as a highly racialized tool of colonial power and control. In this paper, we introduce the concept of auto-essentialization: the use of automated technologies to re-inscribe the essential notions of difference that were established under colonial rule. We consider how the face has emerged as a legitimate site of gender classification, despite being historically tied to projects of racial domination. We examine the history of gendering the face and body, from colonial projects aimed at disciplining bodies which do not fit within the European gender binary, to sexology's role in normalizing that binary, to physiognomic practices that ascribed notions of inferiority to non-European groups and women. We argue that the contemporary auto-essentialization of gender via the face is both racialized and trans-exclusive: it asserts a fixed gender binary and it elevates the white face as the ultimate model of gender difference. We demonstrate that imperialist ideologies are reflected in modern automated facial analysis tools in computer vision through two case studies: (1) commercial gender classification and (2) the security of both small-scale (women-only online platforms) and large-scale (national borders) spaces. Thus, we posit a rethinking of ethical attention to these systems: not as immature and novel, but as mature instantiations of much older technologies. ","",""

However, we still know too little about the performance of computational methods in the context of predictive policing. The paper provides a detailed analysis of existing approaches to algorithmic crime forecasting. First, it is explained how predictive policing makes use of predictive models to generate crime forecasts. Afterwards, three epistemologies of predictive policing are distinguished: mathematical social science, social physics and machine learning. Finally, it is shown that these epistemologies have significant implications for the constitution of predictive knowledge in terms of its genesis, scope, intelligibility and accessibility. It is the different ways future crimes are rendered knowledgeable in order to act upon them that reaffirm or reconfigure the status of criminological knowledge within the criminal justice system, direct the attention of law enforcement agencies to particular types of crimes and criminals and blank out others, satisfy the claim for the meaningfulness of predictions or break with it and allow professionals to understand the algorithmic systems they shall rely on or turn them into a black box. By distinguishing epistemologies and analysing their implications, this analysis provides insight into the techno-scientific foundations of predictive policing and enables us to critically engage with the socio-technical practices of algorithmic crime forecasting.

"2021","The datafication revolution in  criminal justice: An empirical  exploration of frames portraying  data-driven technologies for crime prevention and control"," The proliferation of big data analytics in criminal justice suggests that there are positive frames and imaginaries legitimising them and depicting them as the panacea for efficient crime control. Criminological and criminal justice scholarship has paid insufficient attention to these frames and their accompanying narratives. To address the gap created by the lack of theoretical and empirical insight in this area, this article draws on a study that systematically reviewed and compared multidisciplinary academic abstracts on the data-driven tools now shaping decision-making across several justice systems. Using insights distilled from the study, the article proposes three frames (optimistic, neutral, oppositional) for understanding how the technologies are portrayed. Inherent in the frames are a set of narratives emphasising their ostensible status as vital crime control mechanisms. These narratives obfuscate the harms of data-driven technologies and evince idealistic imaginaries of their capabilities. The narratives are bolstered by unequal structural arrangements, specifically the unevenly distributed digital capital with which some are empowered to participate in technology development for criminal justice application and other forms of penal governance. In unravelling these issues, the article advances current understanding of the dynamics that sustain the depiction of data-driven technologies as prime crime prevention and law enforcement tools.

Through a computational topic modelling-based mixed methods analysis of the submissions made to the draft Investigatory Powers Bill consultation, the article demonstrates the diversity and intersection of discourses within different actor groups, including civil society and the technology industry. We demonstrate that encryption is a key issue for these groups, and is additionally conflated with a human rights discourse.

The focus is on the North Avenue Smart Corridor, located in Atlanta, Georgia, which is one of the world's top ten most surveilled cities. Through the design of these speculative maps, I question our relationship with surveillance. More specifically, I show that unnoticeable materiality and invisible processes of smart surveillance technologies prevent the public from forming an opinion on their intrusion into daily life. Acceptance of these technologies allows powerholders to protect and enhance their power over marginalized communities. Therefore, by mapping the intensity of surveillance, this study aims to raise awareness against the lure of technocracy in so-called smart cities. It situates the reader in the position of surveillance sensors and allows the reader to speculate on what they can see. In doing so, it seeks to highlight the oppressive agency of these technologies and question their appeal to objectivity with the potential to disrupt their patriarchal powers.

The artwork recreates a modern Western home pervaded by surveillance technologies and the automated vision of a robotic vacuum cleaner. The main conceptual idea of the work is the automated gaze , and with few exceptions, all the scenes in the video are filmed without a human behind the camera. As a result, the installation evokes the haunted atmosphere of a home penetrated by a gaze that drifts incessantly, opening up randomly strange and awkward vantage points of the interior. Specifically, the article offers a reading of Modern Escape in the light of Avery Gordon’s notion of “haunting” and argues that the modern Western home is saturated with traces of the military industrial complex through its commonplace technologies, which are haunted by a history of war, complicity, and masculine desires for control. Haunting, according to Gordon, is one way in which “abusive systems of power make themselves known and their impacts felt in everyday life” ( Ghostly Matters xvi). The present article discusses how Modern Escape responds to and questions the subtle militarization of the everyday the technologies carry into the estranged home, “that quintessential space of the uncanny, the haunted house” (Gordon, Ghostly Matters 50).","",""

While supporters of the technologies contend that they help in identifying threats by linking specific bodies to hard evidence, we argue that the indexical relations they exhibit are best described as experimental, pointing to specific situational constellations within which they were initially created. By revisiting key moments in the development of (semi-)automated facial recognition technologies from the late 1960s to the present, we identify varying situational assemblages of facial recognition that depend on different understandings of indexicality. These experimental indices rely on historical dynamics, including significant government interest in the development of facial recognition technology, expansion in the scale of experimental settings, and dissolution of the formerly strict boundaries between the social spheres of private image-sharing, commercial image distribution, and institutional image forensics for identification. In coupling experimental indices with the development of facial recognition technologies, we hope to show a way forward to comparing the histories of other evidential technical images too.","",""
"2021","Transparency and Sovereignty in Contact-tracing Networks","Threaded through Jean Baudrillard’s writings on society, politics, and technology is the notion of transparency. Transparency features in several works critiquing the digital era: by rendering everything overexposed and proximate, media technology has facilitated a frictionless or, using Baudrillard’s term, ecstatic flow of information. As transparency aligns itself semantically with frictionlessness and ecstasy, the question concerning the preconditions of transparency becomes pertinent. By advancing a reading of Singapore’s TraceTogether application, this article proposes that embedded within Baudrillard’s notion of transparency is the paradigm of friction: sovereignty. The TraceTogether team purports a non-invasive and privacy-preserving contact-tracing protocol. Circumventing the use of geo-location tracking, TraceTogether formulates a network of infected bodies based on proximity data by using Bluetooth Relative Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) readings between devices with the application installed. The reduction of all markers of identification and differentiation—or, points of friction—into the same frictionless code belies an imperative invocation of sovereignty. Drawing on a range of thought that obliquely confronts the question of sovereignty and friction, this article frames the inquiry within the parameters of Jean Baudrillard and other theorists whose deliberations on infrastructure like architecture and networks are wrought upon the concept of transparency. The sovereign power to suspend or collapse the friction/frictionless binary calls into question the right to retain one’s friction in this frictionless digital era. This article proposes a critical reading of topological transparency with a view to the political and bio-philosophical implications of what is at stake in proximity-tracing technologies.","",""

As new data collection technologies expand into law enforcement spaces previously dominated by interpersonal interactions, questions emerge about whether the public will evaluate interpersonal and technologically mediated interactions with legal authorities in the same ways. In an analysis guided by procedural justice theory, we examine whether and how legal authorities’ use of decision-making technology affects public evaluations of an authority-subordinate interaction and its outcome in the context of airport border crossings. Using an experimental vignette design (N = 278), we varied whether an encounter between a traveller and border security “agent” that produced a secondary search was described as interpersonal (conducted by a human agent) or technologically mediated (conducted by a machine agent). We also varied the traveller’s group membership relative to the nation-state, describing the traveller as either born in the country in question and a member of the nation’s most common racial group (in-group) or not born in the country and a racial minority (out-group). Both encounter type and group membership independently affected perceptions of the interaction (procedural justice judgements) and its outcome (distributive justice judgments). Technologically mediated encounters improved perceptions of procedural and distributive justice. Further, procedural justice judgments mediated the relationship between encounter type and distributive justice, demonstrating how perceptions of interactions influence perceptions of the outcomes of those interactions. Out-group members were evaluated as having worse experiences across all measures. The findings underscore the importance of extending tests of procedural justice theory beyond interpersonal interactions to technologically mediated interactions.","",""

Looking back at one of the most influential artworks of the last decade, I understand How Not to be Seen as a discursive practice using images that poses an ambivalent surveillance critique through media- and wordplay. I first outline the historical references of Steyerl’s critique of technology, including Heidegger’s (1938) “image as world picture,” and position her in relation to other relevant surveillance-resistant practices. Drawing on analytical theory by Rancière (2006), I argue that the video is an example of a documentary fiction that organizes heterogenous visual, semiotic, and sensory material horizontally. From here, I move on to analyze the artwork focusing on how in both its content and form it engages humorously in discussions of (in)visibility, targeting, resolution, and data extraction. Using discourses on Steyerl’s work from herself and others, I show how the .MOV file, in playing with representational media, subverts categories used for surveillant targeting and data extraction. Hence, I argue that Steyerl ultimately advocates for resistance through ambivalence as a playful counter-visuality in the face of ubiquitous surveillance. In an era of intelligent imagery, this implicates using the image as an object that is part of the medium and not as subject representation.","",""

The case of a secretive state agency being authorized to do surveillance on its citizens for a strictly non-security-related matter seems to realize many of the dangers that surveillance/privacy scholars warn about with regards to surveillance expansion, function creep, and the creation of a surveillance state. I contribute to existing literature about apathy towards surveillance and the privacy paradox by offering the term “nontargets” as an explanation. This term suggests that, alongside social groups that are likely to be targeted by a given surveillance application, there are certain recognizable nontargets that most likely will not bear the brunt of the surveillance, at least not in the short- and medium-term, and thus do not fear it. In the case at hand, which is examined using a qualitative context-bound study, I suggest that Jewish-Israelis are such a nontarget group with regards to this novel Shin Bet surveillance, which explains a significant part of their apathy towards it.","",""

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the surveillance practices of non-Western countries have often been analyzed from the perspective of the West, impacting domestic surveillance policymaking and public perception. However, we rarely know how Western societies’ surveillance practices and discourses may impact how people in non-Western societies understand their own domestic surveillance. Combining data from varied sources, this article examines domestic surveillance during COVID-19 in China and explores how Chinese residents perceive it, with a focus on perceptions that are in relation to the West.","",""

This system was said to enable new forms of predictive capabilities to emerge: the algorithm would be able to, for example, predict the route drivers wanted to take but had not yet taken—including, for example, their occult inner desires for getting away with a secret lover. A panel of academic reviewers from three different universities audited and reviewed the proposed system. All that is left are segments of the video-report resulting from this meeting, which became an urban legend among technology researchers. The short film “Future Movement Future – REJECTED” is the story of a dystopian surveillance future that was barred by institutional refusal.

The COVID-19 pandemic, anti-science policies, radicalized white supremacists, police killings of people of color, and the resurgence of the racial justice movement all inflect surveillance practices in the contemporary moment. In particular, today’s polarized political landscape makes it difficult to condemn surveillance in the service of the public good, but irrespective of one’s goals or intentions, the embrace of transparency carries its own risks. Transparency, and scientific vision more broadly, is an extension of the Enlightenment and subsequent scientific revolution, which from the start sought to advance knowledge and consolidate white power through the violent subjugation of nature, women, and racial minorities. One fundamental risk of valorizing transparency is that doing so occludes the ways that relations of domination are indelibly encoded into surveillance systems and practices. Given this, I argue that the project of decolonizing surveillance inquiry should now be our primary focus as a field.","",""

We build from research that focuses on overlaps between surveillance and emergency response to demonstrate how large-scale data mining practices—in particular, location extraction—are repurposed as beneficial, if not life-saving, measures. In focusing on the capacity to extract and analyze location in the name of public good, we discursively analyze how RapidDeploy’s official company blog constructs the benevolence of data collection. We then demonstrate how these viewpoints are reproduced in the news reports in one city—Charleston, South Carolina—where RapidDeploy has formally partnered with emergency response services. This analysis is used to demonstrate how words like “data” and “cloud” continue to be used as vague buzzwords for companies situated at the intersections of surveillance and civic function, and to argue for greater attention to how the trend towards platformization continues to blur the relationships between surveillance and emergency response systems. This case study examines the public face of this company and, as such, analyzes the language used to gain public assent for the software and its function.","",""

The theoretical argument advanced in the text is that data protection in a post-communist context bears a specific historical significance due to the recent experiences with the extensive, coercive state surveillance that was systematized under the communist regimes. The article focuses on the institutional role conceptions of data protection authorities—a theoretical concept that denotes perceptions of the role of an organization within the larger institutional environment. High-level officials from data protection authorities in sixteen countries were interviewed about change and continuity in surveillance. The results show that historical reflectivity is not a dominant feature of the leadership of contemporary data protection authorities and that different countries differ considerably.

In this paper, we demonstrate the constitutive effects of censorship that seep into the collective mentality and, in Foucauldian terms, “conducts the conduct.” We examine the wider socio-political impact of China’s censorship of COVID-19. We argue that censorship is a force “at large.” By this we refer to the pervasive uptake of censorship practices at different levels and how censorship manifests itself as a form of power unchained, making it difficult, if not impossible, to track and contain its impact, even for the authorities. We argue that censorship surveils the expressed and, by extension, regulates the not-yet-expressed. It surveils what can be perceived and, by extension, pre-conditions the not-yet-conceived. We highlight the domestic impact of how China’s censorship regime bends its population into acquiescing to a harmonious denial of its collective prospects and how it curtails the global response.","",""

Democratic Oversight of Algorithmic Police Surveillance in Belgium","In the last decade and more recently triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, algorithmic surveillance technologies have been increasingly implemented and experimented with by the police for crime control, public order policing, and as management tools. Police departments are also increasingly consumers of surveillance technologies that are created, sold, and controlled by private companies. They exercise an undue influence over police today in ways that are not widely acknowledged and increasingly play a role in the data capture and processing that feeds into larger cloud infrastructures and data markets. These developments are having profound effects on how policing is organized and on existing power relations, whereby decisions are increasingly being made by algorithms. Although attention is paid to algorithmic police surveillance in academic research as well as in mainstream media, critical discussions about its democratic oversight are rare. The goal of this paper is to contribute to ongoing research on police and surveillance oversight and to question how current judicial oversight of algorithmic police surveillance in Belgium addresses socio-technical harms of these surveillance practices.","",""

Although prevention and anticipation are already embedded in the apparatuses of government, going beyond a mere abstract aspiration, the latest innovations hold out the promise of replacing police officers’ “gut feelings” and discretionary risk assessments with algorithmic-powered, quantified analyses of risk scores. While police departments and private companies praise such innovations for their cost-effective rationale, critics raise concerns regarding their potential for discriminating against poor, black, and migrant communities. In this article, I address such controversies by telling the story of the making of CrimeRadar, an app developed by a Rio de Janeiro-based think tank in partnership with private associates and local police authorities. Drawing mostly on Latour’s contributions to the emerging literature on security assemblages, I argue that we gain explanatory and critical leverage by looking into the mundane practices of making and unmaking sociotechnical arrangements. That is, I address the chain of translations through which crime data are collected, organized, and transformed into risk scores. In every step, new ways of seeing and presenting crime are produced, with a significant impact on how we experience and act upon (in)security.","",""

Whilst this literature unpicks important factors and trends, we argue that a focus on surveillance capitalism as a sole driver risks ignoring the more intricate realities of surveillance assemblages. They are often propelled by many different desires and power relations (Haggerty and Ericson 2000). We argue for a more nuanced analysis of the drivers instead, taking into account practices in other countries beyond the United States and the United Kingdom. We argue that much of the existent research skews the picture due to inherent bias, and seldom observed drivers are revealed when smart city developments in different countries such as Belgium and Brazil are considered. We suggest that what we call “surveillance theatre,” the performative uses of surveillance that characterize security discourses, is an overlooked yet important driver of smart city development. Such a driver is particularly evident when it comes to security discourses.","",""
"2021","Financialization and Welfare Surveillance: Regulating the Poor in Technological Times","In light of concerns that the technologies employed by the digital welfare state exacerbate inequality and oppression, this article considers contemporary shifts in the administration of social assistance. Specifically, it examines the surveillance of recipients of government income support focusing on marginalized peoples in two jurisdictions: social security recipients subject to the Cashless Debit Card (CDC) in Australia, many of whom are Indigenous, and persons under the purview of the Lebanon One Unified Inter-Organizational System for E-Cards (LOUISE) in Lebanon, many of whom are Syrian refugees. Taken together, the cases illuminate embedded ideologies and adverse experiences associated with the financialization of social assistance and the digitization of cash. Through a dual case study approach, this analysis draws out patterns as well as contextual distinctions to illustrate how technological changes reflect financialization trends and attempt neoliberal assimilation of social welfare recipients through intensive surveillance, albeit with disparate outcomes. After considering how these dynamics play out in each case, the article concludes by reflecting on the contradictions that emerge in relation to the promises of empowerment and individual responsibility through financialized logics and technologies.","",""
"2021","Authoritarian Surveillance: A Corona Test","As the world seemed undecided in praising China’s crisis management through what was formerly called networked authoritarianism (MacKinnon 2011), countries such as Iran showed no interest in extending its notorious political surveillance practices into the public health arena. Consequently, this paper asks if the umbrella term “authoritarian surveillance” used by many Western and non-Western scholars (including myself) can do justice to the practices witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic in countries such as Iran? Could any act of arbitrary or oppressive surveillance be categorised as authoritarian surveillance? Does authoritarian surveillance necessarily correspond to an authoritarian state form? This paper summarily reviews the political theories of authoritarianism and the current discussions on authoritarian surveillance. By scrutinising Iran’s inability to apply its political surveillance tools during a public health crisis, the paper argues for an analytical integration of other socio-political concepts, such as state legitimacy, and economic potentialities, such as infrastructural capacities, into discussions of authoritarian surveillance. Consequently, the paper proposes a situated understanding of authoritarian surveillance contextualised within social, political, economic, and historical interrelations.","",""
"2021","Speculative Fiction, Sociology, and Surveillance Studies: Towards a Methodology of the Surveillance Imaginary","Utopian theorists often speak about the merits of reading utopian fiction in order to reimagine and rebuild a better world, but dystopian fiction is often overlooked. This is, in my view, misguided because dystopian fiction, like utopian fiction, diagnoses issues with the present, inspires activism and resistance, and, in the twenty-first century, often presents ideas of how to effect positive change through collective activism. As speculative literary genres concerned with world-building, utopian and dystopian fiction have inherent sociological concerns. These texts can therefore be utilised by sociologists and other researchers beyond the arts and humanities. Speculative fiction is important to the field of surveillance studies not only because surveillance is a major theme in these literary texts but also because their formal properties provide us with the language, imagery, and feelings associated with being under surveillance. Twenty-first-century utopian and dystopian fiction has not been thoroughly examined by surveillance scholars. Analysis of utopian and dystopian fiction in this field has also focused on texts set in, and written by authors from, the global north. Considering the plethora of dystopian novels in and beyond the global north published in recent years that discuss surveillance, the neglect of the study of these texts to date is an oversight.","",""

We explore and evaluate the usability of blockchain based decentralized apps in crowd management and contact tracing for the Tokyo Olympics using value-focused thinking (VFT). A VFT framework aids in narrowing fundamental and strategic objectives that need to be addressed for smooth contact tracing and crowd management by understanding stakeholder viewpoints. We established an equivalence of the objectives identified through VFT with blockchain technology properties. Further, we also present a conceptual ideation of contact tracing and crowd management through blockchain based decentralized apps for the Tokyo Olympics. This work could potentially assist decision-makers, researchers and stakeholders involved in organizing the Tokyo Olympics in understanding and analysing the utility of blockchain based decentralized apps for crowd management and contact tracing.","",""

The incorporation of social media was a watershed moment for this process as social media, and even information from the entire Internet, had not been allowed into the investigation process before. The integration was not without resistance to the implementation, though, and backstage concerns about privacy emerged in Congressional hearings. What is most interesting to note, however, is that the resistance was for the most part in support of privacy for the potential employees of whom were receiving the check and the government’s obligations for the information collection; however, there was little, if any, mention of deeper, possibly problematic privacy concerns for the social media platforms and their mediated connections that co-create a second, derivative type of content beyond the access of their users. This paper examines the hearing “Incorporating social media into federal background investigations” in response to the SEAD-5 to see what the U.S. Congress did and did not discuss at the hearing and explores potential explanations for the inclusions/omissions, ultimately answering how those in charge of policies could have overlook deeper privacy complexities, and evaluating what this can mean for government, privacy, and policy researchers.","",""

Most of it was achieved in monodisciplinary works. However, privacy has a deeply interdisciplinary nature. Most importantly, societies as well as individuals experience privacy as being influenced by legal, technical, and social norms and structures. In this article, we hence attempt to connect insights of different academic disciplines into a joint model, an Interdisciplinary Privacy and Communication Model. The model differentiates four different elements: communication context, protection needs, threat and risk analysis, as well as protection enforcement. On the one hand, with this model, we aim to describe how privacy unfolds. On the other hand, the model also prescribes how privacy can be furnished and regulated. As such, the model contributes to a general understanding of privacy as a theoretical guide and offers a practical basis to address new challenges of the digital age. ","",""

Support was found for a TPE model suggesting that users report greater perceived Internet privacy risks on others than on themselves, based on a sample ( N = 613) from Amazon MTurk. In particular, the differential perception of Internet privacy risks between self and others increased people’s willingness to recommend protective measures to others but decreased their willingness to adopt protective measures themselves. Moreover, social distance, perceived Internet privacy knowledge, negative online privacy experiences, and Internet use activities emerged as significant predictors of TPE perceptions about Internet privacy risks. Study findings indicated that third-person perception is one of the major barriers inhibiting the adoption of privacy protection measures. The antecedents of TPE perceptions detected here provide valuable implications about how to enable Internet users to protect their privacy security. ","",""

"2021","Dark and Bright Patterns in Cookie Consent Requests","Dark patterns are (evil) design nudges that steer people’s behaviour through persuasive interface design. Increasingly found in cookie consent requests, they possibly undermine principles of EU privacy law. In two preregistered online experiments we investigated the effects of three common design nudges (default, aesthetic manipulation, obstruction) on users’ consent decisions and their perception of control over their personal data in these situations. In the first experiment (N = 228) we explored the effects of design nudges towards the privacy-unfriendly option (dark patterns). The experiment revealed that most participants agreed to all consent requests regardless of dark design nudges. Unexpectedly, despite generally low levels of perceived control, obstructing the privacy-friendly option led to more rather than less perceived control. In the second experiment (N = 255) we reversed the direction of the design nudges towards the privacy-friendly option, which we title “bright patterns”. This time the obstruction and default nudges swayed people effectively towards the privacy-friendly option, while the result regarding perceived control stayed the same compared to Experiment 1. Overall, our findings suggest that many current implementations of cookie consent requests do not enable meaningful choices by internet users, and are thus not in line with the intention of the EU policymakers. We also explore how policymakers could address the problem.","",""

This article explores the relationship between automated identification and social sorting, decision-making, and response. To develop a theoretical framework for considering the ways in which facial recognition technology reconfigures power relations, the article considers the effects of treating the face as what Harun Farocki calls an “operative image”: not a representation, but part of a sequence of operations. These operations deprive the face of its distinctive character to facilitate the automated governance of space. For Foucault, environmentality focused on the governance of populations, but digital technology individualizes and particularizes this process. Facial recognition technology raises issues of public concern not simply because it changes the conditions of privacy and recognition in shared spaces, but because it enables new modes of automated control.

In particular, it marked a preoccupation in audience measurement with biometrics, and a constant onslaught of technological experiments in search of a seamless body/machine integration.

Funded under the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 programme, the system is analysed in relation to the wider political economy of ‘emotional AI’ and the history of deception detection technologies. We then move on to interrogate the design of iBorderCtrl using publicly available documents and assess the assumptions and scientific validation underpinning the project design. Finally, drawing on a Bayesian analysis we outline statistical fallacies in the foundational premise of mass screening and argue that it is very unlikely that the model that iBorderCtrl provides for deception detection would work in practice. By interrogating actual systems in this way, we argue that we can begin to question the very premise of the development of data-driven systems, and emotional AI and deception detection in particular, pushing back on the assumption that these systems are fulfilling the tasks they claim to be attending to and instead ask what function such projects carry out in the creation of subjects and management of populations. This function is not merely technical but, rather, we argue, distinctly political and forms part of a mode of governance increasingly shaping life opportunities and fundamental rights.","",""

The recent legal steps reflect growing public outcry over corporate data misuses and lack of appropriate legislation. The findings suggest that the issue public of Twitter users in this study largely considered corporations and the government as untrustworthy actors for privacy legislation. The political distrust was raising doubts over regulatory capture and if a future US federal privacy law will be weaker than state laws (e.g., CCPA) while overriding them. The study explores implications of the findings on the current deadlock over the state preemption clause in developing a comprehensive federal privacy law. I argue that the emerging regulatory efforts on data privacy may not be effective unless the public trust in institutions is regained in the US and that the continuing absence of a federal law amid the political distrust can leave people with limited individual privacy strategies as a result.","",""

Although the success of HCA as a public health intervention might have legitimized government or corporate surveillance, the scope and contour of post-pandemic HCA use remain unclear. Both officials and tech firms have been promoting broader post-pandemic HCA use for purposes beyond pandemic control. This research draws on theories on privacy, trust, and media engagement to investigate factors affecting Chinese public opinion on HCA's post-pandemic use. Original survey data were collected in 2021 from adult HCA users in two major Chinese cities: Wuhan where COVID-19 cases were first identified and Hangzhou where the first HCA was deployed. Results point to a majority for moderate post-pandemic HCA use, while almost four out of ten users support expansive HCA use and the voice for restricted or terminated use is tiny. Greater acceptance of HCA data use by various institutional stakeholders, greater institutional trust, greater engagement with COVID-19 related social media content increased the support for expansive use.","",""

Increasingly complex modes of digital data production and usage generate grey areas that seem to escape legal jurisdiction and democratic oversight. With their privileged access inside these grey areas, conscientious employees-turned-whistleblowers are likely to become key sources for the disclosure of serious wrongdoing in the coming years. The argument is empirically illustrated through three cases that represent different types of grey areas in advanced democracies: big data surveillance (Edward Snowden), tax havens (Antoine Deltour and the Panama and Paradise Papers), and digital political profiling (Christopher Wylie).","",""
"2022","The two faces of the child in facial recognition industry discourse: biometric capture between innocence and recalcitrance","ABSTRACT This article explores how the child is evoked in the discursive construction of facial recognition technology. Facial recognition technology is one of the most socially contentious emerging technologies of recent years, heavily criticised for enabling racialized and other forms of social harms. Drawing on data gathered through facial recognition tradeshow ethnographies, and interviews with members of the biometrics industry, we explore how the biometric monitoring of children has gained a prominent place in the industry’s promotion of facial recognition technology as a mode of ‘careful’ surveillance. At the same time, however, the fast-changing face of the growing child is acknowledged as a difficult technical challenge to the efficient development and use of this technology. We argue that in these industry discourses the child is figured as both innocent and recalcitrant, and that the facial recognition industry has productively exploited the tension between these two figurations to legitimate and expand its own enterprise.","",""
"2022","Did the GDPR increase trust in data collectors? Evidence from observational and experimental data","ABSTRACT In the wake of the digital revolution and connected technologies, societies store an ever-increasing amount of data on humans, their preferences, and behavior. These modern technologies create a trust challenge, insofar as individuals have to trust data collectors such as private organizations, government institutions, and researchers that their data is not misused. Privacy regulations should increase trust because they provide laws that increase transparency and allow for punishment in cases in which the trustee violates trust. The introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018 – a wide-reaching regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy that covers millions of individuals in Europe – provides a unique setting to study the impact of privacy regulation on trust in data collectors. We collected survey panel data in Germany around the implementation date and ran a survey experiment with a GDPR information treatment. Our observational and experimental evidence does not support the hypothesis that the GDPR has positively affected trust. This finding and our discussion of the underlying reasons are relevant for the wider research field of trust, privacy, and big data.","",""

This article demonstrates the growing centrality of mobile network operators in managing global health crises through a case study of South Korea’s epidemic governance. In South Korea, KT, one of the country’s three telecommunications companies, has been actively developing and investing in health surveillance platforms since 2015, promoting that its big-data-based surveillance and ICT infrastructures may prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Conducting a situational analysis of archival materials, I document the process through which such mobile network operators emerge as essential producers of the data infrastructures that shape the understanding and management of public health emergencies. The article also addresses the sociocultural implications of such private technology corporations’ capturing of emergency power. In the end, I argue that Korea’s public health surveillance systems are increasingly constructed within the capitalist logic of the telecom industry, mainly via ‘platformization’ – a shift that offers telecom firms to transform from network to platform operators by extracting and aggregating subscribers' data. The case analyzed here demonstrates how granting such extraordinary authority to ICT companies during national emergencies becomes routinized, and even instrumentalized for economic purposes.","",""

This exploratory study investigates the management of location privacy and mitigation of its violations through case studies of six city and county governments in the United States. It focuses on why or why not local governments have instituted location privacy policies, how they incorporate location privacy in their management, and how the managerial processes of location privacy policy formulation and implementation could be conceptualized. It follows an inductive approach, analyzing within-case findings, identifying cross-case commonalities, and inducing propositions. Findings show that there is no consistent definition of location privacy, with each local government developing its own definition and attendant approaches to privacy policymaking, management, and protection. It induces seven propositions and posits a research model centered on the concept of managerial cognition. Practical implications for city and county management are also discussed.","",""
"2022","Multiplicity and temporality of rationality: Constructing information for meningitis surveillance and response in Burkina Faso","Abstract Currently, better data is called for around the world to strengthen detection and response to epidemics. Health information systems are envisioned to provide such data in a coherent manner, but different rationalities of those engaged in the collection and use of data, often lead to fragmentation. In this article we present a socio-technical analysis of the multiple flows of information construction for disease surveillance. Our study is based on fieldwork done in Burkina Faso in West Africa during 2015–2017. The case concerns meningitis control in Burkina Faso focusing on two flows in its meningitis surveillance and response system: (1) data flow from health worker’s initial record on the first contact with the patient to the national level statistics compilation office, (2) substance and related data flows from the sample extracted by the health worker to the laboratories and their reporting of the test results. Drawing from the field of sociology of knowledge and technology, we base our analytical framework on four key concepts: circulating reference, multiplicities, rationalities, and temporalities. While circulating reference and multiplicities concern the “how” of information construction, rationalities and temporalities focus the attention on the “why”, reflecting the positions of different actors. Our findings show that viewed over time, fragmentation also gives rise to coherence in the information system. Providing “good” data follows a “temporality of rationality”, where data which are considered useful are highly affected by when they are needed, by whom, and for what purpose. Taken together, this framework provides for the development of sociologically grounded research on the how and why of information construction, which is also critical for improving the practice of disease surveillance.","",""

These recordings are typically sent to third party companies whose stated purpose is to analyze the recordings to help correct bottlenecks and illuminate problems that are difficult for users to navigate. We examine how session replay scripts are being marketed and how they are used by application developers. The extent of gathered data is intrusive, often going beyond the stated objectives, and often collected without users’ knowledge. Using Nissenbaum’s privacy as contextual integrity framework, we demonstrate how replay scripts violate the norms of both appropriateness and distribution, and hence the privacy of the user. We examine two scenarios: one where the session replay data are sent back to the application developer, and another where captured data are sent to third party companies. We compare the scenarios to two analogous situations: surveys taken at a museum and video surveillance in a brick-and-mortar store. We analyze in detail the case of FullStory, a vendor of session replay scripts. In conclusion, we offer suggestions on how to preserve private information in both scenarios.","",""

While several countries have employed surveillance technologies to tackle the spread of coronavirus, Israel was the only country in the world to authorize its internal security agency to track citizens’ cellphones to deal with this civil-medical crisis. Employing a reflexive thematic analysis to news media outlets, this study examined coverage of Israel Security Agency (ISA) surveillance by four leading Israeli news sites, inquiring into the socio-cultural imageries, and motifs that informed their reports. While two of the sites were mostly supportive and the other two were critical, the coverage as a whole was informed by national security imageries reminiscent of Israel’s nation-in-arms tradition. Our discussion contextualizes these findings within a three-decade tension that has prevailed in Israeli society and culture between securitization/militarization and democratization/demilitarization.

Rooted in the ubiquitous computing boom of the early 2000s, the language of sensing reimagines biometric technology as a mediator between the digital and the human, laying the foundation for biometric surveillance’s expansion into everyday settings such as retail ones. In these newer settings, biometric surveillance is promoted as a means for collecting data on human affect and behavior to be used for marketing and other applications. I argue that this growing ambiguity of biometric surveillance re-articulates a convergence between production and consumption, while it also informs safe society discourses and the shifting role of embodiment within digital culture.

Its capability is expanding rapidly in association with artificial intelligence and has great potential to solve crime. However, it also carries significant privacy and other ethical implications that require law and regulation. This article examines the rise of biometric facial recognition, current applications and legal developments, and conducts an ethical analysis of the issues that arise. Ethical principles are applied to mediate the potential conflicts in relation to this information technology that arise between security, on the one hand, and individual privacy and autonomy, and democratic accountability, on the other. These can be used to support appropriate law and regulation for the technology as it continues to develop.","",""
"2022","Big data surveillance across fields: Algorithmic governance for policing &amp; regulation"," While the academic separation of policing and regulation is still largely operative, points of convergence are more significant than ever in the digital age, starting with concomitant debates about algorithms as a new figure of power. From the policing of illegal activities to the regulation of legal ones, the algorithmization of such critical social ordering practices has been the subject of growing attention. These burgeoning discussions are focused on one common element: big data surveillance. In accordance with such similarities and paralleled developments in policing and regulation, the article aims to further bridge the gap between literatures to respond to the calls for studying big data surveillance across institutional domains and social fields. To do so, it is focused on one case study that articulates algorithmic policing and regulation domains, in-between security and economic fields. This is the fight against illicit finance, i.e. ‘the global action against the financial flows that fuel crime and terrorism’. To what extent does big data surveillance make a difference in the main global policy of crime-fighting and financial regulation? Drawing on a fieldwork in a large North American bank, the present article takes stock of the algorithmic overlap between policing and regulation. It argues that the final result is policing and regulation of neither too much nor too little, which gives rise to automated and everyday mass surveillance while remaining as far removed from regulatory and crime-fighting ambitions as it is from dystopian visions of big data and algorithmic drama.

"2022","Datafication and the practice  of intelligence production"," Datafication of social life affects what society regards as knowledge. Jasanoff’s regimes of sight framework provides three ideal-type models of authorised knowing in environmental data practice. This paper applies Jasanoff's framework for analysing intelligence practice through an exploratory empirical study of crime and intelligence practitioners in a selection of police services in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States. The paper argues that the ‘view from somewhere’ (VFS) captures the essence of existing police intelligence practices in the four countries but the ‘view from nowhere’ (VFN) is emerging as a possible future for police intelligence – an approach promoted by technology companies and supported mainly by police leaders and managers. The paper investigates the challenges and limits of a shift by police from VFS to VFN in the production of intelligence; the challenges are primarily political, which threaten the dominance of police contextual knowledge over ‘scientific’ knowledge. These political challenges also have symbolic and material implications. The paper concludes that, because of these challenges, a complete shift from VFS to VFN is not likely to happen. At best the two models might co-exist with the latter subordinate to the imperatives of the former, resulting in further tension between sworn officers and civilians, organisational inertia, as well as technologies that may be under-utilised or abandoned.

"2022","The unbearable (technical) unreliability of automated facial emotion recognition"," Emotion recognition, and in particular acial emotion recognition (FER), is among the most controversial applications of machine learning, not least because of its ethical implications for human subjects. In this article, we address the controversial conjecture that machines can read emotions from our facial expressions by asking whether this task can be performed reliably. This means, rather than considering the potential harms or scientific soundness of facial emotion recognition systems, focusing on the reliability of the ground truths used to develop emotion recognition systems, assessing how well different human observers agree on the emotions they detect in subjects’ faces. Additionally, we discuss the extent to which sharing context can help observers agree on the emotions they perceive on subjects’ faces. Briefly, we demonstrate that when large and heterogeneous samples of observers are involved, the task of emotion detection from static images crumbles into inconsistency. We thus reveal that any endeavour to understand human behaviour from large sets of labelled patterns is over-ambitious, even if it were technically feasible. We conclude that we cannot speak of actual accuracy for facial emotion recognition systems for any practical purposes. ","",""
"2022","Capitalizing on transparency: Commercial surveillance and pharmaceutical marketing after the Physician Sunshine Act"," How corporations surveil and influence consumers using big data tools is a major area of research and public debate. However, few studies explore it in relation to physicians in the USA, even though they have been surveilled and targeted by the pharmaceutical industry since at least the 1950s. Indeed, in 2010, concerns about the pharmaceutical industry's undue influence led to the passing of the Physician Sunshine Act, a unique piece of transparency legislation that requires companies to report their financial ties to physicians and teaching hospitals in a public database. This article argues that while the Sunshine Act has clearly helped expose important commercial influences on both prescribing and the scale of industry involvement with physicians, it has also, paradoxically, fuelled further commercial surveillance and marketing. The article casts new light on innovative pharmaceutical marketing approaches and the key role of data brokers and analytics companies in the identification, targeting, managing, and surveillance of physicians. We place this analysis within the political economies of the pharmaceutical industry, surveillance-based marketing, and transparency, and argue that policies to promote increased transparency must be tightly tied to policies that impede the commodification and use of transparency data for surveillance and marketing purposes.

"2022","Digital contact tracing in the pandemic cities: Problematizing the regime of traceability in South Korea"," Since 2020, many countries worldwide have deployed digital contact tracing programs that rely on a range of digital sensors in the city to locate and map the routes of viral spread. Many critical commentaries have raised concerns about the privacy risks and trustworthiness of these programs. Extending these analyses, this paper opens up a different line of questioning that goes beyond privacy-centered single-axis critique of surveillance by considering digital contact tracing symptomatic of the broader changes in modes of urban governance that renders our cities traceable, knowable, and governable through data. Based on archival and real-time analysis of South Korean national and local COVID-19 dashboards, online forums, and interviews with South Korean public health practitioners, this paper offers a sociotechnical analysis of digital contact tracing that looks at the various intersections of state-political, bio-political, and techno-political power dynamics. In contrast to popular narratives that attributed the success of the Korean approach to digital contact tracing to its collectivist culture and smart city infrastructures, this paper suggests that the case can be better understood by looking at both the macro-level shift in the forms of governance that takes on a spatialized and networked character and the micro-level formation of moral responsibility that shape one's conduct as a health and safety-conscious citizens. As the latest realization of the expanding regime of traceability in digital/urban governance, the development of digital contract tracing is seen to parallel with concurrent changes occurring in multiple domains of life including knowledge production, cultural memory, and individual subjectivity.

"2022","The Chilling Effects of Digital Dataveillance: A Theoretical Model and an Empirical Research Agenda"," People's sense of being subject to digital dataveillance can cause them to restrict their digital communication behavior. Such a chilling effect is essentially a form of self-censorship in everyday digital media use with the attendant risks of undermining individual autonomy and well-being. This article combines the existing theoretical and limited empirical work on surveillance and chilling effects across fields with an analysis of novel data toward a research agenda. The institutional practice of dataveillance—the automated, continuous, and unspecific collection, retention, and analysis of digital traces—affects individual behavior. A mechanism-based causal model based on the theory of planned behavior is proposed for the micro level: An individual's increased sense of dataveillance causes their subjective probability assigned to negative outcomes of digital communication behavior to increase and attitudes toward this communication to become less favorable, ultimately decreasing the intention to engage in it. In aggregate and triggered through successive salience shocks such as data scandals, dataveillance is accordingly hypothesized to lower the baseline of free digital communication in a society through the chilling effects mechanism. From the developed theoretical model, a set of methodological consequences and questions for future studies are derived. ","",""

Without securing trust from the populace whose information is being collected, analyzed, and deployed, policies on which such data are based will be undermined by a lack of public confidence. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated digitalization and datafication by governments for the purposes of contact tracing and epidemiological investigation. However, concerns about surveillance and data privacy have stunted the adoption of such contact-tracing initiatives. This commentary analyzes Singapore's contact-tracing initiative to uncover the reasons for public resistance and efforts by the state to address them. The government's contact-tracing program encompassing its proprietary TraceTogether app and physical token initially triggered vociferous public criticisms of Big Brother style surveillance. Using a dialogic communication framework, we analyze the TraceTogether initiative to interrogate the communicative strategies that were used to overcome public resistance. We argue that these strategies reflect a top-down approach that prioritizes transactional dissemination of information, in line with Singapore's technocratic stance toward governance. We further assert that such communicative tactics represent missed opportunities to foster public confidence in social data governance through greater trust building. We propose solutions for more dialogic communicative forms that build trust, so that officials can develop a sound understanding of the public concerns, increase the level of public engagement, and incorporate public feedback into policies that govern data use.

Currently, COVID-19 health status certificates are being deployed around the world, including in Europe, the United States and China. When combined with identity verification, these digital and paper-based certificates allow individuals to prove their health status by showing recent COVID-19 tests results, full vaccination records or evidence of recovery from COVID-19. Most countries in the Global South, where vaccination rates are low, have not yet fully implemented such certificates, although several initiatives are currently underway. That is, for instance, the case in the African Union. Yet, it is not sufficient to develop technical solutions for the verification of COVID-19 health status. Because technologies do not evolve in a legal vacuum, the existing laws and regulations must be respected. The risks of implementing such technologies must be anticipated and mitigated as much as possible before any large-scale deployment. Risk mitigation should also underpin strategies throughout the deployment of these certificates. This article evaluates the key legal implications of COVID-19 health status certificates for data privacy and human rights. In doing so, it contributes to the current debates, thus informing policymakers in this area of vital national and international interest ","",""

In the melodramatic narrative strands, sophisticated plotlines, and spectacular performances of forensic science, CSI heavily rests on a novel and meticulously elaborated aesthetics that redefines the conception of gaze and camera shot in the weaving of episodes across the different seasons. A more nuanced comprehension of CSI’s visual forensic discourse is, therefore, necessitated to fully understand the cultural significance of these offerings. To this end, extending the work of Kress and Van Leuween on the systems of gaze and social distance in light of the Foucauldian and post-panoptic views on power and control, the article introduces fine-grained taxonomies of the forensic gaze and camera shot as fundamental aesthetics closely tied to post-9/11 extensive surveillance discourse. Resituating CSI in the broader context of the post-panopticon, the study argues that the drama series operates in a hybrid surveillance mode that surpasses conventional readings of panopticism, straddling the line between the physical and the digital in the contemporary age.

This policy “implementation gap,” signals a failure to take into consideration the complexity of a system or issue. Failure often results in policy that is a misfit for the issue of concern and is lacking in the hoped for remedial or preventative impacts. This study explores policy prototyping as a remedy for policy failures in bills aimed at privacy protection. After selecting three privacy-related bills, we created prototypes that represented one of many ways that privacy policy could be translated into features in online platforms. Using the prototypes, we conducted 41 semi-structured interviews to gather feedback and insights on the challenges with the laws. Our findings illustrate how different roles emphasize protections, harms, and word choice when communicating levers of change like civil rights protections in law to privacy design elements. This solidified the opportunities to better bridge policy and practice by outlining common and distinct bill themes. ","",""

The therapeutic politics of K-Quarantine is enacted by an amalgam of moral guilt and legal liabilities for damages to the community, framing the COVID-stricken public as potential criminals against community. In this political context characterized by potential guilt, the public feel culpable if they resist the overshadowing power of public security. This essay offers a critique of the public security rhetoric, examining the case of an LGBTQ South Korean charged on violations of the Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act amid the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020. A critical evaluation of invasive and punitive measures found in the case demonstrates that the K-Quarantine strategy contradicts its own underlying liberal ideal of the autonomous subject because its public health deliberation reproduces a guilt mandate by constructing a perpetrator/victim binary.

There is a lack of attention paid to intersex issues in mainstream media as well as from surveillance studies scholars. As a result, as scholars reflect backward over the decades of scholarship in surveillance studies in this anniversary issue of Surveillance &amp; Society, we posit that it is time to use the refined tools surveillance studies offers in service of opposing the often-ignored ongoing surveillance—and killing project—of intersex people’s unique sex traits. In doing so, we focus our attention on surgical interventions, medical photography, and the reproductive technology preimplantation genetic diagnosis. These three case studies offer a sampling of the various ways intersex variations are surveilled and eradicated, and, therefore, signal the importance of integrating intersex issues into feminist surveillance studies. To conclude, we address how intersex activists find each other and propel their activism—activism that combats the surveiling and regulating nature of state and medical-sanctioned interphobia—into the mainstream via information and communication technologies. And yet, there remains so much work to be done. We end on the cautionary note that the ways that intersex activists’ work is routinely stymied and undermined by state and medical forces must be considered.","",""

Here we build on the notion of the police métier as a term that encapsulates the interactive identities and practices that produce the police world. We twin the police métier with recent scholarship on pluralized policing and surveillance to illustrate how a desire to expand surveillance to plural actors requires a socialization process that recirculates key characteristics, identities, and assumptive worldviews that shape the typically reclusive domains of high policing. Through an ethnographic account of a three-day counterterrorism training workshop for an array of frontline workers, our article analyzes what we consider three key features of socialization within the high policing métier: (1) the recirculation of the “war on terror’s” racialized fixation on Muslims and Islam; (2) rationalities of preemption and expanding domains of surveillance; and (3) the sharing fraternal moments through the dehumanization of “outsiders.”","",""

At the same time, even the most mundane activities are increasingly affected by offline as well as online surveillance. The privacy paradigm suggests that there is a difference between the private and public spheres of life, and that with technological advancement the demarcation lines between these spheres have become blurred. As a consequence, citizens’ conceptions of privacy are becoming more fluid, nuanced, context-dependent, and socially determined. This gives rise to a need to reconceptualize what privacy means and how citizens think about its boundaries. To investigate citizens’ conceptions of privacy, we conducted six focus groups in Slovakia aimed at exploring people’s attitudes toward privacy and encompassing their experiences and rationalizations (including possible alterations) of behavior in a variety of everyday environments. The analysis suggests that privacy is a complex phenomenon that is understood as an interplay between different privacy norms guiding specific contexts and more general approaches to privacy. We identify four privacy environments (a controlled private space, a [voluntarily] shared private space, a transactional public space, and a non-controllable public space) and three privacy approaches (the reservations approach, the trade-off approach, and the death of privacy approach) whose interplay constitutes individuals’ conceptions of privacy. In addition, the acceptance of loss of privacy seems to depend on a perception of legitimacy, control over the mechanisms of surveillance that individuals encounter, and trust toward the data processor.","",""

By concentrating on the public discourses surrounding the concomitantly rapid increase in gun violence and video surveillance, this paper analyzes the ways in which these communications—through their language, images, and filmic documentation—have shaped and informed public perceptions of CCTV in Charleston’s Eastside. The presented discourses around the public perception of video surveillance and the analysis thereof offer an opportunity to explore the cultural assumptions as well as the underlying racial, gender-based, and socio-economic power dynamics experienced in Charleston’s Eastside community. Through the analysis’s broad scope, this paper argues for a shift in public perceptions of video surveillance. As an integral part of the Eastside’s surveillance infrastructure, video surveillance in the hands of a community of “all-seers” displays, at first, unspoken strategies for preserving racialized surveillance hierarchies that are deeply embedded in the history of Charleston. However, through the counternarratives presented in Idrissou Mora-Kpai’s documentary America Street (2019), those power dynamics are ultimately diffused and questioned, resulting in a reevaluation of video surveillance through the lens of social justice movements, whose effects extend beyond Charleston’s city borders.","",""
"2022","Surface Tensions: Skate-Stoppers and the Surveillance Politics of Small Spaces","Skate-stoppers are ubiquitous objects installed on outdoor surfaces in built environments all over the world. Skate-stoppers are an essential part of low-tech security of urban surfaces at a micro-scale—a single bench, handrail, or ledge—with the sole-purpose of protecting these surfaces from skateboarders. As such skate-stoppers are an extension of human and electronic surveillance systems, though in many patches of the urban landscape, skate-stoppers are a low-cost substitute for more sophisticated technologies. This interplay of control and liberation draws attention to surfaces in urban space and specific tactics adopted to secure and protect them through surveillance. In this article, we explore the criticality of skate-stoppers and tactics for removing them to advance the study of surveillance of small spaces. We argue that skate-stoppers are aggressive attempts to control urban space by interrupting the flow of bodies and boards along particular surfaces, namely the “spots” desired by skateboarders. Second, we argue that the installation of skate-stoppers has shifted from reaction to anticipation of skateboarders, and new construction projects now come with skate-stoppers already installed as part of surveillance infrastructure. Third, we argue that skateboarders have become adept at liberating spots from skate-stoppers, restoring flow to surfaces through both organised activism and covert acts, underscoring the limitations of surveillance using objects. We conclude with some thoughts on the disjuncture between the embrace of creative cities and the proliferation of skate-stoppers, suggesting creative play and its desired affective properties are regulated by the control of surfaces in the same spaces.","",""

While such representations of surveillance fail to account for the automated, algorithmic nature of modern surveillance practices and technologies, they dominate the perception of surveillance in the popular imaginary. Such representations contribute to a myth of digital surveillance as active and individualized, a Big Brother vision of surveillance that ignores or erases how automated surveillance and algorithmic evaluation of human beings can reinforce and exacerbate structural inequalities.","",""

"2022","Building a Latin American Agenda for Studies on Surveillance, Technology, and Society","It has become inescapable to question the conditions of constitution for sociotechnical surveillance arrangements in different contexts, and with that we have seen an increase in interest in studies dedicated to the understanding of the specificities of the social and historical construction of surveillance in Latin American countries from ontologies and epistemologies that are closest to their realities. This has happened both from the point of view of understanding the processes of use of surveillance by governments and companies in the neoliberal management of bodies and territories, as well as in the organization of resistance to more or less explicit violence operated by technologies of control. In this paper, we describe the circumstances in which a decolonial agenda for Latin American countries has been built by scholars, activists, and artists associated with the Latin American Network of Surveillance, Technology and Society Studies (LAVITS). The work of the network has always benefited from the critical thinking formed in the field of surveillance studies with crucial contributions coming from the Surveillance Studies Network and Surveillance &amp; Society in the past twenty years.","",""

"2022","From Privacy to Social Legibility","This paper draws upon James Scott’s Seeing Like a State (1998) to argue that privacy law currently suffers from (at least) three defects: a focus on the legibility of individuals that is too narrow, a focus on collection and subsequent use of data that comes too late, and a focus on rights and harms that ignores the need to create new social structures that can empower more local forms of collective decision-making. What this outlines in broad brushstrokes is the need to enfold privacy concerns within a broader data governance framework concerned with the fair and just terms of social legibility.","",""

"2022","From Banal Surveillance to Function Creep: Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR) in Denmark","This article discusses how Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR) has been implemented in Denmark across three different sectors: parking, environmental zoning, and policing. ALPR systems are deployed as a configuration of cameras, servers, and algorithms of computer vision that automatically reads and records license plates of passing cars. Through digital ethnography and interviews with key stakeholders in Denmark, we contribute to the fields of critical algorithm and surveillance studies with a concrete empirical study on how ALPR systems are configured according to user-specific demands. Each case gives nuance to how ALPR systems are implemented: (1) how the seamless charging for a “barrier-free” parking experience poses particular challenges for customers and companies; (2) how environmental zoning enforcement through automated fines avoids dragnet data collection through customized design and regulation; and (3) how the Danish Police has widened its dragnet data collection with little public oversight and questionable efficacy. We argue that ALPR enacts a form of “banal surveillance” because such systems operate inconspicuously under the radar of public attention. As the central analytic perspective, banality highlights how the demand for increasing efficiency in different domains makes surveillance socially and politically acceptable in the long run. Although we find that legal and civic modes of regulation are important for shaping the deployment of ALPR, the potential for function creep is embedded into the very process of infrastructuring due to a lack of public understanding of these technologies. We discuss wider consequences of ALPR as a specific and overlooked instance of algorithmic surveillance, contributing to academic and public debates around the embedding of algorithmic governance and computer vision into everyday life.","",""

In this paper we undertake the case studies of bSafe, Citizen, and Nextdoor – analyzing promotional materials and blog posts – in order to further theorize digital security consumption and the potential concomitant social harms. We find these app companies frame crime and risk in ways that obscure the structural elements that precede crime and encourage social divisions. Drawing from over 30,000 user reviews, we speculate about the ways these apps might shape understandings, feelings, and experiences of risk, crime, and victimization. A closer examination of these apps is particularly urgent given these digital technologies have been mobilized in similar ways to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.","",""
"2022","Surveillance Capital and Post-Fordist Accumulation: Towards a Critical Political Economy of Surveillance-for-Profit","This article presents a critical political economy of contemporary surveillance-for-profit. The article makes the central argument that surveillance capital emerged out of the contradictions of capitalist accumulation and remains subject to the imperative of accumulation for the sake of ever more accumulation. Platforms constitute the infrastructure and surveillance provides the instrument for the expropriation-accumulation-commodification of user-generated data. Firstly, the article maps how surveillance capital valorizes. Surveillance capital derives surplus value from expropriation rather than exploitation in a strict Marxian sense. Secondly, the article shows that surveillance capital is far from unique in its expropriation of both resources and labor. Indeed, capitalist accumulation has always entailed both expropriation and exploitation. Thirdly, the article argues that while surveillance has always been a key tool for shaping capital-labor relations, surveillance capital as such first emerged under Fordism and has now become an integral part of a Post-Fordist mode of flexible accumulation that is based on the expansion and intensification of forms of surveillance that arose in response to the requirements and contradictions of earlier modes of capitalist accumulation. The article concludes that Post-Fordist flexible accumulation in general and surveillance capital’s valorization in particular may end up producing a crisis of effective demand, as workers who are subject to increasing precariousness and disposability may no longer have the income to consume the commodities on whose sale surveillance capital ultimately depends.","",""
"2022","The Banality of Surveillance","Surveillance is a ubiquitous and routine organizational practice. It has a long history as a tool of governance and a tacit right of the state. In the digital age, actors within both public and private institutions increasingly collect data on people and behaviors to classify, sort, and intervene upon people’s lives in ways that are consequential for individual trajectories and patterns of social stratification. Although theoretical scholarship on surveillance is rich, the corpus of empirical work on the subject is more limited, in part due to methodological and data challenges. Fortunately, scholars across a wide range of disciplines are turning their attention to surveillance and finding creative and ambitious strategies for overcoming these data limitations. Future research—particularly that which leverages new sources of data and comparative or experimental designs—may yield new insights about whether and under what conditions technologically mediated surveillance disrupts or ossifies existing inequalities.","",""

At their heart, the rise of FIRE-tech is about upgrading old and building new forms of surveillance and then applying them to increasingly more people, places, and processes. And yet, critical research on FIRE-tech from the field of surveillance studies has not kept pace with these developments. This special issue offers us a chance to look back on the contributions made by the field and look ahead at the challenges it now faces. As we think about the issues and agendas that should guide our research moving forward, there is value in bringing surveillance studies and FIRE-tech into closer alignment. Doing so provides an opportunity to increase the analytical power and ongoing relevance of the field by critically confronting the development, purpose, and impact of FIRE-tech. In short, we should frame FIRE as surveillance and we should see surveillance via FIRE.","",""
"2022","Developing Privacy Extensions: Is it Advocacy through the Web Browser?","In 2015, Edward Snowden recommended that ordinary citizens use adblocking software and an encryption-oriented privacy extension for their web browser to protect against surveillance. This paper critically explores how the development of privacy extension software for web browsers can be situated in relation to privacy advocacy. Privacy advocates are individuals who act on behalf of the citizenry to speak to governments and corporations about how our data are collected and processed. While the Snowden revelations began in 2013 and the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke in 2018, privacy extensions remain underexplored in the literature on privacy advocacy. This paper shares findings from ethnographically informed interviews conducted with thirty developers and other knowledgeable experts who created twenty-six named privacy extensions. The privacy extensions explored included anti-tracking, hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS), and privacy policy and password-related functionalities. Although privacy extensions are an imperfect set of tools to protect privacy, we argue that production of this software demonstrates an array of privacy advocacy strategies. Privacy extensions can be scaffolded upon previous resistance moves to surveillance by individuals, while also sometimes intersecting with traditional and expanded notions of collective action in the digital age.","",""

"2022","The Haunting of Surveillance Studies: Seeing, Knowing, and Ghostly Apparitions","This paper explores the relevance of a ghost methodology for surveillance studies. Following Torin Monahan’s (2021) call to unsettle transparency as a metric or goal of surveillance studies and inspired by Michelle Brown’s (2022) demand that criminology exorcise the ghosts of white supremacy, I draw upon a 2020 case of a police-involved death of a racialized woman in Toronto to consider the haunting absence of images that are usually called upon to offer evidence what “really” happened. Against the desire to make this death empirically knowable, a ghost method asks us to live with the “eerie” remnants of violence as palpable presences that require of us a reckoning. The spectral presence of white supremacy that looms over the ghostly absence of Regis Korchinski-Paquet can lead us to a form of redress consistent with abolitionist ways of seeing. Thus, I seek to break the impasse of debates over the costs or benefits of increased transparency by outlining how a ghost methodology can help to decentre surveillance studies’ preoccupation with visibility in favour of a more nuanced appreciation of haunting and absence.","",""

"2022","(Un)Seeing as Care or Control: The Collection of Race-Identified COVID-19 Data","The over-surveillance of racialized or colonized groups for the purposes of control is a well-documented issue. At the same time, there tends to be an under-monitoring of these same groups in cases where such surveillance by state or governmental actors could have implications for care outcomes through the safeguarding of public health provisions. This article draws attention to calls in Canada, particularly by black communities, for the collection of race-identified COVID-19 patient data. The collection of such race-identified data has been deemed by proponents as necessary for a more thorough understanding of and equitable policy response to the pandemic. While these calls mean making an already over-surveilled population more visible to states and governments, they also represent an exercise of agency by members of oppressed groups in negotiating how and when they should be visible. Such calls for race-identified data thus unsettle the increasingly “negative” understanding of surveillance and highlight how the care potential of surveillance cannot be dismissed even if surveillance systems are simultaneously dangerous.","",""

The synchronous connection of cloud-based streaming allows some daily activities of higher-ed to continue; yet, Zoom has faced criticism for surveillance and data extraction, privacy and security issues, platform control of content, and as contributing to infrastructural divides. Drawing from critical media studies and surveillance studies approaches, I examine the issues of videoconferencing platforms like Zoom as compositions of platform, infrastructural, and capitalist surveillance. Despite the oft-promoted benefits of these platforms, critical attention must be paid to the highly problematic inherent surveillant dimensions of partnerships between higher-ed and big tech to ensure the protection of students, employees, and faculty. Specifically, the rapid adoption of Zoom exemplifies the dangers of surveillant platform infrastructure, as well as how technological “solutions” gain traction in moments of crisis.","",""

The article focuses on two aspects: the involvement of actors from the public sector in releasing COVID-19 related apps and the measures implemented for personal data protection. The findings suggest that differences exist according to the geographical context in which apps were released and the specific functions they perform. We identify specific trends in Europe that confirm a stronger emphasis on data protection than what happened on a global scale, and to a certain extent a greater involvement of the public sector through health authorities.","",""

China’s information state and its digital economy are particularly industrious data collectors. The resulting extensive exposure of Chinese citizens’ personal information could reasonably provoke privacy concerns. To date, the relative distribution of concerns toward government and companies, as well as the structural and ideological roots of privacy concerns in China, are not yet well understood. Concerns over personal information being combined in a big data scenario have not yet been examined in the Chinese context. Drawing on an original online survey from 2019 (N = 1,500), representative of the Chinese online population, this study reveals that concerns about data collection by government are low, albeit modestly elevated among individuals who are ideologically not aligned with the state. By contrast, concerns over data collection by companies are both extensive and consensual across key socio-structural and ideological divides. Surprisingly, the combination of government and commercially collected personal information does not multiply concerns. Thus, the Chinese authoritarian information state is perceived as a safety device for, rather than a threat to, citizens’ personal information. Extensive state interventions in the digital economy converge with broadly shared popular concerns about corporate information privacy practices.","",""

Findings show that access to digital forensic technologies is an important equalizing tool that allows public defenders to (1) mount strong, data-driven cases; (2) create counter narratives that challenge depictions of marginalized defendants as dangerous; and (3) engage in nuanced storytelling to highlight the complexities of human relationships and life circumstances that shape cases.

Findings support that concerns over control, collection, and access to personal information associate with decreased intensity of social media use and correlate to frustration with terms of service agreements regarding personal information use.

Identifying conceptual barriers to safeguarding children’s data privacy"," This article explores conceptual barriers to protecting children’s personal information in relation to online commercial data practices. It does this by using Vedder’s conceptual categories of privacy to identify and position parents’ and teenagers’ concepts of privacy within interpersonal, institutional and commercial data terrains. Drawing from qualitative interviews, the analysis shows that parents’ and teenagers’ conceptualise privacy in terms of the private/public dimension and that their conceptualisations of the consumer–corporate relationship, and corporations themselves, prohibited any concern for their decisional and informational privacy. As their conceptualisations of privacy harms were embedded within social rather than technological frames, this precluded motivation to protect children’s data privacy. This research argues that without a conceptual shift in the way we think about privacy and privacy harms, we need to question whether the logics of neoliberalism can effectively address children’s data privacy.

Where is the line between personal social media use and professional identities? What is the difference between holding people in positions of power to account and invading the privacy of everyday people? What kinds of social media posts get people fired? In this article, we report on a study of 312 news media articles that document stories of people being fired because of a social media post. We divide the corpus into posts made by the individuals who are fired (“self-posts,” n = 264) and posts made by others that resulted in the subject of those posts losing their job (“third party,” n = 48). Racism was the most common reason people were fired in these news stories, followed by other forms of discriminatory behavior (such as queerphobia), offensive content, workplace conflict, political content, acts of violence, and abuse. We examine these narratives through the lens of what van Dijck describes as “professional value,” and ultimately seek to question how these stories normalize the “hidden curriculum of surveillance,” putting additional pressure on employees and young people who are called to act on social media through the prism of future employment.

Means designed to protect the user’s privacy and prevent exploitation of confidential data often go unused. In this study, we draw on the theory of planned behavior, a reasoned action approach, to explain intentions to adopt privacy behaviors on social networking sites, with a focus on Twitter users. Consistent with the theory, an online survey of Twitter users ( n = 1,060) found that instrumental and experiential attitudes and descriptive and injunctive subjective norms regarding these behaviors were direct predictors of intentions. Perceived behavioral control had a moderating effect, such that subjective norm was a better predictor of intentions for participants high as opposed to low in perceived control. We briefly discuss the implications of these results for developing theory-driven and evidence-based interventions to promote privacy behavior. ","",""

"2022","Biometric Bordering and Automatic Gender Recognition: Challenging Binary Gender Norms in Everyday Biometric Technologies","AbstractWith the rise of advanced biometric technologies, the surveilling of populations who do not match racial and gender norms has increased. Modern-day biometrics make assumptions about gender and race based on skin color, facial structure, body type, and body parts, which are encoded in predictive algorithms and other AI-driven systems. Growing empirical evidence points to the obstacles this poses for trans and non-binary individuals in several spheres, including border security, healthcare, and social media. Drawing on autoethnographic vignettes, semi-structured interviews, and survey responses, we look to the increased use of binary-based biometric technologies and automatic gender recognition (AGR), which rely on outmoded understandings of gender as static, measurable, and physiological. Our ethnographic data demonstrate how trans and non-binary bodies are forced to bend to these systems; meanwhile these technologies and algorithms increasingly extract data on trans and non-binary users, which may then be used as challenge sets to refine their accuracy.","",""

By employing cluster criticism analysis of the Korean health authorities' official reports, I argue that Korean health authorities discursively construct their ICT-based tracking infrastructure as democratic technologies of control. They also position Korean citizens as data subjects entitled to the right to know about vitality and caring subjects responsible for the vitality of others through their provision of data, an exchange which this paper terms as vital dataveillance.

The findings suggest that the app users felt empowered via self-tracking capacity and expressed community-level care and concerns, including those regarding the marginalized. At the same time, the users were raising doubts over technical effectiveness, navigating varying levels of voluntary choice available, and negotiating privacy concerns depending on the (dis)trust they held of institutional entities behind the governance of the apps.

"2022","COVID-19 surveillance in Israeli press: Spatiality, mobility, and control"," In March 2020, Israel passed emergency regulations authorizing its internal security agency to track citizens’ mobile phone geolocations in order to tackle the spread of COVID-19. This unprecedented surveillance enterprise attracted extensive media attention and sparked a vigorous public debate regarding technology and democratic values such as privacy, mobility, and control. This article examines press coverage of Israel’s surveillance of its citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic by four leading news sites to identify and map the frames that informed their reports. Based on a thematic analysis, our findings point to supportive and critical constructions of mobile phone location-tracking and organize them within two scapes: personal; and international. These attest to the collective imagining of intimacies and public life, respectively. We draw on the case study to articulate mobile phones as devices that reduce movement into manageable mapped information and individuals into controllable data. Mobile phone location-tracking during the COVID-19 pandemic is understood as turning mobility into order and control. ","",""
"2023","Promoting Honesty in Children, or Fostering Pathological Behaviour?","Introduction Many years ago, the moral fable of Pinocchio warned children about the evils of lying (Perella). This article explores how children are learning lie-related insights from genres of currently marketed polygraph-style “spy kits”, voice stress analysis apps, and electric shock-delivering games. These artifacts are emerging despite the fact that polygraphy and other lie detection approaches are restricted in use in certain business and community contexts, in part because of their dubious scientific support. However, lie detection devices are still applied in many real-life settings, often in critically important security, customs, and employment arenas (Bunn). A commonly accepted definition of the term “lie” is “a successful or unsuccessful deliberate attempt, without forewarning, to create in another a belief which the communicator considers to be untrue” (Vrij 15), which includes the use of lies in various gaming situations. Many children’s games involve some kind of deception, and mental privacy considerations are important in many social contexts (such as “keeping a poker face”). The dystopian scenario of children learning basic honesty notions through technologically-enabled lie detection games scripted by corporate developers presents frightening prospects. These lie detection toys and games impart important moral perspectives through technological and algorithmic means (including electrical shocks and online shaming) rather than through human modelling and teaching. They normalise and lessen the seriousness of lying by reducing it into a game. In this article I focus on United States and United Kingdom toys and games, but comparable lie detection approaches have permeated other nations and cultures. Alder characterises the US as having an “obsession” with lie detection devices (1), an enthusiasm increasingly shared with other nations. Playing with the Truth: Spy Kits, Voice Stress Apps, and Shocking Liar The often-frightening image of an individual strapped to sensors and hooked up to a polygraph is often found in movies, television shows, and social media (Littlefield). I construe the notion of “lie detection” as “the use of a physiological measurement apparatus with the explicit aim of identifying when someone is lying. This typically comes with specific protocols for questioning the subject, and the output is graphically represented” (Bergers 1). Some lie detection toys utilise autonomic or unintentionally-supplied input in their analyses (such as the vocal changes related to stress); with networked toys, the data can subsequently be utilised by third parties. These aspects raise questions concerning consent as well as the validity of the results. Developers are producing related artifacts that challenge the difference between truth and lies, such as robots that “lie” by giving children responses to questions based on the children’s analysed preferences rather than standard determinations of truth and falsity (Zhu). Early lie detection games for children include the 1961 Lie Detecto from Manning Manufacturing. The technologies involved are galvanometers that required a 9-volt battery to operate, and sensors strapped to the hands of the subjects. It was reportedly designed “for junior G-men”, with suggested test questions for subjects such as """"Do you like school?"""" Its ratings included """"Could Be"""" and """"Big Whopper"""" (“TIME’s New Products”). Lie detection had also been projected as fertile ground for children’s own educational research ventures. For example, in 2016 the popular magazine Scientific American outlined how young people could conduct experiments as to whether cognitive load (such as working on complex puzzles) affects the subject’s galvanic input to lie detection devices (Science Buddies). However, the Science Buddies’ description of the proposed activity did not encourage children to question the validity of the device itself. In organisational and agency settings, polygraph-style strategies are generally labour-intensive, involving experts who set up and administer tests (Bunn). These resource-intensive aspects of polygraphs may make their use in games attractive to players who want theatrical scripts to act out particular roles. An example of a lie detection toy that models the polygraph is the currently marketed Discovery Kids’ Electronic Lie Detection Portable Spy Kit, in which children go through the procedures of attaching the polygraph’s sensors to a human subject (Granich). The roles of “spy” and “detective” are familiar ones in many children’s books and movies, so the artifacts involved fit readily into children’s narratives. However, the overall societal importance of what they are modelling may still be beyond children’s grasps. Users of the comparable spy kit Project MC2 are given the following characterisation of their lie detection device, designed for individuals aged 6 and older:  When someone lies, his or her body often produces small reactions from being nervous or stressed. One of those reactions is a small release of sweat. That moisture increases the skin’s electrical conductivity, or galvanic skin response, and the lie detector reads it as a fib. That's why the lie detector’s clips go on the fingers, because there are lots of sweat glands in your hands. Product includes: Lie detector, disguised as a mint box with a hidden button to force a truth or lie. Equipped with indicator light and sounds. Neon-colored wires with finger clips. (“Project MC2”)  Similar sorts of lie detection approaches (though more sophisticated) are currently being used in US military operations. For example, the US Army’s Preliminary Credibility Assessment Screening Systems (PCASS) are handheld polygraphs designed for use in battle. Voice stress analysis systems for lie detection have been used for decades in business as well as medical and crime contexts. As described by Price, the US toy maker Hasbro distributes The Lie Detector Game, which “uses voice analysis to determine whether someone is lying”. In the box you’ll get a lie detector device and 64 cards with questions to answer as part of the gameplay … . If you tell the truth, or the device at least thinks you did, then you score a point. Lying loses you a point” (1). An assortment of smartphone apps with voice-stress analysis capabilities designed for lie detection are also widely available along with suggestions for their use in games (McQuarrie), providing yet another way for children to explore truth and deception in technologically-framed contexts. Lie detection devices for entertainment generally construe at least one of the participants in the toy’s or game’s operations as a “subject”. The Shocking Liar game openly entices users to construct the human game players as “victims”:  The SHOCKING LIAR [sic] is a table top device that you strap your victim's hand to, delivering a small electric shock when it thinks a lie is being told… The lie detector evaluates the data and stores the information after each question giving an accumulation of data on the person being questioned. This means the more questions that you ask, the more information the lie detector has to evaluate... Place your hand onto the hand plate of the SHOCKING LIAR. If you tell the truth, you can move away from it safely and if you tell a direct lie or have given an unacceptable amount of half-truths, you will receive an electric shock.  Children who use Shocking Liar are indeed led to assume that they can catch themselves or friends in dishonesty, but research justification for the Shocking Liar’s results is not available. The societal messages imparted by the toys to children (such as “this toy can determine whether you are lying”) make their impacts especially consequential. These toys and games extract from the subjects’ data various aspects of which the subjects may not have conscious control or even awareness. For instance, the pitch of the subject’s voice can be mined and subsequently given voice stress analysis, as in the previously described Hasbro game. From this “shadow” or autonomic input is developed an interpretation (however problematic) of the subjects’ mental state. The results of the analysis may eventually be processed consciously by subjects, either as polygraph readings or electrical shocks (as in Shocking Liar). The autonomic input involved is often known as “leakage” or “tells” (Ekman). Game playing with robots presents new lie detection venues. Children often react differently in robot-mediated interactions to truth and deception issues than they do with human beings (Pearson). Since the opportunities for child-robot interaction are increasing with the advent of companion robots, new contexts for lie detection games are emerging. Robots that present verbal feedback to children based on the child’s preferences over time, or that strategically withhold information, are being developed and marketed. Research on children’s responses to robots may provide clues as to how to make cognitive engineering and mental privacy invasions more acceptable. This raises serious concerns about children’s perceptions of the standings of robots as moral guides as well as gaming companions. For younger children who are just acquiring the notion of lying, the toys and games could extend the kinds of socialisation provided by their parents and guardians. As lie detection initiatives are taking on wide roles in everyday human interaction (such as educational cheating and employee credibility assessment), the integration of the approaches into children’s activities may serve to normalise the processes involved. Older children who already have some sense of what lying constitutes may find in the lie detection toys and games some insights as to how to become more effective as liars. Some parents may use these lie-detection toys in misguided attempts to determine whether their children are lying to them about something. Many toys and games are explicit in their lie detection and surveillance themes, with specific narratives relating to the societal roles of detectives and spies. Children become complicit in the societal functions of lie detection, rather than simply being subjects or audiences to them. Children’s toys and games are all about experimentation, and these lie detection artifacts are no different (Oravec 2000). Children are enabled through interactions with the toys and games to experiment with lying behavior and possibly explore certain aspects of their own mental lives as well as those of others. Children can learn how to modulate some of the external physiological signals that are often associated with lying, much in the way that individuals can alter various physiological responses with assistance of biofeedback technologies. Such efforts may be empowering in some senses but also increase the potential for confusion about truthfulness and lying. Use of the toys and games may support the emergence of psychopathic tendencies in which children exhibit antisocial and egocentric behavior along with a failure to learn about the consequences of their actions, in this case lying (Hermann). This situation is comparable to that of organisations that advertise training for how to “beat” or “outsmart” polygraphs, efforts that have often confounded law enforcement and intelligence agencies (Rosky).  Playing with the Truth: Children and Honesty The constructions of lie detection events that are fostered in these toys and games generally simplify and mechanise truth-lie differences, and often present them in an unquestioning manner. Children are not encouraged to wonder whether the devices are indeed functioning as stated in the instructions and advertising materials. Failure to inform children about the toys’ intents and to request their consent about lie detection could also challenge some of them to attempt to subvert the toys’ mechanisms. However, many lie detection toys and games provide the opportunity for historically grounded lessons for children about the detection and surveillance strategies of other eras, if introduced in a critical and context-sensitive manner. The assumption that effective lie detection is possible and mental privacy is thus limited is reinforced by the framings of many of these toys and games (Oravec “Emergence”). Lying is indeed a reflection of “Theory of Mind” which enables us to imagine the minds of others, and children are given an arena for exploration on this theme. However, children also learn that their mental worlds and streams of consciousness are readily accessible by others with the use of certain technologies. Scientific justification for the use of polygraphs through the past decades has yielded problematic results, although polygraphs and many other lie detection technologies have still retained social acceptability apparently related to their cultural appeal (Paul, Fischer, and Voigt). Many voice stress apps are also not reliable according to recent research (Tyrsina). The normalisation of current and projected systems for lie detection and mental privacy incursions presents unsettling prospects for children’s development, and the designers and disseminators of toys and games need to consider these dimensions. Using technologically enhanced games, toys, or robots to detect “lies” rather than engaging more directly with other humans in a game context may have unfortunate overall outcomes. For example, the ability to practice various schemes to evade detection while lying may be an attractive aspect of these toys and games to some individuals. The kinds of input often linked with lying behaviors (or “leakage”) can include physiological changes in voice qualities that are generally not directly controllable by the speaker without specific practice; the games and toys provide such practice venues. Individuals who are able to disconnect from their autonomic expressions and lie without physical or acoustic signs can exacerbate personality issues and social pathologies. Some may become psychopaths, who lie to get their way and tend not to feel remorseful, with the games and toys potentially exacerbating genetic tendencies; others may become pathological liars, who lie regardless of whether there is specific benefit to them in doing so (Vrij). Some of these toy-related spying and detective activities can unfortunately be at the expense of others’ wellbeing, whatever their impacts on the children directly involved as players. For example, some forms of lie detection technologies incorporate the remote collection of data without notification of participants, as in the voice-analysis systems just described. Children’s curiosity about others’ thoughts and mental lives may be at the root of such initiatives, though children can also utilise them for bullying and other forms of aggressive behavior. Some research shows that early lie telling by children is often linked with self-defense as they attempt to save face, but other research couples it with anti-social action and behavioral problems (Lavoie). However, adults have been shown to have some considerable influence on children in their lie-telling conduct (Dykstra, Willoughby, and Evans), so there is hope that parents, guardians, teachers, and concerned community members can have some positive influence. Reflections and Conclusions: The “New Pinocchio”? Toys and games can indeed project comforting and nurturing imageries for children. However, they can also challenge individuals to think differently about themselves and others, and even present dystopian scenarios. For toy and game developers to promote lie detection technologies can be problematic because of the associations of lying with antisocial activity and behavioral problems as well as moral concerns. The characters that children play in roles of spies and lie detector administrators supply them with powerful narratives and impact on their mental concepts. The significance of truth-telling in children’s lives is expanding as societal attention to credibility issues increases. For example, children are often called on to present evidence during divorce proceedings and abuse-related cases, so there is a significant body of research about children’s verbal truth and deception patterns (Talwar, Lavoie, and Crossman). The data collected by some networked lie detection toys (such as voice stress analysers) can subsequently be used by third-parties for marketing purposes or direct surveillance, raising critical questions about consent (Oravec “Emergence”). Future entertainment modes may soon be developed with lie detection approaches comparable to the ones I discuss in this article, since many games rely on some form of mental privacy assumptions. Games often have some aspect of personal cognitive control at their roots, with the assumption that individuals can shield their own deliberations from other players at least to some extent. Technological capabilities for lie detection can alter the kinds of strategies involved in games. For example, if players know the quality of other players’ poker hands through technological means, games would need to be restructured substantially, with speed of response or other aspects at a premium. The current and future toy and game developments just discussed underscore the continuing need for ethical and professional vigilance on the part of researchers and developers as they choose projects to work on and technologies to bring to market. Children and young people who play with lie detection and surveillance-related artifacts are being exposed to assumptions about how their own consciousness functions and how they can best navigate in the world through truth-telling or lying. Although children once acquired insights about lying though moral fables like Pinocchio, they are now learning from corporate-developed technological toys and games.

One of the most important features of the law is its regulation of sensitive personal information processing. This article examines how Chinese legal frameworks treat sensitive personal information and analyzes how the Personal Information Protection Law protects sensitive personal information by creating general rules for personal information processing and specific rules for sensitive information. This article also analyzes three obstacles to sensitive personal information protection: context sensitivity, the influence of widespread use of digital technologies, and the balance among various interests. In response, this article proposes three solutions: (1) a contextual strategy for risk governance, including contextual risk analysis and resilience; (2) algorithm compliance, including the algorithmic impact assessment and algorithmic supervision; and (3) a two-step test for balancing various interests.","",""

Coinciding with Vietnam’s rollout of chip-based national identification cards for citizens over the age of 14, the development of a one-stop ‘super-app’ solution that streamlines data flows across different domains of authority happened in a context where platforms were increasingly discussed alongside, and understood on the same terms as, infrastructure. By conducting situational analysis of publicly available policy documents and official government communication, the paper traces how pandemic platforms contract and expand in response to evolving pandemic management needs, and gives an account of the evolution of institutional dependency across different domains of authority and technology development. Using Vietnam as a case study, this paper contributes to ongoing theorisation at the intersection of platformisation and infrastructuralisation in pandemic social service provision. The paper is an invitation to examine the increasing entanglements of technology and citizenship performances around the world as they unfold throughout the course of the pandemic and beyond.","",""

Facial emotion recognition is a particularly ambitious form of facial analysis – an automated process in which faces are sorted amongst sets of categories – which has recently drawn criticism. The ways in which basic attributes of facial expression and emotion contradict the foundational assumptions of automated emotion recognition highlight larger conceptual problems with attempts to subject complex human phenomena to automated analysis.","",""
"2023","Correcting overconfidence in online privacy: experimenting with an educational game","ABSTRACT Widespread use of the Internet means that online privacy, or how to protect one’s private information while engaging in online activity, has become a concern for many individuals. Research has investigated people’s online privacy experience, including online privacy attitudes, confidence, and behaviors. However, not much attention has been paid to how online privacy confidence could be misperceived and how educational tools can correct such overconfidence. Guided by the protection motivation theory, this research examines online privacy confidence and is composed of two studies: Study 1 reveals that online users misrepresent their online knowledge and may have overconfidence as a result. Inspired by this finding and previous research, Study 2 avoids self-reported measures of online knowledge and instead directly evaluates online privacy knowledge (using OPLIS) and its impact on online privacy confidence. Using a survey experiment, we find playing an online privacy educational game increases confidence overall and, importantly, corrects overconfidence. Despite this, we do not find any evidence that correction leads to increased information-seeking. The findings shed light on what online users themselves and organizations, such as universities, industry, and government agencies, can do to better educate individuals about online privacy while calling attention to the need for continued research regarding the underlying mechanisms and downstream behavioral consequences.","",""
"2023","Problems with surveillance capitalism and possible alternatives for IT infrastructure","ABSTRACT Over the past two decades, the business model of surveillance capitalism has emerged in the IT industry. This model has turned out to be highly profitable, but, if left unchecked, will very likely undermine the foundations of liberal democracies and quality of life on this planet. It involves customized advertising and behavior manipulation, powered by intensive gathering and cross-correlation of personal information. There are significant indirect costs of this model, including loss of privacy, supporting surveillance by both the state and corporations, undermining the democratic process, other kinds of automated attempts of behavior manipulation, and excessive consumerism with its attendant environmental costs. Turning to what could be done, we propose a co-development of regulation and technology, as well as the key roles that can be played by citizens and civil society organizations. The regulatory measures are intended to safeguard privacy, require true informed consent, and to foster interoperability (even among rival firms, nonprofit organizations, and others). We also identify key enabling technologies, including open source, APIs to support interoperability and portability, encryption, and peer-to-peer systems. Finally, we discuss the crucial role of ownership structures for these IT services and argue for an ecosystem approach as a counter narrative to surveillance capitalism.","",""

In most countries, however, their uptake has been too low to realize their full potential. This study contributes to the understanding of CTA adoption by investigating the influence of public perceptions on adoption and the role of media in forming these perceptions in Singapore and Switzerland. In a comparative approach, online surveys in both countries (Singapore: N = 998; Switzerland: N = 1,022) and multigroup structural equation modeling reveal national differences. First, attention to media was associated more strongly with app-related perceptions in Singapore than in Switzerland, with news media attention correlating positively with favorable perceptions in both countries (i.e., perceived usefulness of the CTA, perceived social norms of adoption) and social media attention correlating negatively with these perceptions in Singapore. Second, regarding the influence of these perceptions on CTA adoption, perceived usefulness was associated with CTA adoption in Switzerland but not in Singapore; conversely, perceived social norms were more important in Singapore than in Switzerland. These results suggest that the communicative formation of public perceptions and their behavioral relevance are contingent on media systems (authoritarian vs. democratic media system) and cultural values (collectivism vs. individualism), highlighting the theoretical value of a country-comparative approach and the practical need for a culturally sensitive implementation of health technologies.","",""
"2023","Understanding the effects of conceptual and analytical choices on ‘finding’ the privacy paradox: A specification curve analysis of large-scale survey data","ABSTRACT The privacy paradox suggests that privacy concerns do not relate to privacy-related behavior. Although it has inspired numerous studies, findings remain inconclusive. Some of the inconsistencies in published findings may be explained by a strong heterogeneity in the conceptual and analytical choices that researchers implement when investigating the privacy paradox. Based on representative survey data of the 27 EU member states (2011: n = 8,962; 2015: n = 10,526; 2019: n = 11,428), I investigated the effect of conceptual and analytical decisions on ‘finding’ the privacy paradox. Specification curve analyses revealed that the magnitude and statistical significance of the relationship between privacy concerns and information disclosure is contingent on the operationalization of the independent variable, the inclusion of covariates, and the age of the studied population. The relationship between online privacy concerns and using social media privacy settings, in contrast, was less influenced by analytical decisions. Yet, the relationship was stronger in younger people and increased over time. The findings call for more transparency in analyzing research data. Evaluating the implications of analytical choices will help to establish best practices and advance cumulative knowledge creation in privacy research.","",""
"2023","Fair privacy: how college students perceive fair privacy protection in online datasets","ABSTRACT With the wide use of social media and other online services, people are getting more concerned about online privacy. Social media platforms and other online companies are collecting users’ information for various purposes, including targeted advertising. While these data are anonymous, it is possible to identify people through publicly available information and machine learning algorithms. Members of some groups are more vulnerable to such privacy attacks and more likely to be identified. This raises a concern regarding the fair or equitable protection of online privacy, or the protection of all online users’ instead of most users’ private information. This research addresses this relatively new topic from the sociological perspective and focuses on fair privacy protection in online datasets. Questionnaire data show that college students rate the current privacy protection in online datasets low, but they have great support for general privacy protection and greater support for fair privacy protection. Factors that affect their support for general and fair privacy protection include prior cautious online behavior and how essential they rate company practice and government policies that ensure fair privacy. When they perceive a lack of fair privacy in online datasets, most of them would reduce or stop using certain online services. Factors affecting such reactions include prior cautious online behavior, hours on social media, the perception of being included in online datasets, and perceived importance of fair privacy policies. The findings highlight the pivotal role of institutional privacy measures, namely fair privacy company practice and government policies, especially the latter.","",""
"2023","QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE ON CHILLING EFFECTS—HOW USERS’ IMAGINARIES OF DATAVEILLANCE LEAD TO INHIBITED DIGITAL BEHAVIOR","Our everyday life has become highly digitized, and all our online actions leave digital data traces that are automatically collected, aggregated, and analyzed. Emerging research shows that this dataveillance can lead to chilling effects on mundane and legitimate information and communication behaviors. However, the extent to which a sense of dataveillance deters individuals from freely engaging in legitimate digital behaviors remains empirically understudied. Therefore, we ask: How do internet users imagine dataveillance? And how does this perception lead to people limiting their digital behavior?  To address these questions, we conduct qualitative semi-structured interviews with 15 individuals. Our results contribute to a better understanding of people’s imaginaries of dataveillance, as well as sources for these perceptions and reactions towards them in terms of chilled digital behaviors. We show how imagined sources of dataveillance can range from states to corporate actors and how knowledge about dataveillance can originate in news coverage on data scandals or own experiences. Also, we identify further legitimate, mundane behaviors in other life domains like participating in online dating and buying things online that are affected by a sense of dataveillance and have so far been neglected in research on chilling effects.  These results contribute to an empirically founded understanding of the nature of a sense of dataveillance and resulting chilling effects on digital behavior. They provide the basis for a representative survey and a mobile experience sampling study as part of a mixed-methods research design investigating chilling effects on a population level.  ","",""

Our 21 expert informants from five developed nations offered insight into the machinations of contact tracing from ‘the coal face’ up to executive technical and policy decisions including national CTA development and deployment. We learned that beneath the shiny veneer of an app is the messy certitude of Excel and tech-debt, politics, and mundane organizational technique that worked amidst each other to shape public health. Our approach provides a more nuanced understanding of the interfaces of CTA and digital epidemiology than current App narratives allow.  While a healthy and critical literature on digital app interventions into COVID-19 has developed, there has not been critical consideration of these apps informed by insights from those responsible for designing, implementing, and making use of these digital tools. We redress this research imbalance by considering how user-centric narratives of the platformization of public health can gloss over what situational analysis (Clarke et al., 2016) might better uncover. This paints a more nuanced picture of digital epidemiology than current App narratives provide to address the contingent promises and failures related to these digital technologies.","",""
"2023","RULE BY DEFAULT: A CROSS-PLATFORM ANALYSIS OF PRIVACY SETTINGS","Privacy settings are a critical space of research. Settings are uniquely positioned at the intersection between users and digital platforms and regulation, providing a visible privacy architecture (unlike backend privacy infrastructure and code) as well as an opportunity for users to interact with privacy choices (unlike terms of service and privacy policy documents which offer only all-or-nothing options). This paper examines the structural power relations and hierarchies inherent within privacy settings. We address the conference theme of decolonizing the internet through a comprehensive analysis of privacy controls, a critical site of power for the “new colonising forces in the form of multinational tech giants who are re-fashioning the world in their own image” (#AoIR2022 CFP).  This paper applies a theoretical framework of science &amp; technology studies (STS) to analyze the affordances of social media platforms’ privacy settings. Further, we apply Ian Bogost’s theory of procedural rhetoric to examine how platforms apply “the art of using processes persuasively” (Bogost, 2007). We conduct a comparison study of privacy settings across the most popular social media platforms: Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, WeChat, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, Pintrest, Twitter, and Reddit. The purpose of this qualitative analysis is to examine how privacy is presented to users. How does each platform define privacy? Where do they locate different kinds of privacy settings? What kinds of privacy choices are offered? How do these choices differ? How a platform designs their choice architecture for privacy shapes a user’s understanding of what privacy is and means.","",""

Initially a code-sharing platform, GitHub has become in recent years a major recruitment site. In that environment, a valuable potential worker is one who knows how to extract and make the most of users’ personal information. At the same time, in an open source platform, “privacy” maintains its romantic allure as a worthwhile endeavor. How do developers manage this tension? And what may its negotiation imply for the production of privacy? Analyzing the 2025 GitHub bios in which developers use the word “privacy,” we explore two articulations of privacy in developers’ self-presentation: privacy as a profession, and privacy as a passion.","",""
"2023","ANTECEDENTS OF PRIVACY PROTECTION BEHAVIORS AT THE VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL LEVELS","Internet users face privacy threats when using online services. Privacy protection behaviors, such as adjusting privacy settings, can alleviate some of these threats. Research shows that individuals’ privacy protection behaviors (PPBs) depend on their socio-demographics characteristics, digital engagement, privacy concerns, and online privacy literacy (OPL). In addition, it has been suggested that due to the complexity of privacy issues online, an adequate level of OPL is required to translate privacy concerns into protective actions. Although previous research examined the antecedents of PPBs at a general level, it has rarely made a clear distinction and comparison between PPBs aimed toward the practices of institutions (vertical level) and those aimed toward other internet users (horizontal level). This is somewhat surprising given that many scholars underscored the importance of context in online privacy-related matters. Therefore, this study compared the antecedents of PPBs at the general, vertical, and horizontal levels. To this end, we tested three models to examine how socio-demographic characteristics, digital engagement, privacy concerns, and OPL influence PPBs at the general, vertical, and horizontal levels, and assessed whether OPL moderates the relationship between privacy concerns and PPBs at different levels. The models were tested using linear regression on a nation-wide sample of 1,015 internet users aged 18+ from Slovenia. The analysis revealed important differences between the levels in case of gender, age, and privacy concerns, but not OPL.","",""

Prior work has found that educators recognize this need for privacy lessons but do not always feel equipped to teach them. Indeed, the term “privacy” has many meanings and the concept of privacy does not easily fit in a specific subject, intersecting with social studies, computer science, media literacy, digital literacy, and digital citizenship. Scholars have begun developing frameworks for privacy education, but such efforts will have a higher chance of success if they can be integrated into existing educational standards. Thus, in this study we are analyzing U.S. K-12 educational standards to understand whether and how they address privacy literacy. Our initial analysis has found that 44 of the 50 U.S. states have implemented educational standards related to privacy, largely as part of library, computer science, or social studies. The main privacy-related topics in state standards include being careful about posting information online and managing passwords. These preliminary findings suggest that while privacy is part of many state education standards, there are opportunities to help educators bring a more nuanced approach to privacy into their classrooms.","",""
"2023","WHAT IS PRIVACY LITERACY FOR?","Networked devices, sensors, and the algorithmic processes that power them pervade nearly all facets of daily life. These systems are designed by an elite class of experts and powered by data extracted from populations of people. Many people remain unaware of what data these systems extract and how systems and institutions use data, raising significant questions about privacy. One response to such concerns is to call for educational efforts that increase people’s understanding, or literacy, of digital data flows. Literacy is often regarded as an end in itself, an unquestionably good thing. Yet literacy does not operate autonomously. Teaching someone to understand something does not automatically improve their life. Privacy literacy efforts thus need to be explicit about what they seek to accomplish. In other words, what is privacy literacy for? I argue that privacy literacy efforts should harness education to mobilize people toward changing the technological _and_ social conditions that discipline subjects toward advancing institutional goals. To avoid perpetuating oppressive power dynamics, I advocate that privacy literacy efforts embody a critical pedagogy where teachers and students learn from each other about what privacy means, how data-driven systems do and don’t afford privacy, and what needs to change to create worlds where people can flourish. I also recommend that privacy literacy efforts align with social movements whose visions identify paths away from extraction and toward relations that respect the inherent humanity of data.","",""

Thus much of the responsibility for the users’ personal information is in the hands of the developers and the code that they author. This research adopts a materialist perspective to study developers’ discourse around the privacy solutions they embed in the code. Defining GitHub as a discursive platform, we draw on a sample of almost 60,000 README files to analyze the ways in which developers present code to other developers. We find that the files promote two approaches, privacy-by-policy and privacy-by-design. We suggest that the distinction between the two is in fact a distinction between developers who uphold privacy as a value and developers who regard it as an imposition to comply with.","",""
"2023","Artificial intelligence-related anomies and predictive policing: normative (dis)orders in liberal democracies","AbstractThis article links three rarely considered dimensions related to the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies in the form of predictive policing and discusses them in relation to liberal democratic societies. The three dimensions are the theoretical embedding and the workings of AI within anomic conditions (1), potential normative disorders emerging from them in the form of thinking errors and discriminatory practices (2) as well as the consequences of these disorders on the psychosocial, and emotional level (3). Against this background, AI-induced anomie is conceptualized as a field of tension that refers to a systematic deterioration of democratic norms that are supposed to create ‘normative orders’, but which, when implemented through AI-supported measures, can reproduce existing discriminations, and establish new kinds of discriminatory relations. In future, these AI-based measures have the potential to lead to opposing normative disorders by emerging in the form of false social norms to an equally false Second Nature. They deprive persons involved of the possibility of individual appropriation of social norms and the specific emotional development associated with it.","",""
"2023","The Polyopticon: a diagram for urban artificial intelligences","AbstractSmart city discourses often invoke the Panopticon, a disciplinary architecture designed by Jeremy Bentham and popularly theorized by Michel Foucault, as a model for understanding the social impact of AI technologies. This framing focuses attention almost exclusively on the negative ramifications of Urban AI, correlating ubiquitous surveillance, centralization, and data consolidation with AI development, and positioning technologies themselves as the driving factor shaping privacy, sociality, equity, access, and autonomy in the city. This paper describes an alternative diagram for Urban AI—the Polyopticon: a distributed, polyvalent, multi-modal network of synthetic intelligences. It posits that fourth industrial revolution technologies change the political, social, and psychodynamic relationships of sentience and witness in the city, shifting the effects of watching and watched beyond the exclusive domain of top-down surveillance and discipline. The Polyopticon poses a more expansive and ambivalent spectrum of possibilities for Urban AI scenarios, one that undermines the totalizing, singular, and cerebral notion of intelligence that so often characterizes Urban AI and smart city critiques.","",""

"2023","We have to talk about emotional AI and crime","AbstractEmotional AI is an emerging technology used to make probabilistic predictions about the emotional states of people using data sources, such as facial (micro)-movements, body language, vocal tone or the choice of words. The performance of such systems is heavily debated and so are the underlying scientific methods that serve as the basis for many such technologies. In this article I will engage with this new technology, and with the debates and literature that surround it. Working at the intersection of criminology, policing, surveillance and the study of emotional AI this paper explores and offers a framework of understanding the various issues that these technologies present particularly to liberal democracies. I argue that these technologies should not be deployed within public spaces because there is only a very weak evidence-base as to their effectiveness in a policing and security context, and even more importantly represent a major intrusion to people’s private lives and also represent a worrying extension of policing power because of the possibility that intentions and attitudes may be inferred. Further to this, the danger in the use of such invasive surveillance for the purpose of policing and crime prevention in urban spaces is that it potentially leads to a highly regulated and control-oriented society. I argue that emotion recognition has severe impacts on the right to the city by not only undertaking surveillance of existing situations but also making inferences and probabilistic predictions about future events as well as emotions and intentions.","",""
"2023","Modeling COVID-19 with big mobility data: Surveillance and reaffirming the people in the data"," To better understand the COVID-19 pandemic, public health researchers turned to “big mobility data”—location data collected from mobile devices by companies engaged in surveillance capitalism. Publishing formerly private big mobility datasets, firms trumpeted their efforts to “fight” COVID-19 and researchers highlighted the potential of big mobility data to improve infectious disease models tracking the pandemic. However, these collaborations are defined by asymmetries in information, access, and power. The release of data is characterized by a lack of obligation on the part of the data provider towards public health goals, particularly those committed to a community-based, participatory model. There is a lack of appropriate reciprocities between data company, data subject, researcher, and community. People are de-centered, surveillance is de-linked from action while the agendas of public health and surveillance capitalism grow closer. This article argues that the current use of big mobility data in the COVID-19 pandemic represents a poor approach with respect to community and person-centered frameworks. ","",""
"2023","The after party: Cynical resignation in Adtech's pivot to privacy"," Digital advertising and technology companies are resigned to a new privacy imperative. They are bracing for a world where third-party tracking will be restricted by design or by law. Digital resignation typically refers to how companies cultivate a sense of powerlessness about privacy among internet users. Our paper looks through this optic from the other end of the lens: How is the digital advertising industry coping with the increasing salience of privacy? Recent developments have forced companies to implement “privacy-preserving” designs—or at least promise some semblance of privacy. Yet, the industry remains dependent on flows of data and means of identification to enable still-desired targeting, measurement, and optimization. Our paper analyzes this contradiction by looking at systems that aim to replicate existing functionalities while protecting user “privacy.” We call this a form of “cynical resignation” and characterize its key maneuvers as follows: (a) sanitizing surveillance; (b) party-hopping; and (c) sabotage. We argue that this “cynical resignation” to a privacy imperative represents a policy failure. In the absence of decisive interventions into the underlying business models of data capitalism, companies offer techno-solutionism and self-regulations that seem to conform to new laws and norms while reinforcing commitments to data-driven personalization. This may benefit the largest tech companies, since their privileged access to first-party data will make more companies reliant on them, and their computational power will be even more valuable in a world where modeling is used to compensate for the loss of third-party data and traditional methods of personal identification.

Prediction is a ‘relational grammar’ that governs this allocation of discretion: the everyday ability to define one's situation. This extractive dynamic extends a long historical pattern, in which new methods for producing knowledge entail a redistribution of decision-making power. I focus on two contemporary domains: (1) crime and policing are emblematic of how predictive systems are extractive by design, with pre-existing interests governing what is measured and what persistently goes unmeasured. (2) The prediction of productivity demonstrates the long tradition of extracting discretion as a means to extract labour power. Time after time, making human behaviour more predictable for the client of prediction (the manager, the police officer) often means making life and work more unpredictable for the target of prediction (the employee, the urban citizen).

"2023","Commercial genetic information and criminal investigations: The case for social privacy"," Taking a DNA test with a commercial company is an increasingly popular enterprise, with tens of millions of consumers worldwide. In recent years, these genetic databases have also been used for so-called investigative genetic genealogy (IGG): uploading a crime scene DNA sample in these databases to find a distant relative of the unknown suspect. This forensic use of genetic consumer information has already helped solve many crimes. The debate on IGG tends to focus on individual rights and values, such as individual consent, individual control over information, and – perhaps most prominently – individual privacy. In this paper, I propose to approach IGG through the lens of privacy's social value, in contrast to merely its individual value. First, I discuss the conceptualization of privacy as a social value. Next, I explore several issues of IGG that privacy's social value allows consideration for: the informational and decisional interconnectedness, the risk of a tyranny of the minority, the involvement of multiple contexts, and the relationship between citizens and state. I conclude that this approach offers a fruitful perspective to evaluate the ethical and social desirability of IGG, evading the simplified dichotomy between individual privacy versus the security of society, in which the former will almost automatically lose. A focus on privacy's social value recognizes the effects for society on both sides of the balance. It brings into the light fundamental ethical, social, and political concerns of IGG, that extend beyond individual data control or consent. ","",""
"2023","Predictive privacy: Collective data protection in the context of artificial intelligence and big data"," Big data and artificial intelligence pose a new challenge for data protection as these techniques allow predictions to be made about third parties based on the anonymous data of many people. Examples of predicted information include purchasing power, gender, age, health, sexual orientation, ethnicity, etc. The basis for such applications of “predictive analytics” is the comparison between behavioral data (e.g. usage, tracking, or activity data) of the individual in question and the potentially anonymously processed data of many others using machine learning models or simpler statistical methods. The article starts by noting that predictive analytics has a significant potential to be abused, which manifests itself in the form of social inequality, discrimination, and exclusion. These potentials are not regulated by current data protection law in the EU; indeed, the use of anonymized mass data takes place in a largely unregulated space. Under the term “predictive privacy,” a data protection approach is presented that counters the risks of abuse of predictive analytics. A person's predictive privacy is violated when personal information about them is predicted without their knowledge and against their will based on the data of many other people. Predictive privacy is then formulated as a protected good and improvements to data protection with regard to the regulation of predictive analytics are proposed. Finally, the article points out that the goal of data protection in the context of predictive analytics is the regulation of “prediction power,” which is a new manifestation of informational power asymmetry between platform companies and society.

Many of the important impacts of this project of creating larger and more integrated systems of ‘behavioural surplus’ are captured powerfully by Zuboff; yet as different risk and organisational scholars such as Beck, Perrow, and Vaughan have argued, integrated systems often do not function as intended. While the imperfection of these systems may raise the possibility that surveillance capitalism may not be as bad as Zuboff suggests, there is also a way in which these systems not functioning as intended can make surveillance capitalism an even more dystopian possibility. In this vein, this paper asks: what are the consequences when the tools of a surveillance capitalist society break down? This paper argues that it is by thinking through Zuboff's framework that we can identify the systemic fragility of a surveillance capitalist society. This systemic fragility emerges through how surveillance capitalism generates imperatives towards the maximal collection of data for exploitation, which in turn generates a corresponding imperative to connect all aspects of life. Both of these imperatives, of collect and connect, in turn create an immensely fragile digital system, which has vast ramifications throughout social life, such that small imperfections and gaps in the system can magnify risk throughout society.

Building on surveillance studies and feminist scholarship, we analyze 22 interviews with pro- and anti-abortion activists and pro-encryption activists to answer: How will encrypted messaging apps be relevant for pro- and anti-abortion activists post- Roe? We find that while encrypted messaging apps are used by activists on either side of the abortion debate, their motivations for use range from mere convenience to supplanting state and corporate surveillance. We thus argue that encryption can act as a feminist tool to usurp patriarchal surveillance but must be used in combination with a holistic privacy framework. This framework may include care-motivated, community-centered, relational surveillance. ","",""
"2023","‘I started seeing shadows everywhere’: The diverse chilling effects of surveillance in Zimbabwe"," Recent years have witnessed growing ubiquity and potency of state surveillance measures with heightened implications for human rights and social justice. While impacts of surveillance are routinely framed through ‘privacy’ narratives, emphasising ‘chilling effects’ surfaces a more complex range of harms and rights implications for those who are, or believe they are, subjected to surveillance. Although first emphasised during the McCarthy era, surveillance ‘chilling effects’ remain under-researched, particularly in Africa. Drawing on rare interview data from participants subjected to state-sponsored surveillance in Zimbabwe, the paper reveals complex assemblages of state and non-state actors involved in diverse and expansive hybrid online–offline monitoring. While scholarship has recently emphasised the importance of large-scale digital mass surveillance, the Zimbabwean context reveals complex assemblages of ‘big data’, social media and other digital monitoring combining with more traditional human surveillance practices. Such inseparable online–offline imbrications compound the scale, scope and impact of surveillance and invite analyses as an integrated ensemble. The paper evidences how these surveillance activities exert chilling effects that vary in form, scope and intensity, and implicate rights essential to the development of personal identity and effective functioning of participatory democracy. Moreover, the data reveals impacts beyond the individual to the vicarious and collective. These include gendered dimensions, eroded interpersonal trust and the depleted ability of human rights defenders to organise and particulate in democratic processes. Overall, surveillance chilling effects exert a wide spectrum of outcomes which consequently interfere with enjoyment of multiple rights and hold both short- and long-term implications for democratic participation.

We start from the assumption that the velocity of knowledge and action is defined by heterogeneous formations and interactions of various actors, sites, and materials. To analyze these formations and interactions, we introduce and unpack the concept of “data temporality.” Data temporality explicates how the speed of knowledge and action in datafied environments unfolds in close correspondence with (1) variegated social rhythms, (2) technological inscriptions, and (3) the balancing of speed with other priorities. Specifically, we use the notion of data temporality as a heuristic tool to explore the entanglements of data and time within two case studies: Frontex’ Joint Operation Reporting Application and the predictive policing software PRECOBS. The analysis identifies two key themes in the empirical constitution of data temporalities. The first one pertains to the creation of events as reference points for temporally situated knowledge and action. And the second one pertains to timing and actionability, that is, the question of when interventions based on data analysis should be triggered. ","",""

"2023","Beyond Battlefields and Conventional Research Agendas: The Importance of Understanding Surveillance Activities and Practices During Long-Term Armed Conflicts","As the character of war has changed, surveillance studies scholars need to rethink and reimagine the meaning of surveillance activities and practices during long-term armed conflicts. Never-ending wars in Sudan, Yemen, Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Syria, Ethiopia, Colombia, Lebanon, and Somalia are showing us that one characteristic of contemporary conflicts is the increasing duration of violent and non-violent confrontation. Under these current long wars, numerous armed groups—including national armies—gain more from violence itself than from winning, expanding the expected length of the conflict. This is creating new sociocultural conditions for the development of surveillance activities and practices, where battles between armed groups are rather rare and most violence is directed against civilians. I argue that there is an urgent need for the surveillance studies ﬁeld to create novel theoretical and methodological tools to comprehend surveillance activities and practices during long-term armed conflicts. I believe it is crucial to establish a more fluid dialogue with other disciplines, in particular, epistemologies related to the sociology of emotions, the demography of armed conflicts, and the militarization of civilians in contexts of war. This emerging research agenda will help us to fully comprehend the meaning of surveillance where the surveillance agent and the surveillance subject interact for extended periods of time (years or even decades) under new forms of social interaction. In this contribution to the Dialogue section, I present three dimensions of this emerging research agenda. I will be highlighting key theoretical relations and their relevance and addressing the former Colombian armed conflict to illustrate some of their characteristics.","",""

Slums, immigrant colonies, and shanty towns have long been considered hotbeds of crime and illegal activities. These areas are generally marked as unsafe in the popular imagination. I am interested to see how (and if) communities in these spaces modify their behaviour in order to escape the extra watchful presence of the state in the form of CCTV cameras. I also want to see how these spaces evolve in terms of their interaction with other parts of the city as a result of the use of such exacerbated surveillance technologies. This paper is based on ongoing ethnographic work in one such marked area in the North East part of Delhi where video footage from CCTV cameras, along with mobile phone cameras, was extensively used for police investigations (with additional use of a standalone facial recognition program) following deadly riots that killed a record number of people in the area and destroyed many businesses in February 2020.","",""

King Lear critiques such idealized surveilling by conflating it with another, more quotidian and odious surveillance assemblage, the qui-tam system of surveillance-for-profit. This was the most notable, or notorious, feature of surveillance in Shakespeare’s England, and was perceived as having a corrupting influence on politics, economics, and the legal system, its abusive nature in Lear being conceptualized as sexually perverse. The play also stages the intersection of qui-tam surveillance-for-profit with religiously justified forms of surveilling, calling into question the validity of such rationalizations and linking the eroticized, abusive informing with more socially accepted modes of surveilling, including the benevolent oversight of divine justice. This article contributes to surveillance studies by arguing that the erotics of surveillance informs discussions of the relationship between surveillance and capital, of epistemologies and ideologies of surveillance, and of surveillance art, while suggesting that King Lear can enrich our understanding of the complexities of surveilling.","",""

In addition to substantially increasing monitoring coverage, A23 will provide fishers with the option to utilize electronic monitoring (EM) technologies in place of human at-sea observers. Based on twenty-six interviews with representatives of the fishing industry, nongovernmental organizations, regulatory agencies, EM service providers, and other stakeholder groups, this paper examines how the fishery is planning for the adoption of EM. We focus on the differing perspectives on the value of EM as an appropriate tool for protecting the fishery, and as a tool of surveillance that may transform the lives of fishers. We find that while most stakeholders support the use of EM in the future, mistrust within the industry—based on historical regulatory failures, perceived lack of information on technical feasibility, privacy and data ownership issues, and the unknown long-term costs to vessel owners—poses significant barriers to successful adoption of these technologies. We conclude that these barriers can be overcome by investing in co-management driven EM implementations that draw on the expertise of fishers and increase their autonomy over their vessels and their use of data. This study offers critical insights into the conflicting sociotechnical imaginaries that co-produce spaces of surveillance for natural resource management, as well as provides important findings for the fishery as A23 moves into implementation phases.","",""

This extends to surveillance undertaken in crisis contexts and conflict situations, where humanitarian needs commonly arise.

"2023","“They’re Just Watching You All the Time”: The Surveillance Web of Prison Needle Exchange","In 2018, the federal prison authority in Canada began implementing Prison Needle Exchange Programs (PNEPs) at select institutions. Despite longstanding and successful models of prison-based syringe distribution internationally, Canada’s correctional service introduced a highly restrictive security-based approach, placing prisoners who access the program into a surveillance web that implicates diverse actors and relies on methods such as bio-surveillance and security risk assessments. We examine these and other surveillant functions of the PNEP through the first-hand experiences of thirty former prisoners who were incarcerated at one of the prisons with such a program. These experiences point to how the surveillance web is constituted by multiple lines of sight and flows of information across health and security fields. It is further comprised of risk management practices and discretionary punishment carried out by correctional officers as well as the targeting and social sorting of people who use drugs. Former prisoner narratives also demonstrate how the PNEP is reflective of emerging forms of exclusion and processes of securitization that operate through the identification, management, and containment of specific groups. As a whole, the PNEP model implemented in Canada, and the practices that undergird it, target people who use drugs for increased surveillance, resulting in extremely low rates of program enrollment despite pervasive drug use in prison, and undermining access to an essential health care service to which prisoners are entitled. The study findings point to novel forms of carceral surveillance that enmesh observational, technological, and bureaucratic practices, and demonstrate how prisoner health and therapeutic objectives can be subsumed by securitarian logics.","",""
"2023","Creeping Road Traffic Surveillance in Latvia: Social and Legal Implications of Digital Policing Tools","This article critically analyses road traffic surveillance and its social and legal implications, with a focus on the use of digital tools in policing, namely: speed cameras, drones, and a police mobile application in Latvia. Specifically, the article explores: (1) the attributed role of these surveillance tools in terms of caring, preventive, and punitive functions and the potential for function creep and (2) the key challenges these tools pose to fundamental rights and data protection. Thus, it contributes to academic and public debate around the consequences of digital surveillance and embedding democratic governance in policing. The research is based on an exploratory case study that includes analysis of expert interviews, media coverage, the legal framework, and a focus group with traffic participants. We argue that, while the use of these surveillance tools is construed as an example of benevolent and caring surveillance aimed at improving road safety in a preventive manner, it is reliant upon a pronounced punitive dimension that in itself may not be conducive to behavioural change. At the same time, the increasing deployment of all of these tools may lead to function creep and raises challenges for fundamental rights and data protection. While efforts have been made to ensure legitimate use of these tools, not enough attention has been paid to their compliance with data protection requirements. Moreover, there is a need to improve the regulatory framework regarding police use of new surveillance tools, such as drones, which would determine the purposes of such uses and set an obligation to evaluate their effectiveness, impact, and proportionality in order to comply with fundamental rights law and ensure their trustworthy use.","",""
"2023","A Sense of Ambient Entrapment in  Hito Steyerl’s Factory of the Sun","This article proposes the notion of ambient entrapment to conceptualize the affective experience of surveillance in the current age of ubiquitous computing and smart technologies. A sense of ambient entrapment is identified as a vague, yet pervasive feeling of a controlled environment saturated by surveillance and exploitation, where machine perception and algorithmic processes are hard at work. Arguing that artworks are particularly adept at expressing affective experiences and emerging cultural feelings of surveillance, the article offers a reading of German artist Hito Steyerl’s immersive video installation environment Factory of the Sun (2015) to further explore the theoretical argument. Inside the dark installation space, visitors are immersed in a blue LED grid environment and encouraged to recline in beach chairs facing a large screen. What is perceptible as time passes inside Factory of the Sun, the paper argues, is an indefinable yet all-encompassing sense of something working and conditioning in the background, of technologies extracting and exploiting personal data while we, at the same time, desire and feel the lure of said technologies and devices. The article concludes that artworks can make us aware of the often invisible and barely perceptible forces at work in our environments and everyday life and suggests we should turn to contemporary art as sites of knowledge of the affective experience of ambient surveillance.","",""

In doing so, it has fostered a new class of pandemic-related technological solutions, a subset of which utilize artificial intelligence for contact tracing purposes. The People’s Republic of China has not been immune from this rush to implement these novel tools. But there is a darker element to the country’s Alipay Health Code mobile application that extends beyond pandemic preparedness. With ambitions to further incorporate the app into their already vast surveillance apparatus, China is on the precipice of setting a dangerous precedent for pervasive, state-sponsored automated social control. In such a world, we may see health tools co-opted into systems that score individuals on their political fealty. As such, they have the potential to severely undercut democratic ideals by restricting the freedom to dissent necessary to uphold such values. They would do all this under the guise of promoting collective wellbeing.","",""
"2023","Human-First, Please: Assessing Citizen Views and Industrial Ambition for Emotional AI in Recommender Systems","This paper qualitatively explores the views of diverse members of the British public on applications of biometric emotional AI technologies patented by two globally dominant consumer-facing recommender systems, Amazon and Spotify. Examining Amazon and Spotify patents for biometric profiling of users’ emotions, disposition, and behaviour to offer them tailored services, ads, and products from their wider platforms, this paper points to industrial ambition regarding emotional AI. Little is known about ordinary people’s views on deployment of such technology, and given the complex, abstract, and future-facing nature of such technologies, ascertaining informed lay views is hard. We address this through our innovative, qualitative study of diverse British-based adults (n=46) that presents to them near-horizon use cases in an interactive fictional narrative that deploys design fiction principles and ContraVision techniques. We find the themes of “usefulness,” “resignation,” “uneasy terms of engagement,” and “human-first,” adding rich and nuanced insights to prior survey work on users’ views towards biometric-based emotional AI technologies. In contributing to a richer understanding of whether emotional AI technologies should be deployed in consumer-facing recommender systems, and if so, on what terms, we find that well-established policy-friendly criticisms apply to global emotional AI recommender systems. We conclude, however, that problems of alienation and need for a human-first approach to emerging AI technology are the most significant criticisms.","",""
"2023","Civic Intelligence Oversight: Practitioners’ Perspectives in France, Germany, and the UK","In recent years, various revelations about government malfeasances have highlighted the vulnerability of civil society actors who work on surveillance by intelligence agencies. Simultaneously, new technologies and overburdened state oversight bodies clarify how relevant citizen scrutiny of intelligence is. Both of these factors have led to the emergence of scrutiny by civil society actors as a research subject. This paper contributes to such scholarship by presenting data collected through surveys addressed at journalists and professionals from civil society organisations (CSOs) in France, Germany, and the UK to comparatively characterize the forms, scope, and constraints of the scrutiny they perform. Indicated differences across countries highlight variances in the practices of civic intelligence oversight. These variances indicate that there is room to manoeuvre for civic forms of holding intelligence agencies to account, counteracting the primacy of security and the secrecy of intelligence. Yet, similarities of civic oversight practitioners’ perspectives across all three countries are also distinct and informative; in particular, across all three countries, journalists and CSO professionals who work on surveillance by intelligence agencies worry they are under surveillance themselves and express dissatisfaction with safeguards at work.  ","",""

Regardless of prominent (normative) debates on surveillance and security, studies examining individual attitudes and factors explaining them are relatively scarce. While people in general prefer living in a secure environment, I argue that it is not only the imminent trade-off between security concerns and protecting one’s privacy and freedom that ultimately persuades citizens to support surveillance measures. Based on results from a factorial survey experiment with 5,000 respondents, I demonstrate that German citizens are in general willing to accept the introduction of far-reaching surveillance measures, but related financial costs and individual convenience significantly influence such support. Context, in this case whether a security threat is salient, however, has no effect on individual support.","",""

"2023","Returning the Gaze of Surveillance: The Murder of Shireen Abu Aqleh","The murder of Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Aqleh in Jenin refugee camp in May 2022 has generated extensive debate about how she was killed. Israeli authorities claimed that Abu Aqleh was killed by Palestinian gunfire, circulating a video captured by Palestinian fighters from the morning of Abu Aqleh’s death that showed the use of arms within the camp. Yet independent investigations have shown that this video—captured and circulated by Palestinians to document resistance activities—was used, in conjunction with other evidence, to disprove Israeli authorities’ claim. In this paper, I examine the role of the datafication of everyday life, the authority of interpretation, and the importance of counter-data production as a disruptive tactic in the aftermath of Abu Aqleh’s murder. In contemporary conflicts, we can observe how data extracted from our enabling of becoming increasingly archivable subjects are framed and articulated as objective, even neutral, material evidence. In conjunction with the spectacle of political rhetoric and military theatrics, an asymmetric interpretation and subsequent instrumentalization of digital archives obstruct the inclusion of those subjected to harm as interpreters of their own experiences, shaping public perceptions and further exposing oppressed populations to continued violence. To challenge the material effects of these narratives, counter-data are produced to invert and disrupt a largely unilateral authoritative gaze. These interventions not only push against and reappropriate the generation and collection of data but also challenge the authority to access and interpret it. Grounded in critical security studies, post-colonial studies, as well as other critical bodies of work, this paper uses the case of Abu Aqleh’s murder to demonstrate how the surveillance and selective framing of data are used to distort conflict and structure warfare.","",""
"2023","“I Do Love / To Note and to Observe”: The Pleasures of Surveillance and Resistance in the Work of Ben Jonson","Poet, playwright, religious dissident, and collaborator with the state surveillance apparatus: Ben Jonson experienced a long and tortuous relationship with surveilling in late-Tudor/early-Stuart England. The cultures of surveillance he encountered extended beyond espionage to social and religious surveillance, which in early modern England often bled into and facilitated the workings of the state’s network of informants. His literary output and unusually detailed (for the time) biographical information combine to give us a complex picture of his engagement with surveilling, secrecy, and resistance. Jonson’s experience of surveillance involved incarceration and the threat of corporal punishment, but in his writings, he associates surveilling and being surveilled with pleasure in the context of his Humanist education, his conversion to Catholicism at a time when the Protestant English state had outlawed such worship, and his work as a satirist, playwright, and poet. Using Freud’s notion of unheimlich, or the uncanny, I argue that Jonson demystifies surveilling, but approaches his critique from two directions simultaneously: he interrogates and encourages resistance to state violence and coercion while highlighting his own acquiescence to the pleasures of voyeurism and exhibitionism, suggesting that surveilling is seemingly irresistible, as in both overpowering and appealing. Because he centers the uncanny in his writings, Jonson may be a useful guide for those theorizing and navigating the complexities of surveillance. He exemplifies how resistance to asymmetries of power persists through time and despite outward conformity to a regime of surveillance, which itself may be unheimlich.","",""
"2023","Contested Care: COVID-19 Surveillance and Health Data in the Workplace","Within the ongoing disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, technologically mediated health surveillance programs have vastly intensified and expanded to new spaces. Popular understandings of medical and health data protections came into question as a variety of institutions introduced new tools for symptom tracking, contact tracing, and the management of related data. These systems have raised complex questions about who should have access to health information, under what circumstances, and how people and institutions negotiate relationships between privacy, public safety, and care during times of crisis. In this paper, we take up the case of a large public university working to keep campus productive during COVID-19 through practices of placemaking, symptom screeners, and vaccine mandate compliance databases. Drawing on a multi-methods study including thirty-eight interviews, organizational documents, and discursive analysis, we show where and for whom administrative care infrastructures either misrecognized or torqued (Bowker and Star 1999) the care relationships that made life possible for people in the university community. We argue that an analysis of care—including the social relations that enable it and those that attempt to hegemonically define it—opens important questions for how people relate to data they produce about their bodies as well as to the institutions that manage them. Furthermore, we argue that privacy frameworks that rely on individual rights, essential categories of “sensitive information,” or the normative legitimacy of institutional practices are not equipped to reveal how people negotiate privacy and care in times of crisis.","",""

Students and staff are monitored both physically and digitally, using a range of technologies and for a variety of purposes. Many technologies and systems introduced for other reasons (e.g., for resource sharing, communication, or collaborative work) offer additional surveillance capacities, either as designed-in or incidental features. These surveillance practices, whether already realised or present as possibilities, have the potential to profoundly change Higher Education both as a sector and as a process. There is thus a need for those working (and studying) in the sector to recognise and thus have the opportunity to question or resist these changes. This paper describes an attempt to use participatory speculative fiction to enable this recognition and articulation. It illustrates the power of the surveillance imaginaries that emerge from this approach to reveal deep and complex connections between surveillance, anonymity, knowledge, and power.","",""

"2023","The Temporal Dimension of Surveillance","This article places the temporal dimension of surveillance under the spotlight. Surveillance studies examines multiple dimensions of surveillance: Who surveilles whom; what practices are applied; how, where, and why are they executed; and the dynamics, effects, and meanings of various forms of surveillance. Time is too often taken for granted. A given surveillance setting, such as a biometric system, CCTV, or collecting cellular-based location data, comprises several time vectors: the timeline and pace of events where time is a physical fact, technological temporal affordances, government time, legal time, and perhaps others. These separate time vectors often progress at different paces. Thus, the multiplicity of time vectors enables prioritizing them differently, offering different temporal narrations and, perhaps, discursive manipulations. When the government or a regulator explains a surveillance system or a court reviews it, they offer their view of the interaction of the time vectors and frame its temporality. This is the social construction of time. This article proposes a critical temporal analysis of surveillance. Along with identifying temporal aspects of a given surveillance setting, we should search for the temporal elements in the discourse about surveillance. This inquiry may enlighten how a particular surveillance apparatus was justified or rejected. This article illustrates the relevance of critical temporal inquiry for surveillance studies through a case study from Israel, where mass state surveillance was implemented for contact tracing during the COVID-19 pandemic. I examine three Supreme Court cases that scrutinized this apparatus, exposing how the judicial portrayal of the different time vectors affected its legitimacy.","",""
"2023","Staying in the Game: Activation, Vigilance, and Normalization of Emergency Calls in Austria","Influential accounts of vigilance and lateral surveillance assume that the shift from centralized to more dispersed, governmental forms of surveillance is driven by postmodern tendencies towards an almost unlimited proliferation of suspicion and surveillance. In contrast to former research, this analysis of Austrian public discourse on police emergency services highlights attempts to control, limit, and normalize civil vigilance. Drawing from the theoretical frameworks of governmentality studies, the paper shows that emergency services are a paradigmatic field for the analysis of participatory surveillance because they align interventionist police power with people’s security activities. With the proliferation of an activation paradigm in Austrian policing their role shifts significantly. In this paradigm, a double-sided responsibilization and mobilization of citizens and police is propagated. On one side, active vigilance is discursively promoted to link local subjective awareness of anomalies and (dis)order with rapid police response. On the other side, in a phase of intense criticism, emergency services are subject to reconfigurations themselves: preemptive interventions, a normalization of response time, efficiency-oriented reorganization of its structure, and their application for the management of police resources and forces. However, it is shown that vigilance and response are always controlled, for example, by public rejections of particular kinds of hypervigilant activities. Emergency service discourse not only fosters but also limits vigilance. Therefore, normalization of oversteering hypervigilance points to paradoxes of governmental practices of activation in crime control.","",""

These surveillance practices seen in the war in Ukraine are not novel. Vigilantism campaigns have normalized since the War on Terror, while open-source information is increasingly recognized as a legitimate tool for human rights and international criminal justice investigation. Yet, their importance in the war in Ukraine highlights the agentic power of civilian surveillance. The proliferation of digital technologies empowers civilians to become inevitable actors in all spheres of politics, including war. However, across these practices, I argue that the Ukrainian government and its Western allies harness this agency as operational and narrative weapons. Patriotism and morality are pushed forward to mobilize individuals to participate in the war despite the risks that vigilantes and open-source investigators have to assume: risks of retaliation by Russian forces and lost independence.","",""

The COVID-19 pandemic created many challenges for employers, and many companies turned to new forms of monitoring to ensure remote workers remained productive; however, these technologies raise important privacy concerns as the boundaries between work and home are further blurred. In this paper, we present findings from a study of 645 US workers who spent at least part of 2020 working remotely due to the pandemic. We explore how their work experiences (job satisfaction, stress, and security) changed between January and November 2020, as well as their attitudes toward and concerns about being monitored. Findings support anecdotal evidence that the pandemic has had an uneven effect on workers, with women reporting more negative effects on their work experiences. In addition, while nearly 40% of workers reported their employer began using new surveillance tools during the pandemic, a significant percentage were unsure, suggesting there is confusion or a lack of transparency regarding how new policies are communicated to staff. We consider these findings in light of prior research and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of various approaches to minimize surveillance-related worker harms.","",""

This paper conceptualises public attitudes towards state surveillance within Jasanoff’s (2015) “sociotechnical imaginaries” framework and draws on an Australian survey to examine the complexity and contradictory nature of these attitudes in response to hypothetical use cases. Our study provides estimates of the prevalence of competing sociotechnical imaginaries, ranging from sizeable support for the dominant vision that surveillance can prevent/pre-empt crime/terrorism, to smaller but not insignificant support for either a dystopian or an ambivalent vision recognising the risks of such surveillance. Our results also demonstrate how sociotechnical imaginaries vary by demographics, political orientation, and perception of both citizen-state relations and the effectiveness of state surveillance practices.","",""

In this study of BWC adoption by a police agency in the United States, we examine how officers’ ideological perspectives on BWCs, technological limitations, and policy-related concerns influenced their decisions about whether and how to review video as part of their report writing practice. In conclusion, we argue that police practitioners and policy-makers should provide clearer policy guidance to officers about how BWC footage should be used in the report writing process and that police administrators, policy-makers, and researchers should directly consider the role that technology might play in regulating officer behavior, even in unintended ways.","",""

We critique these proposals by drawing on the theory of privacy as contextual integrity. Overall, we argue that these attribution solutions not only fail to achieve meaningful privacy but also leverage privacy rhetoric to advance commercial interests. ","",""

Conducting critical readings of the apps and textual analysis of discursive materials, we demonstrate how the ideological, relational, and material practices of the apps strategically deployed “care” to normalize a particular form of pandemic technogovernance in these two countries. In the ideological dimension, media and state discourse utilized a combination of vilifying and nationalist rhetoric that framed one’s acquiescence to surveillance as a demonstration of national belonging. Meanwhile, the apps also performed ambivalent roles in facilitating essential care services and mobilizing self-tracking activities, which contributed to the manufacturing of pseudonormality in these societies. In the end, we argue that the Chinese and South Korean governments managed to frame their aggressive surveillance infrastructure during COVID-19 as a form of paternalistic care by finessing the blurred boundaries between care and control.

"2023","How teens negotiate privacy on social media proactively and reactively"," Privacy management can be dichotomized into proactive and reactive behaviors. The former indicates avoiding information leakage beforehand. The latter occurs in the form of recovery efforts and it thus involves interpersonal dynamics. Past studies often focus on proactive privacy management without taking social interaction into account. The current study adopts coping and threat appraisal in the Protection Motivation Theory to compare the factors related to distinct types of privacy management with a stratified sample of teenagers in Taiwan (N = 1956). Controlling the pattern of social networking site use, the empirical results highlight the necessity of differentiating the privacy management. In addition, self-efficacy interacted with perceived vulnerability. Teenagers might ignore their vulnerability perceptions when they perceive themselves as having inferior self-efficacy, constituting disengagement from privacy protection. While it is never easy to prevent privacy breaches, suggestions for instructional designs are made on the basis of the behavioral types and empirical results. ","",""

Hence, this study attempts to integrate privacy self-efficacy and the multidimensional view of privacy management behaviors into the privacy calculus model and proposes an extended privacy calculus model for smart speaker usage. The study explicates three types of privacy management strategies in smart speaker usage: privacy disclosure, boundary linkage, and boundary control. A survey of smart speaker users ( N = 474) finds that perceived benefits are positively associated with privacy disclosure and boundary linkage, whereas perceived privacy risks are negatively related to these two strategies. Also, perceived privacy risks are positively related to boundary control. Finally, privacy self-efficacy promotes all three strategies while mitigating the impact of perceived privacy risks and boosting the impact of perceived benefits on privacy management. ","",""

Using a cross-lagged panel model with random intercepts, we differentiate between-person relations from within-person effects. Results revealed that people who were more concerned about their online privacy than others also shared slightly less personal information and had substantially more negative attitudes toward information sharing (between-person level). People who were more concerned than usual also shared slightly less information than usual (within-person level).

Drawing on communication privacy management theory, this work argues that different governmental approaches of privacy regulation shape users’ subjective norms in the form of perceived rules about how to manage personal and collective boundaries. These subjective privacy norms may better explain cross-national differences in people’s online privacy behavior. We conducted a survey (N = 1,060) among Facebook users in two countries in which privacy regulation policies vary significantly: the United States and Germany. While US users self-disclose more than German users do, they also take more measures to protect their privacy on Facebook. US users perceive stronger norms to protect themselves than German users.

These challenges arise due to legal, technical, and practical factors in developing algorithms for law enforcement.

Given that traditional understandings of the right to privacy and self-determination are founded on a liberal humanist understanding of the subject, dominant critiques of online surveillance are seriously compromised by the fact that behavior cannot, strictly speaking, be accommodated within this intellectual framework.","",""
"2024","The Chinese surveillance state in Latin America? Evidence from Argentina and Ecuador","Abstract Western authors fear that Chinese exports of surveillance technologies to Global South countries may lead to reproduction of the problematic surveillance practices that the Chinese state practices within its borders. However, much of this literature is not based on empirically-grounded research. To examine such concerns, we investigated two surveillance projects built in Argentina and Ecuador in cooperation with Chinese enterprises—JSeI in Argentina and ECU 911 in Ecuador. Based on empirical evidence, we argue for a more situated and differentiated approach for examining such projects that considers the distributed agency among local and Chinese actors, as well as the economic, social, and political factors that led to their deployment.","",""
"2024","China’s expansion into Brazilian digital surveillance markets","Abstract A number of countries in the Global South have adopted anti-China rhetoric in recent years. Here, we seek to assess the relation of such rhetoric to procurement of Chinese digital systems. We use the example of Brazil during the Bolsonaro government, examining whether Bolsonaro’s anti-China stance impacted procurement of Chinese surveillance technologies by sub-national (state/city) governments, which are the main bodies responsible for public security. We find that there has been broad and sustained procurement of Chinese surveillance technologies across the political spectrum; both among local governments politically allied to Bolsonaro and those from the opposition. Combined with acquisition at federal level, this suggests anti-China rhetoric does not feed through into procurement realities. Nor can China be singularly associated with diffusion of surveillance technologies as Western democracies have also been suppliers.","",""
"2024","Identifying undefined risks: A risk model and a privacy risk identification measure in the privacy impact assessment process","Abstract Privacy impact assessment (PIA) has attracted the attention of privacy watchdogs and researchers for decades. This study focuses on a risk model and risk identification method, which are two crucial elements of the risk identification step in the PIA process. As a preparatory work, this article reviews national and international organizations’ current templates and guidelines and finds that PIA guidance includes multiple domains but rarely provide a risk model or a systematic risk identification method. Based on the analysis, our study offers a risk model that can capture various privacy risk realization processes. It further proposes a combination of risk identification methods that correspond to the main target domains in the PIA and the proposed risk model. This combination consists of privacy principles of a given personal information or privacy rule to check compliance with the rule, and our suggested list of risk factors is useful in inductively finding potential risk scenarios that violate social expectations of privacy.","",""

Such dependencies are called privacy dependencies in the literature. Some say that privacy dependencies generate moral duties to avoid sharing information about oneself. If true, we argue, then it is sometimes justified for others to impose harm on the person sharing information to prevent them from doing so. In this paper, we first show how such conclusions arise. Next, we show that the existence of such a dependency between the moral significance you are inclined to attribute to privacy dependencies and judgments about permissible self-defense puts pressure on at least some ways of spelling out the idea that privacy dependencies ought to constrain our data-sharing conduct.","",""
"2024","Digital privacy and the law: the challenge of regulatory capture","AbstractDigital privacy scholars tend to bemoan ordinary people’s limited knowledge of and lukewarm interest in what happens to their digital data. This general lack of interest and knowledge is often taken as a consideration in favor of legislation aiming to force internet companies into adopting more responsible data practices. While we remain silent on whether any new laws are called for, in this paper we wish to underline a neglected consequence of people’s ignorance of and apathy for digital privacy: their potential to encourage capture by industry interests. In particular, we argue that such laws may be at increased risk of capture because they are unlikely to be democratically responsive. We make this claim on a twofold basis: first, well-known theoretical mechanisms explaining how the absence of responsiveness leads to capture, identified in prior political science and political philosophy literature, yield the prediction that digital privacy legislation is likely to be unresponsive and thus captured; second, empirical data concerning the European Union’s digital privacy laws, with a special focus on the General Data Protection Regulation, appears to confirm these predictions: the bloc’s (world’s?) flagship privacy protection law seems more responsive to corporate than citizen interests.","",""

"2024","When facial recognition does not ‘recognise’: erroneous identifications and resulting liabilities","AbstractFacial recognition is an artificial intelligence-based technology that, like many other forms of artificial intelligence, suffers from an accuracy deficit. This paper focuses on one particular use of facial recognition, namely identification, both as authentication and as recognition. Despite technological advances, facial recognition technology can still produce erroneous identifications. This paper addresses algorithmic identification failures from an upstream perspective by identifying the main causes of misidentifications (in particular, the probabilistic character of this technology, its ‘black box’ nature and its algorithmic bias) and from a downstream perspective, highlighting the possible legal consequences of such failures in various scenarios (namely liability lawsuits). In addition to presenting the causes and effects of such errors, the paper also presents measures that can be deployed to reduce errors and avoid liabilities.","",""
"2024","The interplay of rational evaluation and motivated reasoning in privacy helplessness: An integrative approach"," This study investigated the factors that influence individuals’ privacy helplessness in the context of social media and mobile application use. An integrative research model was proposed, simultaneously examining both rational evaluation processes and directional motivated reasoning. The integrative research model was tested using national survey data collected from Facebook users (Study 1, n = 660) and mobile application users (Study 2, n = 385) in the US. The findings demonstrated significant associations between privacy helplessness and factors related to directional motivated reasoning (e.g. perceived rewards, costs, and benefits) as well as the rational evaluation model (e.g. perceived privacy control, trust in the provider, and response efficacy). Moreover, the interaction effects observed in the studies suggest that the two mechanisms either reinforced or attenuated each other's influence. In conclusion, the results emphasize that privacy research should explore both theoretical mechanisms concurrently, as opposed to independently, since they not only operate in conjunction but also interact to define boundary conditions for one another.

When examining mugshot databases gathered by the NIST, such as the Multiple Encounters Dataset (MEDS) I and II (2010) and Special Database 18 Mugshot Identification Database (SD-18) (2016), it is clear that the same gendered and racialized dynamics present in policing practices related to the War on Drugs is reflected in the mugshot databases that continue to use for FRT research and evaluation into the contemporary moment. This paper details the SD-18 and MEDS databases, as well as the MORPH database, showcasing how their representational, technical and political protocols operate. The desires for frictionless interoperability built into the images’ technical protocols supersede concerns for eugenic political and representational protocols, resulting in a current moment where the deployment of mugshot datasets cannot be contained to their original intended use with FRTs, but leak into other forms of algorithmic governance as well as into algorithmic image-making and visual culture, including generative artificial intelligence systems such as DALL-E.

"2024","The curious case of blockchain in rural China: Unravelling power,  profit, and surveillance"," Blockchain originated from the aspiration for decentralization, and in Western countries, its association with freedom from governmental and corporate dominance remains unwavering. However, in China–where blockchain has taken an intriguing foothold–the socio-technical imaginaries of blockchain diverge significantly. As China rises in blockchain development, critical literature examining its ventures is notably lacking. This article analyses state-led initiatives and corporate endeavours related to blockchain deployment in rural China. While blockchain's roots lie in libertarian ideals, within China, it serves as a ‘state techno-solutionist’ tool, empowering authoritarian capitalism for enhanced state control and corporate profit through data exploitation. Although the application of blockchain in agricultural tracing and finance is heralded as a blessing to elevate smallholder farmers from poverty and enhance agricultural practices, the reality contrasts sharply. Instead of empowering farmers, the technology exacerbates power imbalances, embedding them in a system marked by extensive data harvesting and surveillance. Such integration entangles these farmers subsisting on China's economic fringes within broader national and global capitalist financial frameworks, rendering them more susceptible to exploitation and manipulation. Moreover, blockchain in rural China epitomizes authoritarian capitalism, where capitalists aligning closely with state agendas. Blockchain's transparency, traceability, and tamper-resistant features, instead of diminishing government interference, are harnessed by capitalists to amplify the social credit system, strengthening the data dominance of platform companies and supporting state surveillance. Therefore, blockchain emerges as a threat to rural China's ways of life–all driven by the pursuit of corporate profit and the government's quest to reclaim national greatness. ","",""
"2024","Sounding out voice biometrics: Comparing and contrasting how the state and the private sector determine identity through voice"," The voice biometrics industry is promised today as a new center of digital innovation. Tech companies and state agencies are massively investing in speech recognition and analysis systems, pushed by the belief that the acoustics of voice contain unique individual characteristics to convert into information and value through artificial intelligence. This article responds to this current development by exploring the under-researched datafication of the auditory realm to reveal how the sound of voice is emerging as a site for identity construction by both states and corporations. To do so, we look at two different case studies. First, we examine a patent granted to the streaming service Spotify, which aims to improve the platform's music recommendation system by analyzing users’ speech. Second, we discuss the use of voice biometrics in German asylum procedures, where the country of origin of undocumented asylum seekers is determined through accent analysis. Through these seemingly distinct case studies, we identify not only the common assumptions behind the rationale for adopting voice biometrics, but also important differences in the way the private sector and the State determine identity through the analysis of the sounding voice. These two entities are rarely examined together and are often conflated when addressing practices of auditory surveillance. Thus, our comparative and contrastive approach contributes to existing scholarship that questions the claimed efficiency and ethics of voice biometrics’ extractive practices, further defining the operations and assumptions of the private sector and the State.

"2024","Inequalities in privacy cynicism: An intersectional analysis of agency constraints"," A growing body of research highlights a trend toward widespread attitudes of privacy cynicism, apathy and resignation among Internet users. In this work, we extend these discussions by concentrating on the concept of user agency. Specifically, we examine how five types of structural constraints—interpersonal, cultural, technological, economic and political—restrict user agency and contribute to the prevalence of privacy cynicism as a common response. Drawing on critical data studies and adopting an intersectional lens, we demonstrate how these constraints disproportionately impact various social groups unequally, leading to a disparate distribution of agency and privacy cynicism. Furthermore, we contend that the sense of powerlessness engendered by excessive constraints on user agency can, in turn, exacerbate user vulnerability to such constraints, potentially initiating a vicious cycle of disempowerment. The article enriches the field of privacy research by linking the traditionally individual-focused and psychological dimensions of privacy with critical surveillance studies and by proposing potential interventions to mitigate privacy cynicism.

"2024","Privacy cynicism and diminishing utility of state surveillance: A natural experiment of mandatory location disclosure on China's Weibo"," This article examines the public response to mandatory location disclosure (MLD), a new surveillance technology implemented on China's Sina Weibo. Initially introduced to geo-tag posts related to the Ukraine War, the MLD eventually expanded to encompass all posts and comments on the platform. Drawing on a large-scale dataset comprising over 0.6 million posts and 24 million comments, this study uncovers political asymmetry observed during the initial implementation of MLD. Users with different political orientations were subjected to different levels of geo-tagging. Pro-Ukraine users were most frequently geo-tagged, followed by Pro-Russia and liberal-leaning users, while conservative-leaning users are least likely to be tagged. This selective surveillance approach, however, backfired among Pro-Ukraine and Pro-Russia users, pushing them to publish more war-related content, while its impact on liberal- and conservative-leaning users appeared to be minimal. When selective surveillance was replaced by universal surveillance, the backfire effects ceased to exist and people's interest in war-related topics declined. Furthermore, privacy cynicism prevails among commenters across opinion groups. Neither the introduction nor the expansion of MLD deterred audiences from engaging with the geo-tagged posts. These findings suggest that prolonged surveillance makes people less sensitive to privacy threats and more experienced in neutralizing surveillance's influence on themselves. Privacy cynicism, though widely considered toxic to democracy, can function as a source of resilience that shields people from the fear of coercion and undercuts the marginal utility of state surveillance in an authoritarian context.

"2024","The ‘doings’ behind data: An ethnography of police data construction"," Public organisations, like the Netherlands Police, increasingly rely on data. Despite its importance, there has been limited empirical attention to how data is created and how its situated context impacts algorithmic interpretation of data. Using the Netherlands Police as a research focus, this study aims to fill this gap by studying datafication from an interpretivist perspective, emphasising the importance of material factors and human actors engaging in ‘data work’. The main research question is: How do material factors and human actors interact in ‘data work’ to enable datafication of street-level situated contexts at the Netherlands Police? The study builds on nearly 200 h of ethnographic fieldwork with street-level employees at the Netherlands Police. It finds that data work is deeply embedded in daily policing and is shaped by personal values, organisational context, and practical considerations. The findings highlight challenges posed by structured and unstructured data entry in the registration software for police reports. Structured data limit discretion with predefined labels, often conflicting with employees’ own perceptions. Unstructured data offer more flexibility but pose challenges such as linguistic nuance, inconsistencies, and the presence of ‘voice’ in police reports that complicate data interpretation. The study unearths various patterns of the interplay between human actors and material factors in relation to their situated contexts, which impact how police reports are constructed through a registration system. This approach, emphasising the interplay between material factors, human actors, organisational dynamics, and contextual factors, can help public sector organisations take steps towards responsible algorithmic interpretation of data.

"2024","Role-based privacy cynicism and local privacy activism: How data stewards navigate privacy in higher education"," This study examines the impact of role-based constraints on privacy cynicism within higher education, a workplace increasingly subjected to surveillance. Using a thematic analysis of 15 in-depth interviews conducted between 2017 and 2023 with data stewards in the California State University System, the research explores the reasons behind data stewards’ privacy cynicism, despite their knowledge of privacy and their own ability to protect it. We investigate how academic data custodians navigate four role-based tensions: the conflict between the institutional and personal definitions of privacy; the mutual reinforcement between their privacy-cynical attitudes and their perceptions of student privacy attitudes; the influence of role constraints on data stewards’ privacy-protective behaviors; and the contrast between the negatively valued societal surveillance and the positively valued university surveillance. The findings underscore the significance of considering organizational privacy cultures and role-based expectations in studying privacy cynicism. The study contributes to the theoretical understanding of privacy cynicism and offers practical implications for organizations, emphasizing the importance of aligning organizational definitions of privacy with employees’ understanding. Future research should further explore the mutual reinforcement of privacy cynicism in the relationship between data providers and data consumers (which we call the “spiral of resignation”) and consider the impact of role-based constraints in other organizational contexts.

However, its rushed development calls for careful consideration from all involved stakeholders to achieve a shared understanding and engage in joint-sensemaking in order to implement DCT collaboratively and effectively utilize it in the fight against the pandemic. Yet, the empirical ground truth and theoretical mechanism of joint-sensemaking are both unclear. Drawing on this gap, this article applies a multistep approach, including sentiment analysis, topic analysis coupled with regression and unique network analysis, to thoroughly explore, examine, and explain the dynamic process of joint-sensemaking in the context of a public crisis. Based on evidence from 113,264 Weibo posts, we illustrate two joint-sensemaking pathways and three key interventions using the case of China's Health Code in the context of the DCT. We reveal that the effectiveness of different interventions and contributions made by stakeholders vary significantly between different joint-sensemaking pathways. Specifically, we find that official media and opinion leaders act as crucial mediators in bridging intervention conductors and the public. However, their influence presents heterogeneity toward different network modularity, thus leading to distinct patterns. Additionally, inconsistent with previous literature, we find that within the context of the China Health Code, official media has a greater impact on opinion leaders in engaging the public. ","",""

This rapid adoption of technologies has left a significant gap in our theoretical understanding of how police make decisions about which technologies to acquire. While existing research has focused on technology’s impact at the organizational level, the macro-level context that shapes technological acquisition by the police is undertheorized. To address this gap in the literature, this article combines theorizing by Ericson and Haggerty (1997) on policing the risk society (PRS) and Zuboff (2019) on surveillance capitalism (SC) to develop a macro-level theoretical framework. We consider technologies acquired by the police to be risk technologies and argue that combining key elements of PRS and SC theorizing offers a macro-level understanding of police decision-making about which technologies to adopt that can complement meso-level organizational theories. While calling for additional empirical research, this article concludes by discussing the potential impacts associated with private-sector involvement in public-sector initiatives and providing directions for future research.","",""

After reviewing the evolution of productivity management in academia, it argues that surveillance via APM shifts expectations not just about effectiveness at work but also about how work, and the good worker, come to be defined. In our paradigmatic case study of Office 365, we specify how the automated surveillance of workforce practices are deployed to redefine productivity in higher education: productive workers become good data subjects as well as producers of papers, grants, and other traditional outputs of success. Our analysis suggests performing well at work is managed in and by the platform via logics of the surveillance of wellness, time-regulation, and social connectivity to influence, manage, and control workers. We critique these automated performance measures in terms of platform capitalism, noting Office 365’s Viva Insights function as a telematic device of surveillance. The final section of the paper places these trends in Australia’s socio-legal context by showing how Viva is insufficient for considering performance given the range of practices that constitute “academic work,” including but not limited to the need for unmonitored activity. Yet, we observe that currently little can be done about Office 365’s surveillant presence given a regulatory regime that by and large excludes productivity surveillance from the scope of regulated surveillance activities.","",""

In this article, we advance the idea that the addition of AI changes the way surveillance ecologies function and thus deserves to spawn its own concept: the surveillance AI-cology. Surveillance AI-cologies are made up of interconnected collections of disparate actors (technological, human, more-than-human, organisational, etc.), all implicated in AI-aided surveillance tasks. They contain not only the usual complexities of any technological ecosystem but also the added complexity of AI, with emergent characteristics, both technically and socially. We argue for the utility of multi-faceted perspectives in doing work within AI-cologies, and we describe (anthropologically inspired) methodology for understanding and unpacking AI surveillance ecosystems. The development of democratically controlled AI surveillance requires the systematic consideration of ethical, legal, and social aspects (ELSA) within the quintuple helix (public, private, civil society, academia, nature). We stress the relevance of clearly defining which perspectives of the quintuple helix are considered in AI surveillance, and which not, to achieve a transparent set of (ELSA) values that guide AI surveillance development and implementation. We provide an example of the way we have developed and applied (some of) these methodologies in the context of a test-site for the development and application of smart city technology, a so-called “Living Lab.” Here we take the stance of active involvement of academics as “critical friends” into complex innovation and assessment processes. Together with our conversation partners in the field, we tease out and reflect upon the (public safety) values embedded in the setup of the Living Lab we explore. We end with a call to understand surveillance AI-cologies not as a problem to be solved, but as a continuing process to be discussed among highly diverse stakeholders.","",""

Following the theoretical tradition of media “domestication,” this paper examines the incorporation of Student Activity Monitoring Software (SAMS) into the everyday routines of one Australian secondary school. Drawing on two years of fieldwork, the paper details how SAMS was broadly accepted by school staff and students as complementing—rather than challenging—the moral economy of the school. With school leaders keen to increase student surveillance without being seen to diminish teacher professionalism, the paper shows how SAMS was appropriated and objectified in ways that teachers and students perceived as preserving established classroom power relations. At the same time, school leaders could maintain core school values while also projecting an appearance of innovation and being “data-driven.” However, rather than this surveillance system being wholly “tamed,” we also show how SAMS was leading to subtle shifts within the school—not least the surrendering of governance and accountability to the software company, alongside the further entrenchment of “soft surveillance” logics into classrooms.","",""
"2024","User Perception of Smart Home Surveillance: An Integrative Review","Smart Home Technologies (SHTs) have recently become popular for a variety of purposes, including healthcare, entertainment, and convenience, among others. While SHT manufacturers promise to provide a range of services relating to home security, health and wellness, automated domestic tasks, entertainment, and beyond, user perceptions vary widely in terms of benefits and drawbacks. Moreover, surveillance studies researchers have warned against normalizing technologies that may exacerbate uneven power dynamics between users and household members, marketing companies, insurance brokers, law enforcement, and others. Through an analysis of the interdisciplinary literature stemming from computer science and engineering, gerontology, the social sciences, and related fields, we explore the extent to which these potential risks and related concerns are reflected upon by smart home users. This scoping review aims to explore SHT user perceptions of privacy attitudes, the purposes of smart home surveillance, risks and benefits, and impacts on home safety. Through our review of sixty-eight relevant studies, we found that many smart home users reported satisfaction over perceived benefits such as an increased sense of safety and home security. Many others displayed limited understandings of data collection practices or expressed privacy concerns. Nonetheless, SHT usage prevailed among these users. Others report a perceived trade-off between privacy and other factors, such as convenience, and some may have resorted to privacy cynicism, a coping mechanism for dealing with ubiquitous surveillance. In order to better understand SHT adoption trends despite concerns, exploring the conflict between user perceptions of privacy, understanding of SHT data collection purposes, risks and benefits, and home safety, is essential.","",""

Through a critical visual analysis of forty quarantine YouTube vlogs, we illustrate how Korean citizens build playful surveillance imaginaries, which are imaginaries about surveillance constructed through playful frames that perceive participation in surveillance as agentive, pleasurable, and relational. Their playful surveillance imaginaries introduce novel ways of perceiving the self, surveillance technologies, and others in surveillance cultures and the relations that bring them together into a mutually beneficial and caring network.

(Freeman et al. 2014), that share an interest in the affective impact of parental surveillance and discipline on childhood sexual exploration. Using close playing as my method, I argue that the videogames reveal the perils of surveillance and its pleasures. Drawing on assemblage theory, I demonstrate the contingency of videogames’ affective impact on players and the world and the—sometimes contradictory—potentials that surveillance produces as part of a sexual assemblage. Sometimes, using surveillance as a game mechanic amplifies sexual affect and pleasure and can thus be conceptualized as an example of “flirting” with surveillance. At other times, players orient themselves toward the videogames as the archetypical “parent”—finding pleasure in “catching” a videogame about sexual exploration and attempting to discipline it. Finally, drawing on Kathryn Bond Stockton (2004, 2009, 2017) and José Esteban Muñoz (2019), I argue that, by allowing players to relive childhood sexual exploration as adults, You Must Be 18 or Older to Enter and how do you Do It? provide players with the opportunity to become a playful child, to loop back through time and re-explore sexual discovery, and thus shape nuanced critiques of the way surveillance shapes sexual possibilities.","",""

In response to the prevalence of FRT, protesters and photographers are urging and employing anonymizing blurring technologies to evade state and citizen surveillance. I argue that these technologies materially and rhetorically disrupt the racialized surveillant gaze.

While pricing intelligence services like web-scraping and dynamic pricing algorithms are typically applied in e-commerce settings, I focus here on a firm that specializes in the collection of brick-and-mortar retail price data, with special attention to the labor practices involved in the manual (in-person, device-aided) production of retail price information at the national-industrial scale. Building on auto-ethnographic observations as a price data collector as well as analysis of employee reviews of the firm on sites like Indeed and Glassdoor, I argue that surveillance studies can contribute in significant ways to our understanding of the material practices, and politics, of price and price formation.","",""
"2024","Understanding Attitudes Toward Police Surveillance: The Role of Authoritarianism, Fear of Crime, and Private-Sector Surveillance Attitudes","Public attitudes toward domestic police surveillance have important implications for its political salience and regulation. An increasing number of jurisdictions have sought to regulate law enforcement surveillance, in part due to growing concerns over issues related to privacy, civil liberties, and the potential for bias (Beyea and Kebde 2021; Chivukula and Takemoto 2021; Smyth 2021). This study explores what factors help to predict and shape public attitudes toward police surveillance. Two groups of participants (n = 131 and n = 299) completed measures of authoritarianism, fear of crime, consumer surveillance technology use, and attitudes toward private-sector surveillance (such as surveillance by private companies, employers, or citizens) and police surveillance. Demographic factors (age, race/ethnicity, education level, gender, and political leaning) were also examined.

"2024","The Practice of Predictive Identification: Optimising for Organisational Needs","The advent of predictive policing systems demonstrates an increased interest in more novel forms of data processing for the purpose of crime control. This paper draws on interviews with police practitioners in the Netherlands and the UK to deconstruct the rationalities that are embedded within the turn to predictive identification. Debates on predictive policing have predominantly centred data in the analysis of the institutional and societal implication of prediction, linking its use to the premise of efficiency and accuracy and foregrounding issues around bias and discrimination. Yet, little is known about its actual practice. In policing, I find that studying data as practice surfaces new insights into the relationship between risk and the ways in which crime priorities are operationalised and the security mandate of the state is negotiated. Drawing on Harcourt’s (2008) observation that the desire to predict crime says more about the police than it does about a potential offender, I argue that predictive identification is not about prediction, nor about efficiency, but rather it is about optimisation. Here, datafication serves to overcome self-defined organisational challenges within the police.","",""
"2024","Pred-Pol-Pov: Visibility, Data Flows, and the Predictive Policing of Poverty","Predictive and data-driven policing systems continue to proliferate around the world, enticing police forces with promises of improvements in efficiency and the ability to offer various ways of addressing the future to pre-empt, predict, or prevent crime. As more of these systems become operationalised in England and Wales, this paper takes up Duarte’s (2021) observation that there is a lack of description as to what such systems actually are. This paper adapts a social network methodology to explore what is a data-driven policing system. Using a police force in England, UK, as a case study, we provide a visualisation of a data-driven policing system based on the data flows it requires to operate. The paper shows how a disparate network of affiliate organisations act as collators of specific data types that are then used in a range of policing applications. We make visible how data travels from its source through various nodes and the various potential points of translation that occur. We show, as others have argued before us, the data points used are proxies for poverty, making certain groups and sections of society highly visible to the digital system whilst other groups and crimes become less visible—and sometimes even hidden.  ","",""
"2024","The Surveillant Surrounds: Sonar and Sexual Surveillance in Iceland During the Cold War","The Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) was an American naval surveillance network developed over the course of the Cold War. Spanning from the Pacific coast across the Atlantic, SOSUS is remembered for its unprecedented reach and is often figured as a precursor to centralized, networked, and automated surveillance systems today. This article contributes to, and complicates, this history by approaching SOSUS from the perspective of one of its outposts. Iceland was neither an agent nor a target of American surveillance but, as a staging grounds for SOSUS, both shaped and was shaped by this process nevertheless. Theorizing this position as the surveillant surrounds, this article asks after the experience of being interpellated into someone else’s surveillance program, or living where surveillance is a pervasive part of the landscape while occupying neither the position of observer nor observed. In Southern Iceland, I argue, SOSUS both activated and was meaningfully anchored by a local politics of gendered intimacy. Doing so, I shed fresh light on the legacy of SOSUS and make a broader case for attending to the particular place-based dynamics that shape and situate “global” surveillance networks then and today.

Amazon’s Ring, and related connected camera devices, introduce new sociotechnical relations into domestic environments. First, I outline “squeeveillance” as the affective and performative dimensions of cuteness within surveillance. I explore the Ring surveillant assemblage and why it needs the power of cuteness. Then, I examine squeeveillance as the use of cuteness in the way Ring operates. I use the TV show Ring Nation (2022–present) to discuss the remediation of cute footage from doorbell cameras onto other media, before discussing the ways in which cuteness is performed as a normalisation of surveillance power. The article draws on theories of cuteness in conjunction with surveillance studies of power relations. In presenting squeeveillance as a lens through which to assess the expanding scope of Ring, I offer a discussion of the interconnected role of surveillance in contemporary domestic and media settings and its relation to current forms of power in surveillant assemblages.","",""
"2024","Abstracting Injustice","In this paper, we explore how the neorepublican concepts of domination and antipower can contribute to the surveillance studies literature and a more democratic and participatory approach to technology development and deployment within the criminal justice system. We frame the neorepublican approach as an alternative to the predominant liberal paradigm, arguing that normative surveillance studies scholarship should emphasize the dominating potential of surveillance practices rather than merely trying to limit actual interference in peoples’ lives. To illustrate, we focus on the use of surveillance technologies that capture images of individuals within the US criminal justice system for recognition and/or identification. Facial or other biometric recognition technologies (FRTs) are increasingly built on artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms (“AI”). Often seen as a faster, more accurate, and less labor-intensive alternatives to human cognition, AI-powered biometric and facial recognition and other image capture technologies have become widely used within public law enforcement agencies around the world. The deployment of these technologies within the US criminal justice system has produced significant forms of injustice, including faulty identification and the subsequent arrest, detention, and incarceration of innocent individuals. These forms of data injustice are often opaque, hidden behind secretive law enforcement practices or commercial secrecy agreements. We draw from neorepublican conceptions of domination and antipower to frame this legal and technological opacity as an abstraction of injustice. We argue that handing important criminal justice decision-making over to code and algorithms designed, owned, and maintained by private interests exacerbates the potential for the public deployment of unjust systems that subject individuals and communities to unwarranted, arbitrary, and uncontrolled state power. Such government interference represents clear forms of data injustice and domination.","",""

"2024","The Canadian Clearview AI Investigation as a Call for Digital Policy Literacy","In 2020, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPCC) led a joint federal-provincial investigation into privacy violations stemming from the use of facial recognition technologies. The investigation was prompted specifically by the mobilization of Clearview AI’s facial recognition software in law enforcement, including by regional police services as well as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Clearview AI’s technology is based on scraping social media images, which, as the investigation found, constitutes a privacy law violation according to provincial and federal private sector legislation. In response to the investigation, Clearview AI claimed that consent for scraping social media images was not required from users because the information is already public. This common fallacy of social media privacy serves as a pivot point for the integration of digital policy literacy into the OPCC’s digital literacy materials in order to consider the regulatory environment around digital media, alongside their political-economic and infrastructural components. Digital policy literacy is a model that expands what is typically an individual- or organization-level responsibility for privacy protection by considering the wider socio-technical context in which a company like Clearview can emerge.","",""

This type of software has seen a surge of interest since the start of the pandemic, as managers attempt to retain oversight of workers in remote or distributed conditions. However, “bossware” is not monolithic but highly differentiated, with each product created by specific companies, with specific affordances, for specific purposes. This article thus builds a more articulated portrait of bossware by mapping the landscape. It first defines a schema based on the “expansiveness” and “invasiveness” of this software and maps key products along these two axes. It then develops a bossware typology ranging from spyware through to soft-bossware and productivity-ware, highlighting their differences in terms of data captured, userbases, perceived legitimacy, and existing safeguards.

"2024","Surveillant Companionship and the  FBI Agent Meme","In late 2017 and throughout 2018, surveillance discourse collided with meme culture through the popular “FBI agent” meme. The meme had various iterations but usually depicted ordinary individuals who are aware that they are constantly being surveilled on their personal devices by an assigned government agent. However, far from threatening Orwellian depictions of surveillance, in which a dangerous government is constantly watching, the FBI agent meme characterized the surveillant relationship as positive and caring, where the government agent is answering questions or helping with homework, providing a sympathetic ear for relationship troubles, crying over movies together, and even dropping by to deliver milk. The joke is predicated on the assumption that the government agent is always watching, knows the individual intimately, communicates with them regularly, and sometimes even intervenes through their devices, but only with the individual’s best interests in mind. The FBI agent meme depicts the relationship between the individual and the surveillant apparatus as one of surveillant companionship. Surveillant companionship suggests that surveillance fulfills a social role: partly care and control, and partly a response to widespread alienation. The FBI agent meme’s depiction of surveillant companionship satirizes the normalization of mass surveillance by highlighting the absurdity of sharing every intimate moment with the surveillant gaze. Memes also function as collective interventions in political discourse, in this case mass surveillance. Although the meme depicts the surveillant apparatus as a form of ambivalent companionship, the collective and collaborative nature of memes and the participation in communal humor and critique offers a different kind of companionship, one organized around a recognition of shared grievances and surveillant intrusions.","",""

"2024","Neighborly Surveillance: The Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission and the Development of a Post-Jim Crow Ideological Apparatus","The relations of production in Deep South regions like the Mississippi Delta require a high degree of control over race and class configurations. While the overt, de jure White supremacy that marked the post-Reconstruction era allowed for effective repression of dissent, the promise of federal intervention and grassroots organizing during the years of the civil rights movement required White elites to recalibrate methods of control. By integrating theories of racialization of space, internal colonialism, and Althusser’s (2006) notion of the ideological state apparatus, I suggest that this transition from overt to implicit control was accomplished by creating a culture of neighborly surveillance in which everyday Whites were deputized to surveil and report on civil rights organizing at the grassroots level. By neighborly surveillance, I refer to surveillance between and amongst private citizens enacted outside the purview of the formal state but in the interest of the powerful elite who control the state. I document this process through analysis of the archives of the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, an official state agency tasked with spying on and counteracting civil rights activity. These records demonstrate the extent to which non-state actors assumed the roles originally exercised by the de jure Jim Crow regime. Beyond augmenting understandings of the civil rights movement-era US South, this article contributes analytical insights to social and ideological transitions in other post-colonial, post-authoritarian spatial contexts.

"2024","The Art of Screening: Reasonable Efforts and Measures at the Nexus of Aid Work and Counterterrorism","Surveillance in the context of aid work refers to control over procedures, supplies, goods, and people that is deemed necessary for providing care. It is widely considered an inalienable, albeit criticized, part of care provision. International non-governmental organizations implementing aid projects in the Global South (hereafter INGOs or aid organizations), however, also screen individuals based on either conditional clauses in funding agreements in the context of counterterrorism or on their pursuing other organizational interests. While this opaque practice has raised increasing concerns both in humanitarian and development circles, it is much less known how screening is implemented and if it can be construed as (harmful) surveillance. Therefore, qualitative methods were used to explore a screening tool, the description of which is the core empirical part of this study, and to map INGO experiences and dilemmas with screening. As findings indicate, vendors delivering surveillance technology can help INGOs to navigate the complexity of sanctions and enforcement lists, ensure legal compliance, and demonstrate accountability towards donors, while the transparency obligation prescribed in data protection laws poses huge challenges. Furthermore, the right to be recognized, supported, assisted, and employed—either in the humanitarian or the development context—depends on how INGOs categorize individuals before screening and how they make decisions based on the results. The article contributes to earlier research by including screening in the conceptualization of (counter)surveillance in aid work.","",""

"2024","A longitudinal examination of Internet users’ privacy protection behaviors in relation to their perceived collective value of privacy and individual privacy concerns"," People’s perception of privacy can primarily be directed to themselves or to the value of privacy for society. Likewise, privacy protection can repel both individual and collective privacy threats. Focusing on this distinction, the present article examines Internet users’ privacy protection behaviors in relation to individual privacy concerns and their perceived collective value of privacy over time. We conducted a longitudinal panel study with three measurement points ( N = 1790) to investigate relations between and within persons. The results of a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model revealed positive relations between the perceived value of privacy, privacy concerns, and privacy protection between persons. At the within-person level, only a temporal increase in the perceived value of privacy was related to increased protection behaviors. This suggests that individual privacy concerns are not as important for temporal protection as assumed, but that a recognition of collective privacy may temporarily change people’s privacy behavior.

The interest in such conduct has resurged with the development of networked participatory technologies, which enable creation, dissemination, analysis, and use of large amounts of personal information, thereby increasingly augmenting the effect of online self-disclosure on disclosers and disclosees. This article reviews 309 empirical studies about online self-disclosure published between 2010 and 2020 and aggregates insights thereof into an overarching model describing the ways in which this socio-technical undertaking unfolds. The review shows that online self-disclosure research overwhelmingly focuses on the individual and de-emphasizes structural elements that influence these practices and their outcomes. Based on these findings, we propose a structurational framework centered on the dialectic relationship between individuals and structures involved in self-disclosure and affected by such behaviors. This approach provides a useful tool to address the recent transformations of self-disclosure and its implications in the wake of computer-mediated technological developments. ","",""

We argue that the ‘contactless culture’ that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic anticipates the normalization of a form of mass-customized biopolitics: the ability to operate on the population and the individual simultaneously through automated forms of passive identification.

Addressing the implementation of a national security law (NSL) in Hong Kong, we used two-wave panel data to understand political engagement on Facebook before and shortly after the law was enacted. We find a serial mediation path in which pan-democratic and localist users (those who tend to oppose the government) showed greater fear of the law; this encouraged more active privacy management which was related to a higher level of engagement after the enactment of NSL, implying that these users responded strategically through restricting the visibility of their engagement. This mediation path is moderated by the level of political disagreement users encountered on Facebook. Implications of the findings are discussed. ","",""

A large-scale online survey ( N = 3221) reveals that attitudes toward online state and corporate surveillance are interrelated; the two attitudinal components are, however, generation-specific, having different predictors. Tolerance toward state surveillance is more characteristic of the older group, being predicted by trustful and obedient attitudes toward state authorities and institutions. Tolerance toward corporate dataveillance is more characteristic of the younger group, being predicted by active and self-confident media use. While the socio-historical context molds the intergenerational gaps in surveillance-related experiences and attitudes, individual-level experiences of state surveillance do not predict tolerance toward either type of contemporary surveillance, suggesting that global techno-cultural developments are probably more powerful factors than past experiences in forming generation-specific attitudes.

I argue that the mode of labeling culture helped the institutional structure of the Chinese bureaucracy adapt to changing circumstances and absorb novel technologies into its established systems of policing and surveillance, while ensuring that human discretion would continue to play a guiding role.

A dystopian view saw the rapid development and proliferation of COVID-19 contact-tracing apps as a vanguard technology for surveillance. Expediently deployed as a technological fix to the pandemic, contact-tracing was seen to threaten to transform a state of emergency into a state of exception, under which accepted or constitutional laws and norms might be suspended. Here, we extend early critiques of the contact-tracing app as a ‘technofix’ to argue the growing intervention of global technology corporations in digital governance and affairs of national sovereignty throughout the COVID-19 pandemic represents a new frontier of state–industrial surveillance that exploits people’s pre-investment in and dependence on technology corporations. We exemplify this with the ‘technofix’ of the Google–Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) framework and critically examine the notion of a decentralised and privacy-preserving Bluetooth-based contact-tracing framework proposed by global technology corporations that may threaten state sovereignty when determining public health responses to current or future crises.

This legitimation, however, is challenged by the difficulty FRT encounters in capturing the face in its vital and its mortal malleability.

Their position of privileged precarity, which results from the casualization of digital labor, allows these data consultants to quickly become insiders while staying uncomfortable with many of the taken-for-granted ideological convictions and organizational orders. Rationalizing their involvement as disoriented diligence affords the whistleblowers the capacity to craft a story of enchantment, delusion, and subsequent awakening.

We recorded our attempts to disable experimental accounts in 25 SNSs drawn from Alexa’s 2020 Top Sites list. As a result of our systematic content analysis of the recordings, we identified major types of dark patterns (Complete Obstruction, Temporary Obstruction, Obfuscation, Inducements to Reconsider, and Consequences) and unified them into a conceptual model, based on the differences and similarities within nuanced subtypes in the user account disabling context. The Dark Pattern Typology presented at the 12th International Conference on Social Media and Society is further illustrated in this work. We document the distribution of the subtypes in our sample SNSs, exemplifying dark UI design choices. All of the sites used at least one type of dark pattern. Our findings provide empirical evidence for these pervasive—yet rarely discussed—strategies in the social media industry. Users who wish to discontinue using SNSs—to protect their privacy, break an addiction, and/or improve their general well-being—may find it difficult or nearly impossible to do so.

However, there is a dearth of systematic research examining the implementation of new privacy policies exercised by digital platforms and user engagement with these policies. This study establishes a triple-layered comparative approach to explore the complexities and particularities of privacy policy practices in Chinese digital platforms. The methodology encompasses the analysis of privacy policies from representative platforms—WeChat, Taobao, and Douyin—alongside user experience garnered through a walkthrough method and insights from 28 interviews with platform users. Through critical discourse analysis, the research revealed that state-dominant policy discourses were ingrained in the formulation of platform privacy regulations to legitimize their authority over user data ownership. The users perceived a strong sense of passive protection, characterized by the rigid “agreement” discourse practices that underscore their vulnerability in everyday digital platform usage. The findings shed light on intricate power dynamics at play between platforms, their privacy policies, and users, which leads to polarized reactions from users toward privacy concerns. By examining the articulation of digital privacy policies as instruments of statecraft, we offer a nuanced view of describing non-Western experiences of privacy values and regulatory practices in the digital age.

Under the surveillant gaze of RSD, refugee subjects are forced to narrativize their lives using the language of persecution in exchange for state protection. This article contributes to critical refugee studies (CRS) scholarship which challenges the dehumanizing impacts of RSD’s surveillant gaze. Extending Vinh Nguyen’s concept of refugeetude, I develop a framework for refugee sousveillance. I define refugee sousveillance as the co-optation of refugee narratives such that they consciously defy the juridico-political surveillance of RSD towards a creative, open, coalitional future with other refugee subjects and marginalized groups. Refugee sousveillance applies bell hooks’ oppositional gaze (1992) and Browne’s (2015)  dark sousveillance to refugeetude. Identifying a noteworthy collection of essays written by a coalition of elite refugee writers, I provide examples of refugee sousveillance as both process and product.","",""
"2024","<i>Person of Interest</i> as Media Technology of Surveillance: A Cautionary Tale for the Future of the National Security State With Diegetic Big Data Surveillance, Algorithmic Security, and Artificial Intelligence"," In this article, we examine the television series about global surveillance Person of Interest ( POI) (aired on CBS, 2011–2016) to reflect on popular understandings of surveillance and account for its representation of artificial intelligence (AI) and algorithmic surveillance. Drawing on television, media, and surveillance studies, we focus on the power of representations of social relations and diegetic technologies in possible and imagined futures to explore the role of cultural representations in shaping social order. Through the character of the AI Machine representing algorithmic surveillance, we evaluate the show’s critique of algorithmic autonomy and contend that, as a media technology of surveillance, the show participates in the hype of big data as a panacea while banalizing surveillance. We argue that POI could facilitate a comprehensive analysis of the politics of algorithmic surveillance but fails to do so due to its uncritical representation of artificial intelligence agencies in detecting security risks.

This paper draws on the literature on financial narratives to examine the role that such stories play within the form of capitalism that they describe, and what this suggests for the role of “hype” in contemporary capitalism. The same stories that for critical scholars appear as menacing threats of “technofeudalism” or “surveillance capitalism” for investors appear as optimistic stories of promising future returns. By driving financial investments, narratives afford platforms very real social and political powers, enabling them to function as a form of self-fulfilling prophecies. The paper argues for a cultural inflection to the political economy of Big Tech – viewing capitalism as neither mechanistic nor rational, but as an expression of a complex interplay between narrative, technology, and economic power. This suggests the need for a             critical hype studies             , geared at deconstructing the narratives undergirding the technological waves of capitalist pursuits, and examining the broader role of hype in coordinating and directing flows of capital within contemporary financialized capitalism.

"2025","A GAME OF PRIVACY TUG OF WAR: A HISTORICAL ANALYSIS OF PRIVACY SETTINGS","Privacy settings are a critical mechanism for platforms to manage, control, and impact user privacy online. The policies of social media platforms and their technical design—including the choice architecture of privacy settings—""""serve as a form of privatized governance directly enacting rights and regulating the flow of information online (DeNardis &amp; Hackl, 2015). Many platforms use a rhetoric of “choice and control,” relying on privacy settings to shoulder the burden of responsibility for user privacy (Horne, 2021). Another challenge to privacy on social media platforms is that there is a wide disparity of settings choices across different platforms, with varying defaults (Horne, 2023). Additionally, the interconnection and the technical importance of privacy settings has a clear and well-established history. This paper examines this history via a historical analysis of Meta’s changes to privacy settings. The analysis focuses on Meta as it is one of the oldest and largest of social media platforms; it also hosts a comprehensive archive of news articles, which tracks critical updates to Meta products. The study seeks to determine what privacy settings changes Meta has made, when the changes were announced, as well as analyze how these changes were framed in news articles.","",""

This dataveillance becomes salient to users through repeated exposure over time to triggers of a sense of dataveillance. This can lead to a range of consequences including democratically concerning responses such as the self-inhibition of legitimate digital communication behavior, known as the chilling effects of dataveillance. Such chilling effects are expected to subtly accumulate over time. Hence, longitudinal in-situ studies are required to capture the temporal dynamics of individuals’ perception of dataveillance and the resulting behavioral changes. Relying on a longitudinal online field experiment with a representative sample of Swiss internet users, this study investigates how chilling effects accumulate over time and aims to capture the temporal dynamics of chilling effects. Preliminary results reveal that the experimental treatment successfully heightened participants' sense of dataveillance over time. Time significantly predicted this increase, aligning with the notion of accumulating chilling effects. Furthermore, the comfort levels of the digital communication behaviors, including information searching, opinion voicing, and information disclosing, were over time lower for the experimental treatment than control condition, supporting the chilling-effects hypothesis. Accumulating chilling effects were found for information disclosing as the experimental treatment and time predicted a decrease in participants’ comfortability level. This article provides an innovative contribution to the growing research on the chilling effects of dataveillance and adds to the empirical understanding of the nature of chilling effects.","",""

With the increasing datafication of vehicles, new questions are emerging, which are troublingthe imaginaries of different actors. This paper asks: How does the future-oriented imaginary of datafication relate to current practices in vehicle data, particularly for policing? At the same time, how is this imaginary unfolding as privacy/justice concerns for activists and regulators? It draws from semi-structured interviews with over 30 people working on algorithmic surveillance—including police officers and surveillance manufacturers, but also activists and regulators. It also builds on fieldwork conducted at policing/traffic conferences, particularly sessions on “the future” or “emergent technologies”.  It finds: 1) In direct relation to Gekker &amp; Hind’s (2019) concept of “infrastructural surveillance”, that vehicles are already imagined as connected computers, constantly generating surveillance data. Among activists and regulators, this future leads to anxiety around function creep, as manufacturers may decide to change their policies, or new forms of analysis may be enabled for policing; 2) How concern over a future of data excess exists, particularly for policing institutions. This is responded through increased efforts of data integration and a techno-solutionist narrative of AI, but also smaller interventions. For activists, this relates to wider fears over """"predictive policing"""" and its injustices.  The paper thus contributes to critical data studies literature, supporting renewed considerations for privacy and justice frameworks in a world where vehicles act as infrastructures for constant surveillance.","",""
"2025","HACKERS’ PRIVACY APPROACHES: HOW PRIVACY VIOLATION AND PRIVACY PROTECTION GO HAND IN HAND","This study examines the apparent paradox of hackers engaging in both invading and safeguarding privacy. Drawing on digital materialism, which posits that code holds a material presence and cultural significance beyond its functional role, the research aims to illuminate the hackers' ethical dilemmas embedded in privacy code. To gain insight into the cultural logic behind this seeming contrast, we conducted qualitative content and code analyses on both malicious and non-malicious code projects from the open-source platform GitHub. We have narrowed down a list of 2500 hackers to 52 who own both malicious and non-malicious projects, with a reference to privacy. We found that these hackers justify their malicious projects as educational tools, often cautioning other users against illegal use. The hackers' logic asserts that those possessing private information are responsible for its protection, be it the end-user or the software owner managing the information post-collection. This logic is translated into code using two privacy approaches: a formal privacy-by-policy and a technically-oriented privacy-by-design. The hackers' polar approach to privacy materializes both in violating privacy when crafting breaching code and in writing code that expertly protects it. From this individualized, privatized standpoint, this duality makes perfect sense.","",""
"2025","WHO HAS THE POWER?: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS TO PARENTAL CONTROLS ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS","One recent trend in social media platform practices as well as in proposed policy and regulation for online data rights is a turn towards parental controls. While concerns over children’s safety online and complaints about problematic settings are not necessarily new (Horne, 2021; Horne, 2023), there may be an emerging trend in some countries to try to address growing concerns about the impact of social media platforms by setting regulation on parental controls. To that end, more research is currently needed to study parental controls and age-specific settings for teens and children, as these are comparatively newer developments and a topic and platform feature in flux. This paper contributes to this needed research area by focusing on specific definitions and understandings of privacy.  The purpose of this study is two-fold. Many social media platforms offer both age-specific privacy settings to children under certain age, as well as parental controls to manage the account of their children. As a result, this study will examine which parental controls are available and how they are offered across some of the most popular social media platforms: Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Discord, and YouTube. The dataset for this study will consist of each social media platform’s: 1. default settings of teen and children’s accounts and 2. parental control options. The analysis will broadly consider how each platform defines parental controls via privacy options.","",""
"2025","UNPACKING EXPERTISE IN THE PRIVACY TECH INDUSTRY","Companies that collect personal data have spent billions of dollars complying with a patchwork of global data privacy laws since 2018. In response, a nascent privacy tech industry has emerged, consisting of tech startups, consultants, investors, platforms, and domain experts that collectively help companies build compliant data governance programs. This study recognizes the key role of translating the law into software products by asking: how is expertise defined and encoded in the privacy tech industry? I draw on fieldwork from a broader ethnographic study of the privacy tech industry to identify three findings. First, the privacy tech industry constitutes a networked arena of relations structured by partitioning professional expertise across technical, legal, and operational domains. Second, technical expertise in the privacy tech industry is often tenuous and contingent, which could be strengthened by applying scrutiny and deliberation to evaluate the content of expertise rather than its performance. Third, boundaries of expertise are increasingly encoded in compliance software, perpetuating performative rather than scrutinized expertise. At scale, these products promote managerial processes that manifest as checkbox compliance, codifying splintered accountability and undermining the spirit of data privacy law. I argue that technology policy would benefit from scrutinizing the contents of expertise, inviting agonistic deliberation, and including lay expertise to counter the technocratic structural relations of a surveillance economy.","",""

"2025","Surveillance experiences of extinction rebellion activists and police: Unpacking the technologization of Dutch protest policing"," Recent years have witnessed an intensifying debate on the deployment of emerging surveillance technologies in protests. Often discussed in terms of “chilling effects”—where activists self-censor due to fear of surveillance repercussions—there's limited research on its effects on both activists and law enforcement. This study explores the technologization of protest policing, moving beyond the oversimplified cat-and-mouse game analogy, to examine its effects on surveillance experiences in more nuanced ways. By analyzing observations and interview data from 2023 road blockades by Extinction Rebellion in The Hague, Netherlands, this paper highlights the intricate consequences of surveillance technologies for both sides. Moving beyond the narrow legal interpretation of “chilling effects,” it uncovers two further socio-psychological sub-manifestations, showing how both groups adapt through hyper-transparency (extreme openness) and hyper-alertness (extreme caution). The study demonstrates how these experiences can be self-reinforcing, where reciprocal suspicion might contribute to a cycle of mutual distrust beyond protest contexts, but also introduces new forms of resilience. This cycle, despite lacking clear causality, bears important implications for society at large. Pervasive suspicion erodes institutional trust among activists and threatens the traditionally communicative and de-escalation-focused approach of Dutch law enforcement. Overall, this extended impact indicates that the technologization of protest policing has resulted in a hybridization of screens and streets, causing its human impacts to stretch beyond the specific times and places of demonstrations. Protest policing now encompasses a multifaceted spectrum of surveillance experiences, affecting a plethora of public values, beyond the right to protest alone. ","",""

Such beliefs are important to study because they could shape media effects and human behavior (e.g., limiting free speech around devices). We conducted a preregistered cross-sectional survey in the United States, Netherlands, and Poland (             N              = 886) to examine internet users’ surveillance beliefs and evaluate the factors related to such beliefs. The results showed that respondents had different surveillance beliefs, including e-eavesdropping, priming, coincidence, and digital traces. US respondents were most likely to believe in e-eavesdropping. A higher frequency of conversation-related advertising and shorter time perception were associated with e-eavesdropping beliefs. Moreover, in all three countries, we found a positive relation between conspiracy mentality and e-eavesdropping belief. The findings indicate the importance of contextual and individual factors and could help further understand privacy boundaries and enhance the ethical responsibility of Big Data collection strategies.

Algorithmic predictions, the story goes, turn historical data into anticipatory actions instantly and on a large scale. Recent empirical evidence, however, casts doubt on whether algorithmic predictions are best understood as being inherently actionable. In this study, we draw on adjacent debates about actionable knowledge and reconceptualize the actionability of predictions as an active and deliberate construction accomplished by the designers of algorithmic systems. We demonstrate the value of this new perspective using material from an ethnographic research project on predictive policing in Germany. Over a 12-month period, we followed the work of designers in a police research unit responsible for developing an algorithmic system that generates crime predictions. We found that an important part of the designers’ work is calibrating the predictions. When engaging in calibration work, the designers adjust the form of the statistically calculated predictions—their volume, time, and space—to reflect their assumptions of what is most actionable knowledge for frontline police officers. Our study highlights a type of work on algorithmic systems that has received little attention, but which can have a significant impact on how the intended effects of algorithmic predictions are translated into their users’ actions.

"2025","Me, pet, and robot: How home-based surveillance robot constructed different types of telepresence","Remote-control technologies have expanded into homes, potentially transforming domestic dynamics by altering how pets are monitored, interacted with, and cared for within domestic environments. This study delves into the user experiences and societal implications of Enabot, a mobile surveillance robot designed for pets in China. We employ telepresence to gauge operators’ perception of being present in a mediated and physical environment, focusing on human-animal interactions and relationships. Drawing from semi-structured interviews with 22 Chinese users, this research puts forth a typology of ‘embodied projection’ to articulate rich telepresence encounters. Moreover, we establish connections between various forms of telepresence and mediated interactions within the triadic relationship of operator-pets-others (e.g., families, friends, colleagues), surpassing the design intent for operator-pet interactions. Notably, this study finds that when operators regard Enabot as an extension of themselves, they actively seek attention from their pets, which might signal a shift of power in the human-pet dynamic and a novel relationship. Ultimately, we conclude that the utilization of this robot fundamentally serves as an act of self-care for operators.","",""

It focuses on the case of advertising attribution, a paradigm of audience and marketing measurement that attempts to determine advertising effectiveness by observing people as both media audiences and marketplace consumers. Advertising platforms have recently promised to implement ‘privacy-preserving’ methods of attribution measurement. The paper argues that these efforts to legitimize attribution make implicit claims about the values and purposes of media systems. It then introduces the concept of direct marketization to explain how these claims relate to shifts in the social and institutional norms of ad-supported media. The analysis exposes direct marketization and advertising attribution, which both fuel and depend on platform surveillance, as contradictory to the contextual integrity of democratic media.","",""

The government has dramatically expanded its power to control and regulate different forms of digital communications, exerting significant influence over what people watch, read, hear, and think. This extensive authority enables the government to monitor, surveil, censor, and shape public mood and opinion, thus placing communications under siege. In today’s world, communication technologies are deeply embedded in our daily lives as we transmit, share, and broadcast information. In India, the enduring legacy of colonial surveillance powers continues to shape and influence the surveillance over digital communications. This Dialogue paper argues that authoritarian surveillance in India is not merely a direct manifestation of the colonial legacy of British rule, but rather a fusion of enduring authoritarian features rooted in the colonial past, and the prevailing authoritarian intentions and practices of the post-colonial present.","",""

To bring a local perspective to the study of international preventative measures, I build upon the concept of “vernacular security” to examine how Tunisian imams involved in preventing violent extremism (PVE) programs understand security, violent extremism, radicalization, and their role as non-traditional security actors. To achieve this, I observe how imams describe their own experiences of security, in their own words and through their own understandings. Through ethnographic interviews conducted with local imams between 2019 and 2020, this research focuses on the way in which they perceive, re-enact, and influence security practices, with a particular focus on the relationship between religion and security, a central subject in post-revolutionary Tunisia. In so doing, this paper argues that local imams involved in PVE programs reproduce local and global security discourses, while at the same challenging their role in community policing.","",""
"2025","Styling the Surveillance Self in Fashion Media: Strategies of Sexualization and Sentimentality","The burgeoning market for wearable technologies with surveillance capabilities is reorienting our relationship with our bodies, privacy, and digital data. This expanding sector has prompted an exploration into how the surveillance of the individual body has been normalized more broadly in the fashion sphere through its visual communications practice. To this end, a multimodal critical discourse analysis following an adapted framework examined a series of photographic editorials and identified two overarching trends that characterize the representation of surveillance in female-focused fashion consumption contexts. Firstly, by adopting a visual style that uses analog aesthetics and obsolescent technology, contemporary surveillance’s obtrusive and expansive reality is obscured and replaced with hauntological nostalgia. Secondly, by framing the act of self-surveillance via screen technologies as erotically charged and potentially empowering, the body’s surveillance is celebrated rather than scrutinized. With close reference to two specific case studies, I demonstrate how these visual treatments can be interpreted as downplaying concerns about privacy and assisting in accelerating the collapse between public and private spheres. I argue that the fashion media’s aesthetic softening of surveillance has culturally foreshadowed an expansion of surveillance capitalism manifesting in the current interest in, and demand for, fashionable wearables.","",""
"2025","Authoritarian Surveillance: An Introduction","Authoritarian surveillance is no longer an exceptional or rare practice. In many parts of the world, we are witnessing an increase of pervasive government monitoring, of curtailing privacy protections, of stringent control of information flows, and of intimidation towards self-censorship. These hallmarks of authoritarian surveillance are not confined to authoritarian or undemocratic regimes. In a political landscape that favours strongarm authoritarian leaders, the boundaries between authoritarian and democratic regimes, the liberal and the illiberal ones, are blurrier than ever. The increasing availability of advanced technologies for analyzing (big) data, particularly when integrated with artificial intelligence (AI), has heightened the temptation for governments to adopt authoritarian surveillance tools and practices—and has amplified the potential dangers involved. This Dialogue section introduces the multiple dimensions of contemporary authoritarian surveillance, going beyond a dichotomy between “democratic” and “authoritarian” regimes to identify and map authoritarian surveillance in diverse geographical and political contexts. We focus on surveillance beyond the exceptional and beyond the rule of law to examine an increasingly mundane but dangerous practice undermining the limited democratic spaces that remain in our world. The seven articles in this special Dialogue section explore different angles of authoritarian surveillance— the technologies that facilitate it, the laws that govern it, and the legacies that precede it or linger thereafter—and the social and political consequences that emerge as a result. Together, this collection revisits existing literature on authoritarian surveillance, calls for a renewed scholarly focus on its consequences, and proposes new directions for future research.","",""

Drawing on ethnographic work in Britain in 2014 and in Germany between 2019–2023, it advances a consideration of the phenomenon as a form of “boundary play” (Nippert-Eng 2005). Deploying the transgressive exposure of behaviours of a human body, as expressive of transgressions across a social body, scatological references use satire to make statements around contemporary digital surveillance. Splicing this to a noteworthy absence of anthropological scholarship on the concept of privacy, the article positions privacy as an extrinsic concept, alive at the boundary, that struggles to travel across cultural contexts. While continuing to support the local extrinsic work that privacy performs, it suggests the need to construct stronger architectures of value around other phenomena synonymous with not being readable.","",""
"2025","In the Heart of Liberal Democracy: Whitewashing Authoritarian Surveillance a Decade After the Snowden Revelations","Practices of authoritarian surveillance are not limited to so-called authoritarian states. Authoritarian surveillance has been increasingly witnessed in countries that uphold liberal democratic principles and institutions in the twenty-first century, along with accelerated automation of mass surveillance. This article situates authoritarian surveillance as a problem in the heart of democracy and capitalism in its materiality and imperial expansion and discusses how mass surveillance has redrawn boundaries of democratic principles. What Edward Snowden has revealed since 2013 is a good reminder of the materiality of the global surveillance networks built under the “War on Terror” that we still live in. They are embedded within digital communication infrastructures by the security agencies in the United States, the self-defined champion of liberal democracy. Nonetheless, a decade after the Snowden revelations, the authoritarian surveillance within democracy has been whitewashed in technological competitions with the Global South, such as China and India, and in tech-savvy culture in the Global North. What is the driving force of this oblivion? In a contrast with the COVID-19 pandemic surveillance, I highlight the exceptional position given to the security intelligence and policing agencies within liberal democratic institutions to generate authoritarian surveillance continuously from the imperial to postcolonial times. It is critically important to deconstruct the binary discourse of democratic states versus authoritarian states because this view tends to only problematize surveillance activities by countries located outside the “West” and sees authoritarian surveillance practiced by self-defined democratic states as harmless or even necessary to counter perceived authoritarian states. It further fuels global dissemination of surveillance technologies, just like the nuclear arms races, and produces more victims of authoritarian surveillance on earth, without borders.","",""
"2025","Recursive Surveillance and the Persistence of Authoritarian Surveillance in Brazil","To comprehend contemporary surveillance in Brazil, especially under Bolsonaro’s administration (2019–2022), it is crucial to revisit the country’s most authoritarian period, the military dictatorship (1964–1985). During this period, the National Information Service (SNI) was established as a state intelligence agency and played a pivotal role in monitoring and suppressing dissent, setting the stage for future surveillance practices in Brazil. The military dictatorship ended in 1985, with the SNI being dissolved in 1990. In 1999, the remnants of SNI were restructured into the Brazilian Intelligence Agency (ABIN), which remains operational today. Under Bolsonaro’s government, ABIN employed advanced surveillance technologies to monitor opponents of the far-right president. Some of these surveillance practices have been deemed abusive and are currently under investigation by the Federal Police during Lula’s administration (2023–2026). This contribution introduces the concept of recursive surveillance, suggesting that state surveillance mechanisms not only reinvent themselves but also do so in ways that create the framework for their examination and eventual exposure. Surveillance structures, particularly those created in authoritarian regimes, leave traces that may reveal the practices and ideologies of the watchers, allowing for their eventual scrutiny.","",""

This article argues that during situations of long-term kidnapping, novel forms of social interaction emerge as a result of mutual surveillance practices between surveillance agents (kidnappers) and surveillance objects (kidnappees). It focuses on analysing how members of The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) (the kidnappers) and Colombian politicians, police, and army personnel (the kidnappees) conducted mutual practices and activities of surveillance during their lengthy cohabitation inside jungle kidnapping camps. It presents the results of thirty-three semi-structured interviews with victims of long-term kidnapping in Colombia and eleven structured interviews with FARC ex-combatants who were involved in kidnapping operations.

"2025","Authoritarian Surveillance Trends: Structural Racism and Transnationalism","This paper extends the “authoritarian surveillance as a practice” (Topak, Mekouar, and Cavatorta 2022) perspective by focusing on the major trends that shape authoritarian surveillance in three different contexts. It draws on authoritarian surveillance practices implemented by Turkey, Israel (in Palestine), and the European Union (EU) (at Africa-Europe borderzones) and observes that, despite different contexts and regime types, authoritarian surveillance is driven by structural racism and transnational associations. In Turkey, racialized Kurdish populations and pro-Kurdish dissident groups have been the major recipients of authoritarian surveillance practices, even though mass authoritarian surveillance has impacted large segments of the society. The Gülen community, which is a Turkey-origin transnational movement, played a major role in the intensification of authoritarian surveillance, while the EU provided indirect support because of its reliance on Turkey for stopping migrants trying to reach Europe. The EU implements authoritarian surveillance not only through responsibilizing external actors (such as in Turkey and Libya) for border policing but also through the deployment of its own border surveillance technologies. The EU drones, provided by Israeli companies, surveil and facilitate the return of black African migrants to Libya where they are subjected to crimes against humanity. The long history of European colonialism in Africa shapes the current racist use of EU drones as an authoritarian surveillance practice, which is implemented through the EU’s transnational associations involving Libyan militia groups and Israeli drone companies. In Palestine, the legacies of Israel’s settler-colonial racism against Palestinians have culminated in the current genocidal surveillance by Israel. Israel has been committing genocide within a network of transnational associations and is also one of the major exporters of authoritarian surveillance technology, ranging from spyware to drones. Through examination of these contexts, the paper argues that authoritarian surveillance is practiced by both liberal and authoritarian regimes, is driven by structural racism and is implemented through the involvement of various transnational actors.

"2025","“Anyone Who’s Watching Can See That You’re Watching, Too”: A Case Study of Prosumption and Visibility Labours on Instagram Live","Online audiences have become increasingly visible to each other. Recent work in Surveillance &amp; Society has suggested that visible viewership in gaming constitutes “visibility labour” (Abidin 2016). Yet, little work has sketched the relationship between visible consumption, visibility labours, and social media’s surveillance economy. This article fills that gap by offering a preliminary structural outline of how visible consumers play a role in digital surveillance economies. I ask: What role does visible consumption play in digital surveillance economies on Instagram Live? What kinds of visibility labour are demanded of visible consumers, and with what effects? First, top-down surveillance of user interactions turns involuntarily visible consumers into social producers through metrified viewership and personal profiles. Second, lateral surveillance, such as moderator features and reporting tools, also turns voluntarily visible consumers into social producers by reproducing Instagram’s brand and deflecting from government oversight. In the context of Instagram Live, making users’ consumption habits socially public extends surveillance culture and neoliberal trends on social media, whereby market forces are extended into further reaches of social life.","",""
"2025","Abolish privacy","This is a manifesto to reject calls to “online privacy.” Privacy is an inherently exclusionary liberal entitlement inextricably linked to property, racial oppression, sexual control and class segregation. However online privacy is uncritically promoted by academics, activists and media discourse as a civil right and even a form of social justice. We build on the arguments of feminist, queer, Black Radical traditions and GDPR legal scholars to make three arguments to the contrary. First, privacy is not social justice, but reproduces the ideologies of colonial rankings, policing and norms (racial, sexual, able-bodied and more). Second, online privacy is inextricable from private property as the exclusive legal protection of home-owners from state oversight; a liberal privilege that is easily appropriated into corporate affordances. Third, online privacy is a myth: the Internet works because its infrastructures share knowledge inferred from data, in other words there is no actual possibility of privacy, nor any real corporate incentive to privacy, except as an optic tactic to avoid accountability. Grounded in anti-capitalist social justice, our argument exceeds current liberal civil definitions of safety, such as the Human Rights based approach to Smart Cities inspired by the United Nations, the GDPR, municipal policies and environmental law. Instead we call for public, collectivized data and the complete rejection of liberal property entitlement, gatekeeping and policing known as “privacy.”","",""
"2025","Mapping the literature on surveillance capitalism: Towards an empirical research agenda","Surveillance capitalism (SC) — as intended by Shoshana Zuboff — is a fairly recent concept, but it has already attracted the attention of many scholars from various fields within social sciences. Despite this interest, a comprehensive review of the available literature on this concept is lacking. To address this gap, we systematically mapped the contributions on SC. Working on a database of 486 papers downloaded from Scopus and Web of Science, we conducted descriptive statistics to analyze the distribution of contributions over the years, the most cited works, the predominant approaches (i.e., theoretical, empirical, methodological, etc.), and the co-occurrence of keywords. Additionally, we performed a close reading of a purposive sample of 50 articles. Our analysis revealed that empirical works remain limited compared to theoretical contributions. Furthermore, both theoretical and empirical papers often lacked a specific focus on the value(s) of data, with many scholars concentrating on surveillance, privacy, and big data. Building on these findings, we propose “future research directions” to guide and inspire empirical research on SC and to better address matters of value. Specifically, we identified four main directions: “privacy and beyond”, “big data and their relation to digital platforms”, “surveillance and the culture of surveillance”, and “platformization of consumer culture”. For each “direction”, we discuss ad hoc methodological implications and strategies.","",""
"2025","Satellite surveillance and the orbital unconscious"," Satellite data are frequently attached to discourses of infallibility, objectivity and omnipresence. Yet the value of satellite data in everyday society largely depends on the strength of our interpretations, interpretations which are easily misled. Satellite images can be fabricated, misread and restricted, yet companies like Google encourage users to see themselves as active agents in a collaborative process of accumulating data, obscuring users’ true relations with satellite technology and giving them a false sense of power and anonymity. In this sense, satellites constitute a new unconscious terrain of perception. For Geert Lovink, we have reached an age where we can ‘read satellites as metaphors, as a new type of technological mirror’ and as ‘an unconscious apparatus’. This article argues that our lack of conscious awareness around the presence, nature and infrastructure of satellites allows them to thrive under the radar as a new species of unconscious surveillance technology.

"2025","Anonymous dissent: Protest, privacy, and photographic surveillance in digital media","Protesters in recent years have been making a somewhat novel demand: they are asking journalists to blur their faces in news coverage of public demonstrations. This article investigates this demand to explore how new surveillance technologies and the political economy of media are complicating the ethics of visual journalism. Reviewing 26 articles from news outlets, trade publications, and blogs published between May 2020 and October 2024 that discussed protesters’ demand, the study considers three themes: visibility and surveillance in digital media; the ethical contradictions that visual journalists navigate while documenting dissent; and the relationships among journalists, movements, and political-economic power structures. The article contrasts Enlightenment ideals with an ethic of care to understand journalists’ views on transparency and truth, concluding that the uneven power dynamics among protesters, journalists and the state raise important questions about the documentation, preservation and circulation of dissent.","",""
"2025","Comparative Approaches to Studying Privacy: Introduction to the Special Issue","             This editorial introduces the             Social Media + Society             special issue “Comparative Approaches To Studying Privacy.” Recognizing the importance of privacy in today’s digital societies and volatile political and regulatory environments, the editorial highlights the pressing need for comparative research on the topic and describes the articles in this special issue. The special issue addresses the theoretical, methodological, and practical challenges and opportunities of researching privacy across cultural, social, political, economic, and technological units of comparison. The articles in the special issue explore diverse privacy understandings, attitudes, and practices across contexts, challenging decontextualized and mono-cultural understandings in relation to social media and adjacent technologies. The special issue articles also illustrate fruitful ways privacy can be studied across different units of comparison with qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods. Several contributions in the special issue, including this editorial, not only broaden the scope of privacy research but also encourage engagement with multi-stakeholder perspectives in the context of social media, considering the role of policy, industry, and civil society. In the editorial, we briefly relate the special issue and its contributions to the comparative privacy research framework (CPRF), which serves as a useful starting point and a solid conceptual foundation for comparative privacy research. Finally, we develop a research agenda for future comparative privacy research, which critically examines position of power and epistemological biases, evaluates the comparability of the subject of study, determining and justifying relevant units of comparison, and helps to analyze how these units interact in shaping the concept of privacy.

"2025","When corporate dataveillance brings beneficial experiences","  Entertainment, information seeking, socialization: internet users are constantly dataveilled when relying on various online services to meet their diverse needs. Yet research that considers online-service peculiarities in shaping personal experiences in response to corporate data collection and analysis is scarce. This study investigates young adults’ dataveillance imaginaries, sense of dataveillance, and behavioral responses on YouTube, which extensively displays personalized content based on digital traces. Our thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with frequent users demonstrated the perceived self-evidence of dataveillance on this major platform. Users tended to accept and take advantage of, rather than resist, pervasive dataveillance practices. The results also revealed that on YouTube, dataveillance brings greater benefits because it fosters user satisfaction and confirmed that individual attitudes and behaviors related to dataveillance are highly context-dependent. Our fresh service-specific approach contributes to refining user-centered research on everyday dataveillance beyond its expected adverse consequences.  ","",""
"2025","Audiovisual Self-Confrontation: Psychiatric and Psychotherapeutic Uses of Television and Video in (West) Germany 1970s–1990s"," The history of television and video therapy in the Federal Republic of Germany is strongly linked to the working group IAAPP (Internationaler Arbeitskreis für Audiovision in Psychiatrie und Psychotherapie/International Working Group for Audiovision in Psychiatry and Psychotherapy), which was founded 1977 in West Berlin. Although a mainly German-speaking group, the IAAPP also regularly referred to studies from the U.S., but only selectively adopted their approaches concerning audiovisual practices in psychiatry. Technological and legal conditions for the implementation of television systems in psychiatric clinics were debated and elaborated by the working group and formed the basis for the development of various methods of television and video therapy. The members of the IAAPP were particularly interested in approaches to self-confrontation through video recordings which should induce self-reflection, compliance with therapeutic measures, or a coherent self-image.
