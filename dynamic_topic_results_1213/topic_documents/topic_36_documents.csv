"2003","The 'grey digital divide': Perception, exclusion and barriers of access to the Internet for older people","Focussing upon the elderly, this article utilises data discovered as researcher for Age Concern in Wigan (U.K.) and examines the feelings of older people toward the Internet. It explores the reasons why some clients and volunteers choose to use the Internet, whilst others do not, relating these perspectives to the organisations, alongside broader national (U.K.) and EU, commitments to reduce the digital divide. The article argues that for the elderly Internet usability is based upon more than availability of technology. Instead a lack of Web skills among the elderly leads to an opinion that information and communication technologies are for the young, leading to a long-term damage lack of interest in using the Internet.","",""
"2003","Ethnographic Research on the Experience of Japanese Elderly People Online"," Elderly people in Japan are becoming part of virtual communities. This article explores the online experience of such people, how they interact with others and how they construct social support relationships via computer-mediated communication (CMC). This ethnographic research, through participant observation and in-depth interviews, reveals that these elderly people enjoy interaction in a variety of language forms, ranging from haiku to emoticons, by combining traditional text-based Japanese culture with a new virtual culture, despite the limitations of text-based communication. Also, both the immediacy and asynchrony of CMC helps them to construct real human relationships in the virtual community, including social connectedness to others as well as supportive and companionship relationships. The elderly people could create a sense of greater propinquity by sharing their old stories and memories. ","",""
"2004","Creating Text for Older Audiences","       The World Health Organisation has noted the ageing of the world’s population and has emphasised the growing need for older people’s needs to be considered in a range of contexts (WHO 1999, 2001). In Australia, people over the age of 65 currently constitute approximately 13% of the population (Australian Bureau of Statistics [ABS] 2002), but this number is expected to increase to 24% by 2051 (ABS 1999).        As our population ages it will become increasingly necessary to cater to the particular needs of older audiences. This will involve a change in attitudes as the needs of this group have been largely neglected in western cultures and older people continue to be largely invisible in the media (Grossman 1998; Napoli 2002; Thomas and Wolfe 1995).        The ubiquity of the written word and our reliance on this medium in almost every aspect of our lives signifies its importance in modern life. Reliance can become problematic when individuals experience difficulties in comprehending text-based communications (Akutsu, Legge, Ross, and Schuebel 1991). This article explains the problems older people can experience when attempting to read text and provides recommendations to enable communicators to enhance text comprehension among older audiences.        Older audiences        Older people tend to feel generally neglected by the media (Chafetz et al 1998). Previous studies have found that older people are not represented in line with their numbers (Szmigin and Carrigan 2001), and that negative stereotyping of older people is common in the media (de Luce 2001; Nielson and Curry 1997). This cultural bias is reflected in inadequate knowledge and accommodation of the special needs of older audiences when it comes to comprehending text. This has implications not just for the access of older people to sources of news and entertainment, but also for their ability to obtain information important to their health and well-being. Written materials such as brochures are frequently used to disseminate health-related information to older people (Clark et al 1999), and as such there is a need to ensure that we understand how to use text effectively for older audiences.        Biological changes       Quality of eyesight is closely correlated with age (Wahl and Heyl 2003). Deterioration in eyesight usually becomes noticeable in our 40s and 50s (Stuen and Faye 2003). Stuen and Faye (2003) have described the process by which the structure of the eye changes with age. They note that the lens of the eye thickens, hardens, and becomes yellowish in colour. Reduced elasticity in the lens and a tendency for the cornea to scatter light makes it more difficult for older people to focus their eyes, making reading problematic. The pupil shrinks with age, allowing smaller amounts of light to filter into the eye to assist with vision. This results in the need for brighter reading conditions, but not too bright as glare can also interfere with light entering the deteriorating cornea.        As well as physical alterations to the eye, changes in cognitive capacity are also closely associated with ageing (Spotts and Schewe 1989). Wahl and Heyl (2003) postulate that the ageing of the central nervous system results in the deterioration of the neural pathways to the brain resulting in slower cognitive processing, including the processing of visual stimuli. Attentional capacity reduces with age, which means cognitive processing becomes more demanding (Moschis 1992). The outcome of these changes is that the older person experiences increasing difficulty in absorbing new information and evaluating unfamiliar stimuli (Moschis 1994). In particular, it appears more difficult for older audiences to remember new information that contradicts previously learned information (Rice and Okun 1994). Despite these changes in cognitive capacity, older people are reported as being able to assimilate information effectively if given ample time to do so (Moschis 1992; Tongren 1988). In addition, ensuring that new information relates to existing knowledge is likely to enhance comprehension and retention (Clark et al. 1999; Rice and Okun 1994).        Implications for text style and presentation       Age-related changes in visual acuity and cognitive processing result in the need for modifications in styles and presentation of text to maximise comprehension by older audiences. In terms of text style, font size may need to be slightly larger (Braus 1995), but not too large as people of all ages can experience reading difficulties when text is too large or too small (Akutsu et al. 1991). There are warnings against the use of all upper-case text as this impacts negatively on readability (Braus 1995). Colour may need to be manipulated to maximise contrasts to facilitate text discernment (Fairley et al 1997; Spotts and Schewe 1989). Black on white provides a high level of contrast, while shades of the same colour (for example, dark brown on light brown) provide much lower levels of contrast. Colours in the blue-green range can be particularly difficult for older eyes to discern (Braus 1995; Spotts and Schewe 1989). The use of bright colours such as red, orange, and yellow are recommended as they are relatively easy to distinguish (Clark et al. 1999). Text should be printed on matte rather than glossy paper and presented in non-glare environments to enhance readability (Braus 1995; Spotts and Schewe 1989).        In terms of text presentation, the emphasis is on selecting an appropriate message and locating it carefully. There is general consensus that information should be confined to a small number of important points that are communicated simply and explicitly (Clark et al. 1999; Rice and Okun 1994; Spotts and Schewe 1989; Tooth, Clark, and McKenna 2000). This means using concrete terms whenever possible and using abstract terms only when necessary (Clark et al. 1999). It is important to ensure that extraneous information is excluded and the most pertinent information provided first to reduce processing workload (Spotts and Schewe 1989; Tooth et al. 2000). Repetition appears particularly critical in ensuring information is retained by older audiences (Clark et al. 1999).        As older readers have greater trouble differentiating between previously learned information and new information (Clark et al. 1999), it is important to ensure that messages contain information that is related to existing knowledge in a way that will enhance assimilation (Rice and Okun 1994). It helps to locate information in uncluttered contexts and to use short lines and paragraphs (Fairley et al. 1997; Spotts and Schewe 1989). Using pictures to reinforce the message in the text can be effective (Moschis 1992), although the pictures should also be concrete rather than abstract (Clark et al. 1999). It is particularly important to test written materials designed for older audiences prior to dissemination to ensure the right messages are being received (Clark et al. 1999; Tooth et al. 2000).        To conclude, there co-exists an awareness of population ageing and a cultural bias against older people that has resulted in relatively little knowledge of the optimal design of text for older people. This article has argued that the physical changes associated with aging have significant implications for the design and presentation of text. Steps should thus be taken to ensure that written communications are modified to better meet the needs of older audiences.                 Works Cited          Akutsu, H., G. E. Legge, J. A.

"2005","From Eleanor Rigby to Nannanet: The greying of the World Wide Web"," The proportion and number of wired seniors is small. A grey gap punctuates in the digital divide. The World Wide Web is not a panacea or salve for the isolation and ageism that confronts senior citizens. Yet a proactive and political desire to wire those who are living, dancing, talking and thinking in God’s Waiting Rooms around the world provide one more safety net and social safeguard to collectivize the dispersed and dispossessed. This article uses quantitative and qualitative studies to investigate how and why older populations dis/connect from the digital environment. Commencing with international surveys monitoring Web users, the study then drills down to regions with a high proportion of older residents, exploring if and then how seniors use the World Wide Web.

"2005","Is the digital divide between young and elderly people increasing?"," Elderly people still play a minor role in research on information needs and usage patterns of Internet users. Online research and advocacy groups look optimistically at the (economic and social) potential of the active and technology–skilled elderly; other approaches dealing with the social appropriation of technology see obstacles and stress the dangers of an increasing digital divide between generations. Our objective is to refer to taken for granted normative assumptions of the digital divide discourse, highlighting different requirements for the appropriation of the Internet. Using the concept of technological generations we look at formal and informal learning of young and elderly people in the German context. We use survey material and field impressions we gained in various technology related studies. The results show that the """"two worlds apart"""" assumption (young vs. elderly people) is too simplistic. Factors like gender, education and socio–economic status still play an important role for acceptance and diffusion of a technology. The diffusion rate among the elderly is increasing, but will continue to lag behind the figures of the young users. Cultural preparations and easy access modes are essential for the elderly, who could make use of latecomer advantages. Informal learning and peer group support will be crucial for the diffusion of the Internet among the elderly. In our conclusions we look at the specific social status of the elderly cohort, which makes a comparison with other social groups very difficult.  ","",""
"2005","Less is more in Web search interfaces for older adults"," We have previously found the elderly users to face several usability problems with the current search engines. Thus, we designed an elderly–friendly search interface, Etsin. To evaluate the success of the design, a usability study was conducted for comparing the usability of Etsin and Google. The participants faced fewer usability problems when using Etsin than Google and they valued the clarity of the Etsin interface. In conclusion, elderly users benefit from a simplified search engine interface that is easy to understand and that takes into account age–related issues.   ","",""
"2005","‘Getting on’: older New Zealanders’ perceptions                 of computing"," This article explores older New Zealanders’ perceptions of the barriers to, benefits and negative consequences of computer-based information and communication technologies (ICTs) through the analysis of focus group discussions involving 98 respondents. Older people engage with computers in a context constituted by discourses positioning them as declining in the ability to learn skills such as computing, but creating a burden on society if they do not. In this paradoxical context, participants identified emotional and material barriers, as well as benefits and negative consequences to computer use that are shaped by age and gender. Significant gaps between the New Zealand Government’s identification of the benefits of computing for older people and the benefits identified by older people themselves are highlighted. The article argues for the need for a more balanced approach acknowledging potential negative consequences, promoting the ‘people-centred’ benefits of computer use over and above the national economic benefits emphasized in the government’s drive to encourage older people’s uptake of computer-based ICTs.

Semi–structured, open–ended interviews were conducted among members of two senior–oriented computer training organizations: SeniorNet in the U.S. and OldKids (lao xiaohai) in China. Major findings include: first, American and Chinese participants share a similar, strong interest in learning in general and computer learning in particular, because they agree that computers present constant mental challenges and thus are useful for keeping the mind active, which suggests a non–culturally specific phenomenon. Second, for American participants, the computer is one of many means to keep the mind active, while for Chinese participants, the computer is the most important means to this end. Finally, for some older Chinese participants, computer learning is perceived as a means to fulfill old dreams that were interrupted by the Cultural Revolution, suggesting a culturally specific phenomenon. Implications and future research questions are discussed.","",""

About 70 per cent of online seniors report using the internet for health information. This study uses grounded theory to explore online health communication among older Americans.

"2008","Should We Be Concerned That the Elderly Don't Text?","The elderly are generally “out of the loop” when it comes to texting and other new technologies. On the one hand, the elderly do not often send text messages and thus signal their ability and willingness to use the medium. On the other hand, stereotyping by the younger users perhaps inhibits them from sending text messages to the elderly. Is the non-use of texting by the elderly because of self-exclusion or lack of exposure or both? Should this be of concern to us?","",""
"2009","‘It could be useful, but not for me at the moment’: older people, internet access and e-public service provision"," Older people are commonly constructed as a group of heavy users of public services that misses out on opportunities presented online, mainly due to age-related barriers to accessing the internet. Drawing on a study of internet access in sheltered homes for older people, this article argues for the need to focus electronic service provision around the needs, preferences and abilities of the users of public services. A user-centred perspective in e-government and e-service provision requires an understanding of the socially shaped and locally situated nature of media use, which can in turn help prevent the tendency to see chronological age as the sole factor determining (non-) engagement with the internet. It also requires investment in making available assistance and support to access online digital media in order to prevent the disadvantaging of vulnerable service users. ","",""
"2009","When you retire, does everything become leisure? Information and communication technology use and the work/leisure boundary in retirement","This article explores how computer technologies relate to experiences of work and leisure in retirement. It is argued that the literature on information and communication technology (ICT) use and leisure has neglected older age groups, while research on older adults and internet use fails to explore the subjective meanings of activities as work or leisure. This article examines these issues, drawing on qualitative data from interviews with eight retired couples in the UK. The findings show varied levels of engagement with computer and internet technologies as leisure and illustrate how the boundaries of work/leisure/retirement are challenged and reconstructed in relation to technology use. The use of computers and internet for leisure was not differentiated according to gender, although there were gender differences in negotiation of work/leisure/ retirement boundaries. The hesitance among many retirees to define computer technologies as leisure, and their restriction of other leisure technologies, suggests generational and possibly class issues.","",""
"2010","GOODS NOT WANTED","In societies where the use of computers is pervasive, individuals who resist using the technology are often studied in order to determine how susceptible their views might be to change. This research takes a different approach, focusing not on the non-use of computers as a problem but as an opportunity to explore how the proponents of such views make sense of computers and computer use and to accord respect for, rather than dismissal of, their views. Underpinned by a narrative sense-making approach, the investigation examines older non-users' discursive performances of rejection and the ways in which they draw on and position themselves in relation to dominant and emerging socio-cultural narratives of technology and the ways in which those performances are circumscribed by particular value systems or choice behaviours. Participants drew on three prominent socio-cultural narratives in making sense of computers and in performing rejection: computers benefit older people; society discriminates against non-users; and don't need computers, don't want computers. These three narratives work together to enable non-users to justify their rejection of computer use. The study makes a contribution to the literature by highlighting dimensions of older people's relationships with computers not previously identified, including an appreciation for the complex and often tension-filled process by which determinations of rejection are made.","",""

To achieve this, research is needed in how specific demographic segments seek out and use online communication. A growing online audience segment is adults 50 years old and older, important organizational stakeholders. A layered case study, utilizing surveys and interviews, presents an organization’s research on Web–based communication strategy with older adults. The findings reveal several important communication dynamics for online interaction with audiences. These include: how older adults prefer to seek out and receive information; the importance of a technology’s ease of use; increasing uses of social media profiles; and, personal contact.","",""

What kind of images do they use to depict the computer and the internet? How do the social representations of the computer and the internet express the respondents’ distinct identities, interests, history and culture? The research data consist of written accounts by Finnish elderly people living in non-urban environments. Their social representations can be summarized as follows: the computer and the internet are useless and risky ‘tools and things’ that threaten one’s freedom, lifestyle, health and security as well as create differences between users and non-users. The study shows how some elderly people’s distinct identities, interests, history and culture may limit their motivation and capacity to welcome and use the computer. ","",""
"2012","‘Without it I am nothing’: The internet in the lives of older immigrants"," This article aims to explore how using the internet may facilitate coping with the challenges of immigration in later life, based on the case of older Jewish immigrants from the Former Soviet Union in Israel. For that purpose, in-depth interviews were conducted with 32 immigrants living in southern Israel. Results indicated that internet usages by the study participants were: (1) Managing health; (2) Nurturing professional interests; (3) Maintaining and extending social networks; (4) Appreciating the past; and (5) Enjoying leisure. Each usage seemed to preserve and even strengthen the participants’ self-worth and improve their quality of life. These findings suggest that older immigrants who use the internet practice, in fact, strategies of successful ageing, which help them to cope not only with the challenges associated with ageing, but also with the tremendous difficulties and losses posed by immigration.

Older adults perform much of this work, and being a volunteer has been identified as a predictor of successful aging. Despite its prevalence and importance in this demographic group, volunteering remains understudied in the field of communication. This theoretical article integrates work from various disciplines to examine the topics of volunteering and successful aging through a communication lens. After defining volunteering, we systematically outline how communication can inform the study of volunteering. We then briefly highlight potential determinants and motivations for older adults’ volunteering and examine the link between volunteering and successful aging, arguing that many of the documented benefits of volunteering may in fact result from the  communicative  opportunities it affords. Finally, we outline an agenda for future research on communication, successful aging, and volunteering.","",""

Inviting elders as participants, this investigation aimed for full descriptions of individual cases, while also attempting to identify general trends and significant patterns among them. This empirical study comprises a two-year research project. The first year involves an exploratory study, including surveying the related literature and identifying key concepts. During the second year, this study designed a ‘Story Frame’, and conducted case studies and qualitative interviews. Story Frame is an artefact to record the vocalised responses of elderly subjects when viewing photos of the past. To better understand digital material regarding reminiscing in simple form, this study establishes conditions to identify families to participate in three studies using Story Frame. The results indicate that sharing the recorded audio-photos can trigger further conversations. By successfully catalysing embodied and social interaction, reminiscence can establish self-identity, improve social connectedness and create feelings of well-being.","",""
"2013","Deliberate missed calls: A meaningful communication practice for seniors?"," In this article I discuss the phenomenon of deliberated missed calls and their intentional use by senior mobile phone users in Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain). Deliberate missed calls (DMC) are made with the intention that the receiver is not to answer them. Although this multiregional and multicultural practice is described in different countries, no specific study has been carried out on its use by the older population. To address this absence, this article explores the significance of using deliberate missed calls among seniors. There are three main conclusions. First, personal abilities and external support shape the way seniors use DMC. Second, seniors may abandon, or at least redefine, the use of deliberate missed calls if they change to a flat-rate contract. Finally, the focus on an already old innovation such as DMC allows us to observe the importance of accounting for the heterogeneity of older people if we are to properly analyze their mobile communication practices.

"2014","Revisiting the digital divide in Canada: the impact of demographic factors on access to the internet, level of online activity, and social networking site usage","The present study relies on the 2010 Canadian Internet Use Survey to investigate differences in people's access to the internet and level of online activity. The study not only revisits the digital divide in the Canadian context, but also expands current investigations by including an analysis of how demographic factors affect social networking site (SNS) adoption. The findings demonstrate that access to the internet reflects existing inequalities in society with income, education, rural/urban, immigration status, and age all affecting adoption patterns. Furthermore, the results show that inequality in access to the internet is now being mimicked in the level of online activity of internet users. More recent immigrants to Canada have lower rates of internet access; however, recent immigrants who are online have significantly higher levels of online activity than Canadian born residents and earlier immigrants. Additionally, women perform fewer activities online than men. People's use of SNSs differs in terms of education, gender, and age. Women were significantly more likely to use SNSs than men. Interestingly, high school graduates had the lowest percentage of adoption compared to all other education categories. Current students were by far the group that utilized SNSs the most. Canadian born, recent, and early immigrants all showed similar adoption rates of SNSs. Age is a strong predictor of SNS usage, with young people relying heavily on SNSs in comparison to those aged 55+. The findings demonstrate that the digital divide not only persists, but has expanded to include inequality in the level of online activity and SNS usage.","",""
"2015","The implications of information and communication technology use for the social well-being of older adults","Older adults, comprising a population segment more vulnerable to social isolation during the late life stages, are more likely to be excluded from the benefits of information and communication technologies (ICTs) as well as from the focus of ICT research. Addressing this research gap concerning the currently fastest growing sector of ICT users this study centers on the disparities regarding older adults’ ICT access and use. Because the effects of ICTs cannot be uniform for all users, the digital inequalities older adults experience might have different influences on their social lives when compared to other populations that have been studied in the previous literature. Drawing on surveys from 1780 older adults, ages 60 years and older, residing in six suburbs in the Chicago area, this research links older adults’ digital inequalities to their social well-being. We demonstrate that while socio-economic status remains the major factor affecting their quality of life, social and instrumental ICT uses can also contribute to their well-being in varied and unexpected ways. From these results, we draw implications for the study of digital disparities by examining how the impacts of ICTs vary by differential uses and different age groups.","",""
"2015","Lifelong learning in the digital age: A content analysis of recent research on participation","This paper presents results from a cross-disciplinary content analysis of 185 recent research articles, published between 2008 and 2013. These papers examined factors affecting adult participation in lifelong learning, based on the availability and use of Internet-based and face-to-face modes of learning. Articles were written by scholars from 39 countries, including the European Union (EU), United States (U.S.), Canada, Australia, and, to a lesser extent, from developing and newly industrialized countries, such as Mexico, Brazil, China, and Taiwan. Despite widespread assumptions as to online learning’s potential and promise, articles focused on traditional face-to-face learning and training modes more than Internet-based modes. Seven thematic research areas were identified from the dataset: four major and three emerging themes. Key findings from 40 studies about the adult participation in learning in the workplace and community-based programs are highlighted. These papers present broad and deep investigations about diverse groups of lifelong learners previously unstudied, while equity issues pertaining to access and availability of training and learning opportunities are addressed. Directions for future research are identified and discussed.","",""
"2015","Communicating age in Second Life: The contributions of textual and visual factors"," Although considerable research has identified patterns in online communication and interaction related to a range of individual characteristics, analyses of age have been limited, especially those that compare age groups. Research that does examine online communication by age largely focuses on linguistic elements. However, social identity approaches to group communication emphasize the importance of non-linguistic factors such as appearance and non-verbal behaviors. These factors are especially important to explore in online settings where traditional physical markers of age are largely unseen. To examine ways that users communicate age identity through both visual and textual means, we use multiple linear regression and qualitative methods to explore the behavior of 201 players of a custom game in the virtual world Second Life.

"2015","How elders evaluate apps: A contribution to the study of smartphones and to the analysis of the usefulness and accessibility of ICTS for older adults"," Elders are an important part of this society and a group for which ICTs might provide useful answers to existing problems and needs. However, elders and their interests with regard to ICTs have been largely ignored due to a presupposed missing ability to use, a general disinterest in, and a lack of will to learn about ICT developments. This article wants to contribute to the debate about elders and their abilities to use and interests in ICTs. We analysed how elders in focus groups in Spain use mobile ICT applications, how they experiment with them and why they decide to use or not to use them. In our research, we have used apps as an example for ICTs because apps are considered to be flagships for technological innovation, and because, in contrast to call and messenger functions of mobile phones, the motivation for using apps has to come from the individual that uses them. Findings from 4 focus group discussions with elders from Spain suggest that age does not directly influence the perception of, experience with, and evaluation of newest technological developments. Instead past experiences and social contexts in which the technology is introduced play a role. Our results point at the need to find new formulas for introducing, and teaching ICTs to elders, and underline the need to take elders’ emotions with regard to ICTs into consideration when evaluating elders’ ICT uses.

"2016","The capacity of elderly citizens to access digital media in Andalusia (Spain)","ABSTRACT In most of the European Union (EU) countries, including Spain, there has been an increase in the number of inhabitants aged 55 years or older. As of 2014, in the EU (27) more than 65% of the population uses the internet daily. However, among the elderly, the percentage is drastically lower. This type of occurrence is found in technologically advanced societies, and turns the older citizens into a forgotten collective. With the digital divide (defined as physical access to the internet) surmounted in these countries, a new divide is becoming apparent in terms of personal use and societal participation. In this article, through the use of multivariate analysis techniques, we identify a new divide in Andalusia, Spain, with respect to the frequency of access to new media and the use citizens make of them. We will discuss the influence of the elderly's immediate environment as a source of opportunity for the Information and Communication Technologies to improve our quality of life and as a medium for more active social participation.","",""
"2016","Interviews with digital seniors: ICT use in the context of everyday life","ABSTRACT The literature on the digital divide suggests that seniors continue to lag behind in access to the Internet, digital skills, and engagement in various online activities. Much of the research, however, gains insight from large-scale survey research and neglects to examine the challenges and opportunities that digital seniors, those who are connected, experience in their everyday use of information and communication technologies (ICTs). We employed the theoretical lens of ICT use in the context of everyday life to inform this study. Twenty-one digital seniors (60 +) took part in interviews about how ICTs influenced their routines and practices such as news consumption, library use, information seeking, and reading. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using grounded theory. Three key findings emerged. First, digital seniors are developing new practices and routines around their ICT use; these are novel and emerge out of ICTs’ affordances. Second, digital seniors are creating hybrid practices, where they seamlessly combine traditional habits with new ones emerging from ICT use. Finally, digital seniors are recreating existing practices with digital means, i.e. the digital enhances or sometimes even replaces traditional practices. We find that agency is central to our understanding of digital seniors’ adoption and use of ICTs, they critically consider various options, and make choices around their preferences, convenience of use, and affordability. For digital seniors, ICT use is not a binary because they want to have the flexibility to choose for themselves under what circumstances and for what purposes the use of ICTs is appropriate.","",""
"2016","Mapping the two levels of digital divide: Internet access and social network site adoption among older adults in the USA","ABSTRACT Older adults have increasingly adopted Internet and social network sites (SNSs), but little communication scholarship has explored systematic differences in access within this population. Using a nationally representative sample of Americans over the age of 50 years from the 2012 Health and Retirement Study, we examine Internet access (N = 18,851) and SNS adoption patterns (N = 869) among this sample and explore how these patterns vary by age. Regarding Internet access, results suggest that while the gender divide has reversed in favor of women, older adults who are economically, socioculturally, or physically disadvantaged are less likely to have reliable Internet access. In addition, the view that the various divides in Internet access are less of a concern for those who are younger is only partially supported, as some access-related divides do not vary by age or even decrease with age. For SNS adoption, we found that access to technological resources (diversity of online activities) positively predicts SNS use. Moreover, SNS users are more likely to be younger, female, widowed, and homemakers, perhaps because these individuals are more motivated to use SNSs to complement or compensate for their existing social status. These findings reveal unique challenges and motivations in relation to Internet access and SNS adoption patterns across the later life span.","",""

The oldest age group fell behind younger age groups not only in regards to ownership and access, but also the scope and intensity of Internet connectedness. Within age groups, disparities in Internet connectedness was found in the oldest age group, while disparities in connecting to television, newspapers and radio was found in the youngest and middle age groups. Mass media connectedness was found to have a negative relationship with PC Internet connectedness in the oldest age group. Implications for the evolution of media connectedness and disconnectedness across different generations are discussed.","",""

Yet, while the digital divide is closing for young cohorts, it is still an issue when comparing various generations. This study focuses specifically on the so-called ‘grey divide’, a divide among seniors of age 65+ years. Based on a representative survey in Switzerland ( N = 1105), it is found that Internet use is strongly skewed in this age group leading to a partial exclusion of the old seniors (70+). Logistic regression shows that gender differences in usage disappear if controlled for education, income, technical interest, pre-retirement computer use and marital status. Furthermore, the social context appears to have a manifold influence on Internet use. Encouragement by family and friends is a strong predictor for Internet use, and private learning settings are preferred over professional courses. Implications for digital inequality initiatives and further research are discussed. ","",""

We draw inspiration from the ability of interactive art technology to merge electronics into artifacts whose aesthetics are shaped by their craft components. We believe such artifacts hold great potential to engage older adults and significantly improve their daily lives. Therefore, we developed an interactive art-making program for seniors at local assisted-living facilities aimed to enhance cognitive engagement, social connectedness and sense of well-being in older adults. This article examines the physical and mental experience of our participants as they made electronic cards by hand and explores new approaches to electronics construction that leverages the affordances of other related handicrafts.","",""
"2017","Connected seniors: how older adults in East York exchange social support online and offline","ABSTRACT How do older adults mobilize social support, with and without digital media? To investigate this, we focus on older adults 65+ residing in the Toronto locality of East York, using 42 interviews lasting about 90 minutes done in 2013–2014. We find that digital media help in mobilizing social support as well as maintaining and strengthening existing relationships with geographically near and distant contacts. This is especially important for those individuals (and their network members) who have limited mobility. Once older adults start using digital media, they become routinely incorporated into their lives, used in conjunction with the telephone to maintain existing relationships but not to develop new ones. Contradicting fears that digital media are inadequate for meaningful relational contact, we found that these older adults considered social support exchanged via digital media to be real support that cannot be dismissed as token. Older adults especially used and valued digital media for companionship. They also used them for coordination, maintaining ties, and casual conversations. Email was used more with friends than relatives; some Skype was used with close family ties. Our research suggests that policy efforts need to emphasize the strengthening of existing networks rather than the establishment of interventions that are outside of older adults’ existing ties. Our findings also show that learning how to master technology is in itself a form of social support that provides opportunities to strengthen the networks of older adults.","",""
"2017","Older audiences in the digital media environment","ABSTRACT Relying on Jensen and Helles’ model for studying the Internet as a cultural forum, this study aimed to explore the extent to which traditional media are displaced by innovative communication practices within the older audience of new media. The study was based on a cross-European survey of 1039 Internet users aged 60 years and up. Results indicated that older Internet users are significantly more inclined to use traditional mass media than new social media and prefer synchronous to asynchronous mass media. This audience, however, is not homogeneous, as four subsegments were identified. These groups differed in their media repertoires, sociocultural background and leisure preferences. The findings suggest that despite the increasing percentage of older Internet users, this audience tends to adhere to familiar media practices, with only a minority making intense use of new practices. With very few cross-national differences, this tendency appears to be universal, suggesting overall media use traditionalism and a second-level digital divide among the older audience.","",""

Simultaneously, societal ageism, manifested in institutional policies and practices, hinders the agency of older adults. These findings suggest that community-based technology support services need to transcend ageism and embrace the agency of community elders, who are a growing and important segment of local communities throughout the world.","",""
"2017","Education in civic participation: Children, seniors and the challenges of an intergenerational information and communications technology program"," This article investigates an intergenerational information and communications technology (ICT) program that seeks expressly to enhance children’s civic participation by placing them in mutually educational encounters with seniors. Applying Devine’s model of the interrelationship among structure, power, and agency, it problematizes this goal by analyzing the dialectics of the power relations between seniors and children who maintain a technology-driven relationship. The data were gathered via qualitative participant-observation in two elementary schools. The results reveal clashing implications for children’s empowerment as computer “teachers” and their experiencing of agency. Implementation of Devine’s theoretical model sheds light on the meanings of the stereotyped terms “digital natives” and “digital immigrants,” as well as on the a-stereotyped senior’s identity as “digital consumers.” The conclusions suggest that the technological gap may not be definitive in confirming young people’s supremacy in the generational hierarchy, signaling the need for caution in handling this gap via civic empowerment in an educational setting.

"2018","Adoption and feasibility of a communication app to enhance social connectedness amongst frail institutionalized oldest old: an embedded case study","ABSTRACT The risks of social isolation and loneliness are becoming emergent issues for older adults (aged 65+) in industrialized countries, particularly for oldest old people (80+) who are frail and institutionalized. Socially isolated and lonely older people are more likely to experience depression, social disengagement, cognitive and physical decline, morbidity, and early mortality. In response to these significant negative health and socioeconomic costs, research suggests using new technologies to enhance opportunities for social connectedness as a strategy to help alleviate both social isolation and loneliness. In this context, following a participatory design method, we developed an accessible communication app with and for frail institutionalized older adults. To test the adoption of this innovative technology and its feasibility to address social isolation and loneliness, we conducted a two-month deployment of the app in a long-term care home with five oldest old and their relatives. Due to access, recruitment, and ethical challenges, the oldest old are a specially understudied group. Using an embedded case study (based on interviews, psychometric scales, field observations, and usability and accessibility testing) and a recursive approach to technology studies, our findings show that technology adoption is based on a complex set of interrelated factors: social, attitudinal, physical, digital literacy, and usability. We also discuss the feasibility of the app to enhance perceived social connectedness amongst our target population, provided that at least one strong tie is involved and communication norms and expectations across generations are considered.","",""
"2018","Opportunities and challenges of the digital lifespan: views of service providers and citizens in the UK","ABSTRACT Information about UK citizens’ use of digital technologies is often expressed in statistics – x% lack Internet access; y% get online to engage in online banking, update social media sites, or participate in online auctions. There are many social implications to digital technology use, however – individuals may communicate online as a major way to stay in touch with friends and family, and as Internet access rises and government and public sector budgets shrink, online services become an increasingly attractive way for government and public sector service providers to communicate with citizens. This paper presents selected results of an exploratory study designed to investigate the digital personhood of UK citizens through interviews with participants at three life transitions: leaving secondary school, becoming a parent, and retiring from work. Digital personhood in this paper implies identity information online, and some interaction with others around that information. We then report on our presentation of a selection of these results to thirteen stakeholders who represented UK government departments, public sector organisations, and industry. We found that citizen and stakeholder concerns were quite different, especially at the new parent life transition, and that stakeholders tended to underestimate the willingness and ability of citizens to become involved online with the government and public sector, and overestimate citizens’ vulnerability online. Future research should investigate practical strategies for increasing communication between stakeholders and citizens, and also how to encourage stakeholders to work together to benefit their common clientele – the citizens.","",""
"2018","Are older adults networked individuals? Insights from East Yorkers’ network structure, relational autonomy, and digital media use","ABSTRACT Networked individualism is a critical concept about the transition of the societal shift from geographically bounded local groups to the contemporary network society comprised of sparse, permeable, and dynamic communication networks. An underlying assumption about networked individuals thus far in the literature is that they are at a younger age. There are fears that older adults have been left behind in this transition to networked individualism. In this study, we are the first to inquire to what extent ‒ and in what ways ‒ are older adults networked individuals. Using in-depth interviews with 41 older adults living in the East York area of Toronto, we used a combination of quantitative coding, thematic analysis, and individual profiling to analyze their social network structure, relational autonomy, and digital media use. Our findings render a rather complex and nuanced picture, showing three types of older adults along the spectrum of networked individualism: networked individuals, socially connected but not networked individuals, and socially constrained individuals. Although most participants are socially connected, those who are networked individuals actively manage and navigate multiple, diverse, and non-redundant social networks. Digital media use is neither necessary nor sufficient in qualifying a person as a networked individual as the great majority of East Yorkers ‒ even if not networked individuals ‒ integrate digital media into their everyday lives.","",""

It draws inspiration from Boltanski’s pragmatist sociology of critique and the notion that people’s own take on their situation are fruitful sources of information in the quest for emancipation. It employs the notions of ideology, power and inclusion – which are central to critical scholarship – to make sense of older active ICT users’ understandings of digitisation. In doing so, it explores the fruitfulness of the critical lens for studies of ICT users while bringing attention to older active ICT users’ critical capacities. ","",""

In this essay, we bring literatures of (cultural) ageing studies and (new) media studies into conversation with each other by asking what future directions for research on older people and their media lives from the particular perspective of social diversity could be.

This research investigates the association between two important aspects in later life, media usage and social participation, among 36,282 home-dwelling adults aged 60 and above in over 138 municipalities of Belgium’s Flanders region. The data are collected through a participatory research method, in which older adults are recruited and trained as research volunteers. Media is categorised into new media (Internet) and traditional/old media (newspaper, TV, community newsletter), while social participation is divided into formal and informal participation. The results of hierarchical linear regression and logistic binary regression analysis show that reading the community newsletter, reading the newspaper, and Internet usage are positively correlated with formal and informal social participation, whereas watching TV shows a negative correlation with both participation forms. Finally, the implications of the association between older adults’ traditional media usage and social participation are discussed.","",""

Relying on technological and functional approaches in communications research, this study explores how media displacement processes serve as mechanisms that regulate seniors’ media consumption in various sociocultural environments. The study is based on a survey of 6989 Internet users aged 60 and older from six countries (Austria, Denmark, Israel, the Netherlands, Romania and Spain), and compares usage rates and time spent using old media with that allotted to consumption of their digital equivalents. Furthermore, it examines levels of media displacement in different countries and explores the factors explaining such displacement. Results indicate a high media displacement with regard to newspapers and magazines, followed by book reading, with a relatively marginal transition to online TV and radio. Displacement levels vary among participating countries and are highest in Spain and Israel, with differences remaining significant even after controlling for background characteristics. The most significant displacement predictor, however, is the variety of users’ online activities. These findings suggest that despite the increasing percentage of older Internet users, this audience tends to adhere to familiar media practices. Nevertheless, it also exhibits selective displacement that is highly dependent on users’ media habits, the relative advantages of each medium and sociocultural contexts. Such selectivity may be considered a specific strategy for setting, pursuing and maintaining personal goals in later life.","",""

Data so far show the existence of a digital divide, so the question becomes: Is there a way to accelerate the digital inclusion of older adults? Using microdata from Buenos Aires (Argentina), Lima (Peru) and Guatemala City (Guatemala), this paper focuses on the role of younger people in the household in the process of Internet adoption by older adults. Regression analysis confirms that younger people play a pivotal role in the adoption process, but not in intensity of use, in which living with a spouse or partner is important for increasing the number of hours spent using the Internet.","",""

As such, a significant portion of the population enters old age, it is imperative to understand the tools and mechanisms that may aid in the maintenance and improvement of older adults’ well-being. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are tools that may promote well-being through increased connectedness and reduction of isolation and depression. We suggest that ICT use may also enhance mattering, an individual's belief that they are important, acknowledged, and relied upon by others. This study examines the effect of ICT use on older adults’ sense of mattering. Data were collected as part of a multi-site randomized controlled trial study. The aim of the study was to assess the effects of ICT training and use on older adults’ quality of life and well-being. The sample included participants from 19 assisted and independent living communities. Results of our longitudinal and mediation analyses reveal that ICT use, through the promotion of social connectedness, has a significant and positive relationship with mattering. These results suggest that ICT use that facilitates connection and communication with social ties will be beneficial for enhancing well-being among older adults.","",""

Degrees of ICT access and literacy among senior citizens","ABSTRACT Drawing on data derived from a nationwide postal survey (n = 1264) with a simple random sample of Swedes between ages 65 and 85 (response rate: 63%), the article analyses the general patterns of: (a) degrees of information and communication (ICT) access and (b) ICT-literacy among Swedish senior citizens. The overall patterns of access and literacy are analysed in light of senior citizens’ assets – conceptualized as material, discursive and social resources – and their age and gender. The analysis reveals a positive correlation between levels of material (e.g., income), discursive (e.g., English skills) and social (e.g., social networks) resources and access to ICT. With greater resources, the average number of devices increases. The analysis also reveals a positive correlation between discursive and social resources and ICT-literacy. Gender has no bearing on access to devices, but might have some effect on ICT-literacy. The correlation between age, access and literacy is negative. With increasing age, both access and literacy decreases. In this respect, the study reveals a generational effect. However, since all three resources tend to decrease over the life cycle, the results are also discussed in terms of an age effect. These data and our analyses are contextualized by a critical discussion that reflects on the implications of these general patterns: What do they mean for senior citizens’ abilities to be included and participate in a continuously digitalizing society?","",""
"2019","Slow Side of the Divide?","Abstract                 Older ICT non-users are often considered vulnerable and potentially socially and digitally excluded group. More recently age-based digital divides have been questioned by scholars aiming to provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between old age and technology non-use. Following this path, this article takes the experiences of being an older non- and/or seldom-ICT user and their potential exclusion as point of departure to talk about ideas and understandings of digital technologies and social change. The goal is to empirically explore and understand how the ideas and experiences of ICT nonusage are shared, and negotiated, among older non- and seldom-ICT users. The lived experience of different waves of mediatisation is a specific position in the life course allowing older people to reflect back upon changes prompted by technological development. The empirical data consist of six focus group interviews conducted in Sweden in 2017 with 30 older (65+) non- and seldom-users of ICT between the ages of 68 and 88 years. The results of the analysis show that by describing the ideas and experiences of non- and/or seldom-ICT use, the informants offer a broader reflection on social change and an ambivalent picture of social acceleration. They agree namely that digitalisation is an inevitable process but argue simultaneously that several practices connected to it are not necessarily making our lives easier. Participants experience the socio-technological development in the past 30 years as a very fast one, while adjustment to it deems to occur in a rather slow and weary way. It could be suggested that the nexus of old age on the one hand and non/seldom-ICT usage on the other, as well as their position in life, offer a perspective that can challenge the idea that technological development, ICT access and use are synonymous with efficiency, convenience and inclusion.","",""

We investigated older adults’ willingness to use six distinct emerging technologies, which can allow older adults to better manage their health and maintain independence. Data were collected by using a large-scale cross-sectional online survey, which we designed and administered using Qualtrics. The analytical sample (N = 1148) reflected the sociodemographic characteristics of the US older adult population (aged 65 and older) based on the 2010 Census. A series of nested binary logistic regression models were used to assess the willingness to use each type of emerging technology. Our descriptive findings indicated that 19% of participants were willing to use autonomous vehicles, 24% were willing to use assistive robots, 37% were willing to use Internet-connected home appliances, 48% were willing to use Internet-connected cameras for home monitoring, 29% were willing to use a smart home with a built-in personal digital assistant, and 15% were willing to use virtual reality. Our binary logistic regression results revealed that health variables, e.g., limitations with instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) and self-reported health status (SRHS), had statistically significant associations with willingness to use some emerging technologies, such as assistive robots. Our study provides novel insights regarding US older adults’ willingness to use a range of emerging technologies. The findings may help guide future interventions aimed at enhancing health and independence for older adults.","",""

Research on support-seeking for digital media use has primarily considered informal sources such as family and friends, and formal sources such as people employed to provide assistance. Yet, people may also seek support online. Social network sites and other online communities are often used to ask questions on a wide range of topics from both friends and strangers. Drawing on a survey of young adults aged 25–26, we find that online question-asking, although used less frequently than informal and formal support, is a relevant source of support, which expands users’ available resources and has the potential to improve Internet skills. Results show that Internet skills and social capital explain differences in support-seeking behaviors among young adults informing our understanding of how inequities in social support, and ultimately digital inequalities, manifest themselves in this realm of Internet use.","",""

To prevent spread of the virus, social distancing has become the norm worldwide. However, with social distancing comes significantly less face-to-face interaction, which may be particularly harmful to older adults given their existing levels of loneliness. While social technologies can be used to provide critical social interaction during this time of necessary physical distancing, older adults tend to either lack access to these technologies or the skills and experience necessary to use them effectively. Once online, older adults face the additional challenge of being outsized targets of misinformation and scams, both of which abound in the context of COVID-19. In this essay, we discuss the challenges faced by older adults in their use of digital media for social connection in the present pandemic, as well as highlight some of the population’s untapped strengths which can be leveraged to help them live prosperous online lives. Finally, we provide recommendations for actions which key stakeholders can take to support older adults in this pursuit. ","",""

This article presents qualitative research and finds that older people—namely, men and women at least 65 years of age—are highly selective in the digital domain, and diversity marks their attitudes toward and uses and critiques of digital technologies. Thus, older people’s digital inclusion is marked by intragenerational diversity, in which a complex interplay of structural/external and individual/internal factors exists and aging plays a context- and life-experience–driven role. Thus, this article supports a psychosocial approach that views age identity as formed not only by biology, but also on the basis of sociocultural and other systemic factors that are integrated and adapted and create varying differences at the level of the individual. The article closes with theoretical and empirical recommendations for future research on the role of aging in older people’s digital inclusion.","",""

What         balance of independence and interdependence do older adults seek and experience as they         attempt to take up new devices and applications, such as tablets and video chat, during a         period of physical distancing? I introduce “strivers,” “achievers,” and “maintainers” to         describe different experiences of in(ter)dependence that emerged at the intersection of         technology use and physical distancing for participants during and after the technology         training program. Independence is reflected among those who were able to translate provided         technology resources into an expanded social presence during the pandemic. Interdependence         relates to those who became even more dependent on others, with the addition of needed         technology support, while aspiring to replace offline relationships with those promised         through digital technologies. Simultaneously, by declaring oneself “not lonely despite being         alone,” others declared independence despite failing to realize the promise of digital         technology as a stand-in for in-person connection. Research on older adults and digital         technology can benefit from examining not only the possession of digital skills and support         for technology use, but also the meanings that older adults bring to their experiences of         inclusion and exclusion as they adapt to digital technologies while aging – and sheltering –         in place.","",""
"2021","Exploring heterogeneous ICT use among older adults: The warm experts’ perspective"," In this article, we (1) examine the various forms of support required by older users (75+) of digital technology and (2) provide a concrete, everyday life rationale for why warm experts play such a pivotal role in the processes of adopting and using ICT. Although warm experts are usually not older adults themselves, they provide an important mediating view on the technology use among older people that has not been rigorously addressed in previous studies. Thus, in our analysis we examine the younger family members’ views on acting as warm experts to their older family members. The research data consist of 22 extended group interviews (EGI) and observation carried out in Finland. Based on our analysis, we argue that older adults use ICT in very heterogeneous ways and that the roles bestowed upon warm experts can be understood precisely through this heterogeneity. ","",""

In contemporary society, where technology has become one of the main means of communication and personal interaction, has the internet influenced the relationship between living alone and loneliness? This paper aims to answer this research question by using a sample of 64,297 individuals who were surveyed in SHARE project wave 6 – in European countries with different welfare regimes (Portugal, Greece, Italy and Spain, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Switzerland, Luxemburg, Poland, Czech Republic; Slovenia, Estonia, and Croatia). The results of the regression analysis evidence the moderating role of the internet on the relationship between living alone and feelings of loneliness in individuals aged 50 and over, so that the impact of living alone on loneliness is diminished for internet users as compared to their peers who do not use the internet. The results therefore reinforce the importance of policies aimed at fostering e-inclusion as a way of reducing the loneliness of older adults.","",""

This paper examines the relationship between older adults’ online social engagement and social capital based on a national survey of adults aged 60 and over. Findings show that older adults who engage more often in specific online social activities (i.e., asking questions on social media, looking at photos of family members/others) enjoy greater bridging social capital (both in offline and online contexts) than those who do so less often. Furthermore, Internet skills moderate the relationship between online social engagement and social capital. Specifically, older adults with greater Internet skills benefit relatively more from engaging in specific online social activities more often with respect to online bridging. The paper discusses the implications for digital inequality scholarship.","",""

This study considers the role of digital communication in helping young people engage with services and the clinical teams providing their care. Data are drawn from 165 young people and 173 NHS staff across 20 clinical settings in the UK treating a variety of long-term conditions. Although not the focus of the main study the intersection of digital technologies and timely communication in keeping young people engaged was apparent. We drew on theories of time to understand how time was conceptualised and used in the digital communications between young people and their clinical teams. Through the lens of time we show that digital communications are valued differently by young people with long-term conditions and their clinical teams. In the current policy landscape where there is an emphasis on digital technology understanding the temporalities of different groups will help in the introduction of appropriate digital communications channels. Done well digital communications have the potential to improve young patients’ autonomy but this must be balanced with the needs of clinical teams, particularly loss of control over work patterns.","",""
"2022","The warm expert—A warm teacher? Learning about digital media in intergenerational interaction"," The concept warm experts originally referred to people who helped their friends and family to come to terms with home-based computers and Internet connections. As digital technologies have continuously come to permeate our everyday lives, the tasks for warm experts have grown in kinds and character. The present study contributes to our understanding of warm experts by exploring the learning process involving the warm expert and the less knowledgeable other(s). Drawing on interviews with older adults (70 to 94 years of age), the study specifically explores older users’ experiences of learning about digital media with children and grandchildren. The results reveal how interaction with warm experts constituted important learning opportunities for the older adults, in which they developed their skills in using digital media. However, establishing potential learning situations and learning from warm experts was not a straightforward matter, but surrounded by a multitude of barriers structuring the possibilities for learning. This shows how the role of the warm expert is fluid and materializes in different ways in different situations. The warm expert can take the position (or be positioned) as one who solves technical issues. The warm expert can be one who fails in teaching, or one who adopts the position as a warm teacher and contributes to learning among the less knowledgeable user. In order to also be a warm teacher, the warm expert needs to understand the specific learning needs and styles of the less knowledgeable other and adapt to these needs. ","",""
"2022","“I do it my way”: Idioms of practice and digital media ideologies of adolescents and older adults"," This article analyzes the idioms of practice and media ideologies of adolescents and older adults regarding mobile digital media usage, and how they are negotiated within and between age cohorts. We formed aged-based focus groups in Rome and Barcelona (four groups of 16- to 19-year-olds and four of 65- to 85-year-olds). The comparison provides new insights on older individuals’ communication practices, often overshadowed by the focus on youth. Participants of both age groups explained they do media in their own way, which is perceived as “the right” (or legitimate) way. Strategies and hierarchies differ with age, according to meanings and rankings attributed to media choices in a communicative environment of affordances, or polymedia. The results suggest that differentiated generation-based idioms of practice and media ideologies are in operation in each cohort while, in both cases, refer to adaptative and goal-oriented communications.

"2022","Emerging Digital Inequalities: A Comparative Study of Older Adults’ Smartphone Use"," Older adults are increasingly using smartphones. Researchers have identified demographic, attitudinal factors and social outcomes related to inequalities in access, skills, and activities of internet use. While this research has been ongoing for years, studies about the digital inequalities related to the use of smartphones by older adults are still scarce, and they rarely have undertaken sociocultural comparisons of usage. This article builds on an analysis of tracking data of older adults’ (pp. 55–79) smartphone use, to explore digital inequalities around traditional axes of inequality and sociocultural factors that shape older adults’ smartphone use. It adds a comparative perspective for understanding emerging inequalities related to sociocultural contexts to the existing literature. The results show that differences cannot be explained solely by sociodemographic factors, but also possibly by national policies and culture. Particularly, age, on its own, is not able to explain the differences reported. Older adults engage in a range of different activities on their smartphones, and differences between groups across the traditional axes of inequalities do not mirror exactly the differences found in previous research on internet use. This is important considering the risk of emerging new inequalities and the ongoing revisiting of policies to mitigate them. ","",""

This study looks at this relationship by introducing a new factor into the equation—the Internet—which has become increasingly relevant for communication and interaction. It aims to assess to what extent the use of the Internet can mitigate the association between living alone and depression in middle-aged and older adults. This study focuses on a sample of 64,260 individuals aged 50+ who are resident in Portugal, Greece, Italy, Spain, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Switzerland, Luxemburg, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia, and Croatia and were surveyed in the context of the SHARE project (Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe), Wave 6. The results showed that living alone relates to greater odds of depression. Nevertheless, of particular relevance is that they also evidenced that the Internet has a moderating role on this relationship, revealing a protective role, since Europeans aged 50+ who live alone and are Internet users are less likely to experience depression than other older adults. The findings reinforce the importance of policies aimed at digital inclusion to benefit the mental health of older adults who live alone in Europe. ","",""

This pilot study aimed to clarify the effects of Kikoeru on social connectedness related to interactions through the app, subjective health, loneliness, and setting a target number of steps for seven men aged 65 and older who lived at home. Survey items consisted of the Ando-Osada-Kodama loneliness scale, target number of steps, and subjective health ratings. We utilized interviews, seeking to determine whether users felt connected when using the app. The app usage days were collected from the server. The social and physical effects of the app were assessed using a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods. Participants used the app for 54.9 days on average during the 60-day intervention period. Interviews revealed four social connectedness benefits: ‘constructing reliance’, ‘remembering to consider friends’, ‘awareness of friends’ daily lives and encouragement for me’, and ‘taking an interest in friends’. Loneliness decreased for four out of seven people, remained the same for three, and did not worsen for anyone. The target number of steps increased for three people, remained the same for four, and did not decrease for anyone. Average subjective health improved from 63.6 to 72.9 points out of 100 after the intervention. Results showed participants experienced social connectedness, reduced loneliness, and improved their target steps and health by using Kikoeru. Future large-scale studies with expanded sample sizes should be conducted.","",""
"2023","Individual and shared digital repertoires – older adults managing digital services","ABSTRACT The rise of public and other non-recreational digital services is based on the idea of catering to the daily needs of the citizens cost-efficiently and with ease. Previous research has approached the use of digital services mainly from the perspective of an individual, while the significance of shared practices of use has attracted only a little attention. In this article, we (1) examine the incentives and limitations associated with the use of non-recreational digital services, which either encourage or discourage older adults to use them. Based on the first question, we then ask (2) how older adults in this study manage those non-recreational digital services they have chosen to use. Our qualitative analysis is based on participant-induced elicitation (PIE) interviews (n = 21) carried out in Central Finland with older adults aged between 65 and 89. Our findings suggest that there are conflicting views about digital services – they simultaneously evoke both positive and negative associations among interviewees. The incentives and limitations of digital services are expressly heterogeneous among older adults and vary depending on the individual and shared digital repertoire of each user. We describe how participants in this study employed multiple strategies, such as sharing digital repertoires with warm experts, to actively manage using digital services in their daily lives.","",""
"2023","Digital inequality among older adults: explaining differences in the breadth of Internet use","ABSTRACT An increasing number of older adults integrate the Internet in their daily life. Although undertaking a greater range of online activities offers enhanced opportunities to live a self-determined and socially connected life, understanding of the breadth of Internet use is still limited. We address this gap by examining how individual factors representing inequalities between groups of older adults in society are associated with the breadth of their Internet use. The study analyzed survey data collected in 2017 from older adults living in a city in Germany (N = 1,136, age 65–90 years). The group of Internet users comprised of 69.0% (784) of participants, exhibited high levels of autonomy in outdoor activities (87.8%), and reported, on average, 4.92 online activities (SD = 2.31, range 1–8). Linear regression analysis showed positive associations for perceiving higher levels of behavioral control (PBC) in using digital technologies, being male and younger, and holding an academic degree. No associations were found for having medium level of education, living together with someone, and reporting better health. These findings highlight that despite the increased percentage of users, digital inequality regarding the range of online activities prevails. This inequality impedes subgroups of older adults to prepare for future situations in which online activities could substitute outdoor activities that might not be possible anymore. Interventions for these subgroups should emphasize digital skills that facilitate engagement in diverse online activities covering various purposes and life domains.","",""
"2023","EXAMINING OLDER ADULTS DIGITAL INCLUSION THROUGH THE LENS OF INTERSECTIONALITY AND CONTINUITY THEORY","The possible ubiquitous presence of technology connected to the internet and a growing ageing population has necessitated a renewed interest in the digital inclusion of older adults. The focus on chronological age is a form of ageism as it erases the heterogeneity of the community while over-emphasising a physical attribute. We argue that by introducing a conceptual framework incorporating the intersectionality theory (Crenshaw, 1990) and the continuity theory (CT) (Atchley, 1989, 1999) it is possible to explain the differences found in digital in/exclusion that go beyond chronological age. This would enable a more individualised approach to the current curriculum of digital skill acquirement and to help affect lasting change in digital technology adoption by older adults.  A thematic analysis (Braun&amp;Clarke, 2006) on 26 semi-structured interviews, with self-proclaimed digital technology users aged between 66 and 84, was used to test this conceptual framework. By using both theories it was possible to explain why chronological age cannot be used as an indicator of use or non-use. Rather examining the intersections of their identity in combination with their investments in habits and skills can explain why some older adults benefit more and are able to make use of the internet in comparison to others.

"2023","TESTING THE ROLE OF CATEGORICAL AND RESOURCE INEQUALITIES IN INDIRECT INTERNET USES OF OLDER ADULTS: A PATH ANALYSIS","Age-related digital inequalities have been one of the key aspects to understand and enable better ageing in the digitalized world. Although there is a large body of literature on direct forms and determinants of digital engagement among older internet users and non-users, only a few studies have focused on determinants of indirect internet uses among older non-users. To address this gap, this study investigates how the unequal distribution of resources among older non-users affects the availability and activation of supportive relationships, which enable them to ask other internet users to perform internet activities on their behalf—a practice known as use-by-proxy (UBP). Drawing on van Dijk’s (2005) resources and appropriation theory, we build a conceptual model with seven hypotheses. These hypotheses specify sequential pathways between categorical inequalities and differences in social and material resources as determinants of the heterogeneity of UBP availability and activation of networks. In turn, availability and activation affect the breadth of UBP engagement among older non-users. The model is tested on a representative survey sample of 241 respondents aged 65+ from Slovenia. Results from path analysis partly support the model and demonstrate the importance of investigating the sequential paths between social and age-related digital inequalities with respect to indirect forms of internet uses. The results also suggest that interventions aimed at supporting older non-users in their access to online services can be targeted at different levels, from addressing categorical and resource inequalities to providing UBP services.","",""

Simultaneously, technology is rapidly progressing, and new forms of media have become integrated into daily life and societal participation. This study uses time diary data from a panel survey of members of nationally representative households ( N = 1776) to explore patterns of media use and functionally equivalent leisure time among older adults. The data support a three-profile typology of older adult use of media and non-media leisure activities. These include the computer socializer, the hobbyist, and the television watcher. We elaborate on these patterns of use and explore correlates with demographic and well-being variables. We find no evidence that well-being significantly differs across profiles of media use but identify income and employment status as potential drivers of older adults’ media activity, with implications for digital inequalities.

Focusing on the Moderating Role of Media Literacy"," As older adult populations rapidly increase worldwide, loneliness among older adults is emerging as a societal burden. Whether social media use can increase or decrease older adults’ loneliness remains debated in the literature. The purpose of this study is to clarify the effect of social media use on loneliness among older adults by examining the moderating role of media literacy on the relationship between social media use and loneliness. Considering that Korea is facing the most rapid population aging among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries and that two-thirds of Korean older adults use social media, Korean data can provide international insights into the impact of social media use on older adults. Responses from 554 Korean respondents aged 60 to 79, extracted from the 2021 Korea Media Panel Survey, were analyzed using the PROCESS Macro Model 1. The results of this study showed that the effect of social media use on loneliness among older adults was moderated by their level of media literacy. As the amount of time spent using social media increased, loneliness increased for respondents with low-to-middle media literacy. This study’s findings emphasize the importance of educational interventions to increase older adults’ digital media literacy and expand scholarly understanding of the impact of social media use in non-Western countries.

Using theoretical and methodological triangulation six mediation models are conceptualized, followed by empirical validation using a nationally representative dataset of older people (≥ 65 years) living in Wales, UK (N = 2,099). The results reveal that frequency of telephone and video calls mediate the relationship between proximity of family and social isolation, and telephone calls mediate the relationship with loneliness. Text/emails have no significant mediating effect. Qualitative data analysis provides a deeper understanding of conditions that facilitate technology mediated communication. Demonstrating the impact of lifecourse habits, social context and environment on technology mediated communication shifts the focus from individual deficits to other reasons for non-adoption. Understanding the link between the individual, the social-cultural and social structural environment, social interaction, and loneliness requires an understanding of what is important to older people. For example, knowledge concerning the role of embodied presence in alleviating loneliness can be used to better understand the likelihood of implementing successful interventions.","",""

If this is to be realised, we need to understand barriers and facilitators to uptake and investigate who wants this technology and who does not express an interest in use. This analysis is based on data from a population-based cohort study, the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (CFAS)-II, which focused on brain health in older people and included questions about access to- and interest in- internet technologies. The factors affecting willingness to use technologies that support memory and ADL were identified using binary logistic regression analysis. 541 people aged 75 years and older from Cambridgeshire, Nottingham and Newcastle responded. Older adults were more willing to use technologies directed towards improving memory (65%) than towards ADL supportive technologies (38%). Regression analysis showed that an older age (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.34–0.98), female gender (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.42–0.99), no access to technology including laptops and tablets (OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.32–0.72), and self-reported physically less slowing down (but no objective health indicators) (OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.36–0.88) were strongly associated with UK older adults’ lesser willingness to use memory assistive technologies while not having access to laptops and tablets (OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.39–0.84) was associated with willingness to use ADL supportive technologies. Older people, females and those with less access to technologies should be considered as target groups by healthcare providers, policymakers, and technology producers to promote technology and support healthy and independent ageing.","",""

This study focuses on China, one of the most rapidly aging and digitalizing countries in the world. Employing a mixed-method approach, this research examines how elderly individuals experience the digital transformation and the associated digital divide. The findings suggest that the elderly interviewees encounter multiple barriers to learning and using digital technologies, which highlights the significant role of social support and networks in facilitating their adaptation to the digital society and lifestyle. Attitudes toward digital engagement and digitalization vary greatly among the elderly, ranging from being optimistic to feeling left behind and having multiple concerns. Our findings further reveal that the Chinese government has implemented numerous digital apps tailored to the demands of the elderly and provided training opportunities to bridge the gray digital divide. This emphasizes the responsiveness and adaptiveness of Chinese authorities in addressing pressing societal issues. However, we identify a gap in digital outreach, as most elderly interviewees have limited awareness of government digital inclusion policies and programs. This article contributes to digital divide research and offers practical implications for countries grappling with the gray digital divide. ","",""

High-speed broadband availability is associated with higher reported levels of home Internet access, greater frequency of Internet use and more engagement with Internet activities. Controlling for demographic and socio-economic circumstances, regression models show that quality of life is higher among daily users of the Internet. Little association is found with loneliness. Quality of life is higher among users of Internet-based communication applications such as email and video calls, and there is some evidence that loneliness may be less pronounced among users of these applications. The findings are consistent with the view that digital engagement can enhance the lives of older people and thus may be supportive of policies and interventions to address potential ‘grey’ digital divides.

Rooted in socioemotional selectivity theory, we choose a positive attitude toward aging and meaning in life to describe older adults’ reactions to aging, and test the proposed hypotheses based on 204 valid survey responses. Results confirm that while both knowledge contribution and knowledge-seeking activities promote older adults’ satisfaction, the impact of knowledge contribution is stronger on satisfaction. Furthermore, as hypothesized, the positive attitude toward aging amplifies the impact of knowledge-seeking while meaning in life weakens the impact of knowledge contribution on older adults’ satisfaction. This study contributes to the literature on how older adults derive satisfaction from their knowledge contribution and knowledge-seeking activities in VCs and offers insights into using VCs to build a digitally inclusive society.

We apply a ‘folk theory’ framework to illuminate underlying perceptions that guide behaviours, by asking which folk theories older adults draw on to make sense of their experiences with the internet. The empirical data originates from qualitative in-depth interviews and participant observation sessions with 25 people aged 65–98 years in Norway. We identify four interconnected folk theories under the shared theme of transferring expectations from the offline world: expecting human involvement, expecting visibility, lack of a human safety net, and human limitations and social conventions. Our analysis shows how such folk theories inform user decisions, including hindrances and problem-solving, as older adults adapt to digital services in everyday life. ","",""

We examined the predictors of Internet use for services and its increase or decrease among a longitudinal population-based sample of 1426 older adults from Finland aged between 70 and 100 years, gathered in 2017 and 2020. High education and high income positively predicted the use of the Internet for services, and age, deteriorated health and deteriorated memory negatively. High age, low education and a change to living alone predicted a decrease in use. High education predicted the increased Internet use due to COVID-19. Thus, it seems that those older adults who have low education level are very old, whose health or memory has deteriorated and those who have changed to living alone are particularly in danger of digital exclusion.

Focusing on the changes in the use of Email, Chat and Social Network Sites by older people, it explores the process by which new media become ‘old’ and reach a saturation point. Collected survey data suggest differences in media use between the three technology generations distinguished in this study: the ‘mechanical’ generation (born in 1938 or before), the ‘household revolution’ generation (born between 1939 and 1948), and the ‘technology spread’ generation (born between 1949 and 1963). This longitudinal and transnational study provides evidence of media saturation, showing that an increase in both the availability of and access to media does not lead to an increase in use, even in older adults who are behind in the adoption of the new media. Finally, the article discusses the findings, arguing for an interplay between individual and structural lag in later life. ","",""
"2024","Division of digital labor: Partner support for technology use among older adults"," Older adults often assist one another in using digital technology and tend to prefer assistance provided at home. However, research has yet to examine how life partners in this age group support one another in using technology. We interviewed 50 older adults representing 25 couples in five countries about their sources of support when using the Internet. Partner support was more common than existing literature suggests and was motivated by in-home convenience, partners’ level of digital skills, and a desire to avoid burdening other network members. At odds with a one-way view of digital assistance, partners often helped each other in different domains of Internet use based on career experience and personal interest. Partner support could both aid and discourage self-sufficiency, depending on how assistance was provided. Studying couples helps clarify how older adults develop relationships of mutual aid and dependency out of the everyday (un)availability of technology support. ","",""
"2024","The roles of perceived privacy control, Internet privacy concerns and Internet skills in the direct and indirect Internet uses of older adults: Conceptual integration and empirical testing of a theoretical model"," Internet privacy has been proposed as a new dimension of the digital divide. Although Internet privacy relates to all segments of the population, older Internet users are particularly vulnerable because they generally have lower Internet skills. Coupled with their high level of privacy concerns, this can dissuade them from fully engaging in a variety of Internet uses. As older adults overcome their limited Internet skills by asking others to perform online activities on their behalf, a practice known as use-by-proxy, it is likely that this is also a strategy for dealing with Internet privacy concerns. Therefore, we examine how Internet skills, along with Internet privacy concerns and perceived privacy control, influence their Internet uses and use-by-proxy. To this end, we develop an integrative conceptual model and test it with structural equation modelling using data collected in November 2021 from a nationwide sample of 460 Internet users aged 65+ in Slovenia.

"2024","Inequalities in internet use among older people between 2004 and 2021","  Although research already examined sociodemographic profiles of older internet (non-)users, it is unknown how combinations of sociodemographic factors relate to internet (non-)use. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the cumulative impact of sociodemographic characteristics on internet (non-)use among people aged 60 and older between 2004 and 2021, using representative survey data derived from the Belgian Ageing Studies (n = 61 376). Logistic regression analyses consistently associated low education, age 80 or older, low income and female gender with higher probabilities of being internet non-user between 2004 an 2021. CHAID analysis revealed that education and age are the strongest predictors of non-use. The cumulative impact of sociodemographic factors enables to reveal subgroups where prevalence rates of non-use are almost three times higher than the prevalence reported in the population of older people in general. The result that 80.1 percent of individuals aged 80 and above with limited education did not use the internet underscores the need for a comprehensive digital inclusion approach, including strategies to overcome economic barriers to internet access and tailored internet training initiatives addressing digital skills and motivation. CHAID results help policymakers and internet training providers identify subgroups with high prevalence rates of non-users and target interventions to those at a high risk of digital exclusion.

"2024","Mobile phone use before and during the COVID-19 pandemic – a panel study of older adults in seven countries"," The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in older adults’ mobile phone use from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic. The media displacement and digital divide approaches served as the theoretical frameworks of the study. The data were drawn from the 2018 and 2020 waves of the Aging + Communication + Technology cross-national longitudinal panel study. The sample consisted of older Internet users, aged 62 to 96 (in 2018), from Austria, Canada, Finland, Israel, the Netherlands, Romania, and Spain, who participated in both waves (N = 4,398). Latent class analysis and latent transition analysis with multinomial regression models were the main methods applied to the data. With regard to the findings, three mobile phone function use profiles—Narrow Use, Medium Use, and Broad Use—were identified from the data. Lower age, being married, higher income, and place of residence (in 2018) predicted belonging to the three profiles, while country differences in the prevalence of the profiles were substantial. Between 2018 and 2020, transition from one profile to another was relatively rare but typically toward the “Broad Use” category. Profile transitions were most common in Romania, while stability was highest in Finland, Israel, and Canada. In addition, gender, age, marital status, and place of residence predicted the likelihood of changing from one profile to another between 2018 and 2020. The results suggest that older adults’ mobile phone function use is relatively stable over a two-year time span. While new mobile phone functions are adopted, they seem to augment the spectrum of mobile usage rather than displace older similar functionalities. In addition, demographic, socioeconomic, and country-level digital divides, although slightly modified over time, remain significant among older adults. ","",""

"2025","NAVIGATING THE DIGITAL WAVE: THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES OF ORDINARY ELDERLY SHORT VIDEO CREATORS IN CHINA","Concerns about the aging of the Chinese population (Y. Wang &amp; Su, 2024), and with the Chinese government's acknowledgment of the silver-haired economy's significant development, there is an urgent need for research into the social media engagement of the elderly. Short videos, representing a novel form of information dissemination and social engagement, offer the elderly a means to connect across time and space (Zhang &amp; Xiang, 2023). Short form video is dynamic and intuitive, making audio-visual information and public communication particularly accessible to older audiences. Notably, On 15th January 2024, the General Office of the State Council of China published the """"Opinions on Developing the Silver Economy and Enhancing the Well-Being of the Elderly."""" This document marks the inaugural national policy directive specifically addressing the “Silver Economy” by the Chinese Government (Huang, 2024). The issuance of the Opinions policy underscores the critical role of the elderly demographic within the ambit of China's contemporary digital and cultural milieu, highlighting the government's commitment to integrating this segment of the population into the broader socio-economic framework.  However, existing research, both domestically and internationally, has predominantly examined the participation of older adults in short video platforms from the user perspective, often overlooking the significant number of older individuals actively contributing as content creators within the short video culture. Consequently, this research addresses this gap and is dedicated to examining the involvement of Chinese elderly individuals in the realm of short-form video culture, specifically as content creators.","",""
"2025","Playing with persona: Highlighting older adults’ lived experience with the digital media","             During the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns (2020-2021), almost all facets of life were rendered digital – health, work, schooling, and logistics. In this phenomenon, not only did digital access become synonymous with social inclusion but inequalities were also amplified – particularly in the case of older adults (65 years and over). Contemporary older adults represent one of the most diverse spectrums of digital media users – spanning from technologically savvy to non-users. As the first generation of older adults to age             in             and             through             data in a data-saturated world, their understandings and experiences can teach us much about the possibilities and limitations of new media. Understanding these practices through cultural probes – like drawing, photos and writing prompts – can enable playful behaviours that not only elicit new thoughts and actions but also allow insight into some of the tacit lived experience that can support opportunities for technological use. In this paper, we ask:             How can we playfully co-design through personas to enhance understandings of older adults’ lived experience of digital media?             In this paper, we focus on the six co-design workshops in which we deployed personas as representations of digital experience to challenge, explore, provoke and help build nuanced tools for implementation. Through personas, speculative fiction and lived experience collide, offering some fascinating ways to rethink the digital-social dimension for older adults now and into the future.           ","",""
"2025","(How) did self-rated health status shape Internet use among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany?"," This study aims to shed light on health disparities in Internet use among older adults at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data from the 2020 German Ageing Survey short survey ( N = 2243), we examined the links between self-rated health (SRH, independent variable) and four Internet use purposes (dependent variables) that might have been particularly relevant for older adults with health limitations during the pandemic: online information search, maintaining social contacts, religious purposes, and consultations with doctors or therapists. Multivariate regression analyses revealed that older adults with poor SRH were more likely than those with good SRH to use the Internet for online consultations with doctors or therapists, whereas they were less likely to use the Internet to search for information and to maintain social contacts at least once per week. This hints to health-related inequalities in Internet use which merit further investigation. ","",""
"2025","The effect of positive and negative daily social media emotional experiences on older adults’ subjective age: Unveiling the negativity bias in WhatsApp groups"," Social media has become instrumental for older adults in maintaining social connections, which are an integral component of older adults’ well-being. However, little is known about how daily positive/negative social media emotional experiences are associated with older adults’ subjective views of aging. The current study examined daily emotional experiences related to WhatsApp groups and their association with subjective age (feeling younger/older than one’s chronological age). Data were collected from 42 Israeli older adults who confirmed daily WhatsApp usage ( Mage = 74.30, SD = 8.39). Participants reported their daily WhatsApp emotional experiences in family/other groups and daily subjective age over 14 consecutive days, resulting in 557 completed reports. Results demonstrated that on days older adults reported negative WhatsApp group emotional experiences they felt older. Positive emotional experiences were associated with feeling younger solely when these experiences were reported in relation to family WhatsApp groups. Time-lagged models further indicated that only negative (but not positive) WhatsApp emotional experiences on a given day predicted an older subjective age the following day. The results underscore the significance of daily social media emotional experiences in shaping older adults’ daily subjective age. They also indicate the presence of a negativity bias effect in social media interactions among older adults. ","",""

Our data included 4699 participants from a nation-wide panel study, the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study from 2019 to 2022. The findings demonstrated that 322 of 1884 (17.1%) nonusers initiated Internet use in 2019, while 418 of 2815 (14.8%) users discontinued Internet use in 2019. Older age, low education, and low population density predicted less initiation, greater discontinuation, less increase, and more decrease in Internet use. Participation in social activities predicted more initiation, lower discontinuation, and decrease in Internet use. Social support was associated with initiation, discontinuation, and increase in Internet use; the associations varied by the source of support. Digital divide among older adults was exacerbated by socioeconomic disparities. Engagement in social activities and targeted social support may help bridge this divide. ","",""
"2025","Proxy and learning back-feeding: How older adults use smartphones in China"," Digital back-feeding is a bottom-up process by which younger generations teach or assist older generations in digital access, usage, and literacy. This study aims to examine how two means of digital back-feeding—proxy back-feeding and learning back-feeding—might be differently impacted by older adults’ perceptions of smartphone use, as well as their impact on older adults’ digital literacy. A cross-sectional questionnaire survey ( n = 433) was conducted in mainland China. Our findings revealed that perceived usefulness and perceived risk of smartphone use were positively associated with older adults’ engagement with both proxy back-feeding and learning back-feeding. Perceived ease of use was found to be negatively associated with older adults’ engagement in proxy back-feeding. In addition, older adults’ digital literacy was found to be negatively associated with proxy back-feeding, but positively associated with learning back-feeding. Results suggest that digital back-feeding is a complicated process that may influence older adults’ digital literacy through different routes, which deserves further investigation to bridge digital divide intergenerationally.

"2025","Creating speculative mobile media futures with older adults in Australia","People aged over 65 (“older adults”) are among the first to enter later life in a digital data-saturated world. Many older adults across the world are surrounded by mobile media and computational data in their everyday lives. Mobile media, including smartphones, tablets, and wearables, are near-ubiquitous in Australia. At the same time, older adults are among the most digitally excluded in the country and older adults have diverse feelings towards mobile media. High rates of mobile media absorption in the everyday lives of older Australians can obscure the heterogeneity of experiences, perceptions, and concerns towards digital data. In this paper, we use creative speculative methods to unearth older adults’ current and future mobile media affordances (contexts of use), fears and concerns, and what using these methods can reveal about contemporary and future-orientated ageing in data practices.","",""
"2025","Navigating mobile technologies: Older adults’ mobile, digital, and non-digital strategies for enhancing subjective well-being","Older age cohorts have been found to exhibit both less interest and less use of digital technologies than younger cohorts, which suggests that they may be less flexible in comparison to younger technology users. However, frequency is not the only differentiating factor between age groups in the context of mobile technology use, as the specific ways in which technologies are used also play a significant role in the daily lives of older adults (65+). Drawing on the selective optimization with compensation (SOC) model, we ask what strategies older adults use to enhance their subjective well-being when using mobile technologies. The thematic analysis is based on 20 elicitation interviews conducted in Central Finland in 2018. Our findings suggest that mobile technologies can act as both a tool to enhance well-being and a source of problems for older adults, and that older adults show considerable creativity in navigating various mobile, digital and non-digital strategies. Furthermore, we argue that these evolving, and thus also in this sense mobile, strategies contribute to the subjective well-being and successful ageing of older adults by providing them with “workarounds” to manage mobile technologies to their benefit.","",""
