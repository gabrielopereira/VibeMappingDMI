"2015","Toxic femininity 4.0","This paper examines constructions of toxic femininity within fourth-wave feminism. Taking hashtag feminism as its focus, this article contends that charges of toxicity lobbed online reproduce divisive dynamics that have shaped earlier trends within feminist movements in the United States. It further suggests that Twitter, as a platform, amplifies deep discomfort with theories of intersectional feminism while shaping how normative gender is reproduced online.","",""
"2016","“You Need to Be Sorted Out With a Knife”: The Attempted Online Silencing of Women and People of Muslim Faith Within Academia"," Academics are increasingly expected to use social media to disseminate their work and knowledge to public audiences. Although this has various advantages, particularly for alternative forms of dissemination, the web can also be an unsafe space for typically oppressed or subordinated groups. This article presents two auto-ethnographic accounts of the abuse and hate academics researching oppressed groups, namely, women and people of Muslim faith, experienced online. In doing so, this article falls into four parts. The first section provides an overview of existing literature, particularly focusing on work which explores the violence and abuse of women and people of Muslim faith online. The second section considers the auto-ethnographic methodological approach adopted in this article. The third section provides the auto-ethnographic accounts of the author’s experiences of hate and abuse online. The final section locates these experiences within broader theoretical concepts, such as silencing, and considers possible implications of such online hate in both an academic context and beyond.

"2017","Feminist Digilante Responses to a Slut-Shaming on Facebook"," This article examines feminist digilantism in response to the “slut-shaming” of an Australian woman on Facebook in 2015. The activism is used to highlight the nature and significance of the feminist pushback against the worsening problem of cyber violence against women and girls (cyber VAWG). This article builds on my previous research into feminist digilantism and is part of a much larger, mixed-methods, multi-modal study into gendered cyberhate. It uses approaches from Internet historiography, ethnography, and netnography, alongside data drawn from qualitative interviews. Sufficient evidence is available to support the broad argument that the feminist digilantism involved in the case study under analysis was efficacious as well as ethically justified given the dearth of institutional interventions. That said, I demonstrate that while such activism has benefits, it also has risks and disadvantages, and raises ethical issues. This critique of digilantism is not intended as yet another type of victim blaming which suggests the activist responses of cyberhate targets are flawed. Instead, my case is that appraising the efficacy and ethics of such forms of extrajudicial activism should take place within a framing acknowledging that these actions are primarily diagnostic of rather than a solution to cyber VAWG. As such, the increasing prevalence and strength of feminist digilantism lends further support to the case that gendered cyberhate is a problem demanding urgent and multifaceted intervention. ","",""
"2018","#IAmNotAfraidToSayIt: stories of sexual violence as everyday political speech on Facebook","ABSTRACT The debate about the power and influence of networked publics often focuses on large-scale political events, activist campaigns and protest activity – the more visible forms of political engagement. On the other hand, digitally mediated activism is often questioned and sometimes derided as a lesser form of dissent, as it is easier to engage in, highly affective, and offers few assurances of sustainability of the change it calls for. But what about everyday political speech online, where social media platforms can contribute to a personalisation of politics? Can social media users express their views online and make a difference? This paper analyses around 3500 Facebook posts stemming from the #ЯНеБоюсьСказати (Ukrainian for #IAmNotAfraidToSayIt) online campaign that was started in the Ukrainian segment of Facebook in July 2016 by a local activist to raise awareness of how widespread sexual violence and sexual harassment are in the Ukrainian society. The paper argues that networked conversations about everyday rights and affective stories about shared experiences of injustice, underpinned by the affordances of social media platforms for sharing and discussing information and participating in everyday politics, can emerge as viable forms of networked feminist activism and can have real impact on the discursive status quo of an issue, both in the digital sphere and beyond it.","",""
"2018","Platform vulnerabilities: harassment and misogynoir in the digital attack on Leslie Jones","ABSTRACT In the summer of 2016, racist, misogynistic harassers attacked comedienne Leslie Jones on Twitter and on her personal website, which they hacked and flooded with sexist and racist imagery stolen largely from her personal accounts. Through a multiplatform discourse analysis of the Leslie Jones attack, this paper examines the connections between platform vulnerabilities and the vulnerabilities of women of color, as well as the links between the rise of the alt-right and an increase in explicitly racist, misogynistic behaviors. Three key themes emerged from the analysis: messages of support and affirmation; the need for intervention; and the connection between this incident, systemic racism and sexism, and the rise of the alt-right. These themes serve as a bridge between the vulnerabilities of platforms and of women of color in those digital spaces and beyond. The supportive awareness campaigns and calls to action that issue publics launched online attempted to discursively ‘patch’ two perceived vulnerabilities – of Twitter as a platform and of Jones herself. However, in response to these ‘patches,’ members of the alt-right condemned Twitter and mainstream media for marginalizing their conservative voices, using this discourse to bolster their performance of victimization and oppression. Overall, this case study provides insight into the dynamics at work in the rise of the alt-right and online harassment, with particular attention to the significance of digital media, celebrity, and popular feminism in the ongoing political shifts in the United States.","",""
"2018","Bitch, slut, skank, cunt: patterned resistance to women’s visibility in digital publics","ABSTRACT Resistance to women’s public voice and visibility via street harassment and workplace sexual harassment have long constrained women’s use of and comfort in physical public spaces; this gender-based resistance now extends into digital arenas. Women face extreme hostility in the form of digital sexism in discussion rooms, comment sections, gaming communities, and on social media platforms. Reflecting on two years of in-depth interviews with women who have been on the receiving end of gender-based digital abuse (n = 38), conversations with industry professionals working in content moderation and digital safety, the extant literature, and news stories about digital attacks against women, I offer a lens to think through the prominent patterns in digital sexism, showing (1) that aggressors draw upon three overlapping strategies – intimidating, shaming, and discrediting – to limit women’s impact in digital publics, (2) the way femininity and femaleness are used to undermine women’s contributions, and (3) men call attention to women’s physicality as a way to pull gender – and the male advantage that comes with it – to the fore in digital exchanges. Finally, I argue that when digital sexism succeeds in pressing women out of digital spaces, constrains the topics they address publicly, or limits the ways they address them, we must consider the democratic costs of gender-based harassment, in addition to the personal ones.","",""
"2018","#GirlsLikeUs: Trans advocacy and community building online"," In this research, we examine the advocacy and community building of transgender women on Twitter through methods of network and discourse analysis and the theory of networked counterpublics. By highlighting the network structure and discursive meaning making of the #GirlsLikeUs network, we argue that the digital labor of trans women, especially trans women of color, represents the vanguard of struggles over self-definition. We find that trans women on Twitter, led by Janet Mock and Laverne Cox, and in response to histories of misrepresentation and ongoing marginalization and violence, deliberately curate an intersectional networked counterpublic that works to legitimize and support trans identities and advocate for trans autonomy in larger publics and counterpublics.

"2018","Fighting for recognition: Online abuse of women bloggers in Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States"," Women who blog about politics or identify as feminist in Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States face great risks of online abuse. In-depth interviews with 109 bloggers who write about feminisms, family, and/or maternity politics revealed that 73.4% had negative experiences due to blogging and/or social media use. Most of these negative experiences involved not only abusive comments but also stalking, trolls, rape threats, death threats, and unpleasant offline encounters. Response strategies included moderating comments, exposing abuse, adaptation, and solidarity. I argue that the democratic potential of social media in democracies remains haphazard because online abuse is not fully recognized as entangling online and offline communication, constituted and constructed through technological, legal, social, and cultural factors. Using the theoretical approaches of digital feminisms, I call for more systematic empirical work on global recognition of online abuse as punishable crime. ","",""
"2018","Racial justice activist hashtags: Counterpublics and discourse circulation"," Using critical discourse analysis and network analysis, I address how racial justice activist hashtags #NotYourAsianSideKick and #SolidarityisforWhiteWomen circulate discourse across networked online publics within and outside Twitter. These hashtags showcase relationships between feminist online publics, demonstrate ways that hashtags circulate racial justice discourse, and exemplify the fluidity and intersectionality of racialized and feminist online publics. I draw on critical technocultural discourse analysis (CTDA) (Brock, 2012) as my technique in order to examine the hashtag’s discursivity. In order to analyze message spread and network relationships, I then provide a network analysis that illustrates message circulation in online feminist spheres. ","",""
"2018","<i>Gaali</i> cultures: The politics of abusive exchange on social media"," On the rapidly expanding social media in India, online users are witness to a routine exchange of abusive terms and accusations with choicest swearwords hurled even for the seemingly non-inflammatory political debates. This article draws upon anthropology of insult to uncover the distinctness, if at all, of online abuse as a means for political participation as well as for the encumbering it provokes and relations of domination it reproduces as a result. In so doing, the article critiques the conception of ludic as anti-hegemonic in the Bakhtin tradition, and develops an emic term “gaali” to signal the blurred boundaries between comedy, insult, shame, and abuse emerging on online media, which also incite gendered forms of intimidation. Gaali, it argues, is best conceptualized through the metaphor of “sound” as distinct from what recent new media studies theorize as “voice.” ","",""
"2018","“One tweet to make so much noise”: Connected celebrity activism in the case of Marlee Matlin"," Celebrity activism, online celebrity, and online activism are all growing areas of research, but have received relatively little integration. This article argues that connected celebrity activism deploys social media to forge a variety of connections, enabling activist values to pervade a celebrity persona, reinforcing perceptions of authenticity and recirculating those values to disparate audiences. In the case of Deaf American actor Marlee Matlin, media reform activism serves as a unifying feature, expressed via technologically-facilitated connections between her acting, activist, and online activities, creating a cohesive star text that is seemingly authentic in respect to both Deaf and celebrity identities without being stereotypical. Such centrality and unification via connected celebrity activism stands in contrast to more traditional celebrity activism, and draws upon the specific dynamics of digital media, online activism, and contemporary celebrity culture.

"2019","#METOO AND INTERSECTIONALISM: """"RADICAL COMMUNITY HEALING"""" OR """"VOYEURISTIC TRAUMA PORN?""""","In October 2017, millions of people reflected on their experiences of sexual abuse and harassment, publicly sharing their testimonials in an expression of global vulnerability using the hashtag #MeToo. Many of the tweets portrayed the angst and distress individuals experienced in their decision to participate, indicating the psychological costs of engaging with #MeToo. Further, some tweets expressed frustration at the re-appropriated nature of the campaign and the collective feeling of an “intersectional betrayal” by white women and feminists who dominated the mainstream media reporting of the movement. This research foregrounds the intersectional concerns that result from the scale and reach of the millions of testimonials suspended online that constitute the #MeToo movement. It highlights how the many stories that have circulated the online sphere obscure the absence and recognition of marginalised women and those who are already more vulnerable in regards to experiencing sexual assault. The paper adopts an intersectional framework, as conceptualised by Crenshaw (1991), to further an understanding of how race, class, and gender collide and how subordination can be reproduced within feminist protests. Drawing on a large data set of tweets, this research combines content, discourse and social network analysis to examine the narratives related to participation. The paper highlights the experiences and reflections of users who self-identified as queer, disabled, or a person of colour within their tweets. A social network analysis is also used to visualise a snapshot of the affective publics that arose at the beginning and to illustrate how systems of oppression converge.","",""
"2019","Digitized narratives of sexual violence: Making sexual violence felt and known through digital disclosures"," In this article, we argue that social media platforms like Tumblr and Twitter have facilitated an emergence of “digitized narratives” of sexual violence. These narratives are rooted in historical ways in which feminists have discursively articulated sexual violence, yet are shaped by distinctive “platform vernacular” or the conventions, affordances, and restrictions of the platforms in which they appear. Drawing on a qualitative content and critical discourse analysis of 450 texts from the Tumblr site Who Needs Feminism? and the hashtag #BeenRapedNeverReported, we argue that digital platforms such as Tumblr and Twitter produce new vernacular practices which shape how “digitized narratives” of sexual violence are not only disclosed and known, but felt and experienced across digital networks.

"2020","POLICING """"FAKE"""" FEMININITY: ANGER AND ACCUSATION IN INFLUENCER   """"HATEBLOG"""" COMMUNITIES","While social media influencers are held up in the popular imagination as self-enterprising cultural tastemakers, their requisite career visibility opens them up to intensified public scrutiny and, consequently, networked hate and harassment. Key repositories of such critique are influencer “hateblogs”—online spaces wherein anti-fans collectively police the activities of highly visible Instagrammers, YouTubers, and the like. This in-progress, mixed methods study brings together analyses of two “hateblog” communities: Get Off My Internets (GOMI) and the now-defunct Reblogging Donk (RBD), both of which targeted women social media personalities almost exclusively. Our analysis reveals an overarching critique of influencers' perceived duplicity or “fakery'' in the realms of parenting/domesticity, relationships, and personal appearance. Such accusations cast influencers as deceitful, avaricious, and lazy charlatans who unfairly profit off of ersatz performances of perfection. Yet as moral discourses (Gray, 2005), these critiques seem to dismantle the tropes of entrepreneurial femininity, suggesting a form of displaced anger. That is, while such expressions may be deployed in disavowal of individual performances of feminine-coded ideals, they are ostensibly rooted in broader sociocultural critiques connected to gendered expectations of authenticity, labor, and privilege. But while hatebloggers’ purport to disillusion us by exposing the artifice of social media, their expressions do little for progressive gender politics. We thus conclude by highlighting the limitations of this expressive act—one that seeks to liberate women from normative constraints while simultaneously engaging in gendered forms of symbolic violence.","",""
"2020","TIKTOK AND THE “ALGORITHMIZED SELF”: A NEW MODEL OF ONLINE   INTERACTION","Since its release in 2017, the video sharing app TikTok has been downloaded 1.5 billion times. While its popularity has been attributed to the abundance of celebrity users, its interactive features, and its short, palatable video length, it has been the subject of relatively few academic studies. This project employs the walkthrough method to examine TikTok within the context of identity negotiation and self-representation on social media. More specifically, it seeks to understand whether TikTok follows a precedent set by other Social Networking Sites which support users self-representing via sociability “to the network, via the network”; i.e. by interacting within the affordances of the platform, which may include sharing, liking, commenting, etc (Papacharissi, 2013). This model ostensibly offers users a stage where they may display their individuality and curate content that reflects their personal interests. By regularly using the app for a period of a month and collecting extensive field notes, screenshots, and video recordings, we found that TikTok’s version of sociality differs from that offered by other SNSs. While other sites purport to be a tool with which users may represent their identities, TikTok does away with this conceit by engendering a mode of sociality (through its design features and affordances) in which the crux of interaction is not between users and their social network, but between a user and what we call an “algorithmized” version of self. This finding has the potential to enrich and complicate the discourse surrounding online identity formation and sociality.","",""
"2020","YOU MADE THIS? I MADE THIS: CULTURES OF AUTOMATIC (MIS)ATTRIBUTION ON   TIKTOK","In 2019, TikTok captivated international attention as a breakout short-video platform. A key affordance for user-generated content creators on TikTok is how easy the platform makes reproducing popular videos. The video creation interface allows users to make new videos based on the one they were just watching with just one tap. While these features make it fun and easy for users to replicate popular videos, it can also obscure the identity of the creators who created the ‘original’ content being reused. In this way, TikTok engenders a culture of misattribution. Users can freely reuse popular formats, audio clips, or even licensed music without any connection to the original source with impunity. Using a combination of an app walkthrough, a bespoke data scraping tool, content analysis, and a series of qualitative case studies, this study explores the contradictory logic of authorship and how (mis)attribution is shaping cultural production and platform practices on TikTok.","",""
"2020","Memes against sexism? A multi-method analysis of the feminist protest hashtag #distractinglysexy and its resonance in the mainstream news media"," Hashtag feminism has become a popular tactic of online protest against gender inequality. Using the Twitter hashtag #distractinglysexy, women scientists posted pictures of themselves in labs or during field research to contest misogynist remarks by Nobel laureate Tim Hunt. We examined the resulting humorous and memetic discourse on Twitter as well as its coverage in news media combining a content analysis of the multimodal tweets with a qualitative discourse analysis of German and British news media. The results show that the ironic memes in which researchers addressed sexism in academia by parodying social norms and ideals of ‘sexiness’ yielded substantial media attention, but with differences in the two countries: While the hashtag #distractinglysexy initiated a broader debate on sexism and discrimination in academia in the UK news media discourse, in the German context, this form of ‘self-mediation’ was portrayed either as ‘something funny on the Web’ or as a harmful firestorm.

"2020","“I sexually identify as an Attack Helicopter”: Incels, trolls, and non-binary gender  politics online","Recent public debate on gender identification has provided new alternatives to the traditional binary divergent titles of “man and woman”. Some contributors to this discussion have proposed a more regressive position regarding gender equity and identity awareness, instead choosing to mock online discussion by relabeling their own gender as different forms of military hardware (“attack helicopters”). The describing characteristics of these individuals are unclear. Using a sample of respondents (N=20) to the 2016 Australian Sex Survey, we explore some key demographics of those identifying as inanimate objects of modern warfare, and those simply rejecting the possibility of non-binary alternatives. Our archetype analysis delineates participant characteristics into two subpopulations of “Incel” and “Troll”, and identifies key differences in their demographics, personality traits and online behaviours. On average, the study population presents as single Caucasian males, high school educated, with average to low incomes, and some degree of non-heterosexual attraction. While cyber aggression and trolling are well researched areas, further qualitative and quantitative research is warranted into new growing sub-populations such as Incels, and how they differ from other individuals and groups online.","",""
"2020","Online harassment of U.S. women journalists and its impact on press freedom","This investigation aimed to determine whether and how online harassment affects U.S. women journalists. Of particular interest was whether online harassment creates a chilling effect by limiting the types of stories and topics that are covered, which may influence press freedom. The survey (n=141) indicated that negative online interactions caused most participants to feel dissatisfied with their jobs. A chilling effect on coverage was also evident in responses from participants. Some respondents avoided certain stories for fear of online abuse they would receive. An overwhelming majority of U.S. women journalists (79 percent) agreed that online harassment affected press freedom. In the United States, a free and fair press is an essential component of our democracy. This study found that online harassment prevents women journalists from serving in their capacity as a watchdog on government and other institutions.","",""
"2020","Female journalists under attack? Explaining gender differences in reactions to audiences’ attacks"," The literature on public figures attacked by their audiences is unclear why female and male figures react differently to attacks. This study examines why female journalists are more likely than male journalists to use avoidance strategies as a reaction to online attacks. Avoidance includes limiting audience engagement, adapting reporting behavior, and thinking about quitting journalism. Drawing on social role theory and gender stereotypes, this study contrasts two explanatory hypotheses. The results, based on mediation analyses of online survey data of 637 journalists representative of Switzerland, show that women are more likely than men to use avoidance strategies because women are more stressed by attacks. This heightened stress is argued to result from differences in gender role socialization. In contrast, while women are somewhat more severely attacked than men, this cannot explain their greater probability of avoidance. Results contribute a theoretically and empirically rich explanation of gendered reactions to attacks. ","",""

However, more empirical research is needed that examines both the possibilities and constraints of hashtag feminism. Through a qualitative analysis of 51,577 archived tweets and semi-structured interviews, we trace the ways #WhyIStayed creates a space for feminist activism in response to victim-blaming related to domestic violence through voice, multivocality, and visibility. More specifically, we critically analyze postfeminist discourses within #WhyIStayed in order to examine contradictions within the hashtag event as well as how these postfeminist contradictions shape possibilities for feminist activism online.

"2020","“I Definitely Did Not Report It When I Was Raped . . . #WeBelieveChristine #MeToo”: A Content Analysis of Disclosures of Sexual Assault on Twitter"," The “Me Too” movement, founded by activist Tarana Burke, began in 2006, before Twitter became the viral platform for political activism and news media that it is known for today. The reemergence of the Me Too movement on Twitter in 2017 sparked a widespread focus on the societal issue of sexual misconduct. This study examines sexual assault disclosures as an aspect of such misconduct through the context of the Me Too movement on Twitter. Through the use of content analysis, online disclosures of sexual assault ( N = 1,459) are examined for variations of sexual explicitness and attainment of social functions per the functional theory of self-disclosure. Specifically, this study explores associations between Twitter network structure and (1) levels of sexual explicitness and (2) retweet count. Through manual coding and statistical analysis, the study finds associations between sexual explicitness of online disclosures and retweet count as well as associations between network structure and sexual explicitness of disclosures. The study shifts the focus of disclosure discourse from dyadic communication to the contemporary context of networked social media. Implications for theory and practice are discussed, which include, but are not limited to, the exploration of associations between disclosing and catharsis, disclosing that may be characterized as neutral or conflicted, and disclosing sexual assault without being sexually explicit.

"2021","Communicative Forms on TikTok: Perspectives From Digital Ethnography","TikTok is an app that allows people to create, share, and consume short-video content. Although only available internationally since 2017, it has already been downloaded more than 2 billion times and has around 800 million active users. Public interest in the fleeting and seemingly random video clips that TikTok hosts is high. In fact, it has grown steadily since the time of the Twitter-owned short-video app Vine that ended its service in 2016 with only a quarter of TikTok’s current userbase. However, despite this steady growth in popularity, observations and theorizations of short-video apps like TikTok remain lacking. In this article, I thus seek to address this lack by critically discussing how to study short-video communications from the bottom up and by presenting the results of an exploratory investigation into TikTok and its communicative forms.

Drawing on a digital ethnography project, this article considers what could be learned about the “infodemic” from existing health information-sharing communities and creators on TikTok and examines the affective spaces of information they cultivate. Findings from this ethnography reveal that health information sharing practices on TikTok use playfulness, memes, and other platform elements, alongside familiar techniques of highlighting one’s expertise and relatability as a healthcare worker.","",""

This paper uses a mixed-methods approach and draws on network ethnography (Howard, 2002) to explore the visibility of these ‘everyday’ sexual assault disclosures and how such disclosures further survivors’ disclosure motivations. Social network analysis of 23 Twitter hashtags related to sexual assault shows minimal engagement with disclosive tweets, while interviews with survivors (N = 27) indicate that hashtagged disclosures can result in impactful interactions with other survivors, particularly via less visible social media channels, such as direct messages. In combination, results suggest (1) that survivor networks can and do form around mundane hashtags, and (2) that highly visible hashtagged disclosures act as beacons to other survivors and are employed in pursuit of motivations such as supporting other survivors and challenging stigma associated with sexual assault.","",""
"2021","Let’s (re)tweet about racism and sexism: responses to cyber aggression toward Black and Asian women","ABSTRACT Online, anyone’s words can easily be amplified – and on Twitter, the platform’s algorithm highlights tweets that gain attention from other users, which can exponentially reinforce a tweet’s popularity. Moreover, retweets can help spread a message well beyond the reach of its original poster. Thus, users’ interactions with posts containing or making reference to racism or sexism both illuminate the ways individuals accept, challenge, or engage with racism and sexism online, and shape how those messages spread. Using an original dataset of 59.5 million tweets, I test how particular features of messages referencing Black and Asian women predict user engagement (retweets, likes, and replies). This analysis further focuses on messages including terms that express racist or sexist content. Generally, messages including covert racist or sexist insults have a modest positive effect on all measures of user engagement (retweets, likes, and replies), which may suggest that social media environments allow individuals the time and opportunity to contend with topics that can be more difficult in-person. Additionally, variations in engagement with tweets that include references to women, Black or Asian individuals implies that users respond differently to messages involving references to and normative images of different racial, ethnic, and gendered identities. This research illuminates how specific manifestations of racialized and gendered language referencing women, Black and Asian people can not only encourage more engagement, but also share, accept, or challenge messages about marginalized identities.","",""
"2021","Evidentiary activism in the digital age: on the rise of feminist struggles against gender-based online violence","ABSTRACT Gender-based online violence (GBOV) involves digitally-mediated and -enabled forms of harassment and abuse targeting women, and thus represents a major challenge to feminist movements globally. In this paper, we argue that civil society-based feminist organizations from various parts of the world have responded to this challenge by centring evidence of GBOV in order to develop key though hitherto under-examined epistemic, cultural, and socio-political practices, which we term evidentiary activism. Using a qualitative content analysis of 82 documents produced by feminist organizations, our analysis finds that this activism has two fundamental components. First, feminist organizations engage with existing formal evidentiary cultures by advancing and critiquing legislative and regulatory reforms to address GBOV, platform-based technological ‘solutions,’ and conventional notions of user privacy and anonymity. Second, they embrace and contribute to informal evidentiary cultures, which treat evidence as a tool of cultural and political mobilization against GBOV through strategies of publicization, moral pollution, and the cultivation of feminist digital citizenship. We contend that, akin to evidence-based advocacy that is influential in the fields of biomedicine and health, feminist organizations participate in and invent modes of digitally-oriented evidentiary activism designed to combat GBOV. Feminists’ recasting of the how, why, and what of evidence represents a noteworthy development in struggles against online violence and misogyny, and within digital culture more generally.","",""
"2021","Digital microaggressions and everyday othering: an analysis of tweets sent to women members of Parliament in the UK","ABSTRACT Online abuse directed at female politicians has the potential to present barriers to the political representation of women in the digital age. Previous research has produced mixed results, with some finding little difference between the extent of abuse received by male and female MPs, while others found that women and minority groups are subjected to specific kinds of abuse. While straightforward examples of abuse and discrimination are easy to identify, categorise and quantify, tweets which include more subtle microaggressions that position women and minority MPs as unqualified and unwelcome in politics deserve attention. This research therefore employs a qualitative thematic analysis of 11,543 tweets sent to UK members of Parliament. The analysis identified four themes: 1. ‘overt online abuse’, 2. ‘everyday sexism and othering’, 3. ‘dismissing discrimination and victim blaming’, and 4. ‘claiming reverse discrimination’. We argue that these digital microaggressions serve as constant reminders of the marginalised status of female representatives, and women of colour specifically, and should be conceptualised as forms of psychological and semiotic violence that reconstitute online political spaces as a hostile environment for women and may discourage women from seeking political office or compel women representatives to leave. Digital microaggressions may therefore be as damaging to women’s democratic representation as outright abuse.","",""
"2021","TIKTOK’S PEER PEDAGOGIES - LEARNING ABOUT BOOKS THROUGH #BOOKTOK        VIDEOS","This paper eschews normative constructions of formalized ‘online learning’ to argue that learning with ‘the internet’ is mostly vernacular, ordinary, messy and constant. It uses the example of #booktok short videos to argue that individuals frequently learn from and with peers in online spaces, where ‘peerness’ is defined broadly. The paper draws on traditions within education, media and communications research such as theories of media pedagogies that refuse to see learning as pedagogically isolated within formal learning arrangements. I build on these foundations to conceptualize how TikTok viewers learn about books and reading via ‘peer pedagogies’. ‘Peer Pedagogies’ recognizes that in digital contexts individuals often learn from other individuals, regardless of if the ‘teacher’ in the relationship is directly known to the learner, and regardless of if ‘teaching’ is intended or purposeful. For instance, peer pedagogies and learning are frequently central characteristics of the relationships that form between ‘micro-celebrities’ and their fans. The paper discusses findings from an ongoing nationally funded Australian study which is mapping the digital ecology of teen reading in Australia. The project argues that one avenue for teens to find out about books is on digital platforms via peer pedagogies. That is, teenagers may purposefully or casually learn about books and reading from everyday users and micro-celebrities on digital platforms. The TikTok #booktok hashtag is therefore being investigated to identify examples of how young people learn about books and reading via TikTok videos and associated communities.","",""
"2021","TWEETING BACK: EXPLORING BLACK FEMINIST HASHTAG COMMUNITIES ON TWITTER         AND INSTAGRAM","The use of social media by Black women and femmes to talk about         topics from a Black feminist perspective has been explored within the larger context of         studies on Black Twitter and content analysis of circulated Tweets online. However, studies         have yet to empirically study Black feminist social media communities' nuanced dynamics by         directly speaking to those involved across a range of networked conversations. To fill this         gap, this study conducted 21 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with individuals who         engaged in eight different black feminist hashtag conversations across Twitter and Instagram         to expand our current understanding of how black feminist intellectual production has been         developed and broadened through the affordances of digital media. Findings suggest that         while black feminist hashtag discussions have allowed Black women to “talk back” to         hegemonic mainstream and popular discourses about Black women, these conversations are         constantly at stake of appropriation and co-optation, replicating historical erasure of         Black women’s intellectual production.","",""

This         paper presents a methodological reflection of studying the exchange of health information         and building of community and safe space amongst queer youth on the video sharing and social         networking app TikTok. Upon encountering challenges in research related to affordances         within the app, further questions are posed about how we go might about studying the nature         of content that users, especially those of a specific and historically marginalized group,         will come across in their day-to-day engagement with the app, and in so doing exchange         information and support with one-another. Existing affordances in the app beg the question         of whether content on this platform can truly be studied or understood, even in terms of a         simple content analysis, without the direct involvement of users. Replication of the user's         experience, and natural encounter with content of a specific nature, becomes challenging and         has its risks.","",""
"2021","ON GETTING CARRIED AWAY BY THE TIKTOK ALGORITHM","In this paper I respond to debates on the addictive and distractive         quality associated with algorithmic environments like the popular short-video app TikTok.         TikTok has frequently been discussed for its addictive nature. Many commentators and critics         rendering the app as emblematic for the ways in which digital media as such distract their         users from more meaningful and profound experiences. Contrasting such commentary, I draw on         a one and half year long ethnographic investigation of TikTok. Doing so, I outline how young         adult users of the app appropriated the TikTok algorithm's addictive quality in their search         for distraction and escape in everyday life and during the pandemic. Teasing out         similarities with prior media forms, like soap operas or magazines, offering similar sites         of escape in daily life, I discuss how the sense of getting carried away on TikTok was         constructed by users in interaction with the app's algorithm. Finally, I will conclude by         arguing that independence, in the context of algorithms and their emotional consequences,         comes to matter not in absolute but relative terms. While for my participants ‘mindless         scrolling’ through TikTok induced pleasure, the same practice, on other platforms, like         Instagram, induced boredom. These subtle differences within the landscape of ‘addictive         media’ are often overlooked within debates and the question how they come into being require         more attention.","",""

TikTok posts presents a mode of         interdependence where users demonstrate the cultural value of music through challenge and         audio memes. This study focuses on a popular social trend on TikTok known as ‘music         challenges’. We focused on the significance and cultural meaning of music challenge memes         through five key elements – image, audio, text, story, culture – to understand what         comprises a ‘challenge’ on TikTok, how storytelling constitutes music challenges, and what         cross-cultural in-group affiliations are identified in this trend. For this purpose, we         developed a ‘TikTok music storytelling codebook’ informed by grounded theory, and selected         150 music challenge meme posts via manual scraping the ‘#MusicChallenge’ hashtag on TikTok         1–3 April 2021. Through a pilot analysis, we identified new modes of storytelling through         audio memes related to nostalgia, fandom and humour. Beyond “put a finger down” challenges         and “I know the song/I don’t know the song” lists, we found a broader significance in         telling stories grounded across cultures: sharing a childhood memory, relating to a         lifestyle type, and fanning after a musical genre. We noted a musical-peer group belonging         trend that brings out a mixture of urban tribes and experiences via creative song-mixing         that lasts seconds. To sum up, we understand that TikTok music challenges emerge as a         vehicle for interdependent groups to showcase their in-group identities through playful         audio-visual creations.","",""
"2021","TIKTOK’S ‘FOX EYE’ TREND AND EVERYDAY ACTIVISM: GEN Z AGENCY IN AN         AUDIOVISUAL NARRATIVE CASE STUDY","This paper examines TikTok as an emerging activist space for Gen Z.         It uses the ‘fox eye’ trend as a case study to illustrate how TikTok allows young people –         Asian diasporic communities in particular – to create audiovisual narratives of personal         experiences and stories to speak up against anti-Asian racism. Through a qualitative content         analysis of 30 relevant TikTok posts, the paper argues for the platform’s distinct         audiovisual features in enhancing users’ capacity for civic engagement. This paper generates         three related findings. First, young Asian users have created TikTok videos featuring a         variety of themes in relation to the fox eye trend. Some notable examples include historical         popular representation of Asians, personal experiences of racism, impossible beauty         standards, jokingly advocating for countertrends, among others. Collectively, these videos         aim to emphasize the ‘problems’ associated with the trend – that is, it is racially         insensitive and builds on cultural appropriation. The second finding suggests three main         types of narratives constructed through the videos – historical, educational and affective.         Each type is characterized by distinct narrative structures and strategies. Finally, the         audiovisual functions of the platform in creating and amplifying the narratives. That is,         the narratives on TikTok are powerful not only because of the rhetorical devices used, but         also due to their audiovisual elements such as visual filters, audio memes, image and video         compilations and non-verbal performance. Through these discussions of findings, we propose         and explain the concept of ‘audiovisual narrative agency’ as an emerging lens to understand         contemporary digital activism.","",""

"2021","#NoSnowflakes: The toleration of harassment and an emergent gender-related digital divide, in a UK student online culture"," In recent years, some political commentators and mainstream media outlets in the United Kingdom have pejoratively labelled young people, especially university students, a ‘snowflake generation’ – a term used to mock their perceived intolerance and over-sensitivity (Fox, 2016; Gullis, 2017; Slater, 2016; Talbot, 2020). This article challenges this discourse by drawing on findings from a large-scale study ( N = 810) conducted on a university campus in England that critically examined student’s perceptions of and attitudes to different forms of online harassment, including abusive, offensive and harassing communications, using survey and interview data. Key findings indicate that online harassment is so pervasive in digitised spaces that it is often viewed as the ‘norm’ by the student population who appear willing to tolerate it, rather than take actions to address it, which challenges pejorative claims that they are intolerant and easily offended ‘snowflakes’. Respondents who identify as female and transgender are more likely to be targeted by online harassment. We argue that the label ‘snowflake generation’ is diverting attention away from student’s everyday experiences of online harassment and its adverse effects, particularly on women and transgendered people, which has the potential to create a gender-related digital divide (Jane, 2018). The implications of these findings for the higher education sector will be outlined. ","",""
"2021","“Consent Is F#@king Required”: Hashtag Feminism Surrounding Sexual Consent in a Culture of Postfeminist Contradictions"," Hashtag feminism exists in a time of postfeminist contradictions marked by the simultaneous existence of popular feminism and popular misogyny. In one such contradiction, popular feminism has led women to expect the successful negotiation of sexual consent, while popular misogyny permits the circulation of traditional sexual scripts that disregard the necessity of consent. In this study, we analyze messages conveyed through digitized narratives of sexual consent posted on Tumblr, a social media site that is popular among feminist activists, to identify the ways that users construct meaning around the dissonance between expectations for consent and the inequalities that inhibit its negotiation. We specifically explore whether hashtag feminism navigates postfeminist contradictions in a way that simultaneously calls out misogyny and calls on feminism. We find that the Tumblr posts in our sample did both, albeit in a manner that failed to offer tangible solutions to the problem at hand. Calls on feminism were largely limited to tagging feminist allies and recirculating existing feminist campaigns. Thus, we argue that the hashtag ultimately became a handoff to a larger feminist abstraction. Future research should explore conditions under which activists link tangible issues, actors, and agendas to an otherwise abstract popular feminism. ","",""

This study analyses online newspaper comments on articles about gender based violence to establish whether the historic marginalisation of women within public discussions is being reasserted online. Using thematic analysis, this study found that responses were characterised by disbelief. Posters questioned the type and nature of evidence that had been provided, they questioned whether these problems resulted from sexism and they questioned the feminist agenda behind the blogs. While voices expressing disbelief were dominant, there were counter-voices attempting to critique the scepticism by advocating for the importance of the lived experience women and girls. The study demonstrates that online comments on news websites operate as gendered spaces that can marginalise women from the public discussion of social problems.","",""

Drawing from the concept of polymedia and debates on digital connection and disconnection, which center on individuals’ choices whether to connect or detach from digital media based on the affordances they offer, the article highlights an affordance shaping users’ choices of media that have not received sufficient emphasis in these discussions: namely, the ability of a platform to foster intimacy. Based on qualitative research combining structured and semistructured interviews with 14 individuals, the article discusses how and why TikTok has come to be perceived either as an object of attachment with which individuals have intimate relations or as a site for individuals to fashion a shared sense of intimate, safe space with other users. I also illustrate that the ways individuals talk about intimacy intersect with how they talk about the algorithmic systems. Combining approaches from critical algorithm studies, media choices, and research on mediated intimacies, the article demonstrates that (a) individuals choose TikTok to foster intimacies and (b) users connect seemingly contradictory concepts of intimacy and algorithms in their choices of TikTok.

This study addresses digital hostility levelled at public figures, and does so through the case study of Wilson Gavin. Gavin had cultivated a minor public profile in Australia through his conservative activism. In January 2020, after protesting at a drag storytelling event in Brisbane, Gavin was subject to significant online abuse; a day after the protest, he died by suicide. This study examines the forms, themes and frameworks of that abuse as it played out across a small sample of publicly available Twitter posts. The study also addresses Twitter responses to the death. These responses are significant in that they individualise Gavin’s suicide and portray him as unable to protect himself and thus inherently vulnerable to taking his own life. Conversely, the study suggests that Gavin’s death points to the need for an understanding of how digital hostility harms those who are subject to it and how public figures can become resilient to that hostility.","",""
"2022","Policing “Fake” Femininity: Authenticity, Accountability, and Influencer Antifandom"," Although social media influencers enjoy a coveted status position in the popular imagination, their requisite career visibility opens them up to intensified public scrutiny and—more pointedly—networked hate and harassment. Key repositories of such critique are influencer “hateblogs”—forums for anti-fandom often dismissed as frivolous gossip or, alternatively, denigrated as conduits for cyberbullying and misogyny. This article draws upon an analysis of a women-dominated community of anti-fans, Get Off My Internets (GOMIBLOG), to show instead how influencer hateblogs are discursive sites of gendered authenticity policing. Findings reveal that GOMI participants wage patterned accusations of duplicity across three domains where women influencers seemingly “have it all”: career, relationships, and appearance. But while antifans’ policing of “fake” femininity may purport to dismantle the artifice of social media self-enterprise, such expressions fail to advance progressive gender politics, as they target individual-level—rather than structural—inequities.

"2022","“Who’s Going to be a Creep Today?” Understanding the Social Media Experiences of Women Broadcast Journalists"," Reports of the online harassment of journalists have continued to increase as more newsrooms place higher emphasis on social media engagement with audiences. However, this harassment is subject to gendered dynamics, as women journalists are most often the target of online abuse, and the attacks themselves are often gender-centric. This study employs a mixed-method approach to explore how gender influences broadcast journalists’ social media interactions with audiences. Qualitative interviews with US broadcast journalists, along with a social media discourse analysis of the journalists’ Twitter pages, reveal the sexist nature of these interactions. Specifically, findings show that women journalists are treated not only as sexual objects, but also as non-serious journalists. In response to this treatment, women journalists adjust their social media strategies by limiting what they post and blocking certain users. This puts women journalists in a difficult position: increase coveted audience engagement and deal with online harassment or block abusive social media users and suffer the career impacts of low audience engagement. Implications are discussed. ","",""
"2022","#Mixedcouples on TikTok: Performative Hybridization and Identity in the Face of Discrimination"," Spanish-Moroccan mixed couples exemplify a case of cultural hybridization that reflects the colonial past between these two countries. In this context, social media is a space of opportunity and risk to face discrimination and othering. In this article, we draw upon postcolonial theory and Internet studies to consider TikTok affordances as tools that are relevant to understand how cultural, national, and religious identities are shaped and presented in digital spaces. In this sense, this study constitutes the first exploratory analysis of Moroccan-Spanish mixed couples’ (self)representations and identity construction as reflected by their TikTok content. The memetic and intersectional aspects of the mixed-couple identity emerge as central in the convergent nature of the platform and their lived experiences. Through an initial analysis of 8,653 TikTok videos, we identified 6 creator accounts with more than 10K followers to conduct a deeper multimodal content and discourse analysis of 146 videos. This enabled us to explore how these creators portray their hybrid identity through short, vertical videos harnessing TikTok’s vernaculars and affordances. The results enable us to propose the concept of performative hybridization, which involves discursive markers within these couples’ TikTok content that reflect a fluid integration of two cultures, while the pervading visual and narrative components reflect the dominance of one set of identity traits over the other. In this case, Moroccan culture is more prevalent. ","",""

A qualitative analysis of this data finds three distinct themes emerge: (1) awareness of the algorithm, (2) content without context, and (3) self-creation across platforms.

TikTok's endless stream of content, the lack time stamps or notifications of ever being “all caught up,” and concealing the phone's clock make it easy to lose track of time on TikTok. However, there is a lack of knowledge about how TikTok use may therefore interfere with our circadian rhythms, particularly our sleep hygiene. By focusing on pre-sleep cognitive arousal, this study aimed to close this knowledge gap by investigating the association between automatic TikTok use and daytime fatigue. We also investigated how individual preferences for sensation seeking and delayed gratification moderated this relationship. Within a sample of 1,050 TikTok/Douyin users in China, automatic TikTok use was associated with increased daytime fatigue that was mediated by higher levels of cognitive arousal before sleep. This relationship was aggravated by a preference for sensation seeking, and attenuated by a preference for delayed gratification. Above and beyond these early empirical insights, we also provide an early explanatory framework that is meant to systematize both existing and future knowledge about the use of TikTok. ","",""
"2023","Representing Online Hostility against Women","On 6 March 2023, the Australian journalist Lisa Millar appeared on the television programme ABC News Breakfast (of which she is a host) wearing a skirt with a thigh-exposing slit. Photographs of this appearance were circulated on Twitter alongside misogynist commentary about the choice of attire. Millar addressed this commentary on air, admonishing not only those who posted it but also the media outlets where it was republished. This article uses the Millar case as a prism through which to pursue the question: “what are the ethical considerations for journalists when representing online hostility against women?” The article suggests that journalistic representations are significant not only because they help construct public understandings of the issues being reported, but because of the repetition that necessarily constitutes representation. The very term “representation” connotes the “re-presentation” of something past; in the case study, journalists – through graphically depicting the hostility Millar has endured – ­have effectively (and probably unintentionally) exacerbated that hostility. The article concludes with a list of ethical considerations and explores how journalists may negotiate these when reporting on misogynist online abuse. Online Hostility against Women: Research Gap Online hostility is “a cultural condition which has emerged as a practice of communication; and an attitude or mode of disposition towards others that reflects and is produced by the instantaneity of online communication” (Thompson and Cover 1771). The term encompasses a range of practices that are designed primarily or exclusively to offend, degrade, or subjugate. These practices include trolling (posting content to generate heightened responses), doxing (posting personal details – e.g., home addresses – online without permission), and cyberbullying.  The study to which this article belongs seeks to contribute to ongoing research into online hostility directed against women. Researchers have demonstrated that this hostility reflects and exacerbates broader gender inequality (Jane, “Back”), and that it has a parlous impact on wellbeing, especially for those who are abused online and those who witness or are otherwise made aware of this abuse. Online hostility can cause psychological damage (Vakhitova et al.) and make victims reluctant to participate in online fora; Millar herself left Twitter in 2021 after being abused on that platform (Quinn). Online hostility against women can be amplified by prejudices including racism, as witnessed in online attacks against African-American actress Leslie Jones (Lawson) and Sudanese-Australian Muslim commentator Yassmin Abdel-Magied (Fyfe). A growing corpus of scholarship has investigated hostility against female journalists. Fiona Martin notes that “journalists are disproportionately subject to online violence due to the public nature of their work, their focus on covering and analysing aspects of societal conflict and their normative watchdog role” (75). Martin further acknowledges that women journalists “are subject to more frequent, image-oriented and sexualised violence, with deeper structural and social roots and more significant impacts than for men in their profession” (75). Millar’s 2023 Twitter attackers made hostile comments about her physical appearance; victims can be maligned on account of other factors, too, including their ethnicity, sexual identity, or religion. Online hostility against female journalists has also taken the form of rape and death threats (Jane, “Back”), and social media posts attacking them for working in traditionally “masculine” journalistic domains such as sports reporting (Antunovic). Currently, little research exists on journalistic representations of online hostility against women. This is striking given the pivotal roles that journalistic reportage still plays in constructing public understandings of social issues. An exception is a 2017 study which found that “media frames of trolling reinforce the normalisation of online violence against women as an extension of or proxy for gendered violence” (Lumsden and Morgan 936). This study’s findings echo studies of the ways in which “offline” violence against women (including rape and murder) has been represented in media texts (e.g., Morgan). Representation: Politics and Repetition  This article is premised firstly on the argument that representation is an inherently ideological endeavour. Stuart Hall suggests this when he argues that representation “connects meaning and language to culture”; it gives form/s to the way we view and experience the world, legitimising and challenging dominant power systems (Hall 1). This kind of argument has informed feminist scholarship on how mediatised representations of violence against women reinforce gendered power imbalances and stereotypes; the 2017 study cited above is one example. Secondly, the article argues that the power of representation lies in the logic of repetition. This is suggested by the word itself; the object of representation is re-presented, staged again via the deployment of language and visuals – sometimes on multiple occasions. In a to-camera address recorded during ABC Breakfast News on 8 March 2023 (not coincidentally, International Women’s Day), Millar remarked: “that [her online abuse] then ended up online on some news sites where the photos and the abuse were republished made me angry”. The journalistic reportage cited by Millar re-presents that hostility – which was already highly public by virtue of the target’s media profile and by its enactment on Twitter – in public fora (including media outlets that publish journalism). In doing so, this reportage risks granting legitimacy to that hostility; the latter becomes worthy of repeating, even as it may be framed as problematic. In this respect, there are echoes of reportage on right-wing extremists, which – while sometimes well-intentioned – has given those actors “a level of visibility and legitimacy that even they could scarcely believe” (Phillips 32). (It should be acknowledged that online hostility is not perpetrated only by those aligned with a specific political disposition.) Further, journalistic representations of online hostility against women involve the re-presentation of hostility that has – in some cases – been re-presented multiple times on social media platforms. Research has demonstrated that hostile comments and the resharing of abusive content “by very large or uncountable numbers of individuals” can amplify the hostility’s force (Thompson and Cover 1772). This appears to have been the case with Millar; shots of the skirt were shared even by those claiming to defend her, as were vituperative comments about the clothing, and these were shared yet again in certain media coverage (on the 8 March broadcast, Millar’s co-host Michael Rowland identifies news.com.au and Daily Mail as publishers of this coverage). That coverage could then be shared and re-shared on social media. Ethical Considerations for Journalists  This section begins the task – one that is beyond the scope of a single article – of outlining the ethical considerations journalists should make in producing representations of online hostility against women. The section is informed by ongoing scholarship on media ethics, and especially two of its key aims: mitigating harm and maximising equitable participation in online spaces, including social media platforms (Johnson). The section draws on insights from extant scholarship on media representations of violence against women. The following considerations may be adapted to studies of ethical reportage on racism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia. The first consideration involves abandoning gendered stereotypes. Stuart Hall argues that “stereotypes get hold of the few, ‘simple, vivid, memorable, easily grasped and widely recognized’ characteristics about a person, reduce everything about the person to those traits, exaggerate and simplify them” (247; emphasis in original). The simplicity of stereotypes and their familiarity among audiences could make them a convenient go-to for journalists. Feminist media scholars have critiqued the stereotyping of female victims as either “undeserving” innocents or “deserving” (sexually active, revealingly dressed) vamps (Benedict; Morgan). Journalist Ginger Gorman has critiqued the stereotyping of online hostility proponents as bizarre, unhinged, Other; these include the “loner in his mum’s basement” (24). In fact, Gorman argues, these individuals exist within the same society as “we” all do, one where gender inequality still holds currency; they are not rare bad actors (Gorman 264). The second consideration involves interviewing or otherwise obtaining quotes from victims. This should involve the cultivation of trauma literacy and, relatedly, an awareness of how certain lines of questioning can distress victims and journalists (Seely). In the case study under review, Millar decided to speak publicly about her online abuse and, in doing so, received support from her colleagues and television network employer (Meade). She had the platform and the (apparent) willingness to respond to her abusers. Her distress is nevertheless palpable in the 8 March broadcast. The third consideration concerns the explicitness of the detail provided about online hostility. This is especially contentious. Media scholar Emma A. Jane argues that  a less explicit and more polite way of discussing [online hostility against women] may have the unintended consequence of both hiding from view its distinct characteristics and social, political and ethical upshots, and even blinding us to its existence and proliferation – of implying that it circulates only infrequently and/or only in the far flung fringes of the cybersphere. However, research … provides ample evidence to support the contention that gendered vitriol is proliferating in the cybersphere; so much so that issuing graphic rape and death threats has become a standard discursive move online. (“Back” 558)  Jane is clarifying why she has chosen to report – sometimes verbatim – online misogyny. Her words have relevance for journalism. No ethical representation of online hostility against women should downplay its seriousness or frame it as being either an aberrant phenomenon or simply lively (but not necessarily injurious) banter. Jane has elsewhere chronicled the “economic vandalism” (her term) wrought by hostility directed against women workers, including journalists (Jane, “Gendered”). Nonetheless, Millar’s 8 March statement demonstrates that repeating online hostility in detail can (further) distress victims. This can also expand the reach of the hostility, and frame it as somehow worth repeating (even if only for the purpose of critique). The two media outlets accused by Michael Rowland of doing this both proclaim to abhor the abuse and do so via the florid language that is redolent of tabloid media. News.com.au describes the abuse as “sickening” (Borg); Daily Mail labels the abusers “vile online trolls” whose commentary was “disgustingly personal” (Milienos). The abhorrence is diminished by the republication in both pieces of abuse directed against Millar. One of these articles even quotes the tweets of a high-profile Australian Twitter user who – in admonishing Millar’s attackers – posted screenshots of abusive commentary. The fourth consideration involves acknowledging the systemic nature of online hostility against women. This does not comprise isolated acts of aggression against individuals. For instance, where there is space permitting, journalists could cite statistics regarding this hostility and its prevalence. In her 8 March address, Millar stated:   [I am] angry on behalf of myself, and also on behalf of other women, young women who see those stories and see someone like me being violently abused day after day … I worry it might make [young women] think that no progress has been made and that it’s not worth it to be a woman in the public arena.  Millar emphasises that online hostility does not impact only on its targets; it can potentially have a prohibitive impact on the public participation of all women, especially – though not only – when the target has a media profile. “Public participation” can entail working as a journalist or even using social media. The fifth, and perhaps most challenging, consideration entails how exactly more ethical journalistic representations of online hostility might be encouraged or welcomed in the contemporary mediascape. This consideration is as much for policymakers and journalism researchers as journalists themselves. The current Australian Federal Minister for Women, Katy Gallagher, described the republishing of hostile commentary about Millar as “providing clickbait to generate readers” (cited in May). This may seem simplistic – sensationalism and gendered stereotypes are not recent phenomena –, but it is a reminder that their commercial viability persists. There has been public outrage against gendered online hostility; statements by Rowland and myriad Twitter users (some of them journalists) exemplify this. Such outrage can have beneficial outcomes; for instance, research has demonstrated that online “call outs” against misogyny and sexism can publicly emphasise the harms it causes and, therefore, its unacceptability (Mendes et al.). These call outs ­– which include hashtag movements such as #MeToo and screenshots of threatening direct messages – can help attach negative meanings to sexist practices. Nonetheless, outrage in itself cannot prevent or necessarily even restrict hostility. For ethical journalistic representations of online hostility against women to flourish in any tangible sense, widespread institutional changes are required. The ethical considerations listed above could be taught within university journalism curricula, in the same way that trauma literacy has been (Seely; Thompson); in fairness, such teachings might well be underway. Those considerations could also inform guidelines for journalistic reportage of online hostility. There are already several (actual or proposed) guidelines for reporting on violence against women (e.g., Our Watch), as well as “digital safety strategies for women journalists” (Martin 74). Finally, ethical journalistic representations of online hostility against women must be accompanied by proper regulation of this hostility. Such regulations have been the topic of impassioned debate amongst media outlets and politicians in jurisdictions that include Australia (Beckett). Ethical representations – whatever these might look like (and they will necessarily be as diverse as journalism itself) – would have limited benefit in environments where the hostile actors are permitted to remain on the platforms where they abused others. This article has argued for the importance of ethical journalistic representations of online hostility against women. This hostility threatens the wellbeing of its victims and those who witness or are otherwise aware of the abuse; that threat is amplified when the hostile behaviour itself is re-presented, either by journalists or everyday social media users, in graphic detail. Those points have been teased out via the case study of Australian television journalist Lisa Millar. Millar’s Twitter abuse, and the subsequent reportage of that abuse, highlights a need for representations that educate audiences on the harms of online hostility without exacerbating those harms.

"2023","Disclosing sexual abuse on a news website: a qualitative study of affective narratives","ABSTRACT While previous research has examined self-disclosure of sexual abuse in advice columns of magazines, newspapers, and social media spaces such as Reddit, Twitter and Facebook, this qualitative study navigates new terrain by examining such narratives published on an Indian news website by drawing upon the concept of ‘counterpublics’ and the theory of networked affect. A thematic analysis of the narratives showed that apart from acknowledging lingering trauma and suffering, the survivors questioned mainstream portrayals and assumptions about sexual abuse. Many survivors also highlighted the dilemmas associated with confiding about sexual abuse in Indian parents who often focus on family honor and reputation. Shedding anonymity, an affordance offered by the online medium, a majority of the survivors shared identifying information about themselves thereby taking a strong stand against victim-blaming and silencing. By posting self-disclosures of sexual violence and abuse on a news website, the survivors expanded the boundaries of the ‘parallel public sphere’ in the Indian context where issues about sexuality are often limited to the advice columns of women’s magazines. While written in the nature of deeply personal accounts, the affective narratives shared by the survivors simultaneously performed political work by building collective resistance against dominant sexual and societal norms albeit amidst an English-speaking, digitally savvy audience.","",""
"2023","Theorising TikTok cultures: Neuro-images in the era of short videos"," Instead of viewing TikTok as a platform, in this article we borrow Dutch film theorist Patricia Pisters’s concept of neuro-images to approach TikTok as a cultural form that is deeply participatory, platform contingent, and algorithmically engraved. In the co-production between algorithms and users, TikTok becomes an enormous database and generates personalised narratives about individuals and the world onto and through its ‘brain-screen’ interfaces, which simulate our conscious and unconscious mind, and actualise the idea of creativity based on repetition. TikTok thus enables a quasi-automated cinema, whose non-stopping filming of everyday lives does not seek to reduce desires and tastes into a singular and coherent structure, but instead uncovers, releases and contains them in its vast database and interfaces, leading to a fluid and modulating categorisation of identities. It is within this quasi-automated, deeply participatory digital cinema that TikTok constitutes neuro-images, producing a distinctive experience of time, and unpredictable and unstable futures.

"2023","Reconsidering trauma and symbolic wounds in times of online misogyny and platforms"," This article provides an exploratory discussion of the misogynist online incel community and its discourses around mental health. Incels’ discussion of mental health conditions, trauma and victimhood is outlined in relation to Allen Meek’s development of the concept of the symbolic wound. It is argued that incels’ alleged trauma constitutes the construction of a symbolic wound as a marker of group identity as well as a means of shocking and potentially traumatising others. The concept of the symbolic wound is further developed through the psychoanalytic notion of dis/inhibition which shows how incels are torn between modes of desiring and symbolically destroying women. The collective identity of the symbolic wound and its (non)-relation to trauma can thus be more fragile and contradictory than has been discussed in the literature so far. ","",""
"2023","Media, digital sovereignty and geopolitics: the case of the TikTok ban in India"," TikTok, one of the most downloaded apps in the world, has been banned in India since June 2020, following military clashes on the India-China border. This article focuses on government narratives of the TikTok ban in the Indian media and situates the issue within the broader geopolitical framework of deteriorating Sino-Indian relations and attempts for digital sovereignty. At a time of strong nationalist discourses dominating the political and social communication in India, it is perhaps unsurprising that the narratives have been seen outside India as protectionism. However, this paper argues that the digital sovereignty in the Indian context is not exclusionary but aims to create a robust digital infrastructure that is critical for economic development and self-reliance. Highlighting the lessons from India, this paper concludes the following: (i) digital sovereignty is a form of discourse which does not imply any specific policy, (ii) digital sovereignty relates to user control over their data, however, the role and limits of the State is not clearly defined and (iii) digital platforms are highly vulnerable to changing geopolitics in which their existence is not determined by user-platform interactions but by international relations.

"2023","Understanding the popularity and affordances of TikTok through user experiences"," In this paper I discuss the affordances and popularity of the short-video app TikTok from an audience studies point of view. I do so by drawing on findings from ethnographic fieldwork with young adult TikTok users based in the United Kingdom that was conducted in 2020 and 2021. I trace how using the app, specifically scrolling through the TikTok For You Page, the app’s algorithmic content feed, became a fixed part of the everyday routines of young adults. I show how TikTok appealed to them as a convenient means of escape and relief that they were unable to find elsewhere during and beyond times of lockdown. Further, I highlight the complex nature of TikTok as an app and the active role that users play in imagining and appropriating the app’s affordances as meaningful parts of their everyday social life. Closing the paper, I reflect on future directions of TikTok scholarship by stressing the importance of situated audience studies. ","",""
"2023","Compelled TikTok creators? The ambivalent affordances of the short video app for Filipino musicians"," This study is concerned with the incorporation of TikTok by Filipino musicians in their performances, promotion strategies, and other career-related endeavors. As the music artists are compelled, whether consciously or otherwise, to adhere to the logics of the platform, we critically evaluate its implications on their experiences as creative workers. As revealed, the use of TikTok by Filipino musicians fosters the construction of a new cultural logic and format that enhances music content and narratives as they engage in novel creative pursuits as well as participate in nascent forms of audience relations. Yet the prevalence of TikTok use within the music industry also engenders a new range of obligations that reinforce existing pressures on musicians. This study sheds light on the ambivalent role of TikTok as a platform that could potentially liberate and amplify independent and creative cultural production while also generating new sources of tension for creative workers.

"2023","TikTok and its mediatic split: the promotion of ecumenical user-generated content alongside Sinocentric media globalization"," TikTok has ousted Google as the world’s favorite online destination in 2021. As China’s first emergent social media app making its mark across the Global North and South, it has prompted a shift in our global mediascape. Following in the footsteps of YouTube and Instagram after it, TikTok is facilitating new identities through User-Generated Content (UGC) while challenging the hegemony of American-led platform culture. UGC analyzed in this article views it unabashedly as a youthful narcissism through which a form of self-reinvention online is created. This is culturally surmised as an intriguing new form of global creativity that I label ecumenical UGC. Yet, scholarship has largely examined TikTok through empirical and content analysis frameworks only, negating the compelling cultural studies issues evinced in this trendy media. In conjunction with discussions of TikTok’s meteoric rise, this article also probes how the Chinese company that owns this app bends several UNESCO media principles, creating its mediatic split with its twin, Douyin operating only in the PRC. By laying out this other path, one detects a shrinkage of cultural globalization in the pandemic era as TikTok becomes a carrier of ‘underglobalization’ flows, a disrupter and provider of algorithmic content, all going under not against older notions of global culture.

"2023","TikTok and the platformisation from China: Geopolitical anxieties, repetitive creativities and future imaginaries"," In this special issue, we explore the geopolitics, aesthetics and future potentiality surrounding TikTok to assess the possibility and implications of a new phase of digital globalisation. A phase in which China-based innovative platform technologies, infused with state power, generate and potentially disrupt digital cultures in places outside China. We will further explore this in the next part of this introduction, showing how the global rise of TikTok is feeding into increasing geopolitical anxieties worldwide. At the same time, we argue for the need to diversify our approaches to TikTok and platform studies – the latter field is very much dominated by questions around production, monetisation, data and political economy. More approaches, focusing on aesthetics, visual culture and users, are needed. In the second part of this introduction, we mobilise the notion of repetitive creativities as a way to engage with the aesthetic affordances of TikTok. This brings us to our conclusion, in which we allude to the possibility that TikTok can be seen as a kind of silly archive, offering glimpses of a future that is not yet here, but that may well come.

"2023","Framing safety of women in public transport: A media discourse analysis of sexual harassment cases in Bangladesh"," This paper analyzes the role of print media in framing incidences of sexual harassment in public transport; particularly in the context of Bangladesh, where gender-based violence is highly prevalent in the public sphere. This article uses Douglas’ cultural theory to reflect on media practices and its institutional power to reframe the social problem through risk and blame attribution. We conducted a discourse analysis of 71 news articles extracted from four of the widely circulated and influential newspapers of Bangladesh. Our findings reveal that the hegemonic discourse of gender-based violence in public transport is systemic and/or primarily reliant on legal recourse. By contrast, discourses presenting sexual harassment as symptomatic of broader gender inequality is less frequent. Moreover, these media platforms belong to an assemblage of patriarchal social-power holders that collaborate with established law and order to facilitate a blame game, thereby relieving the same stakeholders of ownership and accountability. Given the power of news media in constructing meta-narratives of safety (and nudging policymakers), journalists must tread responsibly on issues of blame, women’s safety, and their rights to the city.

This article considers digital smell loss communities on TikTok as imitation publics characterized by repetition. Via replicable TikTok challenges, digital smell-loss communities reckoned with the unmooring effects of a seemingly mild symptom. By exploring how formulaic smell-loss challenges generated support and facilitated community-building, this article demands greater attention to a sense often considered ‘disposable’.","",""
"2023","How to train your algorithm: The struggle for public control over private audience commodities on Tiktok"," Social media users are increasingly aware of the politics of their viewing habits, and they attempt to express these politics through interactions with proprietary algorithms. Combining theories about audience commodities with scholarship about “algorithmic imaginaries,” I define “algorithmically imagined audiences” as a kind of algorithmic imaginary, and I analyze 103 TikTok videos to explore how people attempt to politically engage with algorithms to position themselves within audiences. Although algorithms and audiences are proprietary, TikTokers believe they can reassert public control over audience commodities to engage in counterpublic world-making and to re-position themselves within imagined communities. While these practices are impactful, they have conceptual and practical limits; these same tactics are used to reprivatize audience commodities and to reinscribe the neoliberal capitalist underpinnings. This article raises questions for future researchers about the opportunities and limits of sociotechnical beliefs. ","",""
"2023","CANCER ON TIKTOK–EVALUATING POSITIVE CULTURE AND ONLINE SELF-DISCLOSURE USING DIRECTED CONTENT ANALYSIS AND IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS","The presented paper characterizes TikTok practices of users with cancer and uses notions of social media as positive culture (presenting oneself without undesirable traits) and online self-disclosure understood as providing intimate, private information about oneself. The research continues the work on self-disclosure of women with breast cancer using Instagram. However, this previous research revolved around posts, and thus was limited. The current study on TikTok asks the following questions: 1) are TikTok videos disclosing information in the manner the previous research on Instagram shows? 2) What are the creators’ motivations and what meanings do they give to disclosing cancer and how do the users position themselves considering the positive culture? The study uses categories from previous work and combines qualitative directed content analysis (DCA; 862 videos are analyzed) with in-depth interviews (n=8), and these go beyond DCA to a more nuanced understanding of the users’ lived experience. Similar to Instagram, TikTok is a tool for negative (e.g., fears, anxiety, pain) and positive self-disclosure (e.g., joyful life events, self-acceptance, self-afﬁrmation) with the prevalence of positive and educational videos (e.g. prevention, debunking stereotypes and normalizing the disease). The respondents feel especially competent to educate others because of their experiences. The research undermines the traditional understanding of online self-disclosure, as for users seeking support is not that important, compared to informing and warning others. Also, the study debunks positive culture as a too-general category, as the interviewees constitute a particular niche and seem not to care how they are perceived while disclosing cancer.","",""
"2023","“HERE TO HAVE FUN AND FIGHT ABLEISM”: #AUTISKTOK USER BIOS AS NEUROQUEER MICRO-ACTIVIST PLATFORM AFFORDANCES","User biography sections on digital social platforms (hereafter described as “user bios” or “bios”) are spaces for account holders to take narrative ownership in communicating their identities to other users and interlocutors. Online platforms, such as social media, are increasingly used as community hubs for disabled groups, and especially for autistic people (Author; Author; Sins Invalid, 2019). We focus on #Autisktok, one of many enclaves for autistic community building and cultural production on TikTok. Through a critical/cultural qualitative thematic analysis of #Autisktok user bios, we assess how the user bio mediates self-advocacy, agency, and autistic-centered knowledges on #Autisktok. To investigate how autistic TikTokers use their profile’s bio section as a space for “restorying” mainstream discourses about autism and agency, we draw upon M. Remi Yergeau’s (2018) work on autism and neuroqueer rhetorics and Arseli Dokumacı’s (2023) theory of micro-activist affordances, extending these frameworks toward the digital. We pose the following research questions: How do autistic youth use the bio section on TikTok to (re)story autism diagnosis? What is the user bio’s role in creating a supportive enclave for other autistic creators, users, and activists on the TikTok platform? Three themes emerged from our analysis: the explicit use of autism in the user bio, autism and intersecting identities, and the bio as a space for asserting agentic autistic selfhood.","",""

The papers in this panel examine this claim and wrestle with its potential implications. Drawing on case studies and data from the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Ireland, we evaluate the current state of play in the online push-and-pull between feminist speech about gender-based violence and its attendant misogynistic backlashes. Using a range of different qualitative methods, these papers unpack the orientations towards visibility and transparency that urge survivors into ever-increasing degrees of exposure online; the way that digital media are reconfiguring the gender and racial politics of doubt and believability; the algorithmic pathways through which boys and men are ushered towards increasingly more radical “manosphere” content and communities; and how the problem of “believability” as it relates to testimonies of assault is being complicated and compounded online by networked misogynoir. The result is an ambivalent portrait of the afterlife of #MeToo on the internet, and some important questions for networked feminist activism going forward.","",""
"2023","“CHECK YOUR FACTS, FETUS”: #GENZ VS. #MILLENNIALS AND THE ROLE OF TIKTOK IN THE GENERATIONING PROCESS","At first glance, the “generational war” between Gen Z and Millennials appears to be merely the latest iteration of an emerging generational cohort demarcating their taste cultures, subjectivities, and values. However, these seemingly trivial and playful debates over who “belongs” on TikTok and who is the “real” social media generation provide a fruitful inquiry into examining the generationing process.  This paper examines the ways that self-proclaimed members of Gen Z and Millennials dyadically use TikTok to co-construct their respective generational consciousness by asking: What role do the platform logics, affordances, memetics, and creative vernaculars of TikTok play in the generationing process, specifically the collective construction of generational borders between Millennials and Gen Z?  I conduct a qualitative discursive analysis of the ways Gen Z and Millennials create dialogical TikTok memes, challenges, and trends to co-construct their respective generational identities. The analysis focuses on the assemblage of the narrative, visual, and audio content of memes alongside the platform logic and affordances that make such memetic participation feasible.  Such an analysis reveals how Gen Z and Millennials are using TikTok to publicly negotiate the borders of their respective generational identities and thus allows for a closer examination of the role of TikTok in the generationing process. Specifically, I demonstrate how the memetic discourse functions as a way for Gen Z to solidify what they perceive as their more progressive values while forcing Millennials to come to terms with the paradoxes of their own problematic values, subjectivities, and positionalities.","",""
"2023","PERCEIVED ENTITLEMENT AND OBLIGATION BETWEEN TIKTOK CREATORS AND AUDIENCES","In 2020 TikTok saw an influx of new users, looking for a sense of relief in the face of overwhelming loneliness, and found some palliative comfort in the sense of intimacy entailed in engaging with the works of microcelebrities. At the same time many new users became creators on TikTok, saw incredible growth, and quickly found themselves navigating a larger scale of demands on their attention and on their affects than they’d ever experienced, or, usually, expected. The purpose of this paper is to examine and describe the specific demands on the affective labor and attention of content creators on TikTok, the ways in which those demands tend to exceed what the creators themselves are comfortable with or capable of sustaining, and the challenges and limitations that prevent creators from setting, communicating, or maintaining boundaries around their labor, relationships, or personal and professional lives. I investigated these questions by participant observation and a series of interviews and explore answers in an ethnographic and autoethnographic framework. Audience members treat the emotional experience of creators as an open resource in two ways: 1) externalization, placing difficult emotional experiences in the creator’s hands with the expectation that the creator will do something about it, and so the audience member doesn’t have to; and 2) extraction, soliciting the public performance of an emotional reaction to material of the audience member’s choice. The dehumanizing experience of being treated as vending machines for intimacy is an ongoing psychological harm that, to some extent, all microcelebrities endure.","",""
"2023","EVERYDAY MISOGYNY: DISCOURSES ABOUT DEPP V HEARD ON TWITTER","This paper examines the manifestation of 'everyday' online misogyny. Social media platforms are often deeply unsafe spaces for women, particularly women who speak publicly about feminist issues. In response to a number of public controversies over the last decade, platforms have introduced a range of different design interventions and policy changes. However, these interventions have predominantly focused on the most extreme, unambiguous manifestations of online misogyny. Current literature on gender-based violence emphasises that ‘everyday’ expressions of misogyny play a significant role in normalising violence against women and reinforcing the beliefs that underpin the more exceptional misogynistic attacks.  This paper presents the initial findings of a case study of everyday misogyny on Twitter in discourses about the $2 trial. It aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of how everyday misogyny manifests in ordinary language and debates on social media platforms, as a step towards developing better mechanisms for identifying and responding to online misogyny. Our preliminary findings challenge platforms' traditional reliance on counterspeech-based approaches to addressing the harms of everyday misogyny. Rather than serving as a remedy, this study suggests that online debate about women's experiences of violence can instead, in some circumstances, become a vehicle for oppression, a manifestation of everyday online misogyny.","",""
"2023","THE POLITICS AND EVOLUTION OF TIKTOK AS PLATFORM TOOL","A fast-growing international success, ByteDance’s short video platform TikTok is a relevant case study to examine how digital platforms expand infrastructurally and accumulate power. TikTok has achieved popularity comparable to major players, including Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. It now grapples with balancing the diverse interests of its different user groups, chief among which content creators. We interrogate how TikTok manages this challenge via an exploratory study that studies the platform’s evolution through what we dub ‘platform tools,’ or, the software-based instruments for cultural production on social media platforms. Such software-based tools have been previously theorized using the ‘boundary resources’ framework, which emerged from information systems studies. This framework conceptualizes platform tools as interrelated, contextual, and dynamic, changing in response to variables internal and external to the platform ecosystem. Recognizing that platform tools are ever-changing, we conduct a ‘platform historiography’ to periodize three main trends: platform tools (1) have contributed to the formalization and professionalization of platform content; (2) have encouraged the standardization of platform-dependent cultural production; and (3) have furthered the platformization of TikTok both within, as well as outside the cultural industries. Our paper serves as a response to calls from media scholars to view platforms as contingent and ever-evolving, and to further social media historiography. More specifically, we contribute to the literature on platform studies because it focuses on an understudied aspect of platform governance: platform tools.","",""
"2023","GENDER AND MISINFORMATION: DIGITAL HATE AND HARASSMENT (PART II)","Social media platforms allow for free expression and speech, but also open possibilities for online misinformation, disinformation, propaganda, harm, and conspiracy theories (Nadim and Fladmoe, 2019). Here, gender as an analytical category plays a significant role in understanding how women, LGBTQ+ people, and members of various minorities, in particular, are disproportionately targeted by hate actors. In fact, through gendered violence and online hate, social media serves to promote structural inequality where gender minorities become the target of harassment (Jane 2014a; Jane 2017). Gendered violence and cyberhate have consequences that negatively impact women and queer groups and pose a threat to political goals through victimization and reinforcement of patriarchy (Jane, 2014b). Though anonymous in nature, mobilized and networked hate becomes a product of what Castells (1986) refers to as the culture of real virtuality where is a flow of capital, information, technology, images as well as organizational interaction. In particular, gendered cyberhate targets women in longstanding discourses that view men as superior to women (Jane, 2014b). Misogyny exists as a connective tissue that legitimizes the subjugation of feminine and othered identities in relation to heteronormative patriarchy (Kaul, 2021).  In particular, online violence against women in politics poses a deepening challenge to democracy, serving as a key tool of illiberalism and democratic backsliding across the globe. Hate speech against women in politics, female journalists and other public figures encompasses all forms of aggression, coercion, and intimidation seeking to exclude women from the digital public sphere simply because they are women. Gender misinformation here itself becomes a form of violence that undermines women and othered identities and weaponizes gendered narratives to promote political, social, or economic objectives. This online behavior seeks to achieve political outcomes: targeting individual women to harm them or drive them out of public life, while also sending a message that women in general should not be involved in politics. It is important to note that digital misogyny may not be overt at all times but benign and subtle - involving “everyday, seemingly innocent slights, comments, overgeneralizations, othering, and denigration of marginalized groups” (Anderson, 2010; Anderson, 2015) that although unintentional is insidious and dangerous.  Despite growing concerns about the increasing prevalence of misogynistic or sexist hate speech on different popular digital platforms, research in this field and the attention directed at ways to combat hate online is relatively recent. At this juncture, this panel on Gender Misinformation: Hate and Harassment will provide a forum to discuss how women in politics, journalism, and the film industry are perceived, and what the hate that targets these women looks like in practice in a global context. We bring together scholars whose interdisciplinary and comparative work in Germany, Azerbaijan, the Philippines, India, and Brazil focuses on prominent women in the digital public sphere and political leaders from racial, ethnic, religious, or other minority groups to demonstrate how misogynistic speech acts to exacerbate patriarchal norms and operationalize a relationship between gender and power. In addition to the focus on digital hate and harassment in the Global South, this panel also brings together a diversity of methodological interventions  References  Anderson Kristin J. (2015).

"2023","MOROCCAN-SPANISH COUPLES’ DECOLONIAL RESPONSES ON TIKTOK","In the past years, the use of social media has allowed migrants and other minority groups to communicate, obtain information and build an identity through self-representation and content creation. The possibility to talk about their experiences, connect to other content creators and interact with the platform allows to decentralize the European narrative and offer visibility to other cultures. In this context, TikTok emerges as one of the platforms where traditionally marginalized populations narrate their experiences and enter public debates. In this case we study Spanish-Moroccan mixed couples who must face the cultural stereotypes derived from the geographical, historical, and colonial confluences between these two nations. To carry out the study, a qualitative analysis was carried out by identifying TikTok videos using the hashtags #mixedcouples and #SpainandMorocco in their Spanish and English versions. We then identified other hashtags of interest that appeared together with these and found other videos of interest. We viewed a total of 8,653 videos and identified six profiles of interest from creators that self-identified as being part of a Spanish-Moroccan mixed couple and had more than 10K followers. This analysis reflects the difficulties faced by people who chose more intimate forms of integration and the existing colonial paradigms in terms of mixed romantic partners. At the same time, these creators exemplify the existence of points of encounter between seemingly opposite cultures and nationalities through their (self)representations and discourses on this platform, as well as the increased visibility they are achieving through their content and profiles.

"2023","TRENDING RESISTANCE: A STUDY OF THE TIKTOK #DEINFLUENCING PHENOMENON.","Starting from January 2023, a new trend gained momentum on TikTok: It is called #deinfluencing, and it collects a series of videos which criticise the consumerist logic of the influencer industry and its tendency to overconsumption, as well as the platforms’ architectures that further fuel these processes. This contribution aims at investigating the #deinfluencing trend on TikTok to analyse to what extent it represents a form of resistance to issues of overconsumption and consumerism. I argue that the deinfluencing phenomenon is an example of how forms of resistance are becoming “trending”, that is, not only currently popular or widely discussed online, but also increasingly intertwined with the affordances and algorithmic nature of TikTok. The empirical research is based on a digital method approach and qualitative data analysis techniques. After collecting data from hashtags such as “#deinfluencing” and “#antihaul”, a content analysis aimed at highlighting the emerging themes in the trend has been performed. The results show that the deinfluencing trend is composed of three main categories of content: resistance; consumerist reappropriation; and trend-surfing. Ultimately, the analysis of the deinfluencing trend shows the different ways in which resistance becomes “trending”, meaning intertwined and progressively mitigated by the logic and architecture of TikTok. It is exactly in the trending nature of these forms of resistance that lies the highly controversial and potentially problematic nature of deinfluencing: a form of resistance to and through the platform’s logic, as well as to and through consumption.","",""
"2023","DELETING VIDEOS ON TIKTOK AS ALGORITHM RELATED IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT","On TikTok, users’ self-presentation is based on interaction and communication with and through short video content rather than on profile information or messaging. TikTok users commonly display awareness for how content is customized and develop strategies and video creation practices. Our qualitative interview study examines the practices of deleting videos and making videos private as forms of impression management online.  We generally find that TikTok users deleted videos because the content or message did not represent their views or attitudes anymore or because they feared it would negatively affect their impression in offline reality. More experienced users also deleted videos in case they failed to achieve the desired feedback. We specifically identified impression management strategies related to participants’ algorithmic literacy. Participant’s assumptions of how the TikTok algorithm works influenced their decision to set videos to private instead of deleting them even if they only have small numbers of followers and likes or only occasionally post or interact with content. A main motivation to set a video to private was that deleting would mess up the users’ personalized algorithmic video feed and ultimately lead to missing trends they are looking for. Many participants also mentioned deleting videos would affect the impression the TikTok algorithm has of their profile and eventually push their videos to the wrong audiences. In this context, our results provide new insights into the effort and thought that users put into making short content on TikTok and how they manage this content to create online identities.","",""
"2023","IMMIGRANT TIKTOKERS DECOLONIZING ALGORITHMIC VISIBILITY","Immigration is deeply rooted in colonial structures that define who migrates and where, through a hierarchized perspective of the representations, knowledge, and ideas. It is possible to extrapolate these societal requirements to the digital space of social media platforms, where a combination of human and algorithmic moderation systems determine what is available, visible, and viral. Thus, colonial structures of dominance are perpetuated through coded biases and algorithmized oppression systems. The internal functioning of these moderation infrastructures is obscure, although we can glimpse at them through the contents and discourse of creators who describe their experiences with the platform, its algorithm, and the moderation policies that shape and affect their content creation practices. In this paper, we illustrate the different vernacular and platformed practices of immigrant content creators who portray the ways in which they negotiate their visibility with TikTok and its algorithmic system. The examples were extracted from a larger study that comprises 57 Latin American immigrant tiktokers who reside in the US and Spain. We use the concept of algorithmic (in)visibility as the basis for the study. The initial findings suggest that these creators deploy platformed practices such as the (re)use of audio tracks for visibility and protest; the use of TikTok vernaculars such as humor and sarcasm to convey controversial ideas; and partial deplatforming to protest the blockage of their profiles on TikTok. These practices provide insights about the decolonial negotiation of algorithmic (in)visibility taking place on social media platforms today.","",""
"2023","HASHTAGS, HIERARCHIES AND HEGEMONIES: MAINSTREAM DIGITAL FEMINIST ACTIVISM AND INTERSECTIONAL CRITIQUES","This paper focuses on the digital-material hybridity of the contemporary feminist activist, particularly the problematic and progressive potential offered by the technological affordances of the Internet and digital social media. In addition, the paper highlights the associated anxieties for feminists of being online and engaging in what is often, in this “age of surveillance capitalism” (Zuboff 2019) and toxic masculinity, a hostile, commodified and misogynistic milieu. Furthermore, the digital affordances enabled through the proliferation of Web 2.0 technology inform the nature of feminist online discourse and campaigning, which has, at times, contributed to the moral panic that surrounds attempts at centering marginalized voices, particularly members of the trans community and sex workers.  The paper will explore the relationship between online tools and platforms adopted by mainstream contemporary feminists and the role they have played in constructing ‘othering’ hierarchies within feminism, as well in enabling the intersectional critique of these narratives. Avoiding either cyber-utopian or dystopian arguments, or a techno-determinist or utilitarian stance, this paper accounts for the complex and contradictory environment that the Internet offers to feminism. The paper also recognizes the enmeshed nature of feminists with their digital tools and platforms as well as the problematic and progressive feminist activism taking place online. ","",""
"2023","THE VIBES ARE OFF: TRACING VIRAL TARGETED THEORIES ACROSS TIKTOK","The social media and short video streaming app TikTok has grown exponentially in the past four years. This exploratory research project outlines and defines a new kind of viral phenomenon taking place on TikTok: that of the targeted theory. Targeted theories are amateur investigations of an individual creator based on an—often mundane—activity recorded in a TikTok video. Targeted theories are often undergirded by mini-moral panics, charging targets with being kidnappers, killers, fakers, cheaters, etc. Targeted theories are related to online harassment; in many cases they constitute a type of harassment. They are also related to conspiracy theories, but are distinct from them in that targeted theories accuse an individual, rather than a group, of duplicity. How do TikTok’s platform affordances create an environment that is (or is not) especially hospitable for targeted theorizing? How are the identities of targeted creators who are marginalized exploited and even weaponized as part of targeted theorizing? This project tackles these questions by tracing the rise and fall of three case studies of targeted theories on TikTok, and the normative and critical discourses that emerge around them. ","",""

Of growing importance and use is TikTok, an application with a multi-modal curation structure that enables users to share content of various interests. Previous TikTok scholarship on crisis research has not considered how the application sustains a cultural understanding of a crisis event. Using a semiotic analysis approach, this study explores TikTok’s role in crisis communication by examining the process of collective sensemaking of the Port of Beirut, Lebanon explosion on August 4th, 2020. The preliminary findings reveal intersemiotic dissonance obscuring crisis discourse, thus negatively influencing the process of collective sensemaking. The results of this study motivate further research that examines tacit guidelines for crisis communication on TikTok and similar applications.","",""

Next to justifying the necessity for this approach and providing an overview of to the tool, the paper illustrates its potential by presenting the analysis of a dataset comprised of daily snapshots of TikTok’s homepage collected over 4 months from 197 countries and territories in the world. Our results shed light on which content is prioritized by TikTok on a global scale, and introduces the notion of ‘platform-mediated proximity’ - i.e., the clustering of countries according to patterns of co-recommendations promoted by the platform. Preliminary results obtained on a subset of the data suggest that TikTok’s cross-national content prioritization patterns generate forms of platform-mediated proximities that, in most cases, follow geographical lines of clustering at the regional level, with notable and interesting exceptions.","",""

However, LGBTQ+ people on the platform often experience challenges relating to visibility and censorship. As users of a variety of ages have joined TikTok’s youthful population, this paper explores the sociotechnical practices of older LGBTQ+ TikTok users as they emerge from, and are shaped by, the platform and its user cultures. It does so through an analysis of older LGBTQ+ TikTokers’ videos and metadata, gathered through novel methods for configuring research accounts to serve up this content to the For You page. Once the accounts were trained to deliver this content through TikTok’s personalized algorithmic curation, videos were collected for one hour per day over a duration of approximately 4 weeks for each account. Preliminary visual and textual analysis of videos indicates recurrent themes related to constructing identities that intersect age with sexual identity, giving advice, sharing about personal experiences and queer history, and circulating counter-discourses against homophobia and transphobia as well as messages of solidarity with targets of discrimination. Analysis of how these users negotiate TikTok’s affordances also indicates that platform’s features, policies, and dominant user practices permeate and shape older LGBTQ+ TikTokers’ self-representations, such that the platform and modes of paying attention to it have become a central element of their content.","",""
"2023","TikTok’s ‘Republicansona’ trend as cross-party cross-dressing: Legible normativity, (in)dividual representation and performing subversive ambiguity"," In the early months of 2021, a curious trend began to emerge on TikTok: left-leaning TikTokkers engaging in lampoonish performances of cross-party cross-dressing to re-present themselves as their alter-ego ‘Republicansonas’. Fascinatingly, the most profuse and popular engagements with this trend have been to cannily recode BIPOC and queer self-presentations through a sardonic pantomime of a legibly centrist normativity generated by strategically ambiguous performances of ‘whitewashing’ and ‘straightifying’. Deploying affect theory, Deleuzian critiques of neoliberalism, affordance theories of algorithmic culture, critical race theory, queer epistemologies of discursive space and textual analysis of Republicansona content, this article interrogates the operations of not just TikTok but of an increasingly right-leaning America. The central questions in this article are to examine the utility and ideology of this memetic mimesis trend while examining what this trend reveals about TikTok’s infrastructure and the potential for revolution from within the apparatus. This analysis of the mindful sardonicism of the Republicansona trend reveals its disruptive potential to call attention to the impacts of neoliberalism on expression. The act of simulating legible normativity generates a subversively ambiguous depth where testimonies of survival in the face of image-violence are shared as a second layer to the trend’s inside joke modality.

This paper argues that due to the ‘massified’ form of contemporary hostility experienced in the internet ‘pile on’, a new framework for understanding and remedying hostility is required. This paper draws on Judith Butler’s theories of identity to present an account of digital hostility as cultural and as having a negative effect on the identities and selfhood of users. It discusses the impact of the online pile-on, shaming and the ways in which hostility positions victims as ungrievable subjects. The essay recommends new ethical approaches grounded in the recognition of subjects as vulnerable, arguing that cultural ethics approaches are valuable not only as public pedagogies but for development of technological solutions and moderation interventions to help prevent hostility and hate speech.

"2023","Missed Feelings","‘Missed Feelings’ addresses the complex repercussions of traumatic experience Lauren Berlant lays out in their article “Structures of Unfeeling” (2015). The article helps to trace the unexpected mediations of injury into affect and discusses the role of victimhood from sexual assault in patriarchal societies. With regard to a case of systemic sexual abuse in Germany, I argue that unfeeling is an essential element of sexual violence. Berlant’s theoretical account of life-sustaining attachments and affect as mediation makes the dialectic of harm and lack of feeling understandable. Unfeeling in the form of social indifference enables gendered violence to occur and to continue uninterrupted, while at the same time, unfeeling is a tool used by survivors in order to be able to live with their experience of assault while often it remains legally and socially unacknowledged. This dynamic of unfeeling explains sexual violence’s subjectifying power: the expectation of not being seen as a credible victim forces survivors to search for other affective mediations of their reality. Therefore, self-protection in a patriarchal world might look risky, idiosyncratic and often unexpected.   ","",""

From one perspective, the combination of personalized recommendations and practically limitless content diminishes news consumption, as people turn to more entertaining fare. From another, algorithmic systems and social networks heighten incidental exposure, raising opportunities for news consumption regardless of explicit individual interest. In this work, we examine the potential for algorithmic exposure to news on TikTok, a massively popular social network built around short-form video. In the context of US-based news audiences, we examine the accounts TikTok recommends, the videos it shows new users, and its trending hashtags. We find almost no evidence of proactive news exposure on TikTok’s behalf. We also find that, while TikTok’s algorithms respond slightly to active signals of news interest from simulated users, that response does not lead to increased exposure to credible news content. These findings highlight a lack of algorithmic news distribution on TikTok. ","",""

As such, it proposes that queer methodologies, invoking multiple approaches infused with an ethics of care and attention to platform specificity, can be applied to examine the hurdles TikTok poses for LGBTQ+ people as well as how individuals appropriate the app for their purposes. By considering how queer identities, publics, and methods play out on TikTok, it becomes possible to locate the app’s existing and potential role in the realization of queer movements and futures.

But what discursive work does the metaphor of side do to describe online communities? Through a case study with a textual analysis of the culture, technology, interface, and platform vernaculars present in reading fandom TikTok, BookTok, we explore how user practice and app features intertwine to establish sides of TikTok as relational, individualistically positioned, and exclusionary. In the process, we also present a cursory charting of the BookTok community. Unpacking the construction and implications of this metaphor matters because it shows the distinctive and exclusionary work done by the term side, not just across TikTok but within collectives as well. Who TikTok believes to be the typical member of a side has implications for discrimination and exclusion on the app, as it feeds into existing divisiveness in communities and the app’s tendency to suppress people of color, LGBTQ individuals, and disabled individuals.

Digital Purdah, Class, and Gender Transgressions on Pakistani TikTok"," Research on women’s social media practices in Muslim societies has primarily focused on middle-class or elite women, such as influencers, activists, and members of online communities. However, we know little about working-class women’s use of social media in Muslim contexts. Using ethnography and interviews, I analyze TikTok’s early popularity with working-class women in Pakistan and report three main findings. First, TikTok’s initial reception in Pakistan was fractured across class lines; whereas middle-class and elite women dismissed it, working-class women flocked to it, and TikTok became associated with a “low-class” femininity. Second, women engaged in a range of gender transgressions on TikTok. Third, women simultaneously crafted new practices of “digital purdah,” or veiling, on TikTok. I contribute to scholarship on digital purdah by, first, showing how women combine tools available on TikTok with other veiling strategies to conceal their identity while expressing their sexuality and second, arguing that “digital purdah” is compatible, rather than incongruous, with gender transgressions on TikTok. By showing how co-constituted class and gender dynamics shaped the simultaneous popularity and moral disapproval of TikTok in Pakistan, I argue for increased attention to class dynamics in studies of new social media platforms.

The recent growing popularity of TikTok has transformed the cultures and practices of social movements worldwide. Through the platform’s participatory affordances, many users find meaningful ways to engage with the platform and its cultures, by leading and participating in a variety of activist initiatives for global awareness, social change, and civic politics. Within this context, this introduction to the Special Issue titled “TikTok and Social Movements” begins by thinking about how social media pop cultures have served as a vehicle for mobilizing and engaging in social movements for social (in)justice and politics in the era of social media. By situating TikTok, a nascent platform and culture of short video, within the ongoing discussion of digitally mobilized movements and social justice, this introduction addresses several crucial points to consider when discussing TikTok cultures and social movements that are happening or interrupted on the platform. These points are interrogated with more details and cultural contexts in the five case studies and three expert commentaries in this Special Issue. Specifically, the collection of papers interrogate how TikTok’s interactive and creative affordances have augmented and altered our cultures, practices, politics, and power dynamics of engaging with publics for various beliefs and social agendas.

"2023","Making Sense of Responsibility: A Semio-Ethic Perspective on TikTok’s Algorithmic Pluralism"," Utilizing the data collected from 40 in-depth interviews, this study explores: How do users perceive social media platforms’ responsibility in designing algorithms? What do users perceive as diverse or similar in the content generated by algorithmic recommendation systems? The analysis discusses and evaluates the tension between (a) how the platform’s algorithm feeds users similar videos that they highly appreciate and, inversely, (b) how the recommendation of similar videos might limit the diversity of content to which the user is exposed. The analysis adopts a semio-ethic framework to understand why algorithmic platforms like TikTok are perceived to be so efficient in promoting an apparent perception of inclusivity while deliberately erasing alterity and promoting universal sameness. Although videos recommended by TikTok might appear to satisfy computational criteria of diversity, the outcome masks the absence of algorithmic pluralism. The algorithm generates socially desirable videos to allow users to feel comfortable in their in-group. In other words, recommended videos perpetuate a digital form of conformism in a conscious attempt to create the illusion of a more plural community. Advancing the study of algorithmic pluralism is therefore crucial to evaluate the extent to which plurality is understood by users, and what assumptions and ethics underpin the cultures that foster algorithmic recommendation design.

"2023","Scrolling TikTok to Soothe and Foster Self-Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic"," The coronavirus pandemic reinforced the burden of self-care, which was imperative to maintaining positivity and controlling discontent amid uncertainty. Burdened with caring for themselves in the absence of psychological support covered by social health care, individuals resorted to scrolling through algorithm-ridden social media feeds to contain their stress and anxiety. Drawing on qualitative interviews with 36 individuals, this research explores the extent to which TikTok scrolling, which users would “normally” consider a waste of time, became a modality of fostering mental well-being and self-care in Turkey during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study initially positions the coronavirus pandemic as a situation that compelled individuals to wait amid uncertainty. The argument weaves anthropological approaches to waiting, critical approaches to self-care, and research on continuous connection to argue distinctive waiting experiences generated different meanings ascribed to TikTok scrolling. The findings center on resorting to algorithmic coping in self-care pursuits and perceiving TikTok scrolling as conducive to gaining practical knowledge, sociality, and physical activity. These understandings are indebted to the pressures of containing discomfort under the uncertainty of the pandemic, which rendered TikTok scrolling useful and meaningful, reducing the guilt attached to the practice. Moreover, the efficacy of algorithms in detaching users from toxic content or delivering useful content constituted a healthy way of engaging with the platform. Both the perception of healthy usage and receiving algorithmic content as contributive to mental well-being marked a shift from wasting time on social media to making time for oneself. ","",""

And how do users engage with the language of intersectionality to either reify, contradict, or complicate the intersection of the Palestinian and Black experiences on the platform?

Using algorithmic awareness as a process, this research examines the relationship between users’ awareness of the TikTok algorithm and the main concerns associated with content that conveys political or moral/religious tenets. A survey of 329 Romanian students showed that greater algorithm awareness influences positive attitudes toward algorithms, but significantly stronger positive effects are observed between awareness and the two mediators related to political and moral/religious content perceived as contentious. Using Foucauldian insights on productive resistance, I argue that in-depth knowledge about the functionality of algorithms empower users to identify and subvert different forms of power, algorithmically mediated through political or religious content. When users perceive that they have enhanced agency over what they watch on TikTok, they feel that they can control potential concerns and consequently adopt positive attitudes toward algorithms and the overall platform. Foucault discusses pastoral power as a subtle form of power, designed to empty individuals of their deepest secrets. Similarly, such power is increasingly algorithmically mediated, given that digital machines enhance their agency in often nontransparent ways. Therefore, users’ awareness regarding the functionalities of algorithms allow them to combat the various mutations specific to pastoral power while encouraging them to adopt more positive attitudes toward algorithms in general.

The videos and practices shared the following themes: realizations of on-platform value, tactics oriented against platform logics and monetization programs, shared theories of value, and digital collaboration for a cause. We argue the genres constitute forms of algorithmic mutual aid, a practice unfolding in platform economies that demonstrates people’s increased recognition of the value of their digital labor, and efforts to reorient platform logics of value, visibility, and compensation to care for one another.

However, despite these algorithmic biases, these marginalized creators have continued to find new and ingenious ways to not only create but also successfully share anti-racist, anti-misogynistic, LGBTQIA+supportive, and body-positive content on the platform. Using this tension, this essay engages visual content analysis and critical technocultural discourse analysis to examine the innovative ways marginalized creators employ TikTok’s various medium and technological affordances to evade algorithmic surveillance and oppression. Building on Simone Browne’s concept of dark sousveillance, I theorize these practices as acts of digital dark sousveillance, defined within the essay as the use of digital tools to enact surveillance subversion, obfuscation, inversion while operating within systems of racializing surveillance.

"2024","Curating hope in chronocracy: TikTok creation and the offline lives of young men from Pakistan in Greece"," This article investigates the disparity between the everyday lives of young men from Pakistan living in Greece and the impressions created through their TikTok profiles. It asks how creating and curating TikTok content counters the multifarious temporal exclusions, or chronocracy, they experience as they work undocumented and attempt to stay under the radar of the authorities. By shedding light on these young men’s own explanations for their TikTok videos, I ultimately argue that TikTok offers a way for these young men to curate a hope that reflects the futures their families in Pakistan desired for their children, while also connecting them with other young men in similar situations. The article draws attention to how multifarious tensions and pressures can both be eased and played out in curating content online and suggests ethnography as a tool and temporality as an analytic in untangling these ambiguities.

"2024","TikTok and the algorithmic transformation of social media publics: From social networks to social interest clusters"," The rise of TikTok has sparked a debate on the consequences of algorithmic content curation for social experience. My thesis is that TikTok represents a second generation of social media, which differs from first-generation social media in the way users are exposed to content. While first-generation social media revolved around ‘networked publics’ formed by explicit interpersonal connections, second-generation social media introduces ‘clustered publics’. These are statistically constructed ‘neighbourhoods’ of users, in which people are brought together based on their past online behaviour and their similarity in interest and taste. Clustering users around shared interests has proven very effective in driving online engagement, leading other platforms to mimic TikTok, in what can be described as ‘TikTokification’. However, this transformation of online publics carries a series of problematic implications: the depersonalisation of online experience; a growing opacity of the structures of online communication; and the further subcultural fragmentation of an already divided digital public sphere.

Examining the dynamic interplay of capacities and constraints of therapeutic and algorithmic frameworks reveals ways in which therapeutic roles and rituals are re-negotiated in this space. Therapists utilize memetic tropes of the platform to position themselves within its affective flows, while leveraging beliefs about the algorithm to connect with users. The affective engagement of users’ works to curate a stream of content against which mental health and therapeutic frameworks are evaluated, ultimately designating a diagnostic gaze to a charismatic algorithm—a potentially emergent social media case of automated forms becoming paradigmatic in the ways we conceive of mental health and therapy.

"2024","Our Boy Whitey: Middle-Aged Women’s Happy Object on TikTok"," This article provides an example of how middle-aged women rediscover and express emotions in digital media, mainly sexual desire but also the joy they feel among like-minded women of the same age. The ethnographic case is a community of European and North American women aged around 40 to 60 years who sexually desire 20-year-old TikTok celebrity William White. White went viral when he began lip-syncing to 1980s hits, particularly Barry Manilow’s “Mandy” while performing his flirtatious signature moves: the smile, the wink, and the eye roll. This study is based on 6 months of daily lurking in a digital community the women call Whiteyynation, structured around White’s accounts on various digital platforms. In trying to understand the meaning and function of a young male TikTok’er in the lives of middle-aged women, with Sara Ahmed’s theory of emotions, I describe how happy objects align individuals in a social community toward happiness. Specifically, I analyze how White, through a playful capitalization of 1980s music combined with a certain flirtatious look, functions as a happy object that is multiplied, magnified, and circulated in Whiteyynation. I explore the circumstances and conditions surrounding Whiteyynation as an affective space and affective economy, such as the production and distribution of self-produced content, gifting as a strategy for increased reciprocity, and the various currencies at play.

"2024","Women in STEM on TikTok: Advancing Visibility and Voice Through STEM Identity Expression"," This study investigated portrayals of women in STEM on TikTok focusing on their self-presentation of identity and use of platform features to promote audience engagement. This quantitative content analysis examined TikTok posts ( N = 400) from a 3-month sample of 100 TikTok accounts by individuals identified as women in STEM. Results for STEM-focused posts showed that these content creators provided positive portrayals of their work as women in STEM and frequent displays of their STEM identity, particularly displays of STEM competence and self-recognition. However, findings also indicated that this TikTok community displayed other social group identities less frequently and used relatively few TikTok platform features that would likely enhance audience engagement. Results suggest that positive portrayals of women in STEM on TikTok are helpful for challenging gender-STEM stereotypes, but the dearth of displays of social group identities highlights a need for more diverse women in STEM role models on TikTok. In addition, the infrequent use of popular platform features appears to be a missed opportunity for broader audience engagement. Implications for social media science influencers, science communicators, and informal STEM outreach professionals are discussed. ","",""

Since this community faces biased scrutiny based on stigmatization surrounding mental health, nonsuicidal self-injury users may turn to TikTok, which offers a space for users to engage in discussions of nonsuicidal self-injury, exchange social support, experience validation with little fear of stigmatization, and facilitate harm reduction strategies. While TikTok’s Community Guidelines permit users to share personal experiences with mental health topics, TikTok explicitly bans content that shows, promotes, or shares plans for self-harm. As such, TikTok may moderate user-generated content, leading to exclusion and marginalization in this digital space. Through semi-structured interviews with 8 TikTok users and a content analysis of 150 TikTok videos, we explore how users with a history of nonsuicidal self-injury experience TikTok’s algorithm to engage with content on nonsuicidal self-injury. Findings demonstrate that users understand how to circumnavigate TikTok’s algorithm through hashtags, signaling, and algospeak to maintain visibility while also circumnavigating algorithmic detection on the platform. Furthermore, findings emphasize that users actively engage in self-surveillance, self-censorship, and self-policing to create a safe online community of care. Content moderation, however, can ultimately hinder progress toward the destigmatization of nonsuicidal self-injury. ","",""
"2024","Educating Cancer on TikTok: Expanding Online Self-Disclosure of Cancer Patients"," The article uses the concept of online self-disclosure and examines whether TikTok videos reveal information similar to what is reported in existing research on social media within this field. In addition, the study aims to identify the creators’ motivations and the meanings they attribute to disclosing cancer and asks whether this disclosure challenges or supports the concept of a positive culture defined within the online self-disclosure framework. While similar research typically focuses on posts and is thus limited, this study combines conventional content analysis of 862 videos with in-depth interviews, offering a more nuanced understanding of the users’ lived experience. The findings highlight that TikTok is a platform for negative (e.g., fears, anxiety) and positive self-disclosure (e.g., joyful life events, self-acceptance). What is crucial, though, is that users feel exceedingly competent in educating others. The research debunks positive culture as an overly general category and undermines the traditional understanding of online self-disclosure. It reveals that seeking support is less important for patients than informing and warning others. By focusing on the educational meanings attributed to self-disclosure, this study enriches the body of research on cancer-related content shared on TikTok, including studies on low-quality cancer-related information.

"2024","Out With the Hero: How TikTok Everyday Stories Are Re-writing the Arctic"," With the rapid growth of TikTok in the last few years, we have seen the emergence of global influencers from diverse backgrounds, whose popularity is enhanced by TikTok’s specific content-based algorithm. In North America, the meta-hashtag #NativeTikTok has become a sharing space for a diverse Indigenous online community. Among these, several young Inuit women have acquired a large fanbase, allowing them to display their culture to a vast public, as well as to bring awareness to issues relating to the Arctic. In this article, we analyze how TikTok became a scale-shifting media for contemporary self-affirmation and displaying of Inuit culture. Drawing data from a case study of six Inuit influencers and an online thematic analysis of their content, we discuss definitions of Inuit authenticity on digital screenscapes, before presenting an analysis of content shared by young Inuit influencers to better understand specific forms of storytelling on TikTok and tensions pertaining to authentic cultural self-presentation. We argue that the TikTok platform provides an efficient tool for young Inuit women to engage with, learn about, and display their culture in their own terms, self-presenting as diverse and modern, in contrast with colonial Inuit imageries.

"2024","“I Had My Hair Cut Today to Share #Women_Short Cut_Campaign”: Feminist Selfies Protesting Misogyny"," This study examines the #Women_Short Cut_Campaign movement, a feminist hashtag activism that began on Twitter (rebranded as X in 2023) in 2021. The movement was to defend a South Korean female archer and Olympic gold medalist, An San, from misogynistic attacks that accused her of being a man-hating feminist, given her short hairstyle. Informed by theories about social media’s affordances and affective politics, this article unpacks how women harness social media affordances to combat sexist oppression, particularly in the sociocultural context where women’s hair is fraught with gendered stereotypes and women’s bodies are historically deprived of agency under Neo-Confucian influence. The qualitative textual analysis of 1,849 tweets mostly written in Korean, with a focus on 811 selfies and images, suggests that #Women_Short Cut_Campaign functions as networked, affective counterpublics where oppressed women construct counter-narratives against the attempts to control women’s bodies. The hashtag also challenges the binary of online or offline and stretches the traditional notion of participation by urging digitally networked participants to take action offline. Participants practiced media solidarities by encouraging each other to protect themselves from potential sexual violence. In doing so, they realized affordances for practice through optimizing and contextualizing the original use of technologies. This research contributes to discussions on the sustainability of digital activism and the need for the pluralization and diversification of contemporary feminism. It also offers an opportunity to address the call for decolonial approaches in mobilizing Western-originated theories. Finally, it invites scholars to focus more on the visual in interrogating digital feminist activism. ","",""

"2024","When Stories Turn Institutional: How TikTok Users Legitimate the Algorithmic Sensemaking"," Educational, political, or moral/religious content is increasingly present on TikTok, so contemporary social dynamics legitimize the process of digital mediation regarding these institutional values. Based on 286 open-ended survey answers and subsequent interviews with 45 Romanian TikTok users, this article applies social constructivism to explore the intersubjective side of algorithmic experiences. The significance of such a framework lies in its ability to elucidate the manner in which users actively construct their social environments, which may initially appear as isolated individual experiences but ultimately unveil shared algorithmic interpretations. Thus, the participants highlight three recurrent institutional themes in relation to TikTok’s algorithm: (1) algorithm as political profiling, (2) algorithm as moral plethora, and (3) algorithm as educational benchmark. Findings show that users’ stories related to algorithms are widely conceived within institutional frameworks. These narratives play a role in shaping what Berger and Luckmann call “intersubjective sedimentation” within the intricate interconnection between institutional and algorithmic realities. The ways in which TikTok users legitimize the presence of these institutional actors on their For You page should be seen as a form of agency negotiation between users and machines. The legitimating role of stories about algorithms also highlights the institutional necessity of intergenerational socialization, which is why the contents made by such institutional actors are more and more actively mediated through TikTok.

"2024","The Influence of BookTok on Literary Criticisms and Diversity"," BookTok, a TikTok community where creators discuss and review books, influences the publishing industry as books that gain popularity on TikTok have seen mainstream success. BookTok is believed to be a diverse space where stories about marginalized identities are celebrated. This is in opposition to the traditional publishing world that is dominated by White, heterosexual, cis-gendered men. However, despite misconceptions, online spaces are notably homogeneous, and TikTok does not appear to diverge from these patterns. By analyzing 55 TikTok videos collected from the BookTok community, this study analyzes the race, gender, and sexual orientation of TikTok creators, authors, and main characters of BookTok books. This article aims to understand the effects social media applications such as TikTok have on the publishing world and to understand BookTok’s relation to diversity. While there is more gender equity among the authors of BookTok than in the traditional publishing world, there continues to be a deficiency in the prevalence of marginalized authors on the platform. Although women creators and women authors are popular on the app, most of these women are White. In addition, the authors who are most discussed on BookTok do not typically include persons of color or members of the LGBTQ+ community. The tendency for authors to write about their own experiences results in there being few characters of color and few books about members of the LGBTQ+ community. Publishing houses should prioritize increased collaboration with authors of color and LGBTQ+ authors, while also using BookTok to promote and advertise their work. ","",""
"2024","Mediated Sexual and Romantic Learning on TikTok: The Dating Wrapped Trend"," The Dating Wrapped trend on TikTok takes inspiration from Spotify’s annual Wrapped event where Spotify users are presented with their year-end listening statistics. Dating Wrapped repackages fundamental components of Spotify’s Wrapped—a focus on aesthetics, PowerPoint-like presentation of information, and quantification of personal experiences—but does so in the context of interpersonal relationships as a dating year-in-review video on TikTok. This article applies a content analysis and critical thematic analysis to 54 TikTok videos with the hashtag DatingWrapped as a way to understand how sensemaking about sexual and romantic relationships occurs when individuals create content centered around self-disclosures of intimate experiences. Ultimately, we argue that trends such as Dating Wrapped provide opportunities for personal expression among emerging adults who use TikTok, the efficacy of which is enhanced by attention to data visualization within its presentation format. Second, TikTok trends centered around interpersonal relationships may influence the formation of sexual and romantic identities through processes of mediated learning about relationships. ","",""

It uses the concept of “peer pedagogies” to identify how the #BookTok hashtag is used to invite book and reading enthusiasts to take up learning positions. The article uses an exploratory approach to identify contrasting videos in which learning about books and reading is made available, and it undertakes an in-depth content and semiotic analysis of three videos to consider how learning is framed in different ways. The article is informed by Bernstein’s theorization of pedagogical classification and framing, which relates to how knowledge and skills are institutionally defined, and how knowledge is made available along a continuum of greater and less formality. This approach enables a consideration of the learning positions available to members of the #BookTok community as they engage with the videos. The article shows how #BookTok creators make deliberate creative and pedagogical choices to use TikTok’s affordances to share knowledge and skills as a form of public media pedagogy and service to the #BookTok community. In addition, it argues that the sharing of knowledge and skills between people who share a passion and interest in books and reading contributes to the videos’ popularity and success. ","",""
"2025","‘Eyo, mixed girl check’: The commodification of embodied performance in the #mixedgirlcheck trend on TikTok","Feminist media research has provided a wide range of studies exploring how individuals navigate and negotiate their identities within the neoliberal platform economy. Popular feminist ideas and social media representations are often criticized for their lack of diversity and strong focus on Western, white, able-bodied, upper-class ciswomen. In this article, we expand on existing literature by focusing on creators’ self-representations under the #mixedgirlcheck on TikTok. The nomenclature of #mixedgirlcheck implies to present a different form of girlhood (‘mixed’) with the potential to subvert popular femininity. Through critical discourse analysis, we analysed 100 TikTok videos to answer our research question: ‘How do creators represent their identities in videos posted under the #mixedgirlcheck on TikTok?’. Our analysis revealed four prominent patterns in this trend: (1) the embodied performance of ‘mixed’ heritage, (2) negotiating embodied ruptures in normative authenticity and belonging, (3) embodied heterosexual performativity and the idealization of the bourgeois family and (4) capitalizing on the performance of embodied individuality. We discuss how TikTok's neoliberal platform logic rewards performances of the ‘mixed girl’ that cater to a white, heterosexual, cisgender dominant gaze, uncritical of discriminatory structures such as racism, sexism or heteronormativity. This paper contributes to platform studies by critically examining how TikTok's neoliberal platform logic shapes and rewards identity performances under #mixedgirlcheck, revealing both its reinforcement of dominant discriminatory structures and its affordances for momentary ruptures in hegemonic discourses on ‘mixed’ girlhood.","",""

This conference paper presents the findings of an 18-month-long digital ethnographic study in which I analyzed ADHD TikTok videos and the technological infrastructures and assemblages surrounding the TikTok app, to interrogate how TikTok has become a voice of authority in the self-diagnosis of ADHD. This paper demonstrates how ADHD TikTok content creators create videos that cultivate sentiments of trust, intimacy, and relatability. These creators also adopt visual and discursive norms from other trending TikTok content, and from more traditional visual media content. In doing so, ADHD content creators generate authority by conforming and contributing to a set of coproduced content standards that ensure their videos are deemed viewable and relevant by viewers and the algorithm. Contrary to traditional understandings of authority, I find that medical authority on TikTok is not produced by individuals or institutions, but rather by content creators’ collective and collaborative performativity of everyday lived experiences, and their engagement with the supporting technologies of the TikTok app. To account for this shift in how authority is produced in our digital mediascape, I build on theories of social, cultural, and algorithmic authority, to offer a theoretical framework of ‘techno-cultural authority’. I ultimately argue that the techno-cultural authority of ADHD TikTok challenges customary understandings of authority figures and disrupts traditional medical expertise within the American healthcare industry.","",""

Users’ agency over their media diets is shaped differently in this new social media paradigm. Platforms such as TikTok, where algorithmic distribution of content is the standard, afford content curation in new avenues.  We build upon previous research on how the TikTok app’s interface design, as a technical artifact, aims to shape consumptive content curation practices at varying degrees of insistence. In this article, we seek to understand how and under what circumstances TikTok affords certain consumptive curation practices to users interested in political and social issues. In other words, how specific users interact with the app’s interface within their social context, focusing on how they adapt their consumptive curation practices to obtain political and social issues content.","",""

A HISTORIOGRAPHIC APPROACH TO ANALYZING PLATFORM TOOLS","The popular short-form video app TikTok is mainly discussed as a discrete app or in relation to its parent company ByteDance. This view neglects how TikTok and other ByteDance apps maintain and advance ByteDance’s highly complex app ecosystem. This paper, therefore, positions ByteDance-owned apps as both apps and “platform tools.” TikTok allows end-users to watch videos, allows creators to make and distribute content, advertisers to endorse products, and developers to build app features. As a platform tool, TikTok is a software-based resource that mediates “platformization,” extending TikTok’s economic, infrastructural, and governmental data-centric logic within and beyond ByteDance’s app ecosystem. Increasingly, ByteDance’s platform tools rely heavily on AI technology because of ByteDance’s early investments in AI technology and the growing interest such tools within the cultural industries. We survey ByteDance’s AI-powered platform tools alongside non-AI ones using systematic financial and infrastructural analysis, uncovering how ByteDance’s platform tools expand ByteDance as a “multi-sided,” “multi-layered,” and “multi-situated” platform. Platform tools, thus, facilitate growth along these three dimensions by encouraging platform dependence; interoperability and interdependence within ByteDance’s app ecosystem; and platformization, including “parallel platformization.” Our empirical work ultimately shows how ByteDance uses platform tools to accrue and operationalize infrastructural and economic power, and how apps have moved from discrete objects to interconnected clusters of platform tools.","",""

This research examines the implications of TikTok's emergence as a locus of sociality for the sober curious movement, both in terms of individual well-being and broader societal attitudes towards addiction and recovery. Central to this is an exploration of the creative and expressive practices employed by individuals within sober curious communities and the attitudes and experiences of those who follow them.  The paper draws on qualitative data from interviews with 28 sober curious TikTok users and a systematic content analysis of 800 TikTok videos.  Emergent findings reveal insights into the role of TikTok in destigmatizing addiction, fostering empathy and promoting positive representations of abstinence and resilience.  Three key themes with be explored: the value of digital storytelling, the nature of TikTok accountability, and the visibility of failures or relapses. These themes underscore TikTok's significance as a platform for personal expression, accountability, and community-building within the sober curious movement.  Combined, these themes speak to TikTok as an important platform for the sober curious. TikTok allows the messy, unpredictable, embodied and digital practices and experiences of sobriety to play out.

This departure takes us from a framework that emphasises performance in the Goffmanian sense to a model that emphasises the role of the algorithm in shaping our identity practices. Social media platforms, though, have been established as important spaces for the performance health and illness identities. With this in mind, this paper asks whether and how illness performances occur on Tiktok and further explores the extent to which we are departing from more traditional self-making practices.  To do this, we draw on findings from an ongoing Leverhulme Trust-funded project focused on social media uses relevant to hereditary cancer syndromes. These syndromes mark health conditions linked to known genetic mutations, also called “cancer genes”, that heighten the risk of having cancer from an early age. Carriers of these genetic mutations are often referred to as ‘previvors’: healthy individuals who are coping with the awareness of having a genetic predisposition to cancer. We used computational techniques to access posts about two hereditary cancer syndromes: BRCA 1/2 and Lynch Syndrome published on TikTok followed by a qualitative content analysis. From this, our initial findings show how strong elements of older identity frameworks remain present in content produced by previvors on TikTok with previvors identity performances remaining very much networked, interactive and connected to specific communities.","",""

Through a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics inherent in this communication process, we seek to gain insights into the evolving landscape of sexual advice and health in the digital age. Furthermore, our objective is to address a notable gap in this body of literature by incorporating how audiences engage with this content. We conducted a thematic analysis of TikTok videos and comment sections, combined with in-depth interviews with sexuality experts, to explore how experts build credibility amongst their audience, and how audiences engage with their content and evaluate expertise and credibility. Preliminary results suggest that creators employ various strategies when their expertise is questioned, including responding to comments, crafting replies to videos, and utilizing humor to connect with users. Audience members also play a vital role in validating creators' expertise. We also found that sexual health advice was not solely coming from creators, but also from those engaging in comments, fostering a culture of advice related to the video’s theme, challenging the conventional top-down hierarchy in sexual education where expertise is unilaterally shared. Ultimately, our study aligns with this year’s conference theme – examining the emergence and continuation of industries like sexual health education – highlighting the dynamics that arise within online spaces.","",""

It zeroes in on cryptocurrency scams as a case study to illuminate how disinformation is propagated for economic gain, using TikTok's API for comprehensive analysis. The research employs advanced data analytics to examine how digital platforms, via algorithmic filtering, shape the flow and influence of content, thereby enabling the proliferation of disinformation markets. By thematic clustering of problematic Facebook narratives and identifying scam-specific jargon, this study pinpoints tactics used on TikTok related to the 2024 Bitcoin halving. It scrutinizes how manipulators exploit technical and platform-specific vulnerabilities for profit, integrating Luhmann's double contingency theory to elucidate the feedback loops that enhance content virality and algorithmic dissemination. This theoretical framework illuminates the complex interplay between user interactions and algorithmic preferences, which, in turn, feed into the economics of disinformation markets. The research underscores the strategic manipulation of digital platforms to foster disinformation, spotlighting the role of algorithms and user engagement in the commodification of attention within these markets. Through this lens, the study aims to provide insights into the operational dynamics of disinformation markets, offering a nuanced understanding of how digital misinformation is not merely a byproduct of technological advancement but a structured market leveraging the inherent vulnerabilities of digital platforms and their users.","",""

While they have made some changes to their policies and design, their foundational approach to content moderation has remained largely the same. Platforms continue to focus on identifying, assessing and responding to individual pieces of violating content, like overt hate speech, direct threats, and doxxing. This approach is ill-equipped to deal with structural harms like misogyny, which cannot be understood in terms of isolated instances, but instead as part of a continuum. ‘Everyday’ experiences of sexism and misogyny form part of the same dynamic as the more widely recognised, extreme forms of violence, but existing tools for identifying this type of harmful but not prohibited content are extremely limited.  This paper presents the preliminary findings of a study that investigates how everyday misogyny manifests on social media platforms, using the online discourse around the $2 trial as a case study. We use a combination of topic modelling and in-depth qualitative analysis of content, informed by the literature on believability and doubt in cases of domestic and sexual violence. We find that everyday misogyny is widespread, and manifests partly in double-standards and double-binds in the expectations imposed on Amber Heard. We aim to use these findings to develop new methods and frameworks for understanding misogyny in aggregate.","",""
"2025","Algorithmic cosmopolitanism, and platform nationalism: From the paradox of the TikTok ban","TikTok's short video culture confirms the idea of algorithmic cosmopolitanism (Elkins, 2019). It involves the algorithmic promotion of local identities and place-making practices as a symbolic representation of multi-culturalism, which nonetheless is also constrained by its “flattened, one-dimensional, and consumerist approach” (Elkins, 2019: 385). At the same time, the impending TikTok ban in the US seems to suggest the rise of platform nationalism as an emerging approach to platform governance (Craig et al., 2021). This paradox between algorithmic cosmopolitanism and platform nationalism demonstrates the political nature of today's digitalization and its promised transformation of society. It raises a renewed question about how technological practices and imaginations are prone to state and economic power. In the complex entanglement between the technical and the political, we must first of all be wary of any simplistic discourses of politicization and governance.","",""

Drawing upon Tan’s notion of “biographical illumination” (BI), which describes how medical frameworks can enrich personal biographies, we explored the shifting nature of BI through the case of TikTok. Combining quantitative and qualitative methods, we argue that TikTok serves as a space to discuss diagnosis and refine one’s sense of self as a result of diagnosis. However, such personal transformation is inseparable from the app’s affordances, or what we term “algorithmically mediated biographical illumination.” BI shapes TikTok as a platform, and TikTok informs BI as a psychosocial process, leading to what we call “platformed diagnosis.” These findings have broader critical applications for the study of algorithms, disability, and digital platforms.

This article seeks to challenge this discourse, building on the participatory approach to children’s media scholarship to argue instead that ‘brain rot’ constitutes a complex, and historically situated,             genre of participation             . Drawing on empirical data from seven TikTok workshops with 16- and 17-year-olds in Oslo, ‘brain rot’ is conceptualised as a collection of related practices that (1) are childish or unserious, (2) provide no cognitive or developmental benefit, and (3) are deliberately non-productive. In this way, it can be understood as a             decompression-driven             genre of participation whereby young people actively resist the pressures of productivity and self-optimisation.

"2025","Affordances turning intersectional: How hierarchical femininities differently experience TikTok’s features","             In recent years, gender scholars have begun to examine the various costs and benefits of hierarchically arranged femininities. These cultural ideals are particularly appealing in the context of growing digitally mediated interactions, as the symbolic and relational boundaries between these femininities are becoming more fluid. Drawing on 32 in-depth interviews with Romanian content creators on TikTok, I highlight the intersectional, symbolic, and discursive character through which different types of femininity define online success and popularity. Women who approximate the hegemonic locations of femininity were found to practice             privileged experiencing             of TikTok’s affordances. These users already endorse affluence, heteronormativity, and knowledge premiums, which gives them an advantage in becoming popular on TikTok. However, women in disadvantaged intersectional locations tend to practice a             resistant assimilation             of TikTok’s affordances, as they tend to borrow but also criticize certain strategies from privileged users. Implications for digital communication and intersectionality are discussed.           ","",""
"2025","“Actually an ED and not just a quirky aspect of autism”: TikTok as a forum and mediator of autistic food issues and eating disorders","Restrictive eating disorders (EDs) have among the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder. To date, little research has investigated the role of digital media in sharing ED experiences and promoting recovery for autistic individuals, despite high autism rates among those with EDs and the potential for social media (SM) to provide resources and support for adolescent girls and young women living with EDs. Given this gap, we undertook an exploratory study to assess content pertaining to autistic people’s difficulties with food and eating on the leading SM app TikTok. We identified four main themes: (a) EDs and autism; (b) cognitive, sensory, and behavioral dimensions of autistic eating and body issues; (c) social, cultural, and economic aspects of autistic people’s food challenges; and (d) self-reported role of TikTok in autistic individuals’ coping with food/eating difficulties. Our study contributes several novel findings to research on digital media, mental health, and marginalized populations.","",""
"2025","Toxic Communication on TikTok: Sigma Masculinities and Gendered Disinformation"," A growing body of research highlights digital platforms like TikTok’s pivotal role in shaping meaning for their users, particularly regarding gender perceptions. With TikTok increasingly serving as a search engine for teens, understanding how opinions are formed necessitates examining online content and interactions. Our article focuses on the construction of masculinity and gender dynamics with sigma videos on TikTok, emphasizing the digital practices that foster toxic communication. We define toxic communication as the deliberate framing and intensification of gender relations through the lens of male control and domination, alongside the denigration, devaluation, or defamation of feminine and non-binary identities associated with hegemonic masculinity. Adopting a socio-technical approach, we utilize a digital qualitative method of immersive observation to collect and analyze videos, posts, hashtags, and gender-related content. Our findings reveal that sigma toxic communication manifests in a spectrum ranging from subtle humor to explicit violence. This diversity of content functions as a “ready-to-think” framework, potentially appealing to a wide range of men across varying tastes, ages, and attitudes toward gender while perpetuating narratives that reflect and reinforce entrenched patterns of male dominance.

"2025","Clapping Back on TikTok: Black-Asian Multiraciality and Humor","TikTok has become an important digital space for solidarity among underrepresented groups. However, it is also a space where stereotypes and offensive jokes are proliferated through unique affordances such as “Use This Sound.” For this study, I focused on Black-Asian multiracials known as “Blasians” and how they used TikTok. I analyzed 56 videos, 47 by Blasian creators and nine by non-Blasian creators, using content analysis and Berger’s typology of 45 humor techniques to uncover common themes and strategies employed by Blasians and non-Blasians on TikTok. Three major findings emerged from the data: First, unlike most social media platforms, the majority of my sample was created by Blasians themselves, with more than half of these videos directly or indirectly referencing racist experiences the creator had encountered using techniques like facetiousness, stereotypes, and wordplay suggesting that a Blasian-specific culture is emerging on TikTok, mirroring elements of Black Twitter. Second, Blasians often relied on monoracial Black and monoracial Asian stereotypes in their videos, demonstrating the multiple dimensions of how they are targeted. Third, non-Blasians relied on Blasian-specific stereotypes, highlighting novel ways in which other minoritized racial groups are racializing Blasians. Taken together, my study sheds light on the racialization process of a growing racial group, the emergence of a digital Black-Asian multiracial culture, and how TikTok united a diverse and broad ethnoracial group.","",""
"2025","From #MelaninMansion to #BlackTikTokStrike: Black TikTok, Joy, and the Politics of Refusal","In this article, we critically analyze TikTok videos related to the #MelaninMansion trend and the #BlackTikTokStrike. Videos analyzed were posted during the hashtags’ peak engagement, 2019–2020, and the summer of 2021, respectively. Drawing from Black cyberfeminism and literatures on Black cyberculture, platform politics, visibility, affect, resistance, refusal, and copyright, we identified shared themes and thematic differences between the hashtags. Based on these findings, we argue #MelaninMansion and #BlackTikTokStrike illustrate two significant moments on TikTok for Black creators, and a marked change in their tactical and affective response to on-platform racism, appropriation, and content theft. We contend the messaging and imaginings found in the videos reveal Black TikTok’s negative experiences on-platform and their understanding of potential technological and policy solutions. We especially note the affective change during the strike, where Black TikTok creators turn from humorous utopian imaginings of on-platform equity and celebrations of Blackness and community, to frustrated refusal of on-platform labor and pessimistic reflections on the (im)possibilities for Black content creation. Despite the sharp turn in tactics and expectations, content from both moments reflects a commitment to Black joy and intracommunity support. We argue our findings reveal how the TikTok platform and non-Black TikTok community together create a toxic technoculture rife with the violence of racism, cultural appropriation, and creative theft. Finally, we note the centrality of Black women to these viral moments, how #BlackTikTokStrike especially centered Black women’s labor and creativity, and that despite this, Black women performed an outsized amount of labor during the strike.","",""
"2025","Deinfluencing TikTok During the Cost-of-Living Crisis: Neoliberal Logics of (Over) Consumption Across Popular Media","Following the economic recession of 2008, media texts blamed individual consumers and their reckless and wasteful consumption of designer goods and extravagant homes for contributing to the financial crisis. Within the current context of the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the cost-of-living crisis has led to increases in the cost of everyday necessities. At the same time, social media influencers promote excessive consumption of expensive viral products that are often discarded upon purchase. Responding to these socio-cultural events, deinfluencing became a viral trend on TikTok, where users post videos encouraging viewers to purchase certain products rather than other more expensive options. Positioning deinfluencing as an example of cultural responses to financial crises, this article highlights the parallels between deinfluencing and previous discursive articulations that emerged during the 2008 global financial crisis. Deinfluencing reproduces longstanding cultural formations of consumer citizenship while also reacting to the overconsumption promoted by the digital economy.","",""
"2025","From Feed to Flow: Watching Television on TikTok","This paper investigates how users engage with content on TikTok that was originally produced for television. Based on interviews with participants in Costa Rica, we argue that watching television content on TikTok provides valuable insights into the future trajectories of both television and new media. To this end, we first demonstrate that TikTok’s television flow (in Raymond Williams’ sense) is “co-programed” through user interaction with algorithms, rather than being universally predetermined. We then posit the notion of “uncommitted attention” to argue that watching television on TikTok involves active engagement with content and texto-material conditions that make this experience fleeting and unstable. Finally, we examine how users establish cross-platform flows between TikTok and their broader media environments. In this way, we offer insights into how ontologically ambivalent platforms such as TikTok reconfigure traditional television watching.","",""
